With watermarking, we can always accurately detect LLM-generated texts. However, recent findings suggest that these techniques often negatively affect the quality of the generated texts, and adversarial attacks can strip the watermarking signals, causing the texts to possibly evade detection. These findings have created resistance in the wide adoption of watermarking by LLM creators. Finally, to encourage adoption, we evaluate the robustness of several watermarking techniques to adversarial attacks by comparing paraphrasing and back translation (i.e., English $\\to$ another language $\\to$ English) attacks; and their ability to preserve quality and writing style of the unwatermarked texts by using linguistic metrics to capture quality and writing style of texts. Our results suggest that these watermarking techniques preserve semantics, deviate from the writing style of the unwatermarked texts, and are susceptible to adversarial attacks, especially for the back translation attack.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u6297\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u91ca\u4e49\u548c\u56de\u8bd1\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u6c34\u5370\u6587\u672c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u3001\u5199\u4f5c\u98ce\u683c\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5371\u5bb3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672f\u5d4c\u5165\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u5b58\u5728\u6587\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u6613\u53d7\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u91ca\u4e49\u548c\u56de\u8bd1\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u6807\u5206\u6790\u6c34\u5370\u6587\u672c\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5199\u4f5c\u98ce\u683c\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u4f46\u504f\u79bb\u4e86\u65e0\u6c34\u5370\u6587\u672c\u7684\u5199\u4f5c\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u4e14\u6613\u53d7\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u56de\u8bd1\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6587\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u62b5\u6297\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u91c7\u7528\u3002", "relevance": 65.0}}

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) embed the governing equations into the learning process, enabling mesh-free solution of PDEs, yet they often struggle to capture steep gradients, discontinuities, and complex nonlinear wave interactions. To address these limitations, this study employs the Extended Physics-Informed Neural Network (XPINN) framework to solve the nonlinear Buckley-Leverett equation with a nonconvex flux function, which models immiscible two-phase flow in porous media. The computational domain is dynamically decomposed in space and time into evolving pre-shock and post-shock regions, allowing localized subnetworks to efficiently learn distinct flow behaviors. Coupling between subnetworks is achieved through the Rankine-Hugoniot jump condition, which enforces physically consistent flux continuity across the moving shock interface. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed XPINN approach accurately captures discontinuous saturation fronts and compound wave interactions without requiring artificial diffusion or entropy corrections. Compared to standard PINNs, the XPINN framework achieves superior stability, faster convergence, and enhanced resolution of nonlinear wave dynamics using smaller, domain-specific models with fewer trainable parameters, establishing it as an effective and scalable tool for solving challenging hyperbolic PDEs in multiphase flow problems.

Due to the lack of standardized, large-scale, and thoroughly verified datasets to facilitate learning of meaningful intermediate representations, such as bird's-eye-view (BEV) features, closed-loop E2E models remain far behind even simple rule-based baselines.

However, spatial reasoning:a fundamental component of human cognition that includes mental rotation, navigation, and spatial relationship comprehension remains a significant challenge for current advanced VLMs. We hypothesize that imagination, the internal simulation of spatial states, is the dominant reasoning mechanism within a spatial world model. To test this hypothesis and systematically probe current VLM spatial reasoning mechanisms, we introduce SpatiaLite, a fully synthetic benchmark that jointly measures spatial reasoning accuracy and reasoning efficiency. Comprehensive experiments reveal three key findings. First, advanced VLMs predominantly rely on linguistic representations for reasoning and imagination, resulting in significant deficiencies on visual centric tasks that demand perceptual spatial relations and 3D geometry transformations such as mental rotation or projection prediction. Second, advanced VLMs exhibit severe inefficiency in their current spatial reasoning mechanisms, with token usage growing rapidly as transformation complexity increases. Third, we propose an Imagery Driven Framework (IDF) for data synthesis and training, which can implicitly construct an internal world model that is critical for spatial reasoning in VLMs. Building on SpatiaLite, this work delineates the spatial reasoning limits and patterns of advanced VLMs, identifies key shortcomings, and informs future advances", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SpatiaLite\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u5148\u8fdbVLMs\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u793a\u800c\u975e\u89c6\u89c9\u7a7a\u95f4\u60f3\u8c61\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Imagery Driven Framework\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\uff08\u5982\u5fc3\u7406\u65cb\u8f6c\u3001\u5bfc\u822a\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u7406\u89e3\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u6311\u6218\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5047\u8bbe\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u60f3\u8c61\u673a\u5236\u662f\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002", "method": "1. \u5f15\u5165SpatiaLite\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6d4b\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\n2. \u5bf9\u5148\u8fdbVLMs\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\n3. \u63d0\u51faImagery Driven Framework\uff08IDF\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3", "result": "1. \u5148\u8fdbVLMs\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u9700\u8981\u611f\u77e5\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u548c3D\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\n2.

State-of-the-art (SOTA) TRL methods transform raw GPS trajectories to grid or road trajectories to capture high-level travel semantics, i.e., regions and roads. However, they lose fine-grained spatial-temporal details as multiple GPS points are grouped into a single grid cell or road segment. To tackle this problem, we propose the BLUrred Encoding method, dubbed BLUE, which gradually reduces the precision of GPS coordinates to create hierarchical patches with multiple levels. The low-level patches are small and preserve fine-grained spatial-temporal details, while the high-level patches are large and capture overall travel patterns. To complement different patch levels with each other, our BLUE is an encoder-decoder model with a pyramid structure. At each patch level, a Transformer is used to learn the trajectory embedding at the current level, while pooling prepares inputs for the higher level in the encoder, and up-resolution provides guidance for the lower level in the decoder. BLUE is trained using the trajectory reconstruction task with the MSE loss. We compare BLUE with 8 SOTA TRL methods for 3 downstream tasks, the results show that BLUE consistently achieves higher accuracy than all baselines, outperforming the best-performing baselines by an average of 30.90%.

However, when unknown samples are semantically similar to known classes, inter-class overlap in the feature space often causes models to assign unjustifiably high confidence to them, leading to misclassification as known classes -- a phenomenon known as overconfidence. This overconfidence undermines OSR by blurring the decision boundary between known and unknown classes. To address this issue, we propose a framework that explicitly mitigates overconfidence caused by inter-class overlap. The framework consists of two components: a perturbation-based uncertainty estimation module, which applies controllable parameter perturbations to generate diverse predictions and quantify predictive uncertainty, and an unknown detection module with distinct learning-based classifiers, implemented as a two-stage procedure, which leverages the estimated uncertainty to improve discrimination between known and unknown classes, thereby enhancing OSR performance.

A key factor influencing MFC performance is the anode structure, where design and material properties play a crucial role. Existing predictive models struggle to capture the complex geometric dependencies necessary to optimize these structures. To solve this problem, we propose KANGURA: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-Based Geometry-Aware Learning with Unified Representation Attention. KANGURA introduces a new approach to three-dimensional (3D) machine learning modeling. It formulates prediction as a function decomposition problem, where Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN)- based representation learning reconstructs geometric relationships without a conventional multi- layer perceptron (MLP). To refine spatial understanding, geometry-disentangled representation learning separates structural variations into interpretable components, while unified attention mechanisms dynamically enhance critical geometric regions. Experimental results demonstrate that KANGURA outperforms over 15 state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the ModelNet40 benchmark dataset, achieving 92.7% accuracy, and excels in a real-world MFC anode structure problem with 97% accuracy.

Large language models (LLMs) offer new potential for analyzing these reports, but often generate unreliable or hallucinated outputs when domain grounding is absent. This study introduces the Mixture-of-Retrieval Agentic RAG (MoRA-RAG), a knowledge-grounded LLM framework that transforms reconnaissance reports into a structured foundation for multi-hazard reasoning. The framework integrates a Mixture-of-Retrieval mechanism that dynamically routes queries across hazard-specific databases while using agentic chunking to preserve contextual coherence during retrieval. It also includes a verification loop that assesses evidence sufficiency, refines queries, and initiates targeted searches when information remains incomplete. We construct HazardRecQA by deriving question-answer pairs from GEER reconnaissance reports, which document 90 global events across seven major hazard types. MoRA-RAG achieves up to 94.5 percent accuracy, outperforming zero-shot LLMs by 30 percent and state-of-the-art RAG systems by 10 percent, while reducing hallucinations across diverse LLM architectures. MoRA-RAG also enables open-weight LLMs to achieve performance comparable to proprietary models.

In this paper, we propose DeepDefense, a novel defense framework that applies Gradient-Feature Alignment (GFA) regularization across multiple layers to suppress adversarial vulnerability. By aligning input gradients with internal feature representations, DeepDefense promotes a smoother loss landscape in tangential directions, thereby reducing the model's sensitivity to adversarial noise.\n  We provide theoretical insights into how adversarial perturbation can be decomposed into radial and tangential components and demonstrate that alignment suppresses loss variation in tangential directions, where most attacks are effective. Empirically, our method achieves significant improvements in robustness across both gradient-based and optimization-based attacks. For example, on CIFAR-10, CNN models trained with DeepDefense outperform standard adversarial training by up to 15.2% under APGD attacks and 24.7% under FGSM attacks. Against optimization-based attacks such as DeepFool and EADEN, DeepDefense requires 20 to 30 times higher perturbation magnitudes to cause misclassification, indicating stronger decision boundaries and a flatter loss landscape.

This task presents key challenges, including maintaining temporal consistency across frames affected by occlusion and appearance variations, and achieving novel object generalization without relying on complex region proposals, which are often computationally expensive and require task-specific training. Our novel object-aware temporal modeling approach addresses these challenges by incorporating a filtering mechanism that selectively propagates high-confidence object features across frames. This enables efficient feature progression, reduces noise accumulation, and enhances detection accuracy in a few-shot setting. By utilizing few-shot trained detection and classification heads with focused feature propagation, we achieve robust temporal consistency without depending on explicit object tube proposals. Our approach achieves performance gains, with AP improvements of 3.7% (FSVOD-500), 5.3% (FSYTV-40), 4.3% (VidOR), and 4.5 (VidVRD) in the 5-shot setting.

Hypothesis 2: baseline expression of OGT and CDO1 predicts the strength of repressed and induced radiation-response modules in breast cancer cells (GSE59732). Hypothesis 3: a 12-gene expression signature predicts biochemical recurrence-free survival after prostate radiotherapy plus androgen deprivation therapy (GSE116918). The DDR-p53 hypothesis was not supported: DDR score and p53 response were weakly negatively correlated (Spearman rho = -0.40, p = 0.76), indistinguishable from random five-gene scores. OGT showed only a weak association (r = 0.23, p = 0.34), whereas CDO1 was a clear outlier (r = 0.70, empirical p = 0.0039). The 12-gene signature achieved a concordance index of 0.61 (p = 0.017) but a non-unique effect size.

In this paper, we propose HiEAG, a novel Hierarchical Evidence-Augmented Generation framework to refine external consistency checking through leveraging the extensive knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our approach decomposes external consistency checking into a comprehensive engine pipeline, which integrates reranking and rewriting, apart from retrieval. Evidence reranking module utilizes Automatic Evidence Selection Prompting (AESP) that acquires the relevant evidence item from the products of evidence retrieval. Subsequently, evidence rewriting module leverages Automatic Evidence Generation Prompting (AEGP) to improve task adaptation on MLLM-based OOC misinformation detectors. Furthermore, our approach enables explanation for judgment, and achieves impressive performance with instruction tuning.

While generative methods provide a unified modeling perspective, they often suffer from slow inference due to the complex sampling trajectories from noise to image. To address this, we formulate image fusion as a direct probabilistic transport from source modalities to the fused image distribution, leveraging the flow matching paradigm to improve sampling efficiency and structural consistency. To mitigate the lack of high-quality fused images for supervision, we collect fusion results from multiple state-of-the-art models as priors, and employ a task-aware selection function to select the most reliable pseudo-labels for each task. We further introduce a Fusion Refiner module that employs a divide-and-conquer strategy to systematically identify, decompose, and enhance degraded components in selected pseudo-labels. For multi-task scenarios, we integrate elastic weight consolidation and experience replay mechanisms to preserve cross-task performance and enhance continual learning ability from both parameter stability and memory retention perspectives. Our approach achieves competitive performance across diverse fusion tasks, while significantly improving sampling efficiency and maintaining a lightweight model design.

They assumed that the SCMs were learned from purely observational data, leading to an imprecise characterization of the marginal distributions of exogenous variables. Their method leveraged the canonical representation of structural equations to decompose a general SCM with high-cardinality exogenous variables into a set of sub-models with low-cardinality exogenous variables. These sub-models had precise marginals over the exogenous variables and therefore admitted efficient exact inference. The aggregated results were used to bound counterfactual probabilities in the original model. The approach was developed for Markovian models, where each exogenous variable affects only a single endogenous variable. In this paper, we investigate extending the methodology to \\textit{semi-Markovian} SCMs, where exogenous variables may influence multiple endogenous variables. Such models are capable of representing confounding relationships that Markovian models cannot. We illustrate the challenges of this extension using a minimal example, which motivates a set of alternative solution strategies. These strategies are evaluated both theoretically and through a computational study.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6269\u5c55\u4e86Bj\u00f8ru\u7b49\u4eba\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u534a\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5916\u751f\u53d8\u91cf\u5f71\u54cd\u591a\u4e2a\u5185\u751f\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u534a\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6df7\u6dc6\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u793a\u4f8b\u8bf4\u660e\u6269\u5c55\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u79cd\u66ff\u4ee3\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u65b9\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u534a\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592bSCMs\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8868\u793a\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u7684\u6df7\u6dc6\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u6743\u8861\u4e0d\u540c\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "relevance": 35.0}}

Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are commonly used in BCIs to reflect cognitive patterns related to motor function activities. However, due to the multichannel nature of EEG signals, explicit information processing is crucial to lessen computational complexity in BCI systems. This study proposes an innovative method based on brain region-specific channel selection and multi-domain feature fusion to improve classification accuracy. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in region-based channel selection, where EEG channels are grouped according to their functional relevance to distinct brain regions. By selecting channels based on specific regions involved in motor imagery (MI) tasks, this technique eliminates irrelevant channels, reducing data dimensionality and improving computational efficiency. This also ensures that the extracted features are more reflective of the brain actual activity related to motor tasks. Three distinct feature extraction methods Common Spatial Pattern (CSP), Fuzzy C-means clustering, and Tangent Space Mapping (TSM), are applied to each group of channels based on their brain region. Each method targets different characteristics of the EEG signal: CSP focuses on spatial patterns, Fuzzy C means identifies clusters within the data, and TSM captures non-linear patterns in the signal. The combined feature vector is used to classify motor imagery tasks (left hand, right hand, and right foot) using Support Vector Machine (SVM).

To address the limitations associated with trajectory acquisition and vehicle tracking, road segment maps recording the individual-level traffic dynamic data were directly served in crash detection. A novel two-stage trajectory-free crash detection framework, was present to generate the rational future road segment map and identify crashes. The first-stage diffusion-based segment map generation model, Mapfusion, conducts a noisy-to-normal process that progressively adds noise to the road segment map until the map is corrupted to pure Gaussian noise. The denoising process is guided by sequential embedding components capturing the temporal dynamics of segment map sequences. Furthermore, the generation model is designed to incorporate background context through ControlNet to enhance generation control. Crash detection is achieved by comparing the monitored segment map with the generations from diffusion model in second stage. Trained on non-crash vehicle motion data, Mapfusion successfully generates realistic road segment evolution maps based on learned motion patterns and remains robust across different sampling intervals. Experiments on real-world crashes indicate the effectiveness of the proposed two-stage method in accurately detecting crashes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65e0\u8f68\u8ff9\u78b0\u649e\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5408\u7406\u7684\u672a\u6765\u8def\u6bb5\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u76d1\u63a7\u5730\u56fe\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u5730\u56fe\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u78b0\u649e\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8f68\u8ff9\u83b7\u53d6\u548c\u8f66\u8f86\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e2a\u4f53\u7ea7\u4ea4\u901a\u52a8\u6001\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8def\u6bb5\u5730\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u78b0\u649e\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u5b9e\u65f6\u78b0\u649e\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u4ea4\u901a\u5b89\u5168\u7ba1\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u4ea4\u901a\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684Mapfusion\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8def\u6bb5\u5730\u56fe\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u566a\u58f0\u5230\u6b63\u5e38\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u9010\u6b65\u6dfb\u52a0\u566a\u58f0\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u76d1\u63a7\u8def\u6bb5\u5730\u56fe\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5730\u56fe\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u78b0\u649e\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u65f6\u5e8f\u5d4c\u5165\u7ec4\u4ef6\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u7f51\u7edc\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u975e\u78b0\u649e\u8f66\u8f86\u8fd0\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684Mapfusion\u80fd\u591f\u6210\u529f\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u8def\u6bb5\u6f14\u5316\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u91c7\u6837\u95f4\u9694\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u78b0\u649e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u68c0\u6d4b\u78b0\u649e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65e0\u8f68\u8ff9\u78b0\u649e\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u8f68\u8ff9\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4ea4\u901a\u4e8b\u6545\u3002", "relevance": 15.0}}

This paper systematically analyzes the vulnerabilities of LVLMs integrated in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) under carefully crafted jailbreaking attacks. First, we carefully construct a dataset with harmful queries relevant to transportation, following OpenAI's prohibited categories to which the LVLMs should not respond. Second, we introduce a novel jailbreaking attack that exploits the vulnerabilities of LVLMs through image typography manipulation and multi-turn prompting. Third, we propose a multi-layered response filtering defense technique to prevent the model from generating inappropriate responses. We perform extensive experiments with the proposed attack and defense on the state-of-the-art LVLMs (both open-source and closed-source). To evaluate the attack method and defense technique, we use GPT-4's judgment to determine the toxicity score of the generated responses, as well as manual verification.

Recent studies demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs can accurately predict vehicle trajectories and lane-change intentions by gathering and transforming data from surrounding vehicles. However, the robustness of such LLM-based prediction models for safety-critical driving systems remains unexplored, despite the increasing concerns about the trustworthiness of LLMs. This study addresses this gap by conducting a systematic vulnerability analysis of LLM-enabled vehicle trajectory prediction. We propose a one-feature differential evolution attack that perturbs a single kinematic feature of surrounding vehicles within the LLM's input prompts under a black-box setting. Experiments on the highD dataset reveal that even minor, physically plausible perturbations can significantly disrupt model outputs, underscoring the susceptibility of LLM-based predictors to adversarial manipulation. Further analyses reveal a trade-off between accuracy and robustness, examine the failure mechanism, and explore potential mitigation solutions. The findings provide the very first insights into adversarial vulnerabilities of LLM-driven automated vehicle models in the context of vehicular interactions and highlight the need for robustness-oriented design in future LLM-based intelligent transportation systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5373\u4f7f\u5fae\u5c0f\u4e14\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u5408\u7406\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u4e5f\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u7834\u574f\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LLM\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLM\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u65b9\u9762\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46LLM\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u65e5\u76ca\u53d7\u5230\u5173\u6ce8\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8f66\u8f86\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5355\u7279\u5f81\u5dee\u5206\u8fdb\u5316\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u9ed1\u76d2\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u6270\u52a8\u5468\u56f4\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u5355\u4e2a\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728highD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5fae\u5c0f\u4e14\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u5408\u7406\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u4e5f\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u7834\u574f\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LLM\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u64cd\u7eb5\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8f66\u8f86\u4ea4\u4e92\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u9762\u5411\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

However, seismic data presents unique characteristics that require specialized processing techniques for pretraining foundation models in seismic contexts with high- and low-frequency features playing crucial roles. Existing vision transformers (ViTs) with sequential tokenization ignore the intrinsic pattern and fail to grasp both the high- and low-frequency seismic information efficiently and effectively. This work introduces a novel adaptive two-grid foundation model training strategy (ADATG) with Hilbert encoding specifically tailored for seismogram data, leveraging the hierarchical structures inherent in seismic data. Specifically, our approach employs spectrum decomposition to separate high- and low-frequency components and utilizes hierarchical Hilbert encoding to represent the data effectively. Moreover, observing the frequency principle observed in ViTs, we propose an adaptive training strategy that initially emphasizes coarse-level information and then progressively refines the model's focus on fine-level features. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our training methods.

Pattern-matching systems can encounter issues where exponential time and space are required to find matches for rules with many underconstrained variables, or which produce combinatorial intermediate partial matches (but are otherwise well-constrained). When online AI systems automatically generate rules from example-driven induction or code synthesis, they can easily produce worst-case matching patterns that slow or halt program execution by exceeding available memory. In our own work with cognitive systems that learn from example, we've found that aggressive forms of anti-unification-based generalization can easily produce these circumstances. To make these systems practical without hand-engineering constraints or succumbing to unpredictable failure modes, we introduce a new matching algorithm called CORGI (Collection-Oriented Relational Graph Iteration). Unlike RETE-based approaches, CORGI offers quadratic time and space guarantees for finding single satisficing matches, and the ability to iteratively stream subsequent matches without committing entire conflict sets to memory. CORGI differs from RETE in that it does not have a traditional $\u03b2$-memory for collecting partial matches. Instead, CORGI takes a two-step approach: a graph of grounded relations is built/maintained in a forward pass, and an iterator generates matches as needed by working backward through the graph. This approach eliminates the high-latency delays and memory overflows that can result from populating full conflict sets. In a performance evaluation, we demonstrate that CORGI significantly outperforms RETE implementations from SOAR and OPS5 on a simple combinatorial matching task.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCORGI\u7684\u65b0\u5339\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u89c4\u5219\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u67e5\u8be2\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5f53AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u89c4\u5219\u65f6\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6267\u884c\u7f13\u6162\u6216\u5185\u5b58\u6ea2\u51fa\u3002", "method": "CORGI\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u6b65\u6cd5\uff1a\u5728\u6b63\u5411\u4f20\u9012\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa/\u7ef4\u62a4\u63a5\u5730\u5173\u7cfb\u56fe\uff0c\u5728\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u9012\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u5668\u6309\u9700\u751f\u6210\u5339\u914d\u3002\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edfRETE\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0d\u540c\uff0cCORGI\u6ca1\u6709\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u03b2-\u5185\u5b58\u6765\u6536\u96c6\u90e8\u5206\u5339\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u7ec4\u5408\u5339\u914d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cCORGI\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eSOAR\u548cOPS5\u4e2d\u7684RETE\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002CORGI\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e8c\u6b21\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6765\u627e\u5230\u5355\u4e2a\u6ee1\u610f\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u8fed\u4ee3\u6d41\u5f0f\u4f20\u8f93\u540e\u7eed\u5339\u914d\u3002", "conclusion": "CORGI\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u9664\u586b\u5145\u5b8c\u6574\u51b2\u7a81\u96c6\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6ea2\u51fa\uff0c\u4f7fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u66f4\u52a0\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u624b\u52a8\u5de5\u7a0b\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "relevance": 65.0}}

Thousands of rare and zero-shot ICD codes are severely underrepresented in datasets like MIMIC-III, leading to low macro-F1 scores. In this work, we propose a data-centric framework that generates high-quality synthetic discharge summaries to mitigate this imbalance. Our method constructs realistic multi-label code sets anchored on rare codes by leveraging real-world co-occurrence patterns, ICD descriptions, synonyms, taxonomy, and similar clinical notes. Using these structured prompts, we generate 90,000 synthetic notes covering 7,902 ICD codes, significantly expanding the training distribution. We fine-tune two state-of-the-art transformer-based models, PLM-ICD and GKI-ICD, on both the original and extended datasets.

During joint multimodal training, due to modality bias, the advantaged modality often dominates backpropagation, leading to imbalanced optimization. Existing methods still face two problems: First, the long-term dominance of the dominant modality weakens representation-output coupling in the late stages of training, resulting in the accumulation of redundant information. Second, previous methods often directly and uniformly adjust the gradients of the advantaged modality, ignoring the semantics and directionality between modalities. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Redundancy Regulation for Balanced Multimodal Information Refinement (RedReg), which is inspired by information bottleneck principle. Specifically, we construct a redundancy phase monitor that uses a joint criterion of effective gain growth rate and redundancy to trigger intervention only when redundancy is high. Furthermore, we design a co-information gating mechanism to estimate the contribution of the current dominant modality based on cross-modal semantics. When the task primarily relies on a single modality, the suppression term is automatically disabled to preserve modality-specific information. Finally, we project the gradient of the dominant modality onto the orthogonal complement of the joint multimodal gradient subspace and suppress the gradient according to redundancy. Experiments show that our method demonstrates superiority among current major methods in most scenarios. Ablation experiments verify the effectiveness of our method.

This enables unscripted, in the wild video analysis at scale to capture natural facial behaviors, transferrable across devices, topics, and cultures without active intervention by clinicians or researchers during recording. Most existing resources prioritize speech or scripted interviews, limiting use outside clinics and coupling predictions to language and transcription. In contrast, we identify and analyze whether temporal facial kinematics, including blink dynamics, small mouth jaw motions, gaze variability, and subtle head adjustments, are sufficient for dementia screening without speech or text. By stabilizing facial signals, we convert these micro movements into interpretable facial microdynamic time series, smooth them, and summarize short windows into compact clip level statistics for screening. Each window is encoded by its activity mix (the relative share of motion across streams), thus the predictor analyzes the distribution of motion across streams rather than its magnitude, making per channel effects transparent.

Engelstad"], "title": "Multi-Horizon Time Series Forecasting of non-parametric CDFs with Deep Lattice Networks", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI"], "comment": null, "summary": "Probabilistic forecasting is not only a way to add more information to a prediction of the future, but it also builds on weaknesses in point prediction. Sudden changes in a time series can still be captured by a cumulative distribution function (CDF), while a point prediction is likely to miss it entirely. The modeling of CDFs within forecasts has historically been limited to parametric approaches, but due to recent advances, this no longer has to be the case. We aim to advance the fields of probabilistic forecasting and monotonic networks by connecting them and propose an approach that permits the forecasting of implicit, complete, and nonparametric CDFs. For this purpose, we propose an adaptation to deep lattice networks (DLN) for monotonically constrained simultaneous/implicit quantile regression in time series forecasting. Quantile regression usually produces quantile crossovers, which need to be prevented to achieve a legitimate CDF. By leveraging long short term memory units (LSTM) as the embedding layer, and spreading quantile inputs to all sub-lattices of a DLN with an extended output size, we can produce a multi-horizon forecast of an implicit CDF due to the monotonic constraintability of DLNs that prevent quantile crossovers. We compare and evaluate our approach's performance to relevant state of the art within the context of a highly relevant application of time series forecasting: Day-ahead, hourly forecasts of solar irradiance observations. Our experiments show that the adaptation of a DLN performs just as well or even better than an unconstrained approach. Further comparison of the adapted DLN against a scalable monotonic neural network shows that our approach performs better.

Recent video generation models have emerged as potential world simulators through Chain-of-Frames (CoF) reasoning -- materializing thought as frame-by-frame visual sequences, with each frame representing a physically-grounded reasoning step. Despite compelling demonstrations, a challenge persists: existing benchmarks, focusing on fidelity or alignment, do not assess CoF reasoning and thus cannot measure core cognitive abilities in multi-step planning, algorithmic logic, or abstract pattern extrapolation. This evaluation void prevents systematic understanding of model capabilities and principled guidance for improvement. We introduce Gen-ViRe (Generative Visual Reasoning Benchmark), a framework grounded in cognitive science and real-world AI applications, which decomposes CoF reasoning into six cognitive dimensions -- from perceptual logic to abstract planning -- and 24 subtasks. Through multi-source data curation, minimal prompting protocols, and hybrid VLM-assisted evaluation with detailed criteria, Gen-ViRe delivers the first quantitative assessment of video models as reasoners. Our experiments on SOTA systems reveal substantial discrepancies between impressive visual quality and actual reasoning depth, establishing baselines and diagnostic tools to advance genuine world simulators.", "AI": {"tldr": "Gen-ViRe\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u94fe\u5f0f\u5e27\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a6\u4e2a\u8ba4\u77e5\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c24\u4e2a\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u5668\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u94fe\u5f0f\u5e27\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u4e16\u754c\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6216\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6838\u5fc3\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u5982\u591a\u6b65\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u7b97\u6cd5\u903b\u8f91\u6216\u62bd\u8c61\u6a21\u5f0f\u5916\u63a8\uff0c\u8fd9\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u6574\u7406\u3001\u6700\u5c0f\u63d0\u793a\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be6\u7ec6\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u6df7\u5408VLM\u8f85\u52a9\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5c06\u94fe\u5f0f\u5e27\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u516d\u4e2a\u8ba4\u77e5\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08\u4ece\u611f\u77e5\u903b\u8f91\u5230\u62bd\u8c61\u89c4\u5212\uff09\u548c24\u4e2a\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5728SOTA\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u63a8\u8fdb\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "Gen-ViRe\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u5668\u7684\u9996\u6b21\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e3a\u53d1\u5c55\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "relevance": 75.0}}

KGs are structured representations of factual knowledge consisting of entities and relations. Due to the high construction cost, they had been regarded as static databases with validated links. However, the recent development of Transformer-based relation extraction (RE) methods has enabled us to generate KGs dynamically by giving them natural language texts, and thereby opened the possibility for representing the meaning of the input sentences with the created KGs. Using this effect, we propose a method that answers MCQs in the \"fill-in-the-blank\" format, taking care of the point that RE methods generate KGs that represent false information if provided with factually incorrect texts.

Despite recent advances in deep learning models for medical time-series forecasting, several challenges persist, including the lack of standardized benchmarks, incomplete data, and limited cross-center validation. To address these challenges, we introduce VitalBench, a novel benchmark specifically designed for intraoperative vital sign prediction. VitalBench includes data from over 4,000 surgeries across two independent medical centers, offering three evaluation tracks: complete data, incomplete data, and cross-center generalization. This framework reflects the real-world complexities of clinical practice, minimizing reliance on extensive preprocessing and incorporating masked loss techniques for robust and unbiased model evaluation. By providing a standardized and unified platform for model development and comparison, VitalBench enables researchers to focus on architectural innovation while ensuring consistency in data handling.

However, existing methods struggle with challenges of scalability and retrieval efficiency, particularly when handling complex, multi-hop questions that require multi-step reasoning. To address these challenges, this paper introduces ALEX (A Light Editing-knowledge Extractor), a lightweight knowledge editing framework. The core innovation of ALEX is its hierarchical memory architecture, which organizes knowledge updates (edits) into semantic clusters. This design fundamentally reduces retrieval complexity from a linear O(N) to a highly scalable O(K+N/C).

In this paper, we propose a selective W2SG framework to avoid using weak supervision when unnecessary.

However, these models often produce chemically invalid molecules, which limits the usable scope of the learned chemical space and poses significant challenges for practical applications. To address this issue, we propose ChemFixer, a framework designed to correct invalid molecules into valid ones. ChemFixer is built on a transformer architecture, pre-trained using masking techniques, and fine-tuned on a large-scale dataset of valid/invalid molecular pairs that we constructed. Through comprehensive evaluations across diverse generative models, ChemFixer improved molecular validity while effectively preserving the chemical and biological distributional properties of the original outputs. This indicates that ChemFixer can recover molecules that could not be previously generated, thereby expanding the diversity of potential drug candidates. Furthermore, ChemFixer was effectively applied to a drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction task using limited data, improving the validity of generated ligands and discovering promising ligand-protein pairs. These results suggest that ChemFixer is not only effective in data-limited scenarios, but also extensible to a wide range of downstream tasks. Taken together, ChemFixer shows promise as a practical tool for various stages of deep learning-based drug discovery, enhancing molecular validity and expanding accessible chemical space.", "AI": {"tldr": "ChemFixer\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5c06\u65e0\u6548\u5206\u5b50\u4fee\u6b63\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u5206\u5b50\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u836f\u7269\u9776\u70b9\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u5316\u5b66\u65e0\u6548\u5206\u5b50\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u63a9\u7801\u6280\u672f\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6709\u6548/\u65e0\u6548\u5206\u5b50\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "ChemFixer\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5206\u5b50\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u539f\u59cb\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u548c\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u836f\u7269\u9776\u70b9\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u914d\u4f53\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ChemFixer\u662f\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u5404\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6709\u7528\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u5206\u5b50\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "relevance": 30.0}}

Inspired by this, we propose the novel task of Collision Sound Source Segmentation (CS3), where we aim to segment the objects responsible for a collision sound in visual input (i.e. video frames from the collision clip), conditioned on the audio. This task presents unique challenges. Unlike isolated sound events, a collision sound arises from interactions between two objects, and the acoustic signature of the collision depends on both. We focus on egocentric video, where sounds are often clear, but the visual scene is cluttered, objects are small, and interactions are brief.\n  To address these challenges, we propose a weakly-supervised method for audio-conditioned segmentation, utilising foundation models (CLIP and SAM2).

While the role of AI in such situations is gaining attention for making optimal decisions within limited resources and time, its development and performance evaluation require benchmark datasets of sufficient quantity and quality. However, MCIs occur infrequently, and sufficient records are difficult to accumulate at the scene, making it challenging to collect large-scale realworld data for research use. Therefore, we developed Syn-STARTS, a framework that uses LLMs to generate triage cases, and verified its effectiveness. The results showed that the triage cases generated by Syn-STARTS were qualitatively indistinguishable from the TRIAGE open dataset generated by manual curation from training materials. Furthermore, when evaluating the LLM accuracy using hundreds of cases each from the green, yellow, red, and black categories defined by the standard triage method START, the results were found to be highly stable.

Yet, we lack a clear understanding of where these symbolic hallucinations originate, making it crucial to systematically handle such triggers and localize the emergence of hallucination inside the model. While prior work explored localization using statistical techniques like LSC and activation variance analysis, these methods treat all tokens equally and overlook the role symbolic linguistic knowledge plays in triggering hallucinations. So far, no approach has investigated how symbolic elements specifically drive hallucination failures across model layers, nor has symbolic linguistic knowledge been used as the foundation for a localization framework. We propose the first symbolic localization framework that leverages symbolic linguistic and semantic knowledge to meaningfully trace the development of hallucinations across all model layers. By focusing on how models process symbolic triggers, we analyze five models using HaluEval and TruthfulQA. Our symbolic knowledge approach reveals that attention variance for these linguistic elements explodes to critical instability in early layers (2-4), with negation triggering catastrophic variance levels, demonstrating that symbolic semantic processing breaks down from the very beginning. Through the lens of symbolic linguistic knowledge, despite larger model sizes, hallucination rates remain consistently high (78.3%-83.7% across Gemma variants), with steep attention drops for symbolic semantic triggers throughout deeper layers.

Un-labeled data on which the classifier and MA-VLMs agree are designated as the Agreed-Unknown set, while conflicting samples form the Disagreed-Unknown set. To enhance label reliability, MA-VLMs simulate dual perspectives, moderator and user, capturing both regulatory and subjective viewpoints. The classifier is optimized using a novel Positive-Negative-Unlabeled (PNU) loss, which jointly exploits labeled, Agreed-Unknown, and Disagreed-Unknown data while mitigating pseudo-label noise.

However, APR models typically operate as black boxes, directly regressing a 6-DoF pose from a query image, which can lead to memorizing training views rather than understanding 3D scene geometry. In this work, we propose a geometrically-grounded alternative. Inspired by novel view synthesis, which renders images from intermediate geometric representations, we reformulate APR as its inverse that regresses the underlying 3D representations directly from the image, and we name this paradigm Geometric Representation Regression (GRR). Our model explicitly predicts two disentangled geometric representations in the world coordinate system: (1) a ray bundle's directions to estimate camera rotation, and (2) a corresponding pointmap to estimate camera translation. The final 6-DoF camera pose is then recovered from these geometric components using a differentiable deterministic solver.

However, real-world deployments often involve mixed distribution shifts, where test samples are affected by diverse and potentially conflicting domain factors, posing significant challenges even for SOTA TTA methods. A key limitation in existing approaches is their reliance on a unified adaptation path, which fails to account for the fact that optimal gradient directions can vary significantly across different domains. Moreover, current benchmarks focus only on synthetic or homogeneous shifts, failing to capture the complexity of real-world heterogeneous mixed distribution shifts. To address this, we propose MoETTA, a novel entropy-based TTA framework that integrates the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. Rather than enforcing a single parameter update rule for all test samples, MoETTA introduces a set of structurally decoupled experts, enabling adaptation along diverse gradient directions. This design allows the model to better accommodate heterogeneous shifts through flexible and disentangled parameter updates. To simulate realistic deployment conditions, we introduce two new benchmarks: potpourri and potpourri+. While classical settings focus solely on synthetic corruptions, potpourri encompasses a broader range of domain shifts--including natural, artistic, and adversarial distortions--capturing more realistic deployment challenges. Additionally, potpourri+ further includes source-domain samples to evaluate robustness against catastrophic forgetting.

Multi-sequence contrast-enhanced MRI is commonly used for recurrence detection; however, interpreting these scans remains challenging, even for experienced radiologists, due to post-surgical alterations such as scarring, swelling, and tissue remodeling. AI-assisted diagnostic tools have shown promise in improving bladder cancer recurrence prediction, yet progress in this field is hindered by the lack of dedicated multi-sequence MRI datasets for recurrence assessment study. In this work, we first introduce a curated multi-sequence, multi-modal MRI dataset specifically designed for bladder cancer recurrence prediction, establishing a valuable benchmark for future research. We then propose H-CNN-ViT, a new Hierarchical Gated Attention Multi-Branch model that enables selective weighting of features from the global (ViT) and local (CNN) paths based on contextual demands, achieving a balanced and targeted feature fusion.

This study presents evidence supporting an instructor-governed feedback loop that converts concept-level assessment evidence into vetted micro-interventions. The adaptive learning algorithm contains three safeguards: adequacy as a hard guarantee of gap closure, attention as a budgeted constraint for time and redundancy, and diversity as protection against overfitting to a single resource. We formalize intervention assignment as a binary integer program with constraints for coverage, time, difficulty windows informed by ability estimates, prerequisites encoded by a concept matrix, and anti-redundancy enforced through diversity. Greedy selection serves low-richness and tight-latency regimes, gradient-based relaxation serves rich repositories, and a hybrid method transitions along a richness-latency frontier. In simulation and in an introductory physics deployment with one thousand two hundred four students, both solvers achieved full skill coverage for essentially all learners within bounded watch time. The gradient-based method reduced redundant coverage by approximately twelve percentage points relative to greedy and harmonized difficulty across slates, while greedy delivered comparable adequacy with lower computational cost in scarce settings. Slack variables localized missing content and supported targeted curation, sustaining sufficiency across subgroups. The result is a tractable and auditable controller that closes the diagnostic-pedagogical loop and delivers equitable, load-aware personalization at classroom scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6559\u5e08\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c06\u6982\u5ff5\u7ea7\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bc1\u636e\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7ecf\u8fc7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5fae\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u4fdd\u969c\u673a\u5236\uff08\u5145\u5206\u6027\u3001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u9884\u7b97\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8bca\u65ad\u7cbe\u786e\u4f46\u5e72\u9884\u8584\u5f31\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ca\u65f6\u4e14\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5e2e\u52a9\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5e72\u9884\u65f6\u673a\u4e0d\u5f53\u6216\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5e72\u9884\u5206\u914d\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u5e26\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u4e8c\u5143\u6574\u6570\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u96be\u5ea6\u7a97\u53e3\u3001\u5148\u51b3\u6761\u4ef6\u6982\u5ff5\u77e9\u9635\u548c\u53cd\u5197\u4f59\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u8d2a\u5fc3\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u677e\u5f1b\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e09\u79cd\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c1204\u540d\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u7269\u7406\u8bfe\u7a0b\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u90fd\u80fd\u5728\u6709\u9650\u89c2\u770b\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u4e3a\u51e0\u4e4e\u6240\u6709\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b8c\u6574\u6280\u80fd\u8986\u76d6\u3002\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u8d2a\u5fc3\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea612%\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u96be\u5ea6\u4e0a\u66f4\u5747\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u8ffd\u8e2a\u548c\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u95ed\u5408\u4e86\u8bca\u65ad-\u6559\u5b66\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u5728\u8bfe\u5802\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u516c\u5e73\u4e14\u8d1f\u8f7d\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6559\u5b66\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

Arabic has a complicated morphological and syntactic structure, posing a greater challenge than other languages. Even though modern neural models have improved greatly in recent years, the majority of previous attempts used individual models without taking into account the potential benefits of combining different systems. In this paper, we present one of the first multi-system approaches for correcting grammatical errors in Arabic, the Arab Enhanced Edit Selection System Complication (ArbESC+). Several models are used to collect correction proposals, which are represented as numerical features in the framework. A classifier determines and implements the appropriate corrections based on these features. In order to improve output quality, the framework uses support techniques to filter overlapping corrections and estimate decision reliability. A combination of AraT5, ByT5, mT5, AraBART, AraBART+Morph+GEC, and Text editing systems gave better results than a single model alone, with F0.5 at 82.63% on QALB-14 test data, 84.64% on QALB-15 L1 data, and 65.55% on QALB-15 L2 data. As one of the most significant contributions of this work, it's the first Arab attempt to integrate linguistic error correction.

In contrast, tokens, which play essential roles in many research fields, exhibit similar characteristics of growth, yet investigations into their incremental learning remain significantly scarce. This research gap primarily stems from the holistic nature of tokens in language, which imposes significant challenges on the design of incremental learning frameworks for them. To overcome this obstacle, in this work, we turn to a type of token, gene, for a large-scale biological dataset--single-cell transcriptomics--to formulate a pipeline for gene incremental learning and establish corresponding evaluations. We found that the forgetting problem also exists in gene incremental learning, thus we adapted existing class incremental learning methods to mitigate the forgetting of genes.

Recent adaptations using domain-specific encoders, such as PubMedBERT or ClinicalBERT, mitigate this issue by leveraging medical corpora, but remain constrained by their limited input length (typically 512 tokens) and relatively shallow semantic understanding. To address these limitations, we propose QwenCLIP, a vision-language framework that replaces CLIP's text encoder with a large language model (LLM)-based embedding module (e.g., Qwen3-Embedding) and introduces learnable prompts to enhance cross-modal alignment. By leveraging the extended context window and richer representations of LLMs, QwenCLIP captures comprehensive medical semantics from long-form clinical text, substantially improving medical image-text alignment and downstream performance on radiology benchmarks.

This problem is interesting because LLMs often hallucinate when direct evidence to answer a question is lacking, and these effects become more pronounced in a network of interacting LLMs. The hallucination spreads, causing previously accurate LLMs to hallucinate. We study interacting LLMs and their hallucination by combining novel ideas of mean-field dynamics (MFD) from network science and the randomized utility model from economics to construct a useful generative model. We model the LLM with a latent state that indicates if it is truthful or not with respect to the ground truth, and extend a tractable analytical model considering an MFD to model the diffusion of information in a directed network of LLMs. To specify the probabilities that govern the dynamics of the MFD, we propose a randomized utility model. For a network of LLMs, where each LLM has two possible latent states, we posit sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point and analyze the behavior of the fixed point in terms of the incentive (e.g., test-time compute) given to individual LLMs. We experimentally study and analyze the behavior of a network of $100$ open-source LLMs with respect to data heterogeneity, node capability, network structure, and sensitivity to framing on multiple semi-synthetic datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76LLM\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5e7b\u89c9\u4f20\u64ad\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5e73\u5747\u573a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u968f\u673a\u6548\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u8282\u70b9\u80fd\u529b\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u534f\u4f5c\u95ee\u7b54\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc1\u636e\u65f6\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u8fd9\u79cd\u5e7b\u89c9\u4f1a\u6269\u6563\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u539f\u672c\u51c6\u786e\u7684LLM\u4e5f\u5f00\u59cb\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u4e00\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7f51\u7edc\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u573a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u968f\u673a\u6548\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6784\u5efaLLM\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06LLM\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\uff08\u771f\u5b9e/\u5e7b\u89c9\uff09\u7684\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u5b9a\u5411\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u6269\u6563\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86LLM\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u56fa\u5b9a\u70b9\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u548c\u552f\u4e00\u6027\u7684\u5145\u5206\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7100\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90LLM\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3001\u8282\u70b9\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u4f20\u64ad\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6fc0\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u63a7\u5236\u5e7b\u89c9\u6269\u6563\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7efc\u5408\u8003\u8651\u8282\u70b9\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

We address this by constructing a large, music-related natural language corpus (40B tokens) that combines open source and in-house data, and by implementing a domain-first data pipeline: a lightweight classifier filters and weights in-domain text, followed by multi-stage cleaning, de-duplication, and privacy-preserving masking. We further integrate multi-source music text with associated metadata to form a broader, better-structured foundation of domain knowledge. On the training side, we introduce reference-model (RM)-based token-level soft scoring for quality control: a unified loss-ratio criterion is used both for data selection and for dynamic down-weighting during optimization, reducing noise gradients and amplifying task-aligned signals, thereby enabling more effective music-domain continued pretraining and alignment.

The Pseudo-Newton Boosting layer makes smart variations of feature weights, with more detailed anatomical features, which are mostly left out in a transfer learning setup. In addition, the Sparsity-Induced Layer removes redundancy for learned features, producing lean yet robust representations for pathology in the lumbar spine. This architecture is novel as it overcomes the constraints in the traditional transfer learning approach, especially in the high-dimensional context of medical images, and achieves a significant performance boost, reaching a precision of 0.9, recall of 0.861, F1 score of 0.88, loss of 0.18, and an accuracy of 88.1%, compared to the baseline model, EfficientNet.

Moreover, collaborative design across app pages demands extra time to align standards and ensure consistent styling. In this work, we propose APD-agents, a large language model (LLM) driven multi-agent framework for automated page design in mobile applications. Our framework contains OrchestratorAgent, SemanticParserAgent, PrimaryLayoutAgent, TemplateRetrievalAgent, and RecursiveComponentAgent. Upon receiving the user's description of the page, the OrchestratorAgent can dynamically can direct other agents to accomplish users' design task. To be specific, the SemanticParserAgent is responsible for converting users' descriptions of page content into structured data. The PrimaryLayoutAgent can generate an initial coarse-grained layout of this page. The TemplateRetrievalAgent can fetch semantically relevant few-shot examples and enhance the quality of layout generation. Besides, a RecursiveComponentAgent can be used to decide how to recursively generate all the fine-grained sub-elements it contains for each element in the layout.

Existing approaches simulate a simplified workflow where actors dub directly without preparation, overlooking the critical director-actor interaction. In contrast, authentic workflows involve a dynamic collaboration: directors actively engage with actors, guiding them to internalize the context cues, specifically emotion, before performance. To address this issue, we propose a new Retrieve-Augmented Director-Actor Interaction Learning scheme to achieve authentic movie dubbing, termed Authentic-Dubber, which contains three novel mechanisms: (1) We construct a multimodal Reference Footage library to simulate the learning footage provided by directors. Note that we integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve deep comprehension of emotional representations across multimodal signals. (2) To emulate how actors efficiently and comprehensively internalize director-provided footage during dubbing, we propose an Emotion-Similarity-based Retrieval-Augmentation strategy. This strategy retrieves the most relevant multimodal information that aligns with the target silent video. (3) We develop a Progressive Graph-based speech generation approach that incrementally incorporates the retrieved multimodal emotional knowledge, thereby simulating the actor's final dubbing process. The above mechanisms enable the Authentic-Dubber to faithfully replicate the authentic dubbing workflow, achieving comprehensive improvements in emotional expressiveness. Both subjective and objective evaluations on the V2C Animation benchmark dataset validate the effectiveness.

We propose PROF, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate and improve executable reward function codes from natural language descriptions and a single expert trajectory. We propose Reward Preference Ranking (RPR), a novel reward function quality assessment and ranking strategy without requiring environment interactions or RL training.

In this work, we evaluate state-of-the-art open-source VLMs on high-level decision-making tasks using ego-view visual inputs and identify critical limitations in their ability to deliver reliable, context-aware decisions.

Despite this momentum, there exists no publicly available application-specific model evaluation that caters to Africa's linguistic diversity. We present AfriSpeech-MultiBench, the first domain-specific evaluation suite for over 100 African English accents across 10+ countries and seven application domains: Finance, Legal, Medical, General dialogue, Call Center, Named Entities and Hallucination Robustness. We benchmark a diverse range of open, closed, unimodal ASR and multimodal LLM-based speech recognition systems using both spontaneous and non-spontaneous speech conversation drawn from various open African accented English speech datasets. Our empirical analysis reveals systematic variation: open-source ASR models excels in spontaneous speech contexts but degrades on noisy, non-native dialogue; multimodal LLMs are more accent-robust yet struggle with domain-specific named entities; proprietary models deliver high accuracy on clean speech but vary significantly by country and domain. Models fine-tuned on African English achieve competitive accuracy with lower latency, a practical advantage for deployment, hallucinations still remain a big problem for most SOTA models.

We analyze scaling laws for anatomical segmentation across 15 semantic tasks and 4 imaging modalities, demonstrating that larger datasets significantly improve segmentation performance, following similar scaling trends. Motivated by the topological isomorphism in images sharing anatomical structures, we evaluate the impact of deformation-guided augmentation strategies on data scaling laws, specifically random elastic deformation and registration-guided deformation. We also propose a novel, scalable image augmentation approach that generates diffeomorphic mappings from geodesic subspace based on image registration to introduce realistic deformation.

Recent research underscores the potential of harnessing large language models (LLMs) for VLN, given their commonsense knowledge and general reasoning capabilities. Despite their strengths, a substantial gap in task completion performance persists between LLM-based approaches and domain experts, as LLMs inherently struggle to comprehend real-world spatial correlations precisely. Additionally, introducing LLMs is accompanied with substantial computational cost and inference latency. To address these issues, we propose a novel dual-process thinking framework dubbed R3, integrating LLMs' generalization capabilities with VLN-specific expertise in a zero-shot manner. The framework comprises three core modules: Runner, Ruminator, and Regulator. The Runner is a lightweight transformer-based expert model that ensures efficient and accurate navigation under regular circumstances. The Ruminator employs a powerful multimodal LLM as the backbone and adopts chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to elicit structured reasoning. The Regulator monitors the navigation progress and controls the appropriate thinking mode according to three criteria, integrating Runner and Ruminator harmoniously. Experimental results illustrate that R3 significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, exceeding 3.28% and 3.30% in SPL and RGSPL respectively on the REVERIE benchmark.

Existing compression methods have achieved partial success but overlook a crucial phenomenon in the training process -- the entropy conflict. During compression training, entropy decreases, leading to shorter reasoning but limited exploration, while accuracy-oriented objectives increase entropy, lengthening reasoning chains. This can cause the model to get stuck in a local dilemma. Our analysis further reveals the origin of the entropy conflict: many high-entropy tokens are logical connectors that receive larger gradients and are encouraged under the performance objective, while the compression objective simultaneously penalizes these potentially redundant connectors. This opposing pressure creates a direct source of entropy conflict. To address these issues, we adopt an entropy-guided training framework. As entropy descends, the model is guided toward efficient reasoning by encouraging concise thought steps; as entropy rises, exploration is reinforced under the compact reasoning mode to improve robustness.

Traditional methods use a fixed temperature throughout training, which is suboptimal. Moreover, architectural differences between teacher and student often result in mismatched logit magnitudes. We demonstrate that students benefit from softer probabilities early in training but require sharper probabilities in later stages. We introduce Dynamic Temperature Scheduler (DTS), which adjusts temperature dynamically based on the cross-entropy loss gap between teacher and student. To our knowledge, this is the first temperature scheduling method that adapts based on the divergence between teacher and student distributions. Our method integrates seamlessly with existing KD frameworks. We validate DTS across multiple KD strategies on vision (CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet) and NLP tasks (GLUE, Dolly, SelfIns, UnNI, S-NI), consistently outperforming static-temperature baselines.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that Uni-Hema achieves comparable or superior performance to train on a single-task and single dataset models, across diverse hematological tasks, while providing interpretable, morphologically relevant insights at the single-cell level.

With the strong generation capabilities of LLMs, research has focused on generating verbalized confidence. This is further enhanced by combining chain-of-thought reasoning, which provides logical and transparent estimation. However, how reasoning strategies affect the estimated confidence is still under-explored. In this work, we demonstrate that predicting a verbalized probability distribution can effectively encourage in-depth reasoning for confidence estimation.

Instead, we rely on an indirect style where learning algorithms, like gradient descent, determine a neural network's function by learning from data. This indirect style is often a virtue; it empowers us to solve problems that were previously impossible. But it lacks discrete structure. We can't compile most algorithms into a neural network -- even if these algorithms could help the network learn. This limitation occurs because discrete algorithms are not obviously differentiable, making them incompatible with the gradient-based learning algorithms that determine a neural network's function. To address this, we introduce $\\textsf{Cajal}$: a typed, higher-order and linear programming language intended to be a minimal vehicle for exploring a direct style of programming neural networks. We prove $\\textsf{Cajal}$ programs compile to linear neurons, allowing discrete algorithms to be expressed in a differentiable form compatible with gradient-based learning. With our implementation of $\\textsf{Cajal}$, we conduct several experiments where we link these linear neurons against other neural networks to determine part of their function prior to learning. Linking with these neurons allows networks to learn faster, with greater data-efficiency, and in a way that's easier to debug.

Their short temporal cycles increase the difficulty in automatically detecting them using classical computer vision approaches and remote sensing. Also, due to scarcity of and the difficulty in producing accurate labeled data, automatic detection of ephemeral gullies using Machine Learning is limited to zero-shot approaches which are hard to implement. To overcome these challenges, we present the first weakly supervised pipeline for detection of ephemeral gullies. Our method relies on remote sensing and uses Vision Language Models (VLMs) to drastically reduce the labor-intensive task of manual labeling. In order to achieve that, the method exploits: 1) the knowledge embedded in the VLM's pretraining; 2) a teacher-student model where the teacher learns from noisy labels coming from the VLMs, and the student learns by weak supervision using teacher-generate labels and a noise-aware loss function. We also make available the first-of-its-kind dataset for semi-supervised detection of ephemeral gully from remote-sensed images. The dataset consists of a number of locations labeled by a group of soil and plant scientists, as well as a large number of unlabeled locations. The dataset represent more than 18,000 high-resolution remote-sensing images obtained over the course of 13 years. Our experimental results demonstrate the validity of our approach by showing superior performances compared to VLMs and the label model itself when using weak supervision to train an student model.

By isolating and measuring fundamental linguistic skills, AraLingBench provides a diagnostic framework for developing Arabic LLMs. The full evaluation code is publicly available on GitHub.", "AI": {"tldr": "AraLingBench\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8bed\u6cd5\u3001\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u3001\u62fc\u5199\u3001\u9605\u8bfb\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u53e5\u6cd5\u4e94\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7150\u9053\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u591a\u9009\u9898\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u6784\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u548c\u53cc\u8bedLLMs\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u578b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5f97\u5206\u5f88\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u638c\u63e1\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5f88\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6216\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u800c\u975e\u771f\u5b9e\u7406\u89e3\u6765\u83b7\u5f97\u6210\u529f\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5305\u542b150\u9053\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u9009\u9898\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u8bed\u6cd5\u3001\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u3001\u62fc\u5199\u3001\u9605\u8bfb\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u53e5\u6cd5\u4e94\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u8bed\u8a00\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5bf935\u4e2a\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u548c\u53cc\u8bedLLMs\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8868\u5c42\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u5f3a\u52b2\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6df1\u5c42\u8bed\u6cd5\u548c\u53e5\u6cd5\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u578b\u57fa\u51c6\u9ad8\u5206\u4e0e\u771f\u6b63\u8bed\u8a00\u638c\u63e1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "AraLingBench\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u57fa\u672c\u8bed\u8a00\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bedLLMs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bca\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u8bb0\u5fc6\u800c\u975e\u771f\u5b9e\u7406\u89e3\u83b7\u5f97\u6210\u529f\u7684\u73b0\u72b6\u3002", "relevance": 75.0}}

We introduce a scalable, model-agnostic framework that assesses temporal behavior using motion vectors (MVs) extracted directly from compressed video streams. Codec-generated MVs from standards such as H.264 and HEVC provide lightweight, resolution-consistent descriptors of motion dynamics. We quantify realism by computing Kullback-Leibler, Jensen-Shannon, and Wasserstein divergences between MV statistics of real and generated videos. Experiments on the GenVidBench dataset containing videos from eight state-of-the-art generators reveal systematic discrepancies from real motion: entropy-based divergences rank Pika and SVD as closest to real videos, MV-sum statistics favor VC2 and Text2Video-Zero, and CogVideo shows the largest deviations across both measures. Visualizations of MV fields and class-conditional motion heatmaps further reveal center bias, sparse and piecewise constant flows, and grid-like artifacts that frame-level metrics do not capture. Beyond evaluation, we investigate MV-RGB fusion through channel concatenation, cross-attention, joint embedding, and a motion-aware fusion module. Incorporating MVs improves downstream classification across ResNet, I3D, and TSN backbones, with ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 reaching up to 97.4% accuracy and I3D achieving 99.0% accuracy on real-versus-generated discrimination. These findings demonstrate that compressed-domain MVs provide an effective temporal signal for diagnosing motion defects in generative videos and for strengthening temporal reasoning in discriminative models.

We test this fundamental question with a series of chronological ordering tasks with increasing complexities over facts the model already knows from pre-training. Our tasks cover (1) chronological ordering, (2) conditional sorting (filter, then order), and (3) anachronism detection. We evaluate GPT-4.1, Claude-3.7 Sonnet, with and without Extended Thinking (ET), and GPT-5 across multiple reasoning-effort settings. Across models, Exact match rate drops sharply as sequences lengthen even while rank correlations stay high as LLMs largely preserve local order but struggle to maintain a single globally consistent timeline. In conditional sorting, most failures stem from the filtering step rather than the ordering step, but GPT-5 and Claude-3.7 Sonnet with Extended Thinking outshine normal models significantly. Lastly, anachronism detection is found to be the easiest task for the LLMs but performance still declines with increasingly overlapping timelines or entities. Overall, our main contribution is showing that allocating explicit reasoning budget helps with chronological ordering with GPT-5 at medium/high reasoning effort achieving flawless ordering at all lengths and perfect conditional sorting (both self-filtered and given-subset), whereas low/minimal effort degrades with longer lists, mirroring earlier models. Our findings delineate limits of current LLMs on chronological tasks, providing insights into task complexity, and demonstrate scenarios in which reasoning helps.

To bridge this gap, we introduce ConInstruct, a benchmark specifically designed to assess LLMs' ability to detect and resolve conflicts within user instructions. Using this dataset, we evaluate LLMs' conflict detection performance and analyze their conflict resolution behavior. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1) Most proprietary LLMs exhibit strong conflict detection capabilities, whereas among open-source models, only DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates similarly strong performance. DeepSeek-R1 and Claude-4.5-Sonnet achieve the highest average F1-scores at 91.5% and 87.3%, respectively, ranking first and second overall. (2) Despite their strong conflict detection abilities, LLMs rarely explicitly notify users about the conflicts or request clarification when faced with conflicting constraints.

Transferability is defined as the ability of a representation learned from one task to support the objective of another.\n  Inspired by the meta-learning paradigm, we construct multiple SSL tasks within each training batch to support explicitly modeling transferability. Based on empirical evidence and causal analysis, we find that although introducing task-level information improves transferability, it is still hindered by task conflict. To address this issue, we propose a Task Conflict Calibration (TC$^2$) method to alleviate the impact of task conflict. Specifically, it first splits batches to create multiple SSL tasks, infusing task-level information. Next, it uses a factor extraction network to produce causal generative factors for all tasks and a weight extraction network to assign dedicated weights to each sample, employing data reconstruction, orthogonality, and sparsity to ensure effectiveness. Finally, TC$^2$ calibrates sample representations during SSL training and integrates into the pipeline via a two-stage bi-level optimization framework to boost the transferability of learned representations. Experimental results on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that our method consistently improves the transferability of SSL models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u51b2\u7a81\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08TC\u00b2\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\u5728\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u8868\u793a\u7684\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4efb\u52a1\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u793a\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff08SSL\uff09\u8868\u793a\u7684\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\uff1a(i) SSL\u8868\u793a\u7684\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff0c(ii) \u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u8fd9\u79cd\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u867d\u7136\u5f15\u5165\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u4fe1\u606f\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u53d7\u4efb\u52a1\u51b2\u7a81\u963b\u788d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4efb\u52a1\u51b2\u7a81\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08TC\u00b2\uff09\uff1a1\uff09\u5728\u6279\u6b21\u4e2d\u5206\u5272\u521b\u5efa\u591a\u4e2aSSL\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6ce8\u5165\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b2\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u56e0\u5b50\u63d0\u53d6\u7f51\u7edc\u751f\u6210\u6240\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u751f\u6210\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u6743\u91cd\u63d0\u53d6\u7f51\u7edc\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u5206\u914d\u4e13\u7528\u6743\u91cd\uff1b3\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u6784\u3001\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u786e\u4fdd\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff1b4\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u53cc\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u6821\u51c6\u6837\u672c\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347SSL\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "TC\u00b2\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u4efb\u52a1\u51b2\u7a81\u5e76\u6821\u51c6\u6837\u672c\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u793a\u7684\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u3002", "relevance": 75.0}}

A central task is Multi-Camera Vehicle Tracking (MCVT), which generates vehicle trajectories and enables applications such as anomaly detection, traffic density estimation, and suspect vehicle tracking. However, most existing studies on MCVT emphasize accuracy while overlooking real-time performance and scalability. These two aspects are essential for real-world deployment and become increasingly challenging in city-scale applications as the number of cameras grows. To address this issue, we propose SAE-MCVT, the first scalable real-time MCVT framework. The system includes several edge devices that interact with one central workstation separately. On the edge side, live RTSP video streams are serialized and processed through modules including object detection, object tracking, geo-mapping, and feature extraction. Only lightweight metadata -- vehicle locations and deep appearance features -- are transmitted to the central workstation.

However, it frequently suffers from hallucination errors, especially under noisy acoustic conditions. Previous works to reduce hallucinations in Whisper-style ASR systems have primarily focused on audio preprocessing or post-processing of transcriptions to filter out erroneous content. However, modifications to the Whisper model itself remain largely unexplored to mitigate hallucinations directly. To address this challenge, we present a two-stage architecture that first enhances encoder robustness through Adaptive Layer Attention (ALA) and further suppresses hallucinations using a multi-objective knowledge distillation (KD) framework. In the first stage, ALA groups encoder layers into semantically coherent blocks via inter-layer correlation analysis. A learnable multi-head attention module then fuses these block representations, enabling the model to jointly exploit low- and high-level features for more robust encoding. In the second stage, our KD framework trains the student model on noisy audio to align its semantic and attention distributions with a teacher model processing clean inputs. Our experiments on noisy speech benchmarks show notable reductions in hallucinations and word error rates, while preserving performance on clean speech. Together, ALA and KD offer a principled strategy to improve Whisper's reliability under real-world noisy conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u67b6\u6784\u6765\u51cf\u5c11Whisper\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u9519\u8bef\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5c42\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u589e\u5f3a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6291\u5236\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "motivation": "Whisper\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7ecf\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\u5e7b\u89c9\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u97f3\u9891\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6216\u540e\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u4fee\u6539\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "1. \u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5c42\u6ce8\u610f\u529b(ALA)\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5206\u6790\u5c06\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5c42\u5206\u7ec4\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u878d\u5408\u5757\u8868\u793a\uff1b2. \u591a\u76ee\u6807\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f(KD)\uff1a\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u97f3\u9891\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u5904\u7406\u5e72\u51c0\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u8bed\u97f3\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u8bcd\u9519\u8bef\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5728\u5e72\u51c0\u8bed\u97f3\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "ALA\u548cKD\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347Whisper\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u539f\u5219\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "relevance": 65.0}}

This study examines whether larger models can systematically jailbreak smaller ones - eliciting harmful or restricted behavior despite alignment safeguards. Using standardized adversarial tasks from JailbreakBench, we simulate over 6,000 multi-turn attacker-target exchanges across major LLM families and scales (0.6B-120B parameters), measuring both harm score and refusal behavior as indicators of adversarial potency and alignment integrity. Each interaction is evaluated through aggregated harm and refusal scores assigned by three independent LLM judges, providing a consistent, model-based measure of adversarial outcomes. Aggregating results across prompts, we find a strong and statistically significant correlation between mean harm and the logarithm of the attacker-to-target size ratio (Pearson r = 0.51, p < 0.001; Spearman rho = 0.52, p < 0.001), indicating that relative model size correlates with the likelihood and severity of harmful completions. Mean harm score variance is higher across attackers (0.18) than across targets (0.10), suggesting that attacker-side behavioral diversity contributes more to adversarial outcomes than target susceptibility. Attacker refusal frequency is strongly and negatively correlated with harm (rho = -0.93, p < 0.001), showing that attacker-side alignment mitigates harmful responses. These findings reveal that size asymmetry influences robustness and provide exploratory evidence for adversarial scaling patterns, motivating more controlled investigations into inter-model alignment and safety.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u6297\u4ea4\u4e92\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u8d8a\u72f1\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4e0e\u8d8a\u72f1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u5448\u663e\u8457\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u884c\u4e3a\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6bd4\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u6613\u53d7\u6027\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u7ed3\u679c\u5f71\u54cd\u66f4\u5927\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLMs\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u589e\u591a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u5982\u4f55\u968f\u89c4\u6a21\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u8d8a\u72f1\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528JailbreakBench\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5bf9\u6297\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u8d85\u8fc76000\u6b21\u591a\u8f6e\u653b\u51fb\u8005-\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e3b\u8981LLM\u5bb6\u65cf\u548c\u89c4\u6a21\uff080.6B-120B\u53c2\u6570\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acbLLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u6d4b\u91cf\u4f24\u5bb3\u5206\u6570\u548c\u62d2\u7edd\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5e73\u5747\u4f24\u5bb3\u5206\u6570\u4e0e\u653b\u51fb\u8005-\u76ee\u6807\u5927\u5c0f\u6bd4\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u5448\u5f3a\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff08Pearson r=0.51\uff09\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u65b9\u884c\u4e3a\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u7ed3\u679c\u5f71\u54cd\u66f4\u5927\uff08\u65b9\u5dee0.18 vs 0.10\uff09\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u62d2\u7edd\u9891\u7387\u4e0e\u4f24\u5bb3\u5206\u6570\u5f3a\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\uff08rho=-0.93\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u5f71\u54cd\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u4fa7\u5bf9\u9f50\u80fd\u51cf\u8f7b\u6709\u5bb3\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u7f29\u653e\u6a21\u5f0f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u53d7\u63a7\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

This task is crucial for enhancing user satisfaction and corporate profits. Existing recommendation models struggle with complex operation logic, diverse user preferences, and sensitive to suboptimal suggestions, limiting their applicability to IoT device operations. To address these issues, we propose DevPiolt, a LLM-based recommendation model for IoT device operations. Specifically, we first equip the LLM with fundamental domain knowledge of IoT operations via continual pre-training and multi-task fine-tuning. Then, we employ direct preference optimization to align the fine-tuned LLM with specific user preferences. Finally, we design a confidence-based exposure control mechanism to avoid negative user experiences from low-quality recommendations. Extensive experiments show that DevPiolt significantly outperforms baselines on all datasets, with an average improvement of 69.5% across all metrics. DevPiolt has been practically deployed in Xiaomi Home app for one quarter, providing daily operation recommendations to 255,000 users.

To address these challenges, we introduce ATLAS (AGI-Oriented Testbed for Logical Application in Science), a large-scale, high-difficulty, and cross-disciplinary evaluation suite composed of approximately 800 original problems. Developed by domain experts (PhD-level and above), ATLAS spans seven core scientific fields: mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, computer science, earth science, and materials science. Its key features include: (1) High Originality and Contamination Resistance, with all questions newly created or substantially adapted to prevent test data leakage; (2) Cross-Disciplinary Focus, designed to assess models' ability to integrate knowledge and reason across scientific domains; (3) High-Fidelity Answers, prioritizing complex, open-ended answers involving multi-step reasoning and LaTeX-formatted expressions over simple multiple-choice questions; and (4) Rigorous Quality Control, employing a multi-stage process of expert peer review and adversarial testing to ensure question difficulty, scientific value, and correctness. We also propose a robust evaluation paradigm using a panel of LLM judges for automated, nuanced assessment of complex answers.

Although the current post hoc explanation methods offer valuable insights into feature importance, they are inherently disconnected from the model training process, limiting their faithfulness and utility. In this work, we introduce a novel differentiable approach to global explainability by design, integrating feature importance estimation directly into model training. Central to our method is the ScoresActivation function, a feature-ranking mechanism embedded within the learning pipeline. This integration enables models to prioritize features according to their contribution to predictive performance in a differentiable and end-to-end trainable manner. Evaluations across benchmark datasets show that our approach yields globally faithful, stable feature rankings aligned with SHAP values and ground-truth feature importance, while maintaining high predictive performance.

Our method also improves classification accuracy by 11.24% with 10 features (5 relevant) and 29.33% with 16 features (5 relevant, 11 irrelevant), demonstrating robustness to irrelevant inputs.

However, we find that reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuned CoT reasoning can paradoxically degrade performance in Visual Grounding tasks, particularly as CoT outputs become lengthy or complex. Additionally, our analysis reveals that increased dataset size does not always enhance performance due to varying data complexities. Motivated by these findings, we propose Curriculum-based Relative Policy Optimization (CuRPO), a novel training strategy that leverages CoT length and generalized Intersection over Union (gIoU) rewards as complexity indicators to progressively structure training data from simpler to more challenging examples. Extensive experiments on RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and LISA datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. CuRPO consistently outperforms existing methods, including Visual-RFT, with notable improvements of up to +12.52 mAP on RefCOCO.

Accurately forecasting regional Airbnb market trends can thus offer critical insights for policymakers and urban planners aiming to mitigate these impacts. This study proposes a novel time-series forecasting framework to predict three key Airbnb indicators -- Revenue, Reservation Days, and Number of Reservations -- at the regional level. Using a sliding-window approach, the model forecasts trends 1 to 3 months ahead. Unlike prior studies that focus on individual listings at fixed time points, our approach constructs regional representations by integrating listing features with external contextual factors such as urban accessibility and human mobility. We convert structured tabular data into prompt-based inputs for a Large Language Model (LLM), producing comprehensive regional embeddings. These embeddings are then fed into advanced time-series models (RNN, LSTM, Transformer) to better capture complex spatio-temporal dynamics. Experiments on Seoul's Airbnb dataset show that our method reduces both average RMSE and MAE by approximately 48% compared to conventional baselines, including traditional statistical and machine learning models.

However, when predicting over a set of candidate options, LLMs suffer from label biases, and existing calibration methods overlook biases arising from multi-token class labels. We tackle an issue we call label length bias, where labels of different lengths are treated inconsistently, even after standard length normalization. To mitigate it, we propose normalized contextual calibration (NCC), an effective method that normalizes and calibrates predictions at the full-label level. NCC achieves statistically significant improvements over prior approaches across multiple datasets and models, with gains of up to 10% F1. Moreover, NCC extends bias mitigation to broader tasks such as multiple-choice question answering. Our analysis shows that, when combined with in-context learning, NCC is less sensitive to few-shot example selection, requires fewer examples for competitive performance, and produces more reliable confidence estimates.

We identify a major bottleneck:the long-tail distribution of rollout lengths, where a small fraction of long generations dominates wall clock time and a complementary opportunity; the availability of historical rollouts that reveal stable prompt level patterns across training epochs. Motivated by these observations, we propose DAS, a Distribution Aware Speculative decoding framework that accelerates RL rollouts without altering model outputs. DAS integrates two key ideas: an adaptive, nonparametric drafter built from recent rollouts using an incrementally maintained suffix tree, and a length aware speculation policy that allocates more aggressive draft budgets to long trajectories that dominate makespan. This design exploits rollout history to sustain acceptance while balancing base and token level costs during decoding. Experiments on math and code reasoning tasks show that DAS reduces rollout time up to 50% while preserving identical training curves, demonstrating that distribution-aware speculative decoding can significantly accelerate RL post training without compromising learning quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "DAS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u5e03\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u5386\u53f2rollout\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u6765\u52a0\u901fRL\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684rollout\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u8fbe50%\u7684rollout\u65f6\u95f4\u800c\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "motivation": "RL\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2drollout\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6548\u7387\u53d7\u5230\u957f\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u957f\u5c3e\u5206\u5e03\u4e2d\u5c11\u6570\u957f\u751f\u6210\u5360\u636e\u4e86\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u65f6\u95f4\u6210\u672c\u3002\u5386\u53f2rollout\u6570\u636e\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u7ea7\u522b\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u52a0\u901f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u673a\u4f1a\u3002", "method": "DAS\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u601d\u60f3\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u8fd1rollout\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u5316draft\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u589e\u91cf\u7ef4\u62a4\u7684\u540e\u7f00\u6811\uff1b2\uff09\u957f\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u63a8\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e3a\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5730\u4f4d\u7684\u957f\u8f68\u8ff9\u5206\u914d\u66f4\u79ef\u6781\u7684draft\u9884\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDAS\u5c06rollout\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe50%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u66f2\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u5e03\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901fRL\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u5b66\u4e60\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in complex reasoning tasks. Despite promising success, current LLM-based KGR methods still face two critical limitations. First, existing methods often extract reasoning paths indiscriminately, without assessing their different importance, which may introduce irrelevant noise that misleads LLMs. Second, while many methods leverage LLMs to dynamically explore potential reasoning paths, they require high retrieval demands and frequent LLM calls. To address these limitations, we propose PathMind, a novel framework designed to enhance faithful and interpretable reasoning by selectively guiding LLMs with important reasoning paths. Specifically, PathMind follows a \"Retrieve-Prioritize-Reason\" paradigm. First, it retrieves a query subgraph from KG through the retrieval module. Next, it introduces a path prioritization mechanism that identifies important reasoning paths using a semantic-aware path priority function, which simultaneously considers the accumulative cost and the estimated future cost for reaching the target. Finally, PathMind generates accurate and logically consistent responses via a dual-phase training strategy, including task-specific instruction tuning and path-wise preference alignment. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PathMind consistently outperforms competitive baselines, particularly on complex reasoning tasks with fewer input tokens, by identifying essential reasoning paths.", "AI": {"tldr": "PathMind\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5f15\u5bfcLLM\u4f7f\u7528\u91cd\u8981\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002\u5b83\u91c7\u7528\"\u68c0\u7d22-\u4f18\u5148\u6392\u5e8f-\u63a8\u7406\"\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8def\u5f84\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u673a\u5236\u548c\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\uff1a1\uff09\u4e0d\u52a0\u533a\u5206\u5730\u63d0\u53d6\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u5165\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\u566a\u58f0\u8bef\u5bfcLLM\uff1b2\uff09\u52a8\u6001\u63a2\u7d22\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u68c0\u7d22\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u9891\u7e41LLM\u8c03\u7528\u3002", "method": "PathMind\u91c7\u7528\"\u68c0\u7d22-\u4f18\u5148\u6392\u5e8f-\u63a8\u7406\"\u8303\u5f0f\uff1a1\uff09\u68c0\u7d22\u6a21\u5757\u4eceKG\u4e2d\u83b7\u53d6\u67e5\u8be2\u5b50\u56fe\uff1b2\uff09\u8def\u5f84\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u673a\u5236\u4f7f\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u8def\u5f84\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u51fd\u6570\u8bc6\u522b\u91cd\u8981\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff1b3\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\uff09\u751f\u6210\u51c6\u786e\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPathMind\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ade\u4e89\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u57fa\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u8f93\u5165token\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "PathMind\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5f15\u5bfcLLM\u4f7f\u7528\u91cd\u8981\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5fe0\u5b9e\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

To address this gap, we construct EduHarm, a benchmark containing safe-unsafe instruction pairs across five representative educational scenarios, enabling systematic safety evaluation of educational LLMs. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage shield framework (TSSF) for educational LLMs that simultaneously mitigates both jailbreak and fine-tuning attacks. First, safety-aware attention realignment redirects attention toward critical unsafe tokens, thereby restoring the harmfulness feature that discriminates between unsafe and safe inputs. Second, layer-wise safety judgment identifies harmfulness features by aggregating safety cues across multiple layers to detect unsafe instructions. Finally, defense-driven dual routing separates safe and unsafe queries, ensuring normal processing for benign inputs and guarded responses for harmful ones. Extensive experiments across eight jailbreak attack strategies demonstrate that TSSF effectively strengthens safety while preventing over-refusal of benign queries. Evaluations on three fine-tuning attack datasets further show that it consistently achieves robust defense against harmful queries while maintaining preserving utility gains from benign fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86EduHarm\u57fa\u51c6\u548cTSSF\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u9632\u62a4\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u9632\u5fa1\u6559\u80b2\u573a\u666f\u4e0bLLM\u7684\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u6027\u67e5\u8be2\u6548\u7528\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u901a\u7528\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9488\u5bf9\u6559\u80b2\u573a\u666f\u72ec\u7279\u5b89\u5168\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u6559\u80b2LLM\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u8d8a\u72f1\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6709\u5bb3\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "method": "1) \u6784\u5efaEduHarm\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e94\u4e2a\u6559\u80b2\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5b89\u5168-\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u6307\u4ee4\u5bf9\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u9632\u62a4\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5b89\u5168\u611f\u77e5\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u91cd\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u5206\u5c42\u5b89\u5168\u5224\u65ad\u3001\u9632\u5fa1\u9a71\u52a8\u53cc\u8def\u7531\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516b\u79cd\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u7b56\u7565\u4e0a\uff0cTSSF\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e14\u907f\u514d\u826f\u6027\u67e5\u8be2\u8fc7\u5ea6\u62d2\u7edd\uff1b\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5fae\u8c03\u653b\u51fb\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u6709\u5bb3\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u9632\u5fa1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ef4\u6301\u826f\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6548\u7528\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "TSSF\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u7f13\u89e3\u8d8a\u72f1\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4e3a\u6559\u80b2LLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u969c\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

Traditional CIL methods, which do not leverage pre-trained models (PTMs), suffer from catastrophic forgetting (CF) due to the need to incrementally learn both feature representations and the classifier. The integration of PTMs into CIL has recently led to efficient approaches that treat the PTM as a fixed feature extractor combined with analytic classifiers, achieving state-of-the-art performance. However, they still face a major limitation: the inability to continually adapt feature representations to best suit the CIL tasks, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose AnaCP (Analytic Contrastive Projection), a novel method that preserves the efficiency of analytic classifiers while enabling incremental feature adaptation without gradient-based training, thereby eliminating the CF caused by gradient updates. Our experiments show that AnaCP not only outperforms existing baselines but also achieves the accuracy level of joint training, which is regarded as the upper bound of CIL.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AnaCP\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u7c7b\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u5206\u6790\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u589e\u91cf\u7279\u5f81\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7c7b\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6301\u7eed\u8c03\u6574\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u589e\u91cf\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u6b21\u4f18\u3002", "method": "AnaCP\uff08\u5206\u6790\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6295\u5f71\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6295\u5f71\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u589e\u91cf\u7279\u5f81\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5206\u6790\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eAnaCP\u4e0d\u4ec5\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6c34\u5e73\uff08\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u7c7b\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u9650\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "AnaCP\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7c7b\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u9002\u5e94\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63a5\u8fd1\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u9650\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "relevance": 45.0}}

In this work, we explore a new way to instil such generic biases in vision transformers (ViTs) by pretraining on procedurally-generated data devoid of visual or semantic content. We generate this data with simple algorithms such as formal grammars, so the results bear no relationship to either natural or synthetic images. We use this procedurally-generated data to pretrain ViTs in a warm-up phase that bypasses their visual patch embedding mechanisms, thus encouraging the models to internalise abstract computational priors. When followed by standard image-based training, this warm-up significantly improves data efficiency, convergence speed, and downstream performance. On ImageNet-1k for example, allocating just 1% of the training budget to procedural data improves final accuracy by over 1.7%. In terms of its effect on performance, 1% procedurally generated data is thus equivalent to 28% of the ImageNet-1k data.

We present MedBench v4, a nationwide, cloud-based benchmarking infrastructure comprising over 700,000 expert-curated tasks spanning 24 primary and 91 secondary specialties, with dedicated tracks for LLMs, multimodal models, and agents. Items undergo multi-stage refinement and multi-round review by clinicians from more than 500 institutions, and open-ended responses are scored by an LLM-as-a-judge calibrated to human ratings. We evaluate 15 frontier models. Base LLMs reach a mean overall score of 54.1/100 (best: Claude Sonnet 4.5, 62.5/100), but safety and ethics remain low (18.4/100). Multimodal models perform worse overall (mean 47.5/100; best: GPT-5, 54.9/100), with solid perception yet weaker cross-modal reasoning.

Forecasting of energy mix and energy use decades ahead is nontrivial. Classical approaches focus on generating a finite number of scenarios (modeled as a mixture of Diracs in statistical theory terms), which limits insight into scenario-specific volatility and hinders robust decision-making. We propose an alternative using tractable probabilistic models (TPMs), particularly sum-product networks (SPNs). These models enable exact, scalable inference of key quantities such as scenario likelihoods, marginals, and conditional probabilities, supporting robust scenario expansion and risk assessment.\n  This framework enables direct embedding of chance-constrained optimization into investment planning, enforcing safety or reliability with prescribed confidence levels. TPMs allow both scenario analysis and volatility quantification by compactly representing high-dimensional uncertainties.

The fields we experiment with are solutions to the Poisson partial differential equation and a diffusion mimicking the steady-state solution of the heat equation. These solutions are obtained by minimizing just the field residuals, no regularization is needed, providing a robust regression capable of diminishing the adverse impacts of outliers in the training data and allowing for sharp cell boundaries.

The system is designed as a reflective space for emotional processing rather than a substitute for professional therapy. It illustrates how conversational assistants can lower barriers to support, complement existing care, and broaden access to mental health resources. To address the shortage of confidential therapeutic data, we introduce synthetic client-therapist dialogue generation conditioned on client profiles. Finally, the planner demonstrates an innovative agentic workflow for dynamically adaptive, personalized self-care, bridging the limitations of static well-being tools. We describe the architecture, demonstrate its functionalities, and report evaluation of the RAG assistant in curated well-being scenarios using both automatic LLM-based judgments and a human-user study. This work highlights opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration between NLP researchers and mental health professionals to advance responsible innovation in human-AI interaction for well-being.", "AI": {"tldr": "Tell Me\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5305\u542bRAG\u5bf9\u8bdd\u52a9\u624b\u3001\u5408\u6210\u6cbb\u7597\u5bf9\u8bdd\u751f\u6210\u5668\u548cAI\u5065\u5eb7\u89c4\u5212\u56e2\u961f\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u652f\u6301\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u8d44\u6e90\u77ed\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLM\u6280\u672f\u964d\u4f4e\u83b7\u53d6\u652f\u6301\u7684\u95e8\u69db\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5408\u6210\u6cbb\u7597\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u96c6\u6210\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1aRAG\u52a9\u624b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u5bf9\u8bdd\u751f\u6210\u5668\u57fa\u4e8e\u7528\u6237\u6863\u6848\u751f\u6210\u6cbb\u7597\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0cAI\u5065\u5eb7\u56e2\u961f\u4f7f\u7528CrewAI\u751f\u6210\u6bcf\u5468\u81ea\u6211\u62a4\u7406\u8ba1\u5212\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8LLM\u5224\u65ad\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u60c5\u611f\u5904\u7406\u53cd\u601d\u7a7a\u95f4\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86NLP\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4e0e\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u58eb\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5728\u5065\u5eb7\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u521b\u65b0\u3002", "relevance": 65.0}}

Github Link provided: https://github.com/KaiChen9909/margnet", "summary": "In differentially private (DP) tabular data synthesis, the consensus is that statistical models are better than neural network (NN)-based methods. However, we argue that this conclusion is incomplete and overlooks the challenge of densely correlated datasets, where intricate dependencies can overwhelm statistical models. In such complex scenarios, neural networks are more suitable due to their capacity to fit complex distributions by learning directly from samples. Despite this potential, existing NN-based algorithms still suffer from significant limitations. We therefore propose MargNet, incorporating successful algorithmic designs of statistical models into neural networks. MargNet applies an adaptive marginal selection strategy and trains the neural networks to generate data that conforms to the selected marginals. On sparsely correlated datasets, our approach achieves utility close to the best statistical method while offering an average 7$\\times$ speedup over it. More importantly, on densely correlated datasets, MargNet establishes a new state-of-the-art, reducing fidelity error by up to 26\\% compared to the previous best.

This study examines how incorporating pluralistic values affects LLM behavior by systematically evaluating demographic variation and design parameters in the alignment pipeline. We collected alignment data from US and German participants (N = 1,095, 27,375 ratings) who rated LLM responses across five dimensions: Toxicity, Emotional Awareness (EA), Sensitivity, Stereotypical Bias, and Helpfulness. We fine-tuned multiple Large Language Models and Large Reasoning Models using preferences from different social groups while varying rating scales, disagreement handling methods, and optimization techniques. The results revealed systematic demographic effects: male participants rated responses 18% less toxic than female participants; conservative and Black participants rated responses 27.9% and 44% more emotionally aware than liberal and White participants, respectively. Models fine-tuned on group-specific preferences exhibited distinct behaviors. Technical design choices showed strong effects: the preservation of rater disagreement achieved roughly 53% greater toxicity reduction than majority voting, and 5-point scales yielded about 22% more reduction than binary formats; and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) consistently outperformed Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in multi-value optimization.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is considered a key technology with significant potential for training such Agents; however, the effective application of RL to LLM Agents is still in its nascent stages and faces considerable challenges. Currently, this emerging field lacks in-depth exploration into RL approaches specifically tailored for the LLM Agent context, alongside a scarcity of flexible and easily extensible training frameworks designed for this purpose. To help advance this area, this paper first revisits and clarifies Reinforcement Learning methodologies for LLM Agents by systematically extending the Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework to comprehensively define the key components of an LLM Agent. Secondly, we introduce Agent-R1, a modular, flexible, and user-friendly training framework for RL-based LLM Agents, designed for straightforward adaptation across diverse task scenarios and interactive environments.

Our CrossTrainer approach discovers skill-attributes, such as balance, control, and hand positioning -- whose meaning transcends the boundaries of any given sport, then trains a multimodal language model to generate actionable feedback for a novel video, e.g., \"lift hands more to generate more power\" as well as its proficiency level, e.g., early expert.

We present a neuro-symbolic framework that explicitly models and propagates uncertainty from perception to planning, providing a principled connection between these two abstraction levels. Our approach couples a transformer-based perceptual front-end with graph neural network (GNN) relational reasoning to extract probabilistic symbolic states from visual observations, and an uncertainty-aware symbolic planner that actively gathers information when confidence is low. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on tabletop robotic manipulation as a concrete application: the translator processes 10,047 PyBullet-generated scenes (3--10 objects) and outputs probabilistic predicates with calibrated confidences (overall F1=0.68).

To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework that equips graphs with a complex-weighted structure, assigning each edge a complex number to drive a diffusion process that extends random walks into the complex domain. We prove that this diffusion is highly expressive: with appropriately chosen complex weights, any node-classification task can be solved in the steady state of a complex random walk. Building on this insight, we propose the Complex-Weighted Convolutional Network (CWCN), which learns suitable complex-weighted structures directly from data while enriching diffusion with learnable matrices and nonlinear activations. CWCN is simple to implement, requires no additional hyperparameters beyond those of standard GNNs, and achieves competitive performance on benchmark datasets.

This technique enhances anatomical detail and soft tissue differentiation, which is vital for early diagnosis and clinical decision-making. However, inherent contrasts disparities between modalities pose fundamental challenges in effectively utilizing reference image textures to guide target image reconstruction, often resulting in suboptimal feature integration. To address this issue, we propose a dual-prompt expert network based on a convolutional dictionary feature decoupling (CD-DPE) strategy for multi-contrast MRI super-resolution. Specifically, we introduce an iterative convolutional dictionary feature decoupling module (CD-FDM) to separate features into cross-contrast and intra-contrast components, thereby reducing redundancy and interference. To fully integrate these features, a novel dual-prompt feature fusion expert module (DP-FFEM) is proposed. This module uses a frequency prompt to guide the selection of relevant reference features for incorporation into the target image, while an adaptive routing prompt determines the optimal method for fusing reference and target features to enhance reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments on public multi-contrast MRI datasets demonstrate that CD-DPE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstructing fine details.

Yet converting unstructured educational materials, such as lecture notes and slides, into KGs that capture key pedagogical content remains difficult. We propose a framework for knowledge graph construction and refinement grounded in rate-distortion (RD) theory and optimal transport geometry. In the framework, lecture content is modeled as a metric-measure space, capturing semantic and relational structure, while candidate KGs are aligned using Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) couplings to quantify semantic distortion. The rate term, expressed via the size of KG, reflects complexity and compactness.

Our results demonstrate that tuning the BR can yield significant improvements over the default: the best setup relied on BR \\leq 1.0 for 24 datasets, BR > 1.0 for 15, and BR = 1.0 was optimal in 4 cases only. We establish a link between dataset characteristics and the preferred BR: datasets with strong global feature-target relationships favor higher BRs, while those with higher local target variance benefit from lower BRs. To further investigate this relationship, we conducted experiments on synthetic datasets with controlled noise levels. These experiments reproduce the observed bias-variance trade-off: in low-noise scenarios, higher BRs effectively reduce model bias, whereas in high-noise settings, lower BRs help reduce model variance.

While optical sensors such as RGB and LiDAR offer high spatial fidelity, they suffer from severe occlusions and introduce privacy risks in indoor environments. In contrast, millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar preserves privacy and penetrates obstacles, but its inherently low spatial resolution makes reliable geometric reasoning difficult.\n  We introduce RISE, the first benchmark and system for single-static-radar indoor scene understanding, jointly targeting layout reconstruction and object detection. RISE is built upon the key insight that multipath reflections, traditionally treated as noise, encode rich geometric cues. To exploit this, we propose a Bi-Angular Multipath Enhancement that explicitly models Angle-of-Arrival and Angle-of-Departure to recover secondary (ghost) reflections and reveal invisible structures. On top of these enhanced observations, a simulation-to-reality Hierarchical Diffusion framework transforms fragmented radar responses into complete layout reconstruction and object detection.\n  Our benchmark contains 50,000 frames collected across 100 real indoor trajectories, forming the first large-scale dataset dedicated to radar-based indoor scene understanding. Extensive experiments show that RISE reduces the Chamfer Distance by 60% (down to 16 cm) compared to the state of the art in layout reconstruction, and delivers the first mmWave-based object detection, achieving 58% IoU.

In this work, we propose AutoTool, a novel graph-based framework that bypasses repeated LLM inference by exploiting a key empirical observation: tool usage inertia - the tendency of tool invocations to follow predictable sequential patterns. AutoTool constructs a directed graph from historical agent trajectories, where nodes represent tools and edges capture transition probabilities, effectively modeling the inertia in tool selection. It further integrates parameter-level information to refine tool input generation. By traversing this structured representation, AutoTool efficiently selects tools and their parameters with minimal reliance on LLM inference. Extensive experiments across diverse agent tasks demonstrate that AutoTool reduces inference costs by up to 30% while maintaining competitive task completion rates, offering a practical and scalable enhancement for inference-heavy frameworks. Our work highlights the promise of integrating statistical structure into LLM agent design for greater efficiency without sacrificing performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "AutoTool\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u60ef\u6027\uff08\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u9075\u5faa\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u987a\u5e8f\u6a21\u5f0f\uff09\u6765\u51cf\u5c11LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u590d\u8c03\u7528LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u5de5\u5177\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5de5\u5177\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u50cfReAct\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u590d\u8c03\u7528LLM\u6765\u51b3\u5b9a\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u4f7f\u7528\u54ea\u4e2a\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u6709\u5411\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u5386\u53f2\u4ee3\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u8282\u70b9\u4ee3\u8868\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u8fb9\u6355\u83b7\u8f6c\u79fb\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u5efa\u6a21\u5de5\u5177\u9009\u62e9\u60ef\u6027\uff1b\u96c6\u6210\u53c2\u6570\u7ea7\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u8f93\u5165\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAutoTool\u53ef\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u8fbe30%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "AutoTool\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5c06\u7edf\u8ba1\u7ed3\u6784\u96c6\u6210\u5230LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002", "relevance": 75.0}}

Effective prompts should meet three principles: focus on decision-critical information, provide step-level granularity, and minimize reliance on expert annotations through label efficiency. However, existing ICL methods often fail to satisfy all three criteria simultaneously. Motivated by these challenges, we introduce SkillGen, a skill-based ICL framework for structured sequential reasoning.

We used electronic health record (EHR) data to dynamically track AKI patients' clinical evolution and characterize AKI-to-CKD progression. Post-AKI clinical states were identified by clustering patient vectors derived from longitudinal medical codes and creatinine measurements. Transition probabilities between states and progression to CKD were estimated using multi-state modeling. After identifying common post-AKI trajectories, CKD risk factors in AKI subpopulations were identified through survival analysis. Of 20,699 patients with AKI at admission, 3,491 (17%) developed CKD. We identified fifteen distinct post-AKI states, each with different probabilities of CKD development. Most patients (75%, n=15,607) remained in a single state or made only one transition during the study period. Both established (e.g., AKI severity, diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, liver disease) and novel CKD risk factors, with their impact varying across these clinical states.

However, the optimization landscape for SAE training can be challenging due to correlations in the input data. We demonstrate that applying PCA Whitening to input activations -- a standard preprocessing technique in classical sparse coding -- improves SAE performance across multiple metrics. Through theoretical analysis and simulation, we show that whitening transforms the optimization landscape, making it more convex and easier to navigate. We evaluate both ReLU and Top-K SAEs across diverse model architectures, widths, and sparsity regimes. Empirical evaluation on SAEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for sparse autoencoders, reveals that whitening consistently improves interpretability metrics, including sparse probing accuracy and feature disentanglement, despite minor drops in reconstruction quality.

Also, in conventional AL, annotation effort is a function of the ROI- larger regions make the task cognitively easier but incur higher annotation costs, whereas smaller regions demand finer precision and more attention from the expert. In this context, language guidance provides an effective alternative, requiring minimal expert effort while bypassing the cognitively demanding task of precise boundary delineation in segmentation. Towards this goal, we introduce LINGUAL: a framework that receives natural language instructions from an expert, translates them into executable programs through in-context learning, and automatically performs the corresponding sequence of sub-tasks without any human intervention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LINGUAL in active domain adaptation (ADA) achieving comparable or superior performance to AL baselines while reducing estimated annotation time by approximately 80%.", "AI": {"tldr": "LINGUAL\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u5c06\u6307\u4ee4\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5b8c\u6210\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea680%\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u867d\u7136\u53ea\u9700\u6807\u6ce8\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u533a\u57df\u800c\u975e\u6574\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u8fb9\u754c\u6a21\u7cca\u6a21\u7cca\uff0c\u4ecd\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u4e14\u52b3\u52a8\u5bc6\u96c6\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u6807\u6ce8\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u4e0eROI\u5927\u5c0f\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5927\u533a\u57df\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u62c5\u8f7b\u4f46\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u5c0f\u533a\u57df\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLINGUAL\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u4e13\u5bb6\u63d0\u4f9b\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u5c06\u6307\u4ee4\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u6267\u884c\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e3b\u52a8\u57df\u9002\u5e94(ADA)\u4e2d\uff0cLINGUAL\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f30\u8ba1\u6807\u6ce8\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea680%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u5bfc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6700\u5c11\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u52aa\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ed5\u8fc7\u4e86\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7cbe\u786e\u8fb9\u754c\u63cf\u7ed8\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u8981\u6c42\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "relevance": 45.0}}

These challenges make conventional optimization and value-based RL approaches computationally inefficient and difficult to scale. This paper applies a Heterogeneous-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HARL) framework, instantiated through Heterogeneous-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (HAPPO), to enable coordinated restoration across interconnected microgrids. Each agent controls a distinct microgrid with different loads, DER capacities, and switch counts, introducing practical structural heterogeneity. Decentralized actor policies are trained with a centralized critic to compute advantage values for stable on-policy updates. A physics-informed OpenDSS environment provides full power flow feedback and enforces operational limits via differentiable penalty signals rather than invalid action masking. The total DER generation is capped at 2400 kW, and each microgrid must satisfy local supply-demand feasibility. Experiments on the IEEE 123-bus and IEEE 8500-node systems show that HAPPO achieves faster convergence, higher restored power, and smoother multi-seed training than DQN, PPO, MAES, MAGDPG, MADQN, Mean-Field RL, and QMIX.

We construct a manually annotated dataset of news articles and assess annotation consistency, bias polarity, and inter-model agreement to quantify divergence between human and model perceptions of bias. Experimental results show that among traditional transformer-based models, RoBERTa achieves the highest alignment with human labels, whereas generative models such as GPT demonstrate the strongest overall agreement with human annotations in a zero-shot setting. Among all transformer-based baselines, our fine-tuned RoBERTa model acquired the highest accuracy and the strongest alignment with human-annotated labels.

Our approach proceeds in two stages. First, we introduce a semantically aware labeling algorithm that, given a generated SQL and a gold reference, assigns node-level correctness without over-penalizing structural containers or alias variation. Second, we represent each node with a rich set of schema-aware and lexical features - capturing identifier validity, alias resolution, type compatibility, ambiguity in scope, and typo signals - and train a supervised classifier to predict per-node error probabilities. We interpret these probabilities as calibrated uncertainty, enabling fine-grained diagnostics that pinpoint exactly where a query is likely to be wrong. Across multiple databases and datasets, our method substantially outperforms token log-probabilities: average AUC improves by +27.44% while maintaining robustness under cross-database evaluation.

Instead of training detectors tailored to specific datasets, we study a training-free approach leveraging self-supervised models without requiring prior data knowledge. These models, pre-trained with augmentations like RandomResizedCrop, learn to produce consistent representations across varying resolutions. Motivated by this, we propose WaRPAD, a training-free AI-generated image detection algorithm based on self-supervised models. Since neighborhood pixel differences in images are highly sensitive to resizing operations, WaRPAD first defines a base score function that quantifies the sensitivity of image embeddings to perturbations along high-frequency directions extracted via Haar wavelet decomposition. To simulate robustness against cropping augmentation, we rescale each image to a multiple of the models input size, divide it into smaller patches, and compute the base score for each patch. The final detection score is then obtained by averaging the scores across all patches. We validate WaRPAD on real datasets of diverse resolutions and domains, and images generated by 23 different generative models. Our method consistently achieves competitive performance and demonstrates strong robustness to test-time corruptions. Furthermore, as invariance to RandomResizedCrop is a common training scheme across self-supervised models, we show that WaRPAD is applicable across self-supervised models.", "AI": {"tldr": "WaRPAD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684AI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u88c1\u526a\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Haar\u5c0f\u6ce2\u5206\u89e3\u63d0\u53d6\u9ad8\u9891\u65b9\u5411\u6270\u52a8\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u6765\u68c0\u6d4bAI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0cAI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u800c\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5185\u5728\u7279\u6027\u6765\u68c0\u6d4bAI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "method": "WaRPAD\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9RandomResizedCrop\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u9996\u5148\u5b9a\u4e49\u57fa\u7840\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Haar\u5c0f\u6ce2\u5206\u89e3\u63d0\u53d6\u9ad8\u9891\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\u5bf9\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u7f29\u653e\u5230\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u5165\u5c3a\u5bf8\u7684\u500d\u6570\uff0c\u5206\u5272\u6210\u5c0f\u8865\u4e01\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8865\u4e01\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u8865\u4e01\u8bc4\u5206\u53d6\u5e73\u5747\u5f97\u5230\u6700\u7ec8\u68c0\u6d4b\u5206\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c23\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cWaRPAD\u59cb\u7ec8\u8fbe\u5230\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u635f\u574f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5404\u79cd\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "WaRPAD\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3AI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6837\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u3002", "relevance": 45.0}}

As High-Performance Computing (HPC) shifts toward heterogeneous GPU-accelerated architectures, many accelerators lack native Fortran bindings, creating an urgent need to modernize legacy codes for portability. Frameworks like Kokkos provide performance portability and a single-source C++ abstraction, but manual Fortran-to-Kokkos porting demands significant expertise and time. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in source-to-source code generation, yet their use in fully autonomous workflows for translating and optimizing parallel code remains largely unexplored, especially for performance portability across diverse hardware. This paper presents an agentic AI workflow where specialized LLM \"agents\" collaborate to translate, validate, compile, run, test, debug, and optimize Fortran kernels into portable Kokkos C++ programs. Results show the pipeline modernizes a range of benchmark kernels, producing performance-portable Kokkos codes across hardware partitions. Paid OpenAI models such as GPT-5 and o4-mini-high executed the workflow for only a few U.S. dollars, generating optimized codes that surpassed Fortran baselines, whereas open-source models like Llama4-Maverick often failed to yield functional codes. This work demonstrates the feasibility of agentic AI for Fortran-to-Kokkos transformation and offers a pathway for autonomously modernizing legacy scientific applications to run portably and efficiently on diverse supercomputers.

We first consider the setting where the loss is non-smooth and the optimizer interacts with a private proxy oracle, which sends only private messages about a minibatch of gradients. In this setting, we show that expected running time $\u03a9(\\min\\{\\frac{\\sqrt{d}}{\u03b1^2}, \\frac{d}{\\log(1/\u03b1)}\\})$ is necessary to achieve $\u03b1$ excess risk on problems of dimension $d$ when $d \\geq 1/\u03b1^2$. Upper bounds via DP-SGD show these results are tight when $d>\\tilde\u03a9(1/\u03b1^4)$. We further show our lower bound can be strengthened to $\u03a9(\\min\\{\\frac{d}{\\bar{m}\u03b1^2}, \\frac{d}{\\log(1/\u03b1)} \\})$ for algorithms which use minibatches of size at most $\\bar{m} < \\sqrt{d}$. We next consider smooth losses, where we relax the private oracle assumption and give lower bounds under only the condition that the optimizer is private. Here, we lower bound the expected number of first order oracle calls by $\\tilde\u03a9\\big(\\frac{\\sqrt{d}}\u03b1 + \\min\\{\\frac{1}{\u03b1^2}, n\\}\\big)$, where $n$ is the size of the dataset. Modifications to existing algorithms show this bound is nearly tight. Compared to non-private lower bounds, our results show that differentially private optimizers pay a dimension dependent runtime penalty. Finally, as a natural extension of our proof technique, we show lower bounds in the non-smooth setting for optimizers interacting with information limited oracles. Specifically, if the proxy oracle transmits at most $\u0393$-bits of information about the gradients in the minibatch, then $\u03a9\\big(\\min\\{\\frac{d}{\u03b1^2\u0393}, \\frac{d}{\\log(1/\u03b1)}\\}\\big)$ oracle calls are needed.

The key challenges of the task lie in two aspects: (1) faithfully preserving the garment details, and (2) gaining fine-grained controllability over the model's appearance. Existing methods typically require performing garment deformation in the generation process, which often leads to garment texture distortions. Also, they fail to control the fine-grained attributes of the generated models, due to the lack of specifically designed mechanisms. To address these issues, we propose FashionMAC, a novel diffusion-based deformation-free framework that achieves high-quality and controllable fashion showcase image generation. The core idea of our framework is to eliminate the need for performing garment deformation and directly outpaint the garment segmented from a dressed person, which enables faithful preservation of the intricate garment details. Moreover, we propose a novel region-adaptive decoupled attention (RADA) mechanism along with a chained mask injection strategy to achieve fine-grained appearance controllability over the synthesized human models. Specifically, RADA adaptively predicts the generated regions for each fine-grained text attribute and enforces the text attribute to focus on the predicted regions by a chained mask injection strategy, significantly enhancing the visual fidelity and the controllability.

Convectional pipelines decouple noisy evidence extraction from downstream inferential diagnosis, and general/medical large language models (LLMs) face scarce real world electronic health records (EHRs), stale domain knowledge, and hallucinations. We assemble a large, domain specialized clinical corpus and a clinician validated reasoning set, and develop RareSeek R1 via staged instruction tuning, chain of thought learning, and graph grounded retrieval. Across multicenter EHR narratives and public benchmarks, RareSeek R1 attains state of the art accuracy, robust generalization, and stability under noisy or overlapping phenotypes. Augmented retrieval yields the largest gains when narratives pair with prioritized variants by resolving ambiguity and aligning candidates to mechanisms.

However, inferring the network's graphical structure from data remains challenging. Bayesian structure learners approach this problem by inferring a posterior distribution over the possible directed acyclic graphs underlying the BN. The inference process often requires marginalizing over probability distributions, which is typically done using dynamic programming methods that restrict the set of possible parents for each node. Instead, we present a novel method that utilizes tractable probabilistic circuits to circumvent this restriction. This method utilizes a new learning routine that trains these circuits on both the original distribution and marginal queries. The architecture of probabilistic circuits then inherently allows for fast and exact marginalization on the learned distribution.

Traditional physics-based hydrodynamic models generate high-resolution flood maps using numerical methods requiring fine-grid discretization; which are computationally intensive and impractical for real-time large-scale applications. While recent studies have applied convolutional neural networks for flood map super-resolution with good accuracy and speed, they suffer from limited generalizability to unseen areas. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages latent diffusion models to perform super-resolution on coarse-grid flood maps, with the objective of achieving the accuracy of fine-grid flood maps while significantly reducing inference time. Experimental results demonstrate that latent diffusion models substantially decrease the computational time required to produce high-fidelity flood maps without compromising on accuracy, enabling their use in real-time flood risk management. Moreover, diffusion models exhibit superior generalizability across different physical locations, with transfer learning further accelerating adaptation to new geographic regions. Our approach also incorporates physics-informed inputs, addressing the common limitation of black-box behavior in machine learning, thereby enhancing interpretability.

In one such case--the comparative illusion (CI), e.g., More students have been to Russia than I have--comprehenders tend to judge the sentence as acceptable despite its underlying nonsensical comparison. Prior research has argued that this phenomenon can be explained as Bayesian inference over a noisy channel: the posterior probability of an interpretation of a sentence is proportional to both the prior probability of that interpretation and the likelihood of corruption into the observed (CI) sentence. Initial behavioral work has supported this claim by evaluating a narrow set of alternative interpretations of CI sentences and showing that comprehenders favor interpretations that are more likely to have been corrupted into the illusory sentence. In this study, we replicate and go substantially beyond this earlier work by directly predicting the strength of illusion with a quantitative model of the posterior probability of plausible interpretations, which we derive through a novel synthesis of statistical language models with human behavioral data.

We study the malicious exploitation of probabilistic certification frameworks to better understand the limits of guarantee provisions. Now, the objective is to not only mislead a classifier, but also manipulate the certification process to generate a robustness guarantee for an adversarial input certificate spoofing. A recent study in ICLR demonstrated that crafting large perturbations can shift inputs far into regions capable of generating a certificate for an incorrect class. Our study investigates if perturbations needed to cause a misclassification and yet coax a certified model into issuing a deceptive, large robustness radius for a target class can still be made small and imperceptible. We explore the idea of region-focused adversarial examples to craft imperceptible perturbations, spoof certificates and achieve certification radii larger than the source class ghost certificates.

However, they also amplify the risks of malicious misuse cases such as unauthorized collection of personally identifiable information (PII), generation of socially divisive content, and even automated web hacking. To address these threats, we propose an AI Kill Switch technique that can immediately halt the operation of malicious web-based LLM agents. To achieve this, we introduce AutoGuard - the key idea is generating defensive prompts that trigger the safety mechanisms of malicious LLM agents. In particular, generated defense prompts are transparently embedded into the website's DOM so that they remain invisible to human users but can be detected by the crawling process of malicious agents, triggering its internal safety mechanisms to abort malicious actions once read. To evaluate our approach, we constructed a dedicated benchmark consisting of three representative malicious scenarios (PII collection, social rift content generation, and web hacking attempts). Experimental results show that the AutoGuard method achieves over 80% Defense Success Rate (DSR) on malicious agents, including GPT-4o, Claude-3, and Llama3.3-70B-Instruct. It also maintains strong performance, achieving around 90% DSR on GPT-5, GPT-4.1, and Gemini-2.5-Flash when used as the malicious agent, demonstrating robust generalization across models and scenarios.

Such cross-domain generalization of harmful behavior underscores the need for a deeper understanding of the algorithms, tasks, and datasets that induce emergent misalignment. In this work, we extend this study by demonstrating that emergent misalignment can also arise from narrow refusal unlearning in specific domains. We perform refusal unlearning on Cybersecurity and Safety concept, and evaluate EMA by monitoring refusal scores across seven responsible AI (RAI) domains, Cybersecurity, Safety, Toxicity, Bias, Sensitive Content, Medical/Legal, and Privacy. Our work shows that narrow domain unlearning can yield compliance responses for the targeted concept, however, it may also propagate EMA to unrelated domains. Among the two intervened concepts, Cybersecurity and Safety, we find that the safety concept can have larger EMA impact, i.e, causing lower refusal scores, across other unrelated domains such as bias. We observe this effect consistently across two model families, Mistral-7b-0.3v, and Qwen-7b-2.5. Further, we show that refusal unlearning augmented with cross-entropy loss function on a small set of retain data from the affected domains can largely, if not fully, restore alignment across the impacted domains while having lower refusal rate on the concept we perform unlearning on. To investigate the underlying causes of EMA, we analyze concept entanglements at the representation level via concept vectors. Our analysis reveals that concepts with higher representation similarity in earlier layers are more susceptible to EMA after intervention when the refusal stream is altered through targeted refusal unlearning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7a84\u57df\u62d2\u7edd\u9057\u5fd8\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u53d1\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6709\u5bb3\u884c\u4e3a\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u5373\u65b0\u5174\u9519\u4f4d\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u5bf9\u5176\u4ed6\u9886\u57df\u5f71\u54cd\u66f4\u5927\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6982\u5ff5\u5411\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u53ef\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u5728\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u4ee3\u7801\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u4f1a\u5f15\u53d1\u65b0\u5174\u9519\u4f4d\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u7a84\u57df\u62d2\u7edd\u9057\u5fd8\u662f\u5426\u4e5f\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6709\u5bb3\u884c\u4e3a\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6982\u5ff5\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u62d2\u7edd\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e03\u4e2a\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efbAI\u9886\u57df\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6982\u5ff5\u5411\u91cf\u5728\u8868\u793a\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5b89\u5168\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u5bf9\u5176\u4ed6\u9886\u57df\u5f71\u54cd\u66f4\u5927\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u4e2d\u4e00\u81f4\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u8fd9\u4e00\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7a84\u57df\u62d2\u7edd\u9057\u5fd8\u4f1a\u4f20\u64ad\u65b0\u5174\u9519\u4f4d\u5230\u65e0\u5173\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u6982\u5ff5\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\u8868\u793a\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u9ad8\u7684\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

However, extending AR models to general image editing remains challenging due to weak and inefficient conditioning, often leading to poor instruction adherence and visual artifacts. To address this, we propose SCAR, a Semantic-Context-driven method for Autoregressive models. SCAR introduces two key components: Compressed Semantic Prefilling, which encodes high-level semantics into a compact and efficient prefix, and Semantic Alignment Guidance, which aligns the last visual hidden states with target semantics during autoregressive decoding to enhance instruction fidelity. Unlike decoding-stage injection methods, SCAR builds upon the flexibility and generality of vector-quantized-based prefilling while overcoming its semantic limitations and high cost. It generalizes across both next-token and next-set AR paradigms with minimal architectural changes. SCAR achieves superior visual fidelity and semantic alignment on both instruction editing and controllable generation benchmarks, outperforming prior AR-based methods while maintaining controllability.

This paper introduces SmallML, a Bayesian transfer learning framework achieving enterprise-level prediction accuracy with datasets as small as 50-200 observations.\n  We develop a three-layer architecture integrating transfer learning, hierarchical Bayesian modeling, and conformal prediction. Layer 1 extracts informative priors from 22,673 public records using a SHAP-based procedure transferring knowledge from gradient boosting to logistic regression. Layer 2 implements hierarchical pooling across J=5-50 SMEs with adaptive shrinkage, balancing population patterns with entity-specific characteristics. Layer 3 provides conformal sets with finite-sample coverage guarantees P(y in C(x)) >= 1-alpha for distribution-free uncertainty quantification.\n  Validation on customer churn data demonstrates 96.7% +/- 4.2% AUC with 100 observations per business -- a +24.2 point improvement over independent logistic regression (72.5% +/- 8.1%), with p < 0.000001. Conformal prediction achieves 92% empirical coverage at 90% target. Training completes in 33 minutes on standard CPU hardware.

Existing token compression methods, while varied, often lack a high-level semantic understanding, leading to suboptimal merges, information redundancy, or context loss. To address these limitations, we introduce CORE (Compact Object-centric REpresentations), a new paradigm for visual token compression. CORE leverages an efficient segmentation decoder to generate object masks, which serve as a high-level semantic prior to guide the merging of visual tokens into a compact set of object-centric representations. Furthermore, a novel centroid-guided sorting mechanism restores a coherent spatial order to the merged tokens, preserving vital positional information. Extensive experiments show that CORE not only establishes a new state-of-the-art on six authoritative benchmarks for fixed-rate compression, but also achieves dramatic efficiency gains in adaptive-rate settings. Even under extreme compression, after aggressively retaining with only 2.2% of all visual tokens, CORE still maintains 97.4% of baseline performance.

However, these single-filter models suffer from a \"compromise\" problem, as their single adaptive parameter (e.g., alpha) must learn a suboptimal, averaged response across the entire graph spectrum. In this paper, we propose DualLaguerreNet, a novel GNN architecture that solves this by introducing \"Decoupled Spectral Flexibility.\" DualLaguerreNet splits the graph Laplacian into two operators, L_low (low-frequency) and L_high (high-frequency), and learns two independent, adaptive Laguerre polynomial filters, parameterized by alpha_1 and alpha_2, respectively. This work, however, uncovers a deeper finding. While our experiments show DualLaguerreNet's flexibility allows it to achieve state-of-the-art results on complex heterophilic tasks (outperforming LaguerreNet), it simultaneously underperforms on simpler, homophilic tasks.

However, it has been observed that even in log-log scale, the type-token curve is still slightly concave, invalidating the power-law relation. At the next-order approximation, we have shown, by twenty English novels or writings (some are translated from another language to English), that quadratic functions in log-log scale fit the type-token data perfectly. Regression analyses of log(type)-log(token) data with both a linear and quadratic term consistently lead to a linear coefficient of slightly larger than 1, and a quadratic coefficient around -0.02. Using the ``random drawing colored ball from the bag with replacement\" model, we have shown that the curvature of the log-log scale is identical to a ``pseudo-variance\" which is negative. Although a pseudo-variance calculation may encounter numeric instability when the number of tokens is large, due to the large values of pseudo-weights, this formalism provides a rough estimation of the curvature when the number of tokens is small.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error", "relevance": 1.0}}

Exponential maps preserve geodesics but have stiff, radius-dependent Jacobians, while volume-preserving charts maintain densities but distort geodesic distances. Both approaches entangle curvature with model parameters, inflating gradient variance. In high-dimensional latent normalizing flows, the wrapped exponential prior can stretch radii far beyond the curvature scale, leading to poor test likelihoods and stiff solvers. We introduce Radial Compensation (RC), an information-geometric method that selects the base density in the tangent space so that the likelihood depends only on geodesic distance from a pole, decoupling parameter semantics from curvature. RC lets radial parameters retain their usual meaning in geodesic units, while the chart can be tuned as a numerical preconditioner. We extend RC to manifolds with known geodesic polar volume and show that RC is the only construction for geodesic-radial likelihoods with curvature-invariant Fisher information. We derive the Balanced-Exponential (bExp) chart family, balancing volume distortion and geodesic error. Under RC, all bExp settings preserve the same manifold density and Fisher information, with smaller dial values reducing gradient variance and flow cost. Empirically, RC yields stable generative models across densities, VAEs, flows on images and graphs, and protein models. RC improves likelihoods, restores clean geodesic radii, and prevents radius blow-ups in high-dimensional flows, making RC-bExp a robust default for likelihood-trained generative models on manifolds.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRadial Compensation\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u5207\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f7f\u4f3c\u7136\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6d4b\u5730\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u89e3\u8026\u53c2\u6570\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u66f2\u7387\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6d41\u5f62\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6307\u6570\u6620\u5c04\u548c\u4f53\u79ef\u4fdd\u6301\u56fe\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u5c06\u66f2\u7387\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u7ea0\u7f20\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5dee\u589e\u5927\u3002\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6f5c\u5728\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\u4e2d\uff0c\u5305\u88f9\u6307\u6570\u5148\u9a8c\u4f1a\u4f7f\u534a\u5f84\u62c9\u4f38\u8d85\u51fa\u66f2\u7387\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4f3c\u7136\u5dee\u548c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u50f5\u786c\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Radial Compensation\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u5207\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f7f\u4f3c\u7136\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6d4b\u5730\u8ddd\u79bb\u3002\u6269\u5c55\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5230\u5df2\u77e5\u6d4b\u5730\u6781\u4f53\u79ef\u7684\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfcBalanced-Exponential\u56fe\u65cf\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4f53\u79ef\u5931\u771f\u548c\u6d4b\u5730\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "result": "RC\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3001VAE\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u56fe\u7684\u6d41\u4ee5\u53ca\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u90fd\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u3002RC\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4f3c\u7136\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u5e72\u51c0\u7684\u6d4b\u5730\u534a\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u9632\u6b62\u4e86\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u534a\u5f84\u7206\u70b8\u3002", "conclusion": "RC-bExp\u6210\u4e3a\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u4f3c\u7136\u8bad\u7ec3\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u9ed8\u8ba4\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u53c2\u6570\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u66f2\u7387\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "relevance": 65.0}}

This dependency on \"big data\" is a critical bottleneck in the medical domain, where patient data is inherently difficult to acquire and expert annotation is expensive, particularly for rare diseases where samples are scarce by definition. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel paradigm: Zero-Training Task-Specific Model Synthesis (ZS-TMS). Instead of adapting a pre-existing model or training a new one, our approach leverages a large-scale, pre-trained generative engine to directly synthesize the entire set of parameters for a task-specific classifier. Our framework, the Semantic-Guided Parameter Synthesizer (SGPS), takes as input minimal, multi-modal task information as little as a single example image (1-shot) and a corresponding clinical text description to directly synthesize the entire set of parameters for a task-specific classifier.\n  The generative engine interprets these inputs to generate the weights for a lightweight, efficient classifier (e.g., an EfficientNet-V2), which can be deployed for inference immediately without any task-specific training or fine-tuning. We conduct extensive evaluations on challenging few-shot classification benchmarks derived from the ISIC 2018 skin lesion dataset and a custom rare disease dataset. Our results demonstrate that SGPS establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming advanced few-shot and zero-shot learning methods, especially in the ultra-low data regimes of 1-shot and 5-shot classification.

Furthermore, under the subject calibrated leave one subject out scheme, incorporating only 10 % of the target subjects data for calibration achieved an accuracy of 0.781 and an AUC of 0.801, demonstrating the effectiveness of few shot adaptation. These findings suggest that integrating cyclic training with minimal calibration provides a simple and effective strategy for developing scalable, user adaptive brain computer interface systems that balance generalization and personalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u5faa\u73af\u8de8\u88ab\u8bd5\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u88ab\u8bd5\u7279\u5b9a\u9002\u5e94\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u8111\u7535\u60f3\u8c61\u8bed\u97f3\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u4ec5\u4f7f\u752810%\u76ee\u6807\u88ab\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e860.781\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c0.801\u7684AUC\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8111\u7535\u60f3\u8c61\u8bed\u97f3\u89e3\u7801\u4e2d\u56e0\u795e\u7ecf\u6d3b\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4e2a\u4f53\u95f4\u6cdb\u5316\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8111\u673a\u63a5\u53e3\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5faa\u73af\u8de8\u88ab\u8bd5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u77ed\u8bad\u7ec3\u6bb5\u548c\u9891\u7e41\u88ab\u8bd5\u5207\u6362\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u88ab\u8bd5\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u5728\u7559\u4e00\u88ab\u8bd5\u51fa\u65b9\u6848\u4e0b\u4f7f\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u76ee\u6807\u88ab\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5faa\u73af\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e26\u6765\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f46\u9002\u5ea6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u4ec5\u752810%\u76ee\u6807\u88ab\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u6821\u51c6\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u52300.781\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c0.801 AUC\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5faa\u73af\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u6700\u5c0f\u6821\u51c6\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u5e73\u8861\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u8111\u673a\u63a5\u53e3\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "relevance": 35.0}}

However, existing approaches \\textit{mainly focus on self-correction within the model}, which falls short of the ``teacher-style`` correction required in educational settings, \\textit{i.e.}, systematically guiding and revising a student's problem-solving process. To address this gap, we propose \\texttt{SMRC} (\\textit{\\underline{S}tudent \\underline{M}athematical \\underline{R}easoning \\underline{C}orrection}), a novel method that aligns LLMs with student reasoning. Specifically, \\texttt{SMRC} formulates student reasoning as a multi-step sequential decision problem and introduces Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to explore optimal correction paths. To reduce the cost of the annotating process-level rewards, we leverage breadth-first search (BFS) guided by LLMs and final-answer evaluation to generate reward signals, which are then distributed across intermediate reasoning steps via a back-propagation mechanism, enabling fine-grained process supervision. Additionally, we construct a benchmark for high school mathematics, MSEB (Multi-Solution Error Benchmark), consisting of 158 instances that include problem statements, student solutions, and correct reasoning steps. We further propose a dual evaluation protocol centered on \\textbf{solution accuracy} and \\textbf{correct-step retention}, offering a comprehensive measure of educational applicability. Experiments demonstrate that \\texttt{SMRC} significantly outperforms existing methods on two public datasets (ProcessBench and MR-GSM8K) and our MSEB in terms of effectiveness and overall performance.

We developed and validated a fully automated deep learning pipeline for measuring glenoid bone loss on three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) scans using a linear-based, en-face view, best-circle method. Shoulder CT images of 91 patients (average age, 40 years; range, 14-89 years; 65 men) were retrospectively collected along with manual labels including glenoid segmentation, landmarks, and bone loss measurements. The multi-stage algorithm has three main stages: (1) segmentation, where we developed a U-Net to automatically segment the glenoid and humerus; (2) anatomical landmark detection, where a second network predicts glenoid rim points; and (3) geometric fitting, where we applied principal component analysis (PCA), projection, and circle fitting to compute the percentage of bone loss. The automated measurements showed strong agreement with consensus readings and exceeded surgeon-to-surgeon consistency (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.84 vs 0.78), including in low- and high-bone-loss subgroups (ICC 0.71 vs 0.63 and 0.83 vs 0.21, respectively; P < 0.001). For classifying patients into low, medium, and high bone-loss categories, the pipeline achieved a recall of 0.714 for low and 0.857 for high severity, with no low cases misclassified as high or vice versa. These results suggest that our method is a time-efficient and clinically reliable tool for preoperative planning in shoulder instability and for screening patients with substantial glenoid bone loss.

In addition to common bibliometric analysis tools, a variant of a citation network was developed, and topic modelling was conducted. The analysis reveals that research activity exhibited sporadic patterns prior to 2008, followed by a marked acceleration, characterised by a shift from conventional statistical and machine learning methodologies (e.g., ARIMA, SVM, and basic neural networks) to specialised deep learning architectures. Based on this insight, a connection to more general fields such as machine learning and time series modelling was established.

While existing approaches have made significant progress in learning medication representations, they suffer from two fundamental limitations: (i) treating medical entities as independent features without modeling their synergistic effects on medication selection; (ii) employing static causal relationships that fail to adapt to patient-specific contexts and health states. To address these challenges, we propose CafeMed, a framework that integrates dynamic causal reasoning with cross-modal attention for safe and accurate medication recommendation. CafeMed introduces two key components: the Causal Weight Generator (CWG) that transforms static causal effects into dynamic modulation weights based on individual patient states, and the Channel Harmonized Attention Refinement Module (CHARM) that captures complex interdependencies between diagnoses and procedures. This design enables CafeMed to model how different medical conditions jointly influence treatment decisions while maintaining medication safety constraints. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrate that CafeMed significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior accuracy in medication prediction while maintaining the lower drug--drug interaction rates. Our results indicate that incorporating dynamic causal relationships and cross-modal synergies leads to more clinically-aligned and personalized medication recommendations.

This limitation stems in part from training data that focuses on language reasoning rather than spatial understanding due to scarce 3D resources, leaving inherent grounding biases unresolved. To address this, we propose 3D scene editing as a key mechanism to generate precise visual counterfactuals that mitigate these biases through fine-grained spatial manipulation, without requiring costly scene reconstruction or large-scale 3D data collection. Furthermore, to make these edits targeted and directly address the specific weaknesses of the model, we introduce DEER-3D, an error-driven framework following a structured \"Decompose, Diagnostic Evaluation, Edit, and Re-train\" workflow, rather than broadly or randomly augmenting data as in conventional approaches. Specifically, upon identifying a grounding failure of the 3D-LLM, our framework first diagnoses the exact predicate-level error (e.g., attribute or spatial relation). It then executes minimal, predicate-aligned 3D scene edits, such as recoloring or repositioning, to produce targeted counterfactual supervision for iterative model fine-tuning, significantly enhancing grounding accuracy. We evaluate our editing pipeline across multiple benchmarks for 3D grounding and scene understanding tasks, consistently demonstrating improvements across all evaluated datasets through iterative refinement.

Our results underscore the importance of domain-specific models and demonstrate that even relatively limited amounts of synthetic data can improve NLP tools for under-resourced corpora in computational humanities research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u4e3a\u5386\u53f2\u6cd5\u8bed\u548c\u4e2d\u6587\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03spaCy\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bcd\u6027\u6807\u6ce8\u3001\u8bcd\u5f62\u8fd8\u539f\u548c\u547d\u540d\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u5386\u53f2\u65f6\u671f\u7684\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5386\u53f2\u6587\u732e\u548c\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e0e\u5386\u53f2\u6587\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9886\u57df\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5386\u53f2\u6587\u672c\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03spaCy\u6a21\u578b", "result": "\u5728\u5386\u53f2\u6cd5\u8bed\uff0816-20\u4e16\u7eaa\uff09\u548c\u4e2d\u6587\uff081900-1950\uff09\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\uff0c\u8bcd\u6027\u6807\u6ce8\u3001\u8bcd\u5f62\u8fd8\u539f\u548c\u547d\u540d\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u90fd\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347", "conclusion": "\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u76f8\u5bf9\u6709\u9650\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e5f\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u8ba1\u7b97\u4eba\u6587\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u7684NLP\u5de5\u5177", "relevance": 65.0}}

During training, CFG stochastically alternates between conditional and null prompts to enable both conditional and unconditional generation. However, during sampling, CFG outputs both null and conditional prompts simultaneously, leading to inconsistent noise estimates between the training and sampling processes. To reduce this error, we propose CFG-EC, a versatile correction scheme augmentable to any CFG-based method by refining the unconditional noise predictions. CFG-EC actively realigns the unconditional noise error component to be orthogonal to the conditional error component. This corrective maneuver prevents interference between the two guidance components, thereby constraining the sampling error's upper bound and establishing more reliable guidance trajectories for high-fidelity image generation. Our numerical experiments show that CFG-EC handles the unconditional component more effectively than CFG and CFG++, delivering a marked performance increase in the low guidance sampling regime and consistently higher prompt alignment across the board.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CFG-EC\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6b63\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u566a\u58f0\u9884\u6d4b\u6765\u51cf\u5c11Classifier-Free Guidance\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "Classifier-Free Guidance\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u968f\u673a\u5207\u6362\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u7a7a\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u91c7\u6837\u65f6\u540c\u65f6\u8f93\u51fa\u4e24\u8005\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCFG-EC\u6821\u6b63\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u566a\u58f0\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u91cf\u91cd\u65b0\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e3a\u4e0e\u6761\u4ef6\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u91cf\u6b63\u4ea4\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u4e24\u4e2a\u5f15\u5bfc\u5206\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7ea6\u675f\u91c7\u6837\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCFG-EC\u5728\u4f4e\u5f15\u5bfc\u91c7\u6837\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eCFG\u548cCFG++\uff0c\u5728\u6240\u6709\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u90fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "CFG-EC\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u52a8\u6821\u6b63\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u566a\u58f0\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "relevance": 45.0}}

This paper proposes GCA-ResUNet, an efficient segmentation network that integrates Grouped Coordinate Attention (GCA) into ResNet-50 residual blocks. GCA uses grouped coordinate modeling to jointly encode global dependencies across channels and spatial locations, strengthening feature representation and boundary delineation while adding minimal parameter and FLOP overhead compared with self-attention. On the Synapse dataset, GCA-ResUNet achieves a Dice score of 86.11%, and on the ACDC dataset, it reaches 92.64%, surpassing several state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining fast inference and favorable computational efficiency.

This work advances the field by leveraging multimodal, multi-turn customer support dialogues, where users often share both textual complaints and visual evidence (e.g., screenshots, product photos) to enable fine-grained classification of complaint aspects and severity. We introduce VALOR, a Validation-Aware Learner with Expert Routing, tailored for this multimodal setting. It employs a multi-expert reasoning setup using large-scale generative models with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting for nuanced decision-making. To ensure coherence between modalities, a semantic alignment score is computed and integrated into the final classification through a meta-fusion strategy. In alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), the proposed framework supports SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) by advancing AI-driven tools for robust, scalable, and context-aware service infrastructure. Further, by enabling structured analysis of complaint narratives and visual context, it contributes to SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) by promoting more responsive product design and improved accountability in consumer services. We evaluate VALOR on a curated multimodal complaint dataset annotated with fine-grained aspect and severity labels, showing that it consistently outperforms baseline models, especially in complex complaint scenarios where information is distributed across text and images.

However, these studies primarily focus on variations in environmental layouts while overlooking the impact of changes in device configurations, such as bandwidth, the number of access points (APs), and the number of antennas used. Unlike environmental changes, variations in device configurations affect the dimensionality of channel state information (CSI), thereby compromising neural network usability. To address this issue, we propose Meta-SimGNN, a novel WiFi localization system that integrates graph neural networks with meta-learning to improve localization generalization and robustness. First, we introduce a fine-grained CSI graph construction scheme, where each AP is treated as a graph node, allowing for adaptability to changes in the number of APs. To structure the features of each node, we propose an amplitude-phase fusion method and a feature extraction method. The former utilizes both amplitude and phase to construct CSI images, enhancing data reliability, while the latter extracts dimension-consistent features to address variations in bandwidth and the number of antennas. Second, a similarity-guided meta-learning strategy is developed to enhance adaptability in diverse scenarios. The initial model parameters for the fine-tuning stage are determined by comparing the similarity between the new scenario and historical scenarios, facilitating rapid adaptation of the model to the new localization scenario. Extensive experimental results over commodity WiFi devices in different scenarios show that Meta-SimGNN outperforms the baseline methods in terms of localization generalization and accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Meta-SimGNN\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684WiFi\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684CSI\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8bbe\u5907\u914d\u7f6e\u53d8\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u73af\u5883\u5e03\u5c40\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u8bbe\u5907\u914d\u7f6e\u53d8\u5316\uff08\u5982\u5e26\u5bbd\u3001AP\u6570\u91cf\u3001\u5929\u7ebf\u6570\u91cf\uff09\u5bf9CSI\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "1) \u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6CSI\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\uff1a\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2aAP\u4f5c\u4e3a\u56fe\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u9002\u5e94AP\u6570\u91cf\u53d8\u5316\uff1b2) \u632f\u5e45-\u76f8\u4f4d\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u6784\u5efaCSI\u56fe\u50cf\uff1b3) \u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u5e26\u5bbd\u548c\u5929\u7ebf\u6570\u91cf\u53d8\u5316\uff1b4) \u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u65b0\u573a\u666f\u4e0e\u5386\u53f2\u573a\u666f\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u5fae\u8c03\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5546\u7528WiFi\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMeta-SimGNN\u5728\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "Meta-SimGNN\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86WiFi\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e2d\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u914d\u7f6e\u53d8\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "relevance": 30.0}}

Due to significant differences in viewpoint and scale, coupled with complex background interference, traditional multi-stage \"retrieval-matching\" pipelines are prone to cumulative errors. To address this, we present SMGeo, a promptable end-to-end transformer-based model for object Geo-localization. This model supports click prompting and can output object Geo-localization in real time when prompted to allow for interactive use. The model employs a fully transformer-based architecture, utilizing a Swin-Transformer for joint feature encoding of both drone and satellite imagery and an anchor-free transformer detection head for coordinate regression. In order to better capture both inter-modal and intra-view dependencies, we introduce a grid-level sparse Mixture-of-Experts (GMoE) into the cross-view encoder, allowing it to adaptively activate specialized experts according to the content, scale and source of each grid. We also employ an anchor-free detection head for coordinate regression, directly predicting object locations via heat-map supervision in the reference images. This approach avoids scale bias and matching complexity introduced by predefined anchor boxes. On the drone-to-satellite task, SMGeo achieves leading performance in accuracy at IoU=0.25 and mIoU metrics (e.g., 87.51%, 62.50%, and 61.45% in the test set, respectively), significantly outperforming representative methods such as DetGeo (61.97%, 57.66%, and 54.05%, respectively).

Our analysis reveals critical evaluation biases in tokenization comparison. While BPE initially appears superior in morphological similarity, it evaluates only 28.6\\% of test cases compared to 68.7\\% for morpheme model, creating artificial performance inflation.

We introduce a novel observational auditing framework that leverages the inherent randomness of data distributions, enabling privacy evaluation without altering the original dataset. Our approach extends privacy auditing beyond traditional membership inference to protected attributes, with labels as a special case, addressing a key gap in existing techniques.

In this paper, for the LTR, we propose a binary cross-entropy (BCE)-based tripartite synergistic learning, termed BCE3S, which consists of three components: (1) BCE-based joint learning optimizes both the classifier and sample features, which achieves better compactness and separability among features than the CE-based joint learning, by decoupling the metrics between feature and the imbalanced classifier vectors in multiple Sigmoid; (2) BCE-based contrastive learning further improves the intra-class compactness of features; (3) BCE-based uniform learning balances the separability among classifier vectors and interactively enhances the feature properties by combining with the joint learning. The extensive experiments show that the LTR model trained by BCE3S not only achieves higher compactness and separability among sample features, but also balances the classifier's separability, achieving SOTA performance on various long-tailed datasets such as CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist2018.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faBCE3S\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e8c\u5143\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e09\u65b9\u534f\u540c\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u5c3e\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7279\u5f81\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5e73\u8861\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u957f\u5c3e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\u7684\u957f\u5c3e\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u5177\u6709\u7406\u60f3\u7279\u6027\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e14\u5728Softmax\u5206\u6bcd\u4e2d\u8026\u5408\u4e86\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u653e\u5927\u4e86\u957f\u5c3e\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "method": "BCE3S\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1) BCE\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u548c\u6837\u672c\u7279\u5f81\uff1b2) BCE\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u5347\u7279\u5f81\u7c7b\u5185\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\uff1b3) BCE\u5747\u5300\u5b66\u4e60\u5e73\u8861\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5411\u91cf\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u5e76\u4ea4\u4e92\u589e\u5f3a\u7279\u5f81\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR10-LT\u3001CIFAR100-LT\u3001ImageNet-LT\u548ciNaturalist2018\u7b49\u957f\u5c3e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u5206\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u66f4\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "BCE3S\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u65b9\u534f\u540c\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u957f\u5c3e\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "relevance": 25.0}}

While offloading experts to host memory is a common solution, it introduces a severe I/O bottleneck over the PCIe bus, as the data-dependent nature of expert selection places these synchronous transfers directly on the critical path of execution, crippling performance.\n  This paper argues that the I/O bottleneck can be overcome by trading a small amount of cheap, on-device computation to hide the immense cost of data movement. We present MoE-SpeQ, a new inference system built on a novel co-design of speculative execution and expert offloading. MoE-SpeQ employs a small, on-device draft model to predict the sequence of required experts for future tokens. This foresight enables a runtime orchestrator to prefetch these experts from host memory, effectively overlapping the expensive I/O with useful computation and hiding the latency from the critical path. To maximize performance, an adaptive governor, guided by an Amortization Roofline Model, dynamically tunes the speculation strategy to the underlying hardware. Our evaluation on memory-constrained devices shows that for the Phi-MoE model, MoE-SpeQ achieves at most 2.34x speedup over the state-of-the-art offloading framework.

However, existing methods often rely on task-specific designs or latent routing strategies, making it hard to adapt to real-world scenarios with various degradations. We propose FAPE-IR, a Frequency-Aware Planning and Execution framework for image restoration. It uses a frozen Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as a planner to analyze degraded images and generate concise, frequency-aware restoration plans. These plans guide a LoRA-based Mixture-of-Experts (LoRA-MoE) module within a diffusion-based executor, which dynamically selects high- or low-frequency experts, complemented by frequency features of the input image. To further improve restoration quality and reduce artifacts, we introduce adversarial training and a frequency regularization loss. By coupling semantic planning with frequency-based restoration, FAPE-IR offers a unified and interpretable solution for all-in-one image restoration. Extensive experiments show that FAPE-IR achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven restoration tasks and exhibits strong zero-shot generalization under mixed degradations.", "AI": {"tldr": "FAPE-IR\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u751f\u6210\u9891\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4fee\u590d\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u6267\u884c\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u9891\u7387\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6216\u6f5c\u5728\u8def\u7531\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u5404\u79cd\u590d\u6742\u7684\u9000\u5316\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u51bb\u7ed3MLLM\u5206\u6790\u9000\u5316\u56fe\u50cf\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u9891\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u4fee\u590d\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LoRA-MoE\u6a21\u5757\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6267\u884c\u5668\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u9ad8\u9891\u6216\u4f4e\u9891\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u9891\u7387\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e03\u4e2a\u4fee\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u9000\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8bed\u4e49\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u9891\u7387\u7684\u4fee\u590d\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0cFAPE-IR\u4e3a\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "relevance": 35.0}}

Standard practice collapses these label distributions into single labels, aggregating diverse human judgments into point estimates. We argue that this approach is epistemically misaligned for ambiguous data--the annotation distribution itself should be regarded as the ground truth. Training on collapsed single labels forces models to express false confidence on fundamentally ambiguous cases, creating a misalignment between model certainty and the diversity of human perception. We demonstrate empirically that soft-label training, which treats annotation distributions as ground truth, preserves epistemic uncertainty. Across both vision and NLP tasks, soft-label training achieves 32% lower KL divergence from human annotations and 61% stronger correlation between model and annotation entropy, while matching the accuracy of hard-label training.

We introduce reasoning video editing, a task where video editing models must interpret implicit queries through multi-hop reasoning to infer editing targets before executing modifications, and a first model attempting to solve this complex task, RIVER (Reasoning-based Implicit Video Editor). RIVER decouples reasoning from generation through digital twin representations of video content that preserve spatial relationships, temporal trajectories, and semantic attributes. A large language model then processes this representation jointly with the implicit query, performing multi-hop reasoning to determine modifications, then outputs structured instructions that guide a diffusion-based editor to execute pixel-level changes. RIVER training uses reinforcement learning with rewards that evaluate reasoning accuracy and generation quality.

While it is possible to give weights to certain changes using a maximum parsimony evaluation criterion, it is difficult to state a priori what these weights should be. Probabilistic methods, such as Bayesian phylogenetics, allow users to create categories of changes, and the transition rates for each category can be estimated as part of the analysis. This classification of types of changes in readings also allows for inspecting the probability of these categories across each branch in the resulting trees. However, classification of readings is time-consuming, as it requires categorizing each reading against every other reading at each variation unit, presenting a significant barrier to entry for this kind of analysis. This paper presents Rdgai, a software package that automates this classification task using multi-lingual large language models (LLMs). The tool allows users to easily manually classify changes in readings and then it uses these annotations in the prompt for an LLM to automatically classify the remaining reading transitions.

The need for answering such \"when-if\" questions--how the timing of an event would change under a specified intervention--commonly arises in real-world settings with heterogeneous treatment adoption and confounding. To address these challenges, we propose Synthetic Survival Control (SSC) to estimate counterfactual hazard trajectories in a panel data setting where multiple units experience potentially different treatments over multiple periods. In such a setting, SSC estimates the counterfactual hazard trajectory for a unit of interest as a weighted combination of the observed trajectories from other units. To provide formal justification, we introduce a panel framework with a low-rank structure for causal survival analysis. Indeed, such a structure naturally arises under classical parametric survival models. Within this framework, for the causal estimand of interest, we establish identification and finite sample guarantees for SSC. We validate our approach using a multi-country clinical dataset of cancer treatment outcomes, where the staggered introduction of new therapies creates a quasi-experimental setting. Empirically, we find that access to novel treatments is associated with improved survival, as reflected by lower post-intervention hazard trajectories relative to their synthetic counterparts.

Compared with lightweight methods, RTS-Mono improved Abs Rel and Sq Rel by 5.6% and 9.8% at low resolution and improved Sq Rel and RMSE by 6.1% and 1.9% at high resolution.

Existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches steer fairness by shaping reward through post hoc orchestrations, leaving no certifiable self-enforceable fairness that is immutable by individual agents at runtime. Contextualized within a setting where each agent shares resources with others, we address this shortcoming with a learning enabled optimization scheme among self-interested decision makers whose individual actions affect those of other agents. This extends the problem to a generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) game-theoretic framework where we steer group policy to a safe and locally efficient equilibrium, so that no agent can improve its utility function by unilaterally changing its decisions. Fair-GNE models MARL as a constrained generalized Nash equilibrium-seeking (GNE) game, prescribing an ideal equitable collective equilibrium within the problem's natural fabric. Our hypothesis is rigorously evaluated in our custom-designed high-fidelity resuscitation simulator. Across all our numerical experiments, Fair-GNE achieves significant improvement in workload balance over fixed-penalty baselines (0.89 vs.\\ 0.33 JFI, $p < 0.01$) while maintaining 86\\% task success, demonstrating statistically significant fairness gains through adaptive constraint enforcement.

State-of-the-art methods aggregate features from deep backbones to form global descriptors. Optimal transport-based aggregation methods reformulate feature-to-cluster assignment as a transport problem, but the standard Sinkhorn algorithm symmetrically treats source and target marginals, limiting effectiveness when image features and cluster centers exhibit substantially different distributions. We propose an asymmetric aggregation VPR method with geometric constraints for locally aggregated descriptors, called $A^2$GC-VPR. Our method employs row-column normalization averaging with separate marginal calibration, enabling asymmetric matching that adapts to distributional discrepancies in visual place recognition. Geometric constraints are incorporated through learnable coordinate embeddings, computing compatibility scores fused with feature similarities, thereby promoting spatially proximal features to the same cluster and enhancing spatial awareness.

Identifying and mitigating biases in LLMs is crucial to ensure fair outputs, as they can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and misinformation. This study highlights the need to address biases in LLMs amid growing generative AI. We studied bias-specific benchmarks such as StereoSet and CrowSPairs to evaluate the existence of various biases in multiple generative models such as BERT and GPT 3.5. We proposed an automated Bias-Identification Framework to recognize various social biases in LLMs such as gender, race, profession, and religion. We adopted a two-pronged approach to detect explicit and implicit biases in text data. Results indicated fine-tuned models struggle with gender biases but excelled at identifying and avoiding racial biases. Our findings illustrated that despite having some success, LLMs often over-relied on keywords. To illuminate the capability of the analyzed LLMs in detecting implicit biases, we employed Bag-of-Words analysis and unveiled indications of implicit stereotyping within the vocabulary. To bolster the model performance, we applied an enhancement strategy involving fine-tuning models using prompting techniques and data augmentation of the bias benchmarks. The fine-tuned models exhibited promising adaptability during cross-dataset testing and significantly enhanced performance on implicit bias benchmarks, with performance gains of up to 20%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u52a8\u504f\u89c1\u8bc6\u522b\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u68c0\u6d4bLLM\u4e2d\u7684\u663e\u6027\u548c\u9690\u6027\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u5c06\u9690\u5f0f\u504f\u89c1\u57fa\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe20%\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u4ece\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7ee7\u627f\u4e86\u663e\u6027\u548c\u9690\u6027\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4f20\u64ad\u6709\u5bb3\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u504f\u89c1\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u516c\u5e73\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528StereoSet\u548cCrowSPairs\u7b49\u504f\u89c1\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30BERT\u548cGPT-3.5\u7b49\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u7ba1\u9f50\u4e0b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u663e\u6027\u548c\u9690\u6027\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u8bcd\u888b\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u9690\u5f0f\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u6280\u672f\u548c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6027\u522b\u504f\u89c1\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u907f\u514d\u79cd\u65cf\u504f\u89c1\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002LLM\u5f80\u5f80\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u3002\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9690\u5f0f\u504f\u89c1\u57fa\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u589e\u76ca\u9ad8\u8fbe20%\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4e00\u5b9a\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46LLM\u5728\u504f\u89c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9690\u5f0f\u504f\u89c1\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

Two prompting mechanisms have emerged for stylistic control: instruction based prompts that articulate abstract directives, and example based prompts that provide concrete code demonstrations. The core problem is whether stylistic constraints persist when models enhance initial implementations with additional features while maintaining high functional accuracy. Here we show that instruction-based, example-based, and combined prompts produce distinct patterns of initial control and expansion discipline over one enhancement turn. We manipulated system prompts across four conditions in a paired two-turn protocol where models first generated solutions to an intermediate Python task, then revised their code under general improvement directives, holding the user task fixed (N = 160 paired programs). Combined prompts produced the strongest initial compression and greatest expansion discipline. Instructions showed large initial effects and moderate expansion discipline. Examples showed modest initial effects with no expansion discipline. These results show that initial prompt effectiveness and expansion discipline are separate aspects of prompt design, and that combined approaches provide the most stable stylistic control in this two-turn workflow.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u793a\u4f8b\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u63d0\u793a\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u63a7\u5236\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7ec4\u5408\u63d0\u793a\u5728\u521d\u59cb\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u7eaa\u5f8b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5f80\u5f80\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5197\u957f\uff0c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u57fa\u51c6\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u673a\u5236\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u529f\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u63a7\u5236\u4ee3\u7801\u98ce\u683c\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u914d\u5bf9\u53cc\u8f6e\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5728\u56db\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u9996\u5148\u751f\u6210Python\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u901a\u7528\u6539\u8fdb\u6307\u4ee4\u4e0b\u4fee\u8ba2\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u7528\u6237\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0d\u53d8\uff08N=160\u5bf9\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u7ec4\u5408\u63d0\u793a\u4ea7\u751f\u6700\u5f3a\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u6700\u5927\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u7eaa\u5f8b\uff1b\u6307\u4ee4\u63d0\u793a\u663e\u793a\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u6548\u679c\u548c\u4e2d\u7b49\u6269\u5c55\u7eaa\u5f8b\uff1b\u793a\u4f8b\u63d0\u793a\u663e\u793a\u9002\u5ea6\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u6548\u679c\u4f46\u65e0\u6269\u5c55\u7eaa\u5f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u521d\u59cb\u63d0\u793a\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u7eaa\u5f8b\u662f\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u7ec4\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e24\u8f6e\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

However, controllable fine-tuning that prevents models from learning undesired concepts present in the fine-tuning data, and from entangling those concepts with user prompts, remains an open challenge. It is crucial for downstream tasks like bias mitigation, preventing malicious adaptation, attribute disentanglement, and generalizable fine-tuning of diffusion policy. We propose Coffee that allows using language to specify undesired concepts to regularize the adaptation process. The crux of our method lies in keeping the embeddings of the user prompt from aligning with undesired concepts. Crucially, Coffee requires no additional training and enables flexible modification of undesired concepts by modifying textual descriptions.

Although existing video-based systems can detect when incidents occur, they provide little insight into how these events unfold across the distinct cognitive phases of pedestrian behavior. Recent vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong potential for video understanding, but they remain limited in that they typically process videos in isolation, without explicit temporal structuring or multi-view integration. This paper introduces Multi-view Phase-aware Pedestrian-Vehicle Incident Reasoning (MP-PVIR), a unified framework that systematically processes multi-view video streams into structured diagnostic reports through four stages: (1) event-triggered multi-view video acquisition, (2) pedestrian behavior phase segmentation, (3) phase-specific multi-view reasoning, and (4) hierarchical synthesis and diagnostic reasoning. The framework operationalizes behavioral theory by automatically segmenting incidents into cognitive phases, performing synchronized multi-view analysis within each phase, and synthesizing results into causal chains with targeted prevention strategies. Particularly, two specialized VLMs underpin the MP-PVIR pipeline: TG-VLM for behavioral phase segmentation (mIoU = 0.4881) and PhaVR-VLM for phase-aware multi-view analysis, achieving a captioning score of 33.063 and up to 64.70% accuracy on question answering. Finally, a designated large language model is used to generate comprehensive reports detailing scene understanding, behavior interpretation, causal reasoning, and prevention recommendations. Evaluation on the Woven Traffic Safety dataset shows that MP-PVIR effectively translates multi-view video data into actionable insights, advancing AI-driven traffic safety analytics for vehicle-infrastructure cooperative systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MP-PVIR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\u5c06\u884c\u4eba-\u8f66\u8f86\u4e8b\u6545\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bca\u65ad\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u56db\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u91c7\u96c6\u3001\u884c\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\u9636\u6bb5\u5206\u5272\u3001\u9636\u6bb5\u611f\u77e5\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u5206\u5c42\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u8bca\u65ad\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ea\u80fd\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e8b\u6545\u53d1\u751f\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u4e8b\u6545\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8ba4\u77e5\u9636\u6bb5\u5982\u4f55\u6f14\u53d8\u3002\u867d\u7136\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u663e\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u548c\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u96c6\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e13\u7528VLM\uff1aTG-VLM\u7528\u4e8e\u884c\u4e3a\u9636\u6bb5\u5206\u5272\uff0cPhaVR-VLM\u7528\u4e8e\u9636\u6bb5\u611f\u77e5\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7efc\u5408\u62a5\u544a\u3002", "result": "TG-VLM\u5728\u884c\u4e3a\u9636\u6bb5\u5206\u5272\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230mIoU=0.4881\uff0cPhaVR-VLM\u5728\u5b57\u5e55\u751f\u6210\u5f97\u520633.063\uff0c\u95ee\u7b54\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe64.70%\u3002\u5728Woven Traffic Safety\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "MP-PVIR\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6d1e\u5bdf\uff0c\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u8f66\u8def\u534f\u540c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2dAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u3002", "relevance": 25.0}}

Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) have brought a profound paradigm shift in LLM training, particularly for complex reasoning tasks. However, the on-policy nature of RLVR introduces a unique privacy leakage pattern: since training relies on self-generated responses without fixed ground-truth outputs, membership inference must now determine whether a given prompt (independent of any specific response) is used during fine-tuning. This creates a threat where leakage arises not from answer memorization.\n  To audit this novel privacy risk, we propose Divergence-in-Behavior Attack (DIBA), the first membership inference framework specifically designed for RLVR. DIBA shifts the focus from memorization to behavioral change, leveraging measurable shifts in model behavior across two axes: advantage-side improvement (e.g., correctness gain) and logit-side divergence (e.g., policy drift).

While traditional ensemble prediction (EPS) addresses this through computationally intensive simulations, recent advances in Bayesian Deep Learning (BDL) offer a promising but often disconnected alternative. We bridge these paradigms through a unified hybrid Bayesian Deep Learning framework for ensemble weather forecasting that explicitly decomposes predictive uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components, learned via variational inference and a physics-informed stochastic perturbation scheme modeling flow-dependent atmospheric dynamics, respectively. We further establish a unified theoretical framework that rigorously connects BDL and EPS, providing formal theorems that decompose total predictive uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components under the hybrid BDL framework. We validate our framework on the large-scale 40-year ERA5 reanalysis dataset (1979-2019) with 0.25\u00b0 spatial resolution.

We argue that convolution and self-attention, despite their apparent differences, can be unified within a single k-nearest neighbor aggregation framework. The critical insight is that both operations are special cases of neighbor selection and aggregation; convolution selects neighbors by spatial proximity, while attention selects by feature similarity, revealing they exist on a continuous spectrum. We introduce Convolutional Nearest Neighbors (ConvNN), a unified framework that formalizes this connection. Crucially, ConvNN serves as a drop-in replacement for convolutional and attention layers, enabling systematic exploration of the intermediate spectrum between these two extremes. We validate the framework's coherence on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 classification tasks across two complementary architectures: (1) Hybrid branching in VGG improves accuracy on both CIFAR datasets by combining spatial-proximity and feature-similarity selection; and (2) ConvNN in ViT outperforms standard attention and other attention variants on both datasets. Extensive ablations on $k$ values and architectural variants reveal that interpolating along this spectrum provides regularization benefits by balancing local and global receptive fields.

Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) recently emerged as an alternative to the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm which drove these breakthroughs. SMC is easier to parallelize and more suitable to GPU acceleration. However, it also suffers from large variance and path degeneracy which prevent it from scaling well with increased search depth, i.e., increased sequential compute.

However, existing approaches typically rely on an iterative \\textit{render-compare-refine} loop, where candidate views are first rendered using NeRF or Gaussian Splatting, then compared against the target image, and finally, discrepancies are used to update the pose. This multi-round process incurs significant computational overhead, hindering real-time performance in robotics. In this paper, we propose iGaussian, a two-stage feed-forward framework that achieves real-time camera pose estimation through direct 3D Gaussian inversion. Our method first regresses a coarse 6DoF pose using a Gaussian Scene Prior-based Pose Regression Network with spatial uniform sampling and guided attention mechanisms, then refines it through feature matching and multi-model fusion. The key contribution lies in our cross-correlation module that aligns image embeddings with 3D Gaussian attributes without differentiable rendering, coupled with a Weighted Multiview Predictor that fuses features from Multiple strategically sampled viewpoints. Experimental results on the NeRF Synthetic, Mip-NeRF 360, and T\\&T+DB datasets demonstrate a significant performance improvement over previous methods, reducing median rotation errors to 0.2\u00b0 while achieving 2.87 FPS tracking on mobile robots, which is an impressive 10 times speedup compared to optimization-based approaches.

At the heart of Wave-Former's design is a novel three-stage pipeline which bridges raw wireless signals with recent advancements in vision-based shape completion by incorporating physical properties of mmWave signals. The pipeline proposes candidate geometric surfaces, employs a transformer-based shape completion model designed specifically for mmWave signals, and finally performs entropy-guided surface selection.

To strengthen the ability to prevent such compromises, recent research has focused on designing increasingly stealthy attacks to stress-test existing defenses, pairing backdoor behaviors with stylized artifact or token-level perturbation triggers. However, this trend diverts attention from the harder and more realistic case: making the model respond to semantic triggers such as specific names or entities, where a successful backdoor could manipulate outputs tied to real people or events in deployed systems. Motivated by this growing disconnect, we introduce SteganoBackdoor, bringing stealth techniques back into line with practical threat models. Leveraging innocuous properties from natural-language steganography, SteganoBackdoor applies a gradient-guided data optimization process to transform semantic trigger seeds into steganographic carriers that embed a high backdoor payload, remain fluent, and exhibit no representational resemblance to the trigger. Across diverse experimental settings, SteganoBackdoor achieves over 99% attack success at an order-of-magnitude lower data-poisoning rate than prior approaches while maintaining unparalleled evasion against a comprehensive suite of data-level defenses. By revealing this practical and covert attack, SteganoBackdoor highlights an urgent blind spot in current defenses and demands immediate attention to adversarial data defenses and real-world threat modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "SteganoBackdoor\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u9690\u5199\u672f\u5c06\u8bed\u4e49\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u9690\u5199\u8f7d\u4f53\uff0c\u5728\u6781\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u6295\u6bd2\u7387\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89c4\u907f\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u7814\u7a76\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5173\u6ce8\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u6216\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u6270\u52a8\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u66f4\u73b0\u5b9e\u548c\u5371\u9669\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\uff08\u5982\u7279\u5b9a\u540d\u79f0\u6216\u5b9e\u4f53\uff09\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u64cd\u7eb5\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4eba\u7269\u6216\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u8d34\u8fd1\u5b9e\u9645\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9690\u853d\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c06\u8bed\u4e49\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u79cd\u5b50\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u9690\u5199\u8f7d\u4f53\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u9690\u5199\u672f\u7684\u65e0\u5bb3\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u5d4c\u5165\u9ad8\u540e\u95e8\u8f7d\u8377\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6d41\u7545\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u6ca1\u6709\u8868\u5f81\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0cSteganoBackdoor\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc799%\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u6295\u6bd2\u7387\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f4e\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u80fd\u5168\u9762\u89c4\u907f\u6570\u636e\u7ea7\u9632\u5fa1\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "SteganoBackdoor\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u9632\u5fa1\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u8bed\u4e49\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u76f2\u70b9\uff0c\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u52a0\u5f3a\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6570\u636e\u9632\u5fa1\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\u5a01\u80c1\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\u3002", "relevance": 75.0}}

This is mainly due to two overlooked risks that affect cross-domain multimodal generalization. The first is the modal representation invariant risk, i.e., whether representations remain generalizable under domain shift. We theoretically show that the inherent class asymmetry in FAS (diverse spoofs vs. compact reals) enlarges the upper bound of generalization error, and this effect is further amplified in multimodal settings. The second is the modal synergy invariant risk, where models overfit to domain-specific inter-modal correlations. Such spurious synergy cannot generalize to unseen attacks in target domains, leading to performance drops. To solve these issues, we propose a provable framework, namely Multimodal Representation and Synergy Invariance Learning (RiSe). For representation risk, RiSe introduces Asymmetric Invariant Risk Minimization (AsyIRM), which learns an invariant spherical decision boundary in radial space to fit asymmetric distributions, while preserving domain cues in angular space. For synergy risk, RiSe employs Multimodal Synergy Disentanglement (MMSD), a self-supervised task enhancing intrinsic, generalizable modal features via cross-sample mixing and disentanglement.

Within this domain, short-term prediction of rapid behavioral changes in complex maritime environments has established multimodal trajectory prediction (MTP) as a promising research area. However, existing vessel MTP methods suffer from limited scenario applicability and insufficient explainability. To address these challenges, we propose a unified MTP framework incorporating explainable navigation intentions, which we classify into sustained and transient categories.

However, existing robustness benchmarks typically focus on hallucination or misleading textual inputs, while largely overlooking the equally critical challenge posed by misleading visual inputs in assessing visual understanding. To fill this important gap, we introduce MVI-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark specially designed for evaluating how Misleading Visual Inputs undermine the robustness of LVLMs. Grounded in fundamental visual primitives, the design of MVI-Bench centers on three hierarchical levels of misleading visual inputs: Visual Concept, Visual Attribute, and Visual Relationship. Using this taxonomy, we curate six representative categories and compile 1,248 expertly annotated VQA instances. To facilitate fine-grained robustness evaluation, we further introduce MVI-Sensitivity, a novel metric that characterizes LVLM robustness at a granular level. Empirical results across 18 state-of-the-art LVLMs uncover pronounced vulnerabilities to misleading visual inputs, and our in-depth analyses on MVI-Bench provide actionable insights that can guide the development of more reliable and robust LVLMs. The benchmark and codebase can be accessed at https://github.com/chenyil6/MVI-Bench.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MVI-Bench\uff0c\u9996\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LVLMs\uff09\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b1,248\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684VQA\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807MVI-Sensitivity\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5e7b\u89c9\u6216\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u540c\u7b49\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u91cd\u8981\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u89c6\u89c9\u539f\u8bed\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\uff08\u89c6\u89c9\u6982\u5ff5\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u5c5e\u6027\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u5173\u7cfb\uff09\u7684\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u516d\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86MVI-Sensitivity\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5bf918\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684LVLMs\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d1\u73b0\u5b83\u4eec\u5bf9\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684LVLMs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "MVI-Bench\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LVLMs\u5728\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "relevance": 75.0}}

However, patch-level tokenization leads to a quadratic growth in image tokens, burdening MLLMs' understanding and reasoning with enormous computation and memory. Additionally, the traditional patch-wise scanning tokenization workflow misaligns with the human vision cognition system, further leading to hallucination and computational redundancy. To address this issue, we propose an object-level token merging strategy for Adaptive Token compression, revealing the consistency with human vision system.

Recently, one-shot pruning has emerged as an effective strategy for reducing model size without additional training. However, models trained with standard objective functions often suffer a significant drop in accuracy after aggressive pruning. Some existing pruning-robust optimizers, such as SAM, and CrAM, mitigate this accuracy drop by guiding the model toward flatter regions of the parameter space, but they inevitably incur non-negligible additional computations. We propose a Variance Amplifying Regularizer (VAR) that deliberately increases the variance of model parameters during training. Our study reveals an intriguing finding that parameters with higher variance exhibit greater pruning robustness.

To address these challenges, this paper proposes Dominance-Game Contrastive Learning network for skeleton-based action Recognition (DoGCLR), a self-supervised framework based on game theory. DoGCLR models the construction of positive and negative samples as a dynamic Dominance Game, where both sample types interact to reach an equilibrium that balances semantic preservation and discriminative strength. Specifically, a spatio-temporal dual weight localization mechanism identifies key motion regions and guides region-wise augmentations to enhance motion diversity while maintaining semantics. In parallel, an entropy-driven dominance strategy manages the memory bank by retaining high entropy (hard) negatives and replacing low-entropy (weak) ones, ensuring consistent exposure to informative contrastive signals. Extensive experiments are conducted on NTU RGB+D and PKU-MMD datasets. On NTU RGB+D 60 X-Sub/X-View, DoGCLR achieves 81.1%/89.4% accuracy, and on NTU RGB+D 120 X-Sub/X-Set, DoGCLR achieves 71.2%/75.5% accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 0.1%, 2.7%, 1.1%, and 2.3%, respectively.

The prevailing works address these degradations in isolation, developing highly specialized, specialist models that lack scalability and fail to exploit the shared underlying essences of these restoration problems. While specialist models are limited, recent large-scale pretrained generalist models offer powerful, text-driven image editing capabilities. while recent general-purpose systems (e.g., GPT-4o, Flux Kontext, Nano Banana) require detailed prompts and often fail to achieve robust removal on these fine-grained tasks or preserve identity of the scene. Leveraging the common essence of soft effects, i.e., semi-transparent occlusions, we introduce a foundational versatile model UniSER, capable of addressing diverse degradations caused by soft effects within a single framework. Our methodology centers on curating a massive 3.8M-pair dataset to ensure robustness and generalization, which includes novel, physically-plausible data to fill critical gaps in public benchmarks, and a tailored training pipeline that fine-tunes a Diffusion Transformer to learn robust restoration priors from this diverse data, integrating fine-grained mask and strength controls.

Small, imbalanced, and noisy datasets, coupled with high-dimensional and weakly identified clinical features, amplify this multiplicity and make conventional validation schemes unreliable. As a result, selecting among equally performing models becomes uncertain, particularly when resource constraints and operational priorities are not considered by conventional metrics like F1 score. To address these issues, we propose two complementary tools for robust model assessment and selection: Intervention Efficiency (IE) and the Perturbation Validation Framework (PVF). IE is a capacity-aware metric that quantifies how efficiently a model identifies actionable true positives when only limited interventions are feasible, thereby linking predictive performance with clinical utility. PVF introduces a structured approach to assess the stability of models under data perturbations, identifying models whose performance remains most invariant across noisy or shifted validation sets. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world healthcare datasets show that using these tools facilitates the selection of models that generalize more robustly and align with capacity constraints, offering a new direction for tackling the Rashomon Effect in clinical settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u4e34\u5e8a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684Rashomon\u6548\u5e94\uff08\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u8fd1\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5e72\u9884\u6548\u7387(IE)\u548c\u6270\u52a8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6(PVF)\u4e24\u79cd\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e34\u5e8a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u8fd1\u7684\u6a21\u578b(Rashomon\u6548\u5e94)\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u5c0f\u3001\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u591a\uff0c\u52a0\u4e0a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5f31\u8bc6\u522b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u4f20\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u7ea6\u675f\u6765\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e72\u9884\u6548\u7387(IE)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bb9\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6709\u9650\u5e72\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u6270\u52a8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6(PVF)\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5de5\u5177\u80fd\u591f\u9009\u62e9\u51fa\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u6cdb\u5316\u4e14\u7b26\u5408\u5bb9\u91cf\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5de5\u5177\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684Rashomon\u6548\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\u3002", "relevance": 40.0}}

However, VA-VAE proves that a more uniform feature distribution yields better generation performance. In this work, we introduce a Global Perspective Tokenizer (GloTok), which utilizes global relational information to model a more uniform semantic distribution of tokenized features. Specifically, a codebook-wise histogram relation learning method is proposed to transfer the semantics, which are modeled by pre-trained models on the entire dataset, to the semantic codebook. Then, we design a residual learning module that recovers the fine-grained details to minimize the reconstruction error caused by quantization. Through the above design, GloTok delivers more uniformly distributed semantic latent representations, which facilitates the training of autoregressive (AR) models for generating high-quality images without requiring direct access to pre-trained models during the training process. Experiments on the standard ImageNet-1k benchmark clearly show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance and generation quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "GloTok\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5168\u5c40\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee3\u7801\u672c\u76f4\u65b9\u56fe\u5173\u7cfb\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728ImageNet-1k\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u50cf\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5747\u5300\u6027\u3002\u800cVA-VAE\u8bc1\u660e\u66f4\u5747\u5300\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5168\u5c40\u89c6\u89d2\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u5668(GloTok)\uff1a1) \u4ee3\u7801\u672c\u76f4\u65b9\u56fe\u5173\u7cfb\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u8bed\u4e49\u4ee3\u7801\u672c\uff1b2) \u6b8b\u5dee\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\u6062\u590d\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u91cf\u5316\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6ImageNet-1k\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "GloTok\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40\u5173\u7cfb\u5efa\u6a21\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4e14\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u65e0\u9700\u76f4\u63a5\u8bbf\u95ee\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "relevance": 75.0}}

Existing communication systems only support parallel transmissions at the bit level, which fundamentally limits the number of tasks that can be concurrently processed. To address this bottleneck, this paper introduces the new concept of Semantic Multiplexing. Our approach shifts stream multiplexing from bits to tasks by merging multiple task-related compressed representations into a single semantic representation. As such, Semantic Multiplexing can multiplex more tasks than the number of physical channels without adding antennas or widening bandwidth by extending the effective degrees of freedom at the semantic layer, without contradicting Shannon capacity rules. We have prototyped Semantic Multiplexing on an experimental testbed with Jetson Orin Nano and millimeter-wave software-defined radios and tested its performance on image classification and sentiment analysis while comparing to several existing baselines in semantic communications. Our experiments demonstrate that Semantic Multiplexing allows jointly processing multiple tasks at the semantic level while maintaining sufficient task accuracy. For example, image classification accuracy drops by less than 4% when increasing from 2 to 8 the number of tasks multiplexed over a 4$\\times$4 channel. Semantic Multiplexing reduces latency, energy consumption, and communication load respectively by up to 8$\\times$, 25$\\times$, and 54$\\times$ compared to the baselines while keeping comparable performance.

The prevalent approach to handle this challenge is to aggregate a weighted combination of requirement violation penalties into the training objective. To be effective, this approach requires careful tuning of these hyperparameters (weights), involving trial-and-error and cross-validation, which becomes ineffective even for a moderate number of requirements. These issues are exacerbated when the requirements involve parities or equalities, as is the case in fairness and boundary value problems. An alternative technique uses constrained optimization to formulate these learning problems. Yet, existing approximation and generalization guarantees do not apply to problems involving equality constraints. In this work, we derive a generalization theory for equality-constrained statistical learning problems, showing that their solutions can be approximated using samples and rich parametrizations. Using these results, we propose a practical algorithm based on solving a sequence of unconstrained, empirical learning problems. We showcase its effectiveness and the new formulations enabled by equality constraints in fair learning, interpolating classifiers, and boundary value problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u7b49\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u516c\u5e73\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u63d2\u503c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u503c\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5904\u7406\u9664\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5916\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u9700\u6c42\uff08\u5982\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3001\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\uff09\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u52a0\u6743\u60e9\u7f5a\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u7b49\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u7b49\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e8f\u5217\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u7ea6\u675f\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7b49\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u6837\u672c\u548c\u4e30\u5bcc\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u516c\u5e73\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u63d2\u503c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u503c\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7b49\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u5728\u590d\u6742\u9700\u6c42\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "relevance": 75.0}}

To evaluate the real behavioral safety of AVs controlled in the black box, we present the first end-to-end benchmark dataset collected entirely by autonomous-driving mode in the real world. This dataset contains over 100 hours of naturalistic data from multiple production autonomous-driving vehicle models in the market. We segment the original data into 32,727 key frames, each consisting of four synchronized camera images and high-precision GNSS/IMU data (0.8 cm localization accuracy). For each key frame, 20 Hz vehicle trajectories spanning the past 6 s and future 5 s are provided, along with detailed 2D annotations of surrounding vehicles, pedestrians, traffic lights, and traffic signs.

However, despite their foundational role, the hidden irreversibility implied by the Second Law of Thermodynamics is often neglected during training, leading to unphysical solutions or even training failures in conventional PINNs. In this paper, we identify this critical gap and introduce a simple, generalized, yet robust irreversibility-regularized strategy that enforces hidden physical laws as soft constraints during training. This approach ensures that the learned solutions consistently respect the intrinsic one-way nature of irreversible physical processes. Across a wide range of benchmarks spanning traveling wave propagation, steady combustion, ice melting, corrosion evolution, and crack propagation, we demonstrate that our regularization scheme reduces predictive errors by more than an order of magnitude, while requiring only minimal modification to existing PINN frameworks.

This task is particularly challenging due to rapid succession, motion blur, and subtle visual differences. Consequently, most existing methods rely on domain-specific, end-to-end training with large labeled datasets and often struggle in few-shot conditions due to their dependence on pixel- or pose-based inputs alone. However, obtaining large labeled datasets is practically hard. We propose a Unified Multi-Entity Graph Network (UMEG-Net) for few-shot PES. UMEG-Net integrates human skeletons and sport-specific object keypoints into a unified graph and features an efficient spatio-temporal extraction module based on advanced GCN and multi-scale temporal shift. To further enhance performance, we employ multimodal distillation to transfer knowledge from keypoint-based graphs to visual representations.

However, this distributed learning paradigm faces several security threats, particularly to its integrity, such as backdoor attacks that aim to inject malicious behavior during the local training steps of certain clients. We present the first analysis of the influence of LoRA on state-of-the-art backdoor attacks targeting model adaptation in FL. Specifically, we focus on backdoor lifespan, a critical characteristic in FL, that can vary depending on the attack scenario and the attacker's ability to effectively inject the backdoor.

Minimally invasive repairs involving branch vessels necessitate detailed 3D anatomical analysis. Existing methods often overlook hierarchical anatomical relationships while struggling with severe class imbalance inherent in vascular structures. We address these challenges with a curriculum learning strategy that leverages a novel fractal softmax for hierarchical semantic learning. Inspired by human cognition, our approach progressively learns anatomical constraints by decomposing complex structures from simple to complex components. The curriculum learning framework naturally addresses class imbalance by first establishing robust feature representations for dominant classes before tackling rare but anatomically critical structures, significantly accelerating model convergence in multi-class scenarios. Our two-stage inference strategy achieves up to fivefold acceleration, enhancing clinical practicality. On the validation set at epoch 50, our hierarchical semantic loss improves the Dice score of nnU-Net ResEnc M by 11.65%. The proposed model demonstrates a 5.6% higher Dice score than baselines on the test set. Experimental results show significant improvements in segmentation accuracy and efficiency, making the framework suitable for real-time clinical applications.

However, existing general-to-customized CMR methods typically assume that the entire target-domain data is available, which is easily violated in real-world scenarios and thus inevitably suffer from the query shift (QS) problem. Specifically, query shift embraces the following two characteristics and thus poses new challenges to CMR. i) Online Shift: real-world queries always arrive in an online manner, rendering it impractical to access the entire query set beforehand for customization approaches; ii) Diverse Shift: even with domain customization, the CMR models struggle to satisfy queries from diverse users or scenarios, leaving an urgent need to accommodate diverse queries. In this paper, we observe that QS would not only undermine the well-structured common space inherited from the source model, but also steer the model toward forgetting the indispensable general knowledge for CMR. Inspired by the observations, we propose a novel method for achieving online and harmonious adaptation against QS, dubbed Robust adaptation with quEry ShifT (REST). To deal with online shift, REST first refines the retrieval results to formulate the query predictions and accordingly designs a QS-robust objective function on these predictions to preserve the well-established common space in an online manner. As for tackling the more challenging diverse shift, REST employs a gradient decoupling module to dexterously manipulate the gradients during the adaptation process, thus preventing the CMR model from forgetting the general knowledge.

By modeling global score distributions, DetGain efficiently estimates the global AP change and computes teacher-student contribution gaps to select informative samples at each iteration. The method is architecture-agnostic and minimally intrusive, enabling straightforward integration into diverse object detection architectures.

The design of backdoor triggers has evolved from fixed triggers to dynamic or implicit triggers. This increased flexibility in trigger design makes it challenging for defenders to identify their specific forms accurately. Most existing backdoor defense methods are limited to specific types of triggers or rely on an additional clean model for support. To address this issue, we propose a backdoor detection method based on attention similarity, enabling backdoor detection without prior knowledge of the trigger. Our study reveals that models subjected to backdoor attacks exhibit unusually high similarity among attention heads when exposed to triggers. Based on this observation, we propose an attention safety alignment approach combined with head-wise fine-tuning to rectify potentially contaminated attention heads, thereby effectively mitigating the impact of backdoor attacks.

Recently, we introduced ComplexEye, a multi-lens array microscope comprising 16 independent aberration-corrected glass lenses arranged at the pitch of a 96-well plate, capable of capturing high-resolution movies of migrating cells. This architecture enables high-throughput live-cell video microscopy for migration analysis, supporting routine quantification of autonomous motility with strong potential for clinical translation. However, ComplexEye and similar high-throughput imaging platforms generate data at an exponential rate, imposing substantial burdens on storage and transmission. To address this challenge, we present FlowRoI, a fast optical-flow-based region of interest (RoI) extraction framework designed for high-throughput image compression in immune cell migration studies. FlowRoI estimates optical flow between consecutive frames and derives RoI masks that reliably cover nearly all migrating cells. The raw image and its corresponding RoI mask are then jointly encoded using JPEG2000 to enable RoI-aware compression. FlowRoI operates with high computational efficiency, achieving runtimes comparable to standard JPEG2000 and reaching an average throughput of about 30 frames per second on a modern laptop equipped with an Intel i7-1255U CPU.

However, some existing vessel Re-ID methods are directly adapted from pedestrian-focused algorithms, making them ill-suited for mitigating the unique problems present in vessel images, particularly the greater intra-identity variations and more severe missing of local parts, which lead to the emergence of outlier samples within the same identity. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-scale Correlation-aware Transformer Network (MCFormer), which explicitly models multi-scale correlations across the entire input set to suppress the adverse effects of outlier samples with intra-identity variations or local missing, incorporating two novel modules, the Global Correlation Module (GCM), and the Local Correlation Module (LCM). Specifically, GCM constructs a global similarity affinity matrix across all input images to model global correlations through feature aggregation based on inter-image consistency, rather than solely learning features from individual images as in most existing approaches. Simultaneously, LCM mines and aligns local features of positive samples with contextual similarity to extract local correlations by maintaining a dynamic memory bank, effectively compensating for missing or occluded regions in individual images. To further enhance feature robustness, MCFormer integrates global and local features that have been respectively correlated across multiple scales, effectively capturing latent relationships among image features.

However, most of these models don't have the ability to change the number of atoms in the crystal during the generation process, which limits the variability of model sampling trajectories. In this paper, we demonstrate the severity of this restriction and introduce a simple yet powerful technique, mirage infusion, which enables diffusion models to change the state of the atoms that make up the crystal from existent to non-existent (mirage) and vice versa. We show that this technique improves model quality by up to $\\times2.5$ compared to the same model without this modification. The resulting model, Mirage Atom Diffusion (MiAD), is an equivariant joint diffusion model for de novo crystal generation that is capable of altering the number of atoms during the generation process. MiAD achieves an $8.2\\%$ S.U.N. rate on the MP-20 dataset, which substantially exceeds existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Diffusion-based priors currently deliver state-of-the-art reconstructions, but existing approaches either adapt image diffusion models with ad hoc temporal regularizers - leading to temporal artifacts - or rely on native video diffusion models whose iterative posterior sampling is far too slow for real-time use. We introduce InstantViR, an amortized inference framework for ultra-fast video reconstruction powered by a pre-trained video diffusion prior. We distill a powerful bidirectional video diffusion model (teacher) into a causal autoregressive student that maps a degraded video directly to its restored version in a single forward pass, inheriting the teacher's strong temporal modeling while completely removing iterative test-time optimization. The distillation is prior-driven: it only requires the teacher diffusion model and known degradation operators, and does not rely on externally paired clean/noisy video data. To further boost throughput, we replace the video-diffusion backbone VAE with a high-efficiency LeanVAE via an innovative teacher-space regularized distillation scheme, enabling low-latency latent-space processing. Across streaming random inpainting, Gaussian deblurring and super-resolution, InstantViR matches or surpasses the reconstruction quality of diffusion-based baselines while running at over 35 FPS on NVIDIA A100 GPUs, achieving up to 100 times speedups over iterative video diffusion solvers. These results show that diffusion-based video reconstruction is compatible with real-time, interactive, editable, streaming scenarios, turning high-quality video restoration into a practical component of modern vision systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "InstantViR\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u8d85\u5feb\u901f\u89c6\u9891\u91cd\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u53cc\u5411\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u84b8\u998f\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u89c6\u9891\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u9891\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u6d41\u5a92\u4f53\u3001\u8fdc\u7a0b\u5448\u73b0\u548cAR/VR\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5e76\u5b58\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u8fed\u4ee3\u91c7\u6837\u901f\u5ea6\u8fc7\u6162\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u65f6\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u6559\u5e08\uff09\u84b8\u998f\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u6559\u5e08\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5df2\u77e5\u9000\u5316\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u3002\u4f7f\u7528LeanVAE\u66ff\u6362VAE\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6d41\u5f0f\u968f\u673a\u4fee\u590d\u3001\u9ad8\u65af\u53bb\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cInstantViR\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u6269\u6563\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5728NVIDIA A100 GPU\u4e0a\u8fd0\u884c\u8d85\u8fc735 FPS\uff0c\u6bd4\u8fed\u4ee3\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5feb100\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u6563\u57fa\u89c6\u9891\u91cd\u5efa\u53ef\u4e0e\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u3001\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u6d41\u5a92\u4f53\u573a\u666f\u517c\u5bb9\uff0c\u4f7f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u9891\u6062\u590d\u6210\u4e3a\u73b0\u4ee3\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002", "relevance": 65.0}}

Each model was trained using k-mer integer encoding to capture both local and long-range dependencies. Among these, the CNN achieved the highest validation accuracy of 91.8%, demonstrating the effectiveness of localized motif detection. Explainable AI techniques, including Grad-CAM and Integrated Gradients, were applied to interpret model predictions and identify biologically meaningful sequence motifs. The discovered motifs, enriched in histidine, aspartate, glutamate, and lysine, represent amino acid residues commonly found in catalytic and metal-binding regions of transferase enzymes.

However, some fundamental cardiac biomarkers of interest, including stroke volume and cardiac output, require invasive measurements, e.g., arterial pressure waveforms (APW). As a non-invasive alternative, photoplethysmography (PPG) measurements are routinely collected in hospital settings. Unfortunately, the prediction of key cardiac biomarkers from PPG instead of APW remains an open challenge, further complicated by the scarcity of annotated PPG measurements. As a solution, we propose a hybrid approach that uses hemodynamic simulations and unlabeled clinical data to estimate cardiovascular biomarkers directly from PPG signals.

Through semi-structured stakeholder interviews and iterative modeling, we construct a multi-level representation of the recruitment pipeline, capturing how information is transformed, filtered, and interpreted across both algorithmic and human components.

However, existing methods typically produce deterministic results, struggling to capture this one-to-many nature. In this paper, we propose a Measurement-Constrained Sampling (MCS) approach that enables diverse LQ face reconstructions conditioned on different textual prompts. Specifically, we formulate BFR as a measurement-constrained generative task by constructing an inverse problem through controlled degradations of coarse restorations, which allows posterior-guided sampling within text-to-image diffusion.

Current approaches face a fundamental tradeoff: custom implementations like TransformerLens ensure consistent interfaces but require coding a manual adaptation for each architecture, introducing numerical mismatch with the original models, while direct HuggingFace access through NNsight preserves exact behavior but lacks standardization across models. To bridge this gap, we develop nnterp, a lightweight wrapper around NNsight that provides a unified interface for transformer analysis while preserving original HuggingFace implementations. Through automatic module renaming and comprehensive validation testing, nnterp enables researchers to write intervention code once and deploy it across 50+ model variants spanning 16 architecture families. The library includes built-in implementations of common interpretability methods (logit lens, patchscope, activation steering) and provides direct access to attention probabilities for models that support it.

To address these limitations, we propose a novel autoregressive diffusion model that processes input audio in a streaming manner. This design ensures flexibility with varying audio lengths and achieves low latency independent of audio duration. Specifically, we select a limited number of past frames as historical motion context and combine them with the audio input to create a dynamic condition. This condition guides the diffusion process to iteratively generate facial motion frames, enabling real-time synthesis with high-quality results. Additionally, we implemented a real-time interactive demo, highlighting the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.

Current approaches excessively rely on implicit network modeling of spatiotemporal relationships and motion characteristics, falling into the passive learning trap that results in redundant and monotonous 3D coordinate information acquisition while lacking actively guided explicit learning mechanisms. To overcome these issues, we propose an Active Perceptual Strategy (APS) for human motion prediction, leveraging quotient space representations to explicitly encode motion properties while introducing auxiliary learning objectives to strengthen spatio-temporal modeling. Specifically, we first design a data perception module that projects poses into the quotient space, decoupling motion geometry from coordinate redundancy. By jointly encoding tangent vectors and Grassmann projections, this module simultaneously achieves geometric dimension reduction, semantic decoupling, and dynamic constraint enforcement for effective motion pose characterization. Furthermore, we introduce a network perception module that actively learns spatio-temporal dependencies through restorative learning. This module deliberately masks specific joints or injects noise to construct auxiliary supervision signals.

However, capturing the complex spatial and temporal dependencies of HIV transmission remains challenging. Conventional Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) models rely on a fixed binary adjacency matrix that only encodes geographic adjacency, which is unable to represent interactions between non-contiguous counties. Our study proposes a deep learning architecture Mobility-Aware Transformer-Message Passing Neural Network (MAT-MPNN) framework to predict county-level HIV diagnosis rates across California, Florida, and the New England region. The model combines temporal features extracted by a Transformer encoder with spatial relationships captured through a Mobility Graph Generator (MGG). The MGG improves conventional adjacency matrices by combining geographic and demographic information. Compared with the best-performing hybrid baseline, the Transformer MPNN model, MAT-MPNN reduced the Mean Squared Prediction Error (MSPE) by 27.9% in Florida, 39.1% in California, and 12.5% in New England, and improved the Predictive Model Choice Criterion (PMCC) by 7.7%, 3.5%, and 3.9%, respectively. MAT-MPNN also achieved better results than the Spatially Varying Auto-Regressive (SVAR) model in Florida and New England, with comparable performance in California.

However, the inherent temporal heterogeneous induced by localized perturbations present significant challenges for generating structurally consistent time series. While flow matching provides a promising paradigm by modeling temporal dynamics through trajectory-level supervision, it fails to adequately capture abrupt transitions in perturbed time series, as the use of globally shared parameters constrains the velocity field to a unified representation. To address these limitations, we introduce \\textbf{PAFM}, a \\textbf{P}erturbation-\\textbf{A}ware \\textbf{F}low \\textbf{M}atching framework that models perturbed trajectories to ensure stable and structurally consistent time series generation. The framework incorporates perturbation-guided training to simulate localized disturbances and leverages a dual-path velocity field to capture trajectory deviations under perturbation, enabling refined modeling of perturbed behavior to enhance the structural coherence. In order to further improve sensitivity to trajectory perturbations while enhancing expressiveness, a mixture-of-experts decoder with flow routing dynamically allocates modeling capacity in response to different trajectory dynamics. Extensive experiments on both unconditional and conditional generation tasks demonstrate that PAFM consistently outperforms strong baselines.

However, given access to some data from downstream tasks, a natural question arises: can the performance of these models be further improved? To this end, we propose WeSTAR, a parameter-efficient framework that performs Weakly supervised Self-Training Adaptation with Regularization, designed to enhance the robustness of MDE foundation models in unseen and diverse domains. We first adopt a dense self-training objective as the primary source of structural self-supervision. To further improve robustness, we introduce semantically-aware hierarchical normalization, which exploits instance-level segmentation maps to perform more stable and multi-scale structural normalization. Beyond dense supervision, we introduce a cost-efficient weak supervision in the form of pairwise ordinal depth annotations to further guide the adaptation process, which enforces informative ordinal constraints to mitigate local topological errors. Finally, a weight regularization loss is employed to anchor the LoRA updates, ensuring training stability and preserving the model's generalizable knowledge.

However, they overlook the CPU bottleneck in three aspects: (1) substantial overhead of fine-grained dynamic cache management performed on the CPU side, (2) significant transfer overhead from poor PCIe bandwidth utilization caused by heavy gathering operations at the CPU side, and (3) GPU runtime bubbles introduced by coarse-grained CPU-centric synchronization. To address these challenges, we propose CLO, a CPU-light KVCache offloading system via algorithm-system co-design. CLO features: (1) a coarse-grained head-wise approximate on-GPU caching strategy with negligible cache management cost, (2) seamless combination of data prefetching and on-GPU persistent caching for lower transfer overhead, (3) a zero-copy transfer engine to fully exploit PCIe bandwidth, and a GPU-centric synchronization method to eliminate GPU stalls. Evaluation on two widely-used LLMs demonstrates that CLO achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art systems, while substantially minimizing CPU overhead, fully utilizing PCIe bandwidth, thus improving decoding throughput by 9.3%-66.6%. Our results highlight that algorithm-system co-design is essential for memory-constrained LLM inference on modern GPU platforms.

Despite their progress, these models still face two major challenges. First, categorical sampling of discrete residue types collapses their continuous parameters into onehot assignments, while continuous variables (e.g., atom positions) evolve smoothly throughout the generation process. This mismatch disrupts the update dynamics and results in suboptimal performance. Second, current models assume unimodal distributions for side-chain torsion angles, which conflicts with the inherently multimodal nature of side chain rotameric states and limits prediction accuracy. To address these limitations, we introduce PepBFN, the first Bayesian flow network for full atom peptide design that directly models parameter distributions in fully continuous space. Specifically, PepBFN models discrete residue types by learning their continuous parameter distributions, enabling joint and smooth Bayesian updates with other continuous structural parameters. It further employs a novel Gaussian mixture based Bayesian flow to capture the multimodal side chain rotameric states and a Matrix Fisher based Riemannian flow to directly model residue orientations on the $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$ manifold. Together, these parameter distributions are progressively refined via Bayesian updates, yielding smooth and coherent peptide generation.

Existing image manipulation detection and localization (IMDL) benchmarks suffer from limited content diversity, narrow generative-model coverage, and insufficient interpretability, which hinders the generalization and explanation capabilities of current manipulation detection methods. To address these limitations, we introduce \\textbf{ManipBench}, a large-scale benchmark for image manipulation detection and localization focusing on AI-edited images. ManipBench contains over 450K manipulated images produced by 25 state-of-the-art image editing models across 12 manipulation categories, among which 100K images are further annotated with bounding boxes, judgment cues, and textual explanations to support interpretable detection.

This heterogeneous structure presents significant challenges for existing diffusion-based imputation models, which typically assume a homogeneous feature space and rely on stochastic denoising trajectories. Such assumptions make it difficult to maintain conditional consistency, and they often lead to information collapse for categorical variables or instability when numerical variables require deterministic updates. These limitations indicate that a single diffusion process is insufficient for mixed-type tabular imputation.\n  We propose a hybrid deterministic diffusion framework that separates heterogeneous features into two complementary generative channels. A continuous DDIM-based channel provides efficient and stable deterministic denoising for numerical variables, while a discrete latent-path diffusion channel, inspired by loopholing-based discrete diffusion, models categorical and discrete features without leaving their valid sample manifolds. The two channels are trained under a unified conditional imputation objective, enabling coherent reconstruction of mixed-type incomplete data.\n  Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets show that the proposed framework achieves higher imputation accuracy, more stable sampling trajectories, and improved robustness across MCAR, MAR, and MNAR settings compared with existing diffusion-based and classical methods.

However, two critical limitations of t-SVD methods persist: (1) the approximation of the latent tensor (e.g., tensor factorizations) is coarse and fails to accurately capture spatial local high-frequency information; (2) The transform matrix is composed of fixed basis atoms (e.g., complex exponential atoms in DFT and cosine atoms in DCT) and cannot precisely capture local high-frequency information along the mode-3 fibers. To address these two limitations, we propose a Gaussian Splatting-based Low-rank tensor Representation (GSLR) framework, which compactly and continuously represents multi-dimensional images. Specifically, we leverage tailored 2D Gaussian splatting and 1D Gaussian splatting to generate the latent tensor and transform matrix, respectively. The 2D and 1D Gaussian splatting are indispensable and complementary under this representation framework, which enjoys a powerful representation capability, especially for local high-frequency information. To evaluate the representation ability of the proposed GSLR, we develop an unsupervised GSLR-based multi-dimensional image recovery model.

Several Projection Quality Metrics (PQMs) have been developed as tools to quantify the goodness-of-fit of a DR projection; however, they mostly focus on measuring how well the projection captures the global or local structure of the data, without taking into account the visual distortion of the resulting plots, thus often ignoring the presence of outliers or artifacts that can mislead a visual analysis of the projection. In this work, we introduce the Warping Index (WI), a new metric for measuring the quality of DR projections onto the 2D plane, based on the assumption that the correct preservation of empty regions between points is of crucial importance towards a faithful visual representation of the data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Warping Index (WI)\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b0\u7684\u964d\u7ef4\u6295\u5f71\u8d28\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cf\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u6d4b\u91cf\u6295\u5f71\u4e2d\u7a7a\u533a\u57df\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u8d28\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5168\u5c40\u6216\u5c40\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u6301\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u5931\u771f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7a7a\u533a\u57df\u53d8\u5f62\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u7528\u6237\u5f97\u51fa\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a7a\u533a\u57df\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86Warping Index\u6307\u6807\u6765\u91cf\u53162D\u6295\u5f71\u4e2d\u7a7a\u533a\u57df\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u4fdd\u6301\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684WI\u5ea6\u91cf\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u6295\u5f71\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5931\u771f\u548c\u5f02\u5e38\u70b9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "WI\u6307\u6807\u4e3a\u964d\u7ef4\u6295\u5f71\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u907f\u514d\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u6790\u3002", "relevance": 10.0}}

First, they struggle with coarse semantic alignment, often failing to capture fine-grained prompt details. Second, they lack robust 3D spatial understanding, leading to geometric inconsistencies and catastrophic failures in part assembly and spatial relationships. To address these challenges, we propose VLM3D, a general framework that repurposes large vision-language models (VLMs) as powerful, differentiable semantic and spatial critics. Our core contribution is a dual-query critic signal derived from the VLM's Yes or No log-odds, which assesses both semantic fidelity and geometric coherence. We demonstrate the generality of this guidance signal across two distinct paradigms: (1) As a reward objective for optimization-based pipelines, VLM3D significantly outperforms existing methods on standard benchmarks. (2) As a test-time guidance module for feed-forward pipelines, it actively steers the iterative sampling process of SOTA native 3D models to correct severe spatial errors.

Different from predominant CDFSL works focused on generalized representations, we make novel attempts to construct Intermediate Domain Proxies (IDP) with source feature embeddings as the codebook and reconstruct the target domain feature with this learned codebook. We then conduct an empirical study to explore the intrinsic attributes from perspectives of visual styles and semantic contents in intermediate domain proxies. Reaping benefits from these attributes of intermediate domains, we develop a fast domain alignment method to use these proxies as learning guidance for target domain feature transformation. With the collaborative learning of intermediate domain reconstruction and target feature transformation, our proposed model is able to surpass the state-of-the-art models by a margin on 8 cross-domain few-shot learning benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u4e2d\u95f4\u57df\u4ee3\u7406\u6765\u8fde\u63a5\u6e90\u57df\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u57df\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3001\u5927\u57df\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u4e09\u91cd\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709CDFSL\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5e7f\u4e49\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u800c\u672c\u6587\u5c1d\u8bd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2d\u95f4\u57df\u4ee3\u7406\u6765\u5f25\u5408\u6e90\u57df\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6e90\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u5d4c\u5165\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7801\u672c\u91cd\u6784\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528\u6e90\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u5d4c\u5165\u6784\u5efa\u4e2d\u95f4\u57df\u4ee3\u7406\u4ee3\u7801\u672c\n2. \u91cd\u6784\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u7279\u5f81\n3. \u4ece\u89c6\u89c9\u98ce\u683c\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5185\u5bb9\u89d2\u5ea6\u63a2\u7d22\u4e2d\u95f4\u57df\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5185\u5728\u5c5e\u6027\n4. \u5f00\u53d1\u5feb\u901f\u57df\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee3\u7406\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6307\u5bfc", "result": "\u57288\u4e2a\u8de8\u57df\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2d\u95f4\u57df\u91cd\u6784\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u7279\u5f81\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u534f\u540c\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3CDFSL\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "relevance": 35.0}}

We introduce ReflexGrad, a novel architecture that tightly couples three complementary mechanisms: (1) LLM-based hierarchical TODO decomposition for strategic planning, (2) history-aware causal reflection that analyzes recent action patterns to identify failure root causes and enable within-trial learning, and (3) gradient-based optimization for systematic improvement.

Evaluated on ALFWorld benchmark tasks, ReflexGrad demonstrates 67% zero-shot success rate on Trial 0 without any prior task experience or demonstrations, establishing effective performance on first exposure.

During surgery, these plans must be accurately transferred, relying on precise cross-registration between preoperative and intraoperative data. However, substantial modality heterogeneity across imaging modalities makes this registration challenging and error-prone. Robust, automatic, and modality-agnostic bone surface registration is therefore clinically important. We propose NeuralBoneReg, a self-supervised, surface-based framework that registers bone surfaces using 3D point clouds as a modality-agnostic representation. NeuralBoneReg includes two modules: an implicit neural unsigned distance field (UDF) that learns the preoperative bone model, and an MLP-based registration module that performs global initialization and local refinement by generating transformation hypotheses to align the intraoperative point cloud with the neural UDF. Unlike SOTA supervised methods, NeuralBoneReg operates in a self-supervised manner, without requiring inter-subject training data. We evaluated NeuralBoneReg against baseline methods on two publicly available multi-modal datasets: a CT-ultrasound dataset of the fibula and tibia (UltraBones100k) and a CT-RGB-D dataset of spinal vertebrae (SpineDepth). The evaluation also includes a newly introduced CT--ultrasound dataset of cadaveric subjects containing femur and pelvis (UltraBones-Hip), which will be made publicly available. NeuralBoneReg matches or surpasses existing methods across all datasets, achieving mean RRE/RTE of 1.68\u00b0/1.86 mm on UltraBones100k, 1.88\u00b0/1.89 mm on UltraBones-Hip, and 3.79\u00b0/2.45 mm on SpineDepth.

Most existing models adopt either \\textbf{channel-independent} (CI) or \\textbf{channel-dependent} (CD) strategies, each presenting distinct drawbacks. CI methods fail to leverage the potential insights from inter-channel interactions, resulting in models that may not fully exploit the underlying statistical dependencies present in the data. Conversely, CD approaches often incorporate too much extraneous information, risking model overfitting and predictive inefficiency. To address these issues, we introduce the Adaptive Forecasting Transformer (\\textbf{Adapformer}), an advanced Transformer-based framework that merges the benefits of CI and CD methodologies through effective channel management. The core of Adapformer lies in its dual-stage encoder-decoder architecture, which includes the \\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{C}hannel \\textbf{E}nhancer (\\textbf{ACE}) for enriching embedding processes and the \\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{C}hannel \\textbf{F}orecaster (\\textbf{ACF}) for refining the predictions. ACE enhances token representations by selectively incorporating essential dependencies, while ACF streamlines the decoding process by focusing on the most relevant covariates, substantially reducing noise and redundancy. Our rigorous testing on diverse datasets shows that Adapformer achieves superior performance over existing models, enhancing both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, thus making it state-of-the-art in MTSF.", "AI": {"tldr": "Adapformer\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u5143\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u7684Transformer\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u901a\u9053\u7ba1\u7406\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u901a\u9053\u72ec\u7acb\u548c\u901a\u9053\u4f9d\u8d56\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u5143\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a\u901a\u9053\u72ec\u7acb\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u901a\u9053\u95f4\u4ea4\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u901a\u9053\u4f9d\u8d56\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bb9\u6613\u5f15\u5165\u8fc7\u591a\u65e0\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5e73\u8861\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "Adapformer\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u901a\u9053\u589e\u5f3a\u5668(ACE)\u7528\u4e8e\u4e30\u5bcc\u5d4c\u5165\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u901a\u9053\u9884\u6d4b\u5668(ACF)\u7528\u4e8e\u7cbe\u70bc\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u3002ACE\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6574\u5408\u5173\u952e\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0cACF\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u5197\u4f59\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u660e\uff0cAdapformer\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "Adapformer\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u901a\u9053\u7ba1\u7406\u6210\u529f\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u901a\u9053\u72ec\u7acb\u548c\u901a\u9053\u4f9d\u8d56\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u5143\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "relevance": 35.0}}

These constraints reduce the quality and stability of pseudo-labels, while large models, though more accurate, cannot be trained or used for routine inference on client devices. We propose SAM-Fed, a federated semi-supervised framework that leverages a high-capacity segmentation foundation model to guide lightweight clients during training.

However, current medical screening methods often miss the early warning signs of smoking-related health problems, leading to late-stage diagnoses when treatment options become limited. This study presents a systematic comparative evaluation of machine learning approaches for smoking-related health risk assessment, emphasizing clinical interpretability and practical deployment over algorithmic innovation. We analyzed health screening data from 55,691 individuals, examining various health indicators, including body measurements, blood tests, and demographic information. We tested three advanced prediction algorithms - Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM - to determine which could most accurately identify people at high risk. This study employed a cross-sectional design to classify current smoking status based on health screening biomarkers, not to predict future disease development. Our Random Forest model performed best, achieving an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.926, meaning it could reliably distinguish between high-risk and lower-risk individuals. Using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis to understand what the model was detecting, we found that key health markers played crucial roles in prediction: blood pressure levels, triglyceride concentrations, liver enzyme readings, and kidney function indicators (serum creatinine) were the strongest signals of declining health in smokers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5438\u70df\u76f8\u5173\u5065\u5eb7\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73(AUC=0.926)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7SHAP\u5206\u6790\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u8840\u538b\u3001\u7518\u6cb9\u4e09\u916f\u3001\u809d\u9176\u548c\u80be\u529f\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u662f\u5438\u70df\u8005\u5065\u5eb7\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5b50\u3002", "motivation": "\u5438\u70df\u662f\u5168\u7403\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u53ef\u9884\u9632\u6b7b\u56e0\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u533b\u5b66\u7b5b\u67e5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u9519\u8fc7\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u8b66\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u4e34\u5e8a\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65e9\u671f\u8bc6\u522b\u5438\u70df\u76f8\u5173\u5065\u5eb7\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u752855,691\u540d\u4e2a\u4f53\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u7b5b\u67e5\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u3001XGBoost\u548cLightGBM\u4e09\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6a2a\u65ad\u9762\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u5206\u7c7b\u5f53\u524d\u5438\u70df\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528SHAP\u5206\u6790\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73(AUC=0.926)\uff0cSHAP\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u8840\u538b\u3001\u7518\u6cb9\u4e09\u916f\u3001\u809d\u9176(ALT/AST)\u548c\u8840\u6e05\u808c\u9150\u662f\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u5438\u70df\u76f8\u5173\u5065\u5eb7\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5173\u952e\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u7b5b\u67e5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "relevance": 20.0}}

However, practical systems are often constrained by ultra-sparse-view sampling, which significantly degrades reconstruction quality. Traditional methods struggle under ultra-sparse-view settings, where interpolation becomes inaccurate and the resulting reconstructions are unsatisfactory. To address this challenge, this study proposes Diffusion-Refined Neural Attenuation Fields (Diff-NAF), an iterative framework tailored for multi-source stationary CT under ultra-sparse-view conditions. Diff-NAF combines a Neural Attenuation Field representation with a dual-branch conditional diffusion model. The process begins by training an initial NAF using ultra-sparse-view projections. New projections are then generated through an Angle-Prior Guided Projection Synthesis strategy that exploits inter view priors, and are subsequently refined by a Diffusion-driven Reuse Projection Refinement Module. The refined projections are incorporated as pseudo-labels into the training set for the next iteration. Through iterative refinement, Diff-NAF progressively enhances projection completeness and reconstruction fidelity under ultra-sparse-view conditions, ultimately yielding high-quality CT reconstructions.

However, it remains vulnerable to malicious clients who compromise model integrity through Byzantine attacks, data poisoning, or adaptive adversarial behaviors. Existing defense mechanisms rely on static thresholds and binary classification, failing to adapt to evolving client behaviors in real-world deployments. We propose FLARE, an adaptive reputation-based framework that transforms client reliability assessment from binary decisions to a continuous, multi-dimensional trust evaluation. FLARE integrates: (i) a multi-dimensional reputation score capturing performance consistency, statistical anomaly indicators, and temporal behavior, (ii) a self-calibrating adaptive threshold mechanism that adjusts security strictness based on model convergence and recent attack intensity, (iii) reputation-weighted aggregation with soft exclusion to proportionally limit suspicious contributions rather than eliminating clients outright, and (iv) a Local Differential Privacy (LDP) mechanism enabling reputation scoring on privatized client updates. We further introduce a highly evasive Statistical Mimicry (SM) attack, a benchmark adversary that blends honest gradients with synthetic perturbations and persistent drift to remain undetected by traditional filters. Extensive experiments with 100 clients on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN demonstrate that FLARE maintains high model accuracy and converges faster than state-of-the-art Byzantine-robust methods under diverse attack types, including label flipping, gradient scaling, adaptive attacks, ALIE, and SM. FLARE improves robustness by up to 16% and preserves model convergence within 30% of the non-attacked baseline, while achieving strong malicious-client detection performance with minimal computational overhead. https://github.com/Anonymous0-0paper/FLARE", "AI": {"tldr": "FLARE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u8a89\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ef4\u4fe1\u8a89\u8bc4\u5206\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9608\u503c\u548c\u8f6f\u6392\u9664\u673a\u5236\u6765\u62b5\u5fa1\u62dc\u5360\u5ead\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u9608\u503c\u548c\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u73b0\u5b9e\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u7ef4\u4fe1\u8a89\u8bc4\u5206\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u6027\u80fd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u7edf\u8ba1\u5f02\u5e38\u6307\u6807\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u884c\u4e3a\uff09\u3001\u81ea\u6821\u51c6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9608\u503c\u673a\u5236\u3001\u4fe1\u8a89\u52a0\u6743\u805a\u5408\u4e0e\u8f6f\u6392\u9664\u3001\u672c\u5730\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u62df\u653b\u51fb\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728MNIST\u3001CIFAR-10\u548cSVHN\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cFLARE\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u62dc\u5360\u5ead\u9c81\u68d2\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe16%\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u6301\u5728\u975e\u653b\u51fb\u57fa\u7ebf\u768430%\u4ee5\u5185\u3002", "conclusion": "FLARE\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u591a\u7ef4\u4fe1\u4efb\u8bc4\u4f30\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u653b\u51fb\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "relevance": 45.0}}

While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) shows promise for novel view synthesis, its application to the standard clinical triad of unposed anterior and bilateral buccal photographs is challenging. The large view baselines, inconsistent illumination, and specular surfaces common in intraoral settings can destabilize simultaneous pose and geometry estimation. Furthermore, sparse-view photometric supervision often induces a frequency bias, leading to over-smoothed reconstructions that lose critical diagnostic details. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{Dental3R}, a pose-free, graph-guided pipeline for robust, high-fidelity reconstruction from sparse intraoral photographs. Our method first constructs a Geometry-Aware Pairing Strategy (GAPS) to intelligently select a compact subgraph of high-value image pairs. The GAPS focuses on correspondence matching, thereby improving the stability of the geometry initialization and reducing memory usage. Building on the recovered poses and point cloud, we train the 3DGS model with a wavelet-regularized objective. By enforcing band-limited fidelity using a discrete wavelet transform, our approach preserves fine enamel boundaries and interproximal edges while suppressing high-frequency artifacts. We validate our approach on a large-scale dataset of 950 clinical cases and an additional video-based test set of 195 cases.

Our analysis reveals a field in transition: pre-2021 works focused on emotion recognition using traditional ranking methods (rankSVM), while post-2021 studies have pivoted toward generation tasks employing modern RLHF frameworks. We identify three critical patterns: (1) the emergence of multi-dimensional evaluation strategies combining synthetic, automated, and human preferences; (2) inconsistent alignment between traditional metrics (WER, PESQ) and human judgments across different contexts; and (3) convergence on multi-stage training pipelines that combine reward signals. Our findings suggest that while preference learning shows promise for audio, particularly in capturing subjective qualities like naturalness and musicality, the field requires standardized benchmarks, higher-quality datasets, and systematic investigation of how temporal factors unique to audio impact preference learning frameworks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7efc\u8ff0\u53d1\u73b0\u97f3\u9891\u9886\u57df\u7684\u504f\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\u7814\u7a76\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0d\u8db3\uff08\u4ec56%\uff09\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u4ece\u4f20\u7edf\u6392\u5e8f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5411\u73b0\u4ee3RLHF\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u591a\u7ef4\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u6307\u6807\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u97f3\u9891\u548c\u6587\u672c\u9886\u57df\u5728\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0a\u9762\u4e34\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f46\u504f\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u97f3\u9891\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u4ecd\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u97f3\u9891\u9886\u57df\u504f\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u73b0\u72b6\u548c\u53d1\u5c55\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528PRISMA\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7efc\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7ea6500\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa30\u7bc7\u5e94\u7528\u504f\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u97f3\u9891\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5e76\u6309\u65f6\u95f4\u9636\u6bb5\uff082021\u5e74\u524d\u540e\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u97f3\u9891\u504f\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\u7814\u7a76\u4ece\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u8f6c\u5411\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4ece\u4f20\u7edfrankSVM\u65b9\u6cd5\u8f6c\u5411\u73b0\u4ee3RLHF\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u591a\u7ef4\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ba1\u9053\u878d\u5408\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u504f\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u97f3\u9891\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6355\u6349\u81ea\u7136\u5ea6\u548c\u97f3\u4e50\u6027\u7b49\u4e3b\u89c2\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u3001\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u97f3\u9891\u7279\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u504f\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "relevance": 65.0}}

Yet the quadratic nature of the $\\ell_2$ penalty embedded in weight decay drives all parameters toward the origin at the same rate, making the update vulnerable to rare but extreme gradient directions and often over-penalizing well-conditioned coordinates. We propose AdamHuberDecay, a drop-in replacement for AdamW that substitutes the $\\ell_2$ penalty with a decoupled smooth Huber regularizer. The resulting update decays parameters quadratically while their magnitude remains below a threshold $\u03b4$, and linearly ($\\ell_1$-like) once they exceed $\u03b4$, yielding (i) bounded regularization gradients, (ii) invariance to per-coordinate second-moment rescaling, and (iii) stronger sparsity pressure on overgrown weights.\n  We derive the closed-form decoupled Huber decay step and show how to integrate it with any Adam-family optimizer at $O(1)$ extra cost. Extensive experiments on GPT-2 and GPT-3 pre-training demonstrate that AdamHuberDecay (a) converges 10-15% faster in wall-clock time, (b) reduces validation perplexity by up to 4 points, (c) delivers performance improvements of 2.5-4.7% across downstream tasks, and (d) yields visibly sparser weight histograms that translate into 20-30% memory savings after magnitude pruning, without tuning the decay coefficient beyond the default grid used for AdamW. Ablations confirm robustness to outlier gradients and large-batch regimes, together with theoretical analyses that bound the expected parameter norm under noisy updates. AdamHuberDecay therefore provides a simple, principled path toward more efficient and resilient training of next-generation foundational generative transformers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AdamHuberDecay\u4f5c\u4e3aAdamW\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5e73\u6ed1Huber\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u66ff\u4ee3\u2113\u2082\u60e9\u7f5a\uff0c\u5728GPT-2\u548cGPT-3\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u6536\u655b\u3001\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfAdamW\u4e2d\u7684\u2113\u2082\u60e9\u7f5a\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u53c2\u6570\u4ee5\u76f8\u540c\u901f\u7387\u5411\u539f\u70b9\u6536\u7f29\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u6781\u7aef\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u6761\u4ef6\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5750\u6807\u8fc7\u5ea6\u60e9\u7f5a\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06AdamW\u4e2d\u7684\u2113\u2082\u60e9\u7f5a\u66ff\u6362\u4e3a\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1Huber\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u5f53\u53c2\u6570\u5e45\u5ea6\u4f4e\u4e8e\u9608\u503c\u03b4\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u4e8c\u6b21\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7\u03b4\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u7ebf\u6027\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301O(1)\u989d\u5916\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5728GPT-2\u548cGPT-3\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\uff1a\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u534710-15%\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u6700\u591a4\u70b9\uff0c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u53472.5-4.7%\uff0c\u6743\u91cd\u76f4\u65b9\u56fe\u66f4\u7a00\u758f\uff0c\u5e45\u5ea6\u526a\u679d\u540e\u5185\u5b58\u8282\u770120-30%\u3002", "conclusion": "AdamHuberDecay\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u57fa\u7840\u751f\u6210Transformer\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8c03\u6574\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u5373\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

Most existing methods, whether using invasive sensors or computer vision, rely on two-stage pipelines, which result in high intrusiveness, intensive computation, and poor real-time performance on embedded edge devices. Inspired by YOLOv11-Pose, a lightweight single-stage network for sitting posture recognition on embedded edge devices termed LSP-YOLO was proposed. By integrating partial convolution(PConv) and Similarity-Aware Activation Module(SimAM), a lightweight module, Light-C3k2, was designed to reduce computational cost while maintaining feature extraction capability. In the recognition head, keypoints were directly mapped to posture classes through pointwise convolution, and intermediate supervision was employed to enable efficient fusion of pose estimation and classification. Furthermore, a dataset containing 5,000 images across six posture categories was constructed for model training and testing. The smallest trained model, LSP-YOLO-n, achieved 94.2% accuracy and 251 Fps on personal computer(PC) with a model size of only 1.9 MB. Meanwhile, real-time and high-accuracy inference under constrained computational resources was demonstrated on the SV830C + GC030A platform.

However, in real-world scenarios, lacking labeled data often prevents practitioners from obtaining well-performing models, thereby forcing practitioners to highly rely on prompt-based approaches that are often tedious, inefficient, and driven by trial and error. To alleviate this issue of lacking labeled data, we present a learning framework integrating LLMs with active learning for unlabeled dataset (LAUD).

Benefiting from the residual connections, modern neural networks can scale up to more than one hundred layers and enjoy wide success. However, as networks continue to deepen, current architectures often struggle to realize their theoretical capacity improvements, calling for more advanced designs to further unleash the potential of deeper networks. In this paper, we identify two key barriers that obstruct residual models from scaling deeper: shortcut degradation and limited width. Shortcut degradation hinders deep-layer learning, while the inherent depth-width trade-off imposes limited width. To mitigate these issues, we propose a generalized residual architecture dubbed Step by Step Network (StepsNet) to bridge the gap between theoretical potential and practical performance of deep models. Specifically, we separate features along the channel dimension and let the model learn progressively via stacking blocks with increasing width. The resulting method mitigates the two identified problems and serves as a versatile macro design applicable to various models. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently outperforms residual models across diverse tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and language modeling. These results position StepsNet as a superior generalization of the widely adopted residual architecture.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Step by Step Network (StepsNet)\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u969c\u788d\uff1a\u6377\u5f84\u9000\u5316\u548c\u6709\u9650\u5bbd\u5ea6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u901a\u9053\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u79bb\u548c\u9010\u6b65\u589e\u52a0\u5bbd\u5ea6\u7684\u5757\u5806\u53e0\u6765\u91ca\u653e\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u7f51\u7edc\u6df1\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u67b6\u6784\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u7684\u5bb9\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6377\u5f84\u9000\u5316\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6-\u5bbd\u5ea6\u6743\u8861\u9650\u5236\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6765\u5145\u5206\u53d1\u6325\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faStepsNet\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u901a\u9053\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5206\u79bb\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5806\u53e0\u5bbd\u5ea6\u9010\u6e10\u589e\u52a0\u7684\u5757\u6765\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u9010\u6b65\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u6377\u5f84\u9000\u5316\u548c\u5bbd\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u7b49\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cStepsNet\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u6b8b\u5dee\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6b8b\u5dee\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "StepsNet\u662f\u5e7f\u6cdb\u91c7\u7528\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u91ca\u653e\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "relevance": 75.0}}

However, existing deep-learning approaches rely heavily on modality-specific training, large annotated datasets, and controlled scanning conditions, which limit generalization across devices and hinder deployment in real clinical workflows. Moreover, raw intraoral meshes exhibit substantial variation in arch pose, incomplete geometry caused by occlusion or tooth contact, and a lack of texture cues, making unified semantic interpretation highly challenging. To address these limitations, we propose ArchMap, a training-free and knowledge-guided framework for robust structured dental understanding. ArchMap first introduces a geometry-aware arch-flattening module that standardizes raw 3D meshes into spatially aligned, continuity-preserving multi-view projections. We then construct a Dental Knowledge Base (DKB) encoding hierarchical tooth ontology, dentition-stage policies, and clinical semantics to constrain the symbolic reasoning space. We validate ArchMap on 1060 pre-/post-orthodontic cases, demonstrating robust performance in tooth counting, anatomical partitioning, dentition-stage classification, and the identification of clinical conditions such as crowding, missing teeth, prosthetics, and caries.

While existing benchmarks like LoCoBench~\\cite{qiu2025locobench} assess long-context code understanding, they focus on single-turn evaluation and cannot capture the multi-turn interactive nature, tool usage patterns, and adaptive reasoning required by real-world coding agents. We introduce \\textbf{LoCoBench-Agent}, a comprehensive evaluation framework specifically designed to assess LLM agents in realistic, long-context software engineering workflows. Our framework extends LoCoBench's 8,000 scenarios into interactive agent environments, enabling systematic evaluation of multi-turn conversations, tool usage efficiency, error recovery, and architectural consistency across extended development sessions. We also introduce an evaluation methodology with 9 metrics across comprehension and efficiency dimensions. Our framework provides agents with 8 specialized tools (file operations, search, code analysis) and evaluates them across context lengths ranging from 10K to 1M tokens, enabling precise assessment of long-context performance. Through systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art models, we reveal several key findings: (1) agents exhibit remarkable long-context robustness; (2) comprehension-efficiency trade-off exists with negative correlation, where thorough exploration increases comprehension but reduces efficiency; and (3) conversation efficiency varies dramatically across models, with strategic tool usage patterns differentiating high-performing agents.

For drug discovery specifically, a key inflection - akin to vision's \"ImageNet moment\" - arrived in 2015, when deep neural networks surpassed traditional approaches on the Tox21 Data Challenge. This milestone accelerated the adoption of deep learning across the pharmaceutical industry, and today most major companies have integrated these methods into their research pipelines. After the Tox21 Challenge concluded, its dataset was included in several established benchmarks, such as MoleculeNet and the Open Graph Benchmark. However, during these integrations, the dataset was altered and labels were imputed or manufactured, resulting in a loss of comparability across studies. Consequently, the extent to which bioactivity and toxicity prediction methods have improved over the past decade remains unclear. To this end, we introduce a reproducible leaderboard, hosted on Hugging Face with the original Tox21 Challenge dataset, together with a set of baseline and representative methods. The current version of the leaderboard indicates that the original Tox21 winner - the ensemble-based DeepTox method - and the descriptor-based self-normalizing neural networks introduced in 2017, continue to perform competitively and rank among the top methods for toxicity prediction, leaving it unclear whether substantial progress in toxicity prediction has been achieved over the past decade.

These factors hinder the stability of appearance-based similarity metrics and often lead to convergence failures or anatomically implausible alignments. To address these limitations, we propose DentalSCR, a pose-stable, contour-guided framework for accurate and interpretable silhouette-to-contour registration. Our method first constructs a U-Midline Dental Axis (UMDA) to establish a unified cross-arch anatomical coordinate system, thereby stabilizing initialization and standardizing projection geometry across cases. Using this reference frame, we generate radiograph-like projections via a surface-based DRR formulation with coronal-axis perspective and Gaussian splatting, which preserves clinical source-object-detector magnification and emphasizes external silhouettes. Registration is then formulated as a 2D similarity transform optimized with a symmetric bidirectional Chamfer distance under a hierarchical coarse-to-fine schedule, enabling both large capture range and subpixel-level contour agreement. We evaluate DentalSCR on 34 expert-annotated clinical cases. Experimental results demonstrate substantial reductions in landmark error-particularly at posterior teeth-tighter dispersion on the lower jaw, and low Chamfer and controlled Hausdorff distances at the curve level.

Consequently, users may act strategically to obtain more favorable outcomes, effectively contesting the platform's predictions. While past work has studied strategic user behavior on learning platforms, the focus has largely been on strategic responses to a deployed model, without considering the behavior of other users. In contrast, look-ahead reasoning takes into account that user actions are coupled, and -- at scale -- impact future predictions. Within this framework, we first formalize level-$k$ thinking, a concept from behavioral economics, where users aim to outsmart their peers by looking one step ahead. We show that, while convergence to an equilibrium is accelerated, the equilibrium remains the same, providing no benefit of higher-level reasoning for individuals in the long run. Then, we focus on collective reasoning, where users take coordinated actions by optimizing through their joint impact on the model. By contrasting collective with selfish behavior, we characterize the benefits and limits of coordination; a new notion of alignment between the learner's and the users' utilities emerges as a key concept. We discuss connections to several related mathematical frameworks, including strategic classification, performative prediction, and algorithmic collective action.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\u7528\u6237\u7684\u6218\u7565\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e86\u81ea\u79c1\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u96c6\u4f53\u534f\u8c03\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u63a8\u7406\u5c42\u7ea7\u5bf9\u5747\u8861\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u6548\u7528\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5b66\u4e60\u5e73\u53f0\u4f18\u5316\u6807\u51c6\u53cd\u6620\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8005\u800c\u975e\u7528\u6237\u7684\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7528\u6237\u91c7\u53d6\u6218\u7565\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u6765\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u6709\u5229\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5bf9\u5df2\u90e8\u7f72\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6218\u7565\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e86\u884c\u4e3a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684k\u7ea7\u601d\u7ef4\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u901a\u8fc7\u5411\u524d\u770b\u4e00\u6b65\u6765\u8d85\u8d8a\u540c\u4f34\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u96c6\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u8c03\u884c\u52a8\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u867d\u7136k\u7ea7\u601d\u7ef4\u52a0\u901f\u4e86\u5747\u8861\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u4f46\u5747\u8861\u72b6\u6001\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0d\u53d8\uff0c\u9ad8\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u957f\u671f\u5bf9\u4e2a\u4f53\u65e0\u76ca\uff1b\u96c6\u4f53\u534f\u8c03\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u81ea\u79c1\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6bd4\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u6536\u76ca\u548c\u9650\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u6548\u7528\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8fde\u63a5\u4e86\u6218\u7565\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u6267\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u96c6\u4f53\u884c\u52a8\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "relevance": 45.0}}

However, existing approaches are constrained by small-scale training with annotations that are typical short and coarse, restricting generalization to nuanced transitions in long videos. We introduce ARC-Chapter, the first large-scale video chaptering model trained on over million-level long video chapters, featuring bilingual, temporally grounded, and hierarchical chapter annotations. To achieve this goal, we curated a bilingual English-Chinese chapter dataset via a structured pipeline that unifies ASR transcripts, scene texts, visual captions into multi-level annotations, from short title to long summaries. We demonstrate clear performance improvements with data scaling, both in data volume and label intensity. Moreover, we design a new evaluation metric termed GRACE, which incorporates many-to-one segment overlaps and semantic similarity, better reflecting real-world chaptering flexibility. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARC-Chapter establishes a new state-of-the-art by a significant margin, outperforming the previous best by 14.0% in F1 score and 11.3% in SODA score.

While large language models (LLMs) show promise for automatically repairing flaky tests, existing approaches like FlakyDoctor fail in industrial settings due to the context problem: providing either too little context (missing critical production code) or too much context (overwhelming the LLM with irrelevant information). We present FlakyGuard, which addresses this problem by treating code as a graph structure and using selective graph exploration to find only the most relevant context.

However, ConvLSTM and its variants are computationally expensive, which makes them inapplicable in edge devices with limited computational resources. With the emerging need for edge computing in CPS, efficient AI is essential to reduce the computational cost while preserving the model performance. Common methods of efficient AI are developed to reduce redundancy in model capacity (i.e., model pruning, compression, etc.). However, spatiotemporal data mining naturally requires extensive model capacity, as the embedded dependencies in spatiotemporal data are complex and hard to capture, which limits the model redundancy. Instead, there is a fairly high level of data and feature redundancy that introduces an unnecessary computational burden, which has been largely overlooked in existing research. Therefore, we developed a novel framework SparseST, that pioneered in exploiting data sparsity to develop an efficient spatiotemporal model.

However, its use of low-degree spherical harmonics limits its ability to capture spatially varying color and view-dependent effects such as specular highlights. Existing works augment Gaussians with either a global texture map, which struggles with complex scenes, or per-Gaussian texture maps, which introduces high storage overhead. We propose Image-Based Gaussian Splatting, an efficient alternative that leverages high-resolution source images for fine details and view-specific color modeling. Specifically, we model each pixel color as a combination of a base color from standard 3DGS rendering and a learned residual inferred from neighboring training images. This promotes accurate surface alignment and enables rendering images of high-frequency details and accurate view-dependent effects.

Accordingly, it remains unclear how and to what extent AI can accelerate innovation. To help to fill this gap, we report results from 32 interviews with U.S.-based academic manufacturing and materials sciences researchers experienced with AI and machine learning (ML) techniques. Interviewees primarily used AI for modeling of materials and manufacturing processes, facilitating cheaper and more rapid search of design spaces for materials and manufacturing processes alike. They report benefits including cost, time, and computation savings in technology development. However, interviewees also report that AI/ML tools are unreliable outside design spaces for which dense data are already available; that they require skilled and judicious application in tandem with older research techniques; and that AI/ML tools may detrimentally circumvent opportunities for disruptive theoretical advancement. Based on these results, we suggest there is reason for optimism about acceleration in sustaining innovations through the use of to AI/ML; but that support for conventional empirical, computational, and theoretical research is required to maintain the likelihood of further major advances in manufacturing and materials science.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc732\u4f4d\u7f8e\u56fd\u5b66\u672f\u5236\u9020\u548c\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u7684\u8bbf\u8c08\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8AI\u5728\u521b\u65b0\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0AI\u4e3b\u8981\u7528\u4e8e\u6750\u6599\u548c\u5236\u9020\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u9886\u57df\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u586b\u8865AI\u5982\u4f55\u52a0\u901f\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u5730\u8c03\u7814\u4e86\u89e3AI\u5728\u5236\u9020\u548c\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u5e94\u7528\u6548\u679c\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5bf932\u4f4d\u7f8e\u56fd\u5b66\u672f\u5236\u9020\u548c\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u8fdb\u884c\u534a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bbf\u8c08\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u90fd\u6709AI\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u5e94\u7528\u7ecf\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "AI\u4e3b\u8981\u7528\u4e8e\u6750\u6599\u548c\u5236\u9020\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6280\u672f\u5f00\u53d1\u6210\u672c\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\uff1b\u4f46\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u9886\u57df\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u963b\u788d\u98a0\u8986\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u7a81\u7834\u3002", "conclusion": "AI/ML\u6709\u671b\u52a0\u901f\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u521b\u65b0\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u7ee7\u7eed\u652f\u6301\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\u5236\u9020\u548c\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u91cd\u5927\u7a81\u7834\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "relevance": 20.0}}

Our method incorporates heterogeneous data into the self-improvement process, including demonstrations, data from on-policy collection, and expert teleoperated interventions provided during autonomous execution. RECAP starts by pre-training a generalist VLA with offline RL, which we call $\u03c0^{*}_{0.6}$, that can then be specialized to attain high performance on downstream tasks through on-robot data collection. We show that the $\u03c0^{*}_{0.6}$ model trained with the full RECAP method can fold laundry in real homes, reliably assemble boxes, and make espresso drinks using a professional espresso machine.

Generally, detection performance heavily depends on the discriminative feature representation between target and background. Existing methods typically treat deblurring as a preprocessing step focused on visual quality, while neglecting the enhancement of task-relevant features crucial for detection. Improving feature representation for detection under blur conditions remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel Joint Feature-Domain Deblurring and Detection end-to-end framework, dubbed JFD3. We design a dual-branch architecture with shared weights, where the clear branch guides the blurred branch to enhance discriminative feature representation. Specifically, we first introduce a lightweight feature restoration network, where features from the clear branch serve as feature-level supervision to guide the blurred branch, thereby enhancing its distinctive capability for detection. We then propose a frequency structure guidance module that refines the structure prior from the restoration network and integrates it into shallow detection layers to enrich target structural information. Finally, a feature consistency self-supervised loss is imposed between the dual-branch detection backbones, driving the blurred branch to approximate the feature representations of the clear one. Wealso construct a benchmark, named IRBlurUAV, containing 30,000 simulated and 4,118 real infrared UAV target images with diverse motion blur. Extensive experiments on IRBlurUAV demonstrate that JFD3 achieves superior detection performance while maintaining real-time efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faJFD3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u8fdb\u884c\u7279\u5f81\u57df\u53bb\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u5171\u4eab\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6e05\u6670\u5206\u652f\u6307\u5bfc\u6a21\u7cca\u5206\u652f\u589e\u5f3a\u68c0\u6d4b\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a", "motivation": "\u7ea2\u5916\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u76ee\u6807\u56fe\u50cf\u5e38\u56e0\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5feb\u901f\u79fb\u52a8\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u7cca\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u80cc\u666f\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u53bb\u6a21\u7cca\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u589e\u5f3a", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5171\u4eab\u6743\u91cd\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u6062\u590d\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6e05\u6670\u5206\u652f\u7279\u5f81\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76d1\u7763\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u9891\u7387\u7ed3\u6784\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u6d45\u5c42\u68c0\u6d4b\u5c42\uff1b\u65bd\u52a0\u7279\u5f81\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u635f\u5931", "result": "\u5728IRBlurUAV\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u6548\u7387", "conclusion": "JFD3\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u7cca\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5224\u522b\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd", "relevance": 30.0}}

Therefore, the effectiveness of Physical Adversarial Examples (PAEs) on stereo-based binocular depth estimation remains largely unexplored. To this end, we propose the first texture-enabled physical adversarial attack against stereo matching models in the context of autonomous driving. Our method employs a 3D PAE with global camouflage texture rather than a local 2D patch-based one, ensuring both visual consistency and attack effectiveness across different viewpoints of stereo cameras. To cope with the disparity effect of these cameras, we also propose a new 3D stereo matching rendering module that allows the PAE to be aligned with real-world positions and headings in binocular vision.

We contribute an alias-aware evaluation protocol that credits rename while never rewarding deleted paths, and a practical Forgetting Probe that quantifies residual emissions of obsolete paths. Across Flask, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Poetry, Inc-FT with old-aware mixes delivers the best overall balance on mixed sets, ICL with English delta summaries delivers the fastest new-code lift when training is not feasible, and Full Refresh remains the ceiling when maximum NEW accuracy matters.

Our previous work revealed a critical puzzle: the 2-parameter adaptive L-JacobiNet often suffered from high variance and was surprisingly outperformed by the 0-parameter, stabilized-static S-JacobiNet. This suggested that stabilization was more critical than adaptation in this domain. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{GegenbauerNet}, a novel GNN filter based on the Gegenbauer polynomials, to find the Optimal Compromise in this trade-off. By enforcing symmetry (alpha=beta) but allowing a single shape parameter (lambda) to be learned, GegenbauerNet limits flexibility (variance) while escaping the fixed bias of S-JacobiNet. We demonstrate that GegenbauerNet (1-parameter) achieves superior performance in the key local filtering regime (K=2 on heterophilic graphs) where overfitting is minimal, validating the hypothesis that a controlled, symmetric degree of freedom is optimal. Furthermore, our comprehensive K-ablation study across homophilic and heterophilic graphs, using 7 diverse datasets, clarifies the domain's behavior: the fully adaptive L-JacobiNet maintains the highest performance on high-K filtering tasks, showing the value of maximum flexibility when regularization is managed.

To address this limitation, we introduce TLS-Assist, a modular redundancy layer that augments LLM-based autonomous driving agents with explicit traffic light and sign recognition. TLS-Assist converts detections into structured natural language messages that are injected into the LLM input, enforcing explicit attention to safety-critical cues. The framework is plug-and-play, model-agnostic, and supports both single-view and multi-view camera setups. We evaluate TLS-Assist in a closed-loop setup on the LangAuto benchmark in CARLA.

However, for speech LLMs that generate acoustic tokens, exact token matching is overly restrictive: many discrete tokens are acoustically or semantically interchangeable, reducing acceptance rates and limiting speedups. We introduce Principled Coarse-Graining (PCG), which verifies proposals at the level of Acoustic Similarity Groups (ASGs) derived from the target model's embedding space. By splitting each token's probability mass across the overlapping groups that contain it, we define an overlap-aware coarse-grained distribution and perform rejection sampling on the resulting group variable.

While traditional methods estimate the human in image coordinates, many applications require human motion to be estimated in world coordinates. This is particularly challenging when there is both human and camera motion. Progress on this topic has been limited by the lack of rich video data with ground truth human and camera movement. We address this with BEDLAM2.0, a new dataset that goes beyond the popular BEDLAM dataset in important ways. In addition to introducing more diverse and realistic cameras and camera motions, BEDLAM2.0 increases diversity and realism of body shape, motions, clothing, hair, and 3D environments. Additionally, it adds shoes, which were missing in BEDLAM. BEDLAM has become a key resource for training 3D human pose and motion regressors today and we show that BEDLAM2.0 is significantly better, particularly for training methods that estimate humans in world coordinates. We compare state-of-the art methods trained on BEDLAM and BEDLAM2.0, and find that BEDLAM2.0 significantly improves accuracy over BEDLAM.

However, most existing methods, particularly autoregressive (AR) frameworks, primarily rely on straightforward temporal sequencing of multi-channel EEG data, which fails to capture the rich physiological characteristics inherent to EEG signals. Moreover, their time-centered modeling approach also limits the effective representation of the dynamic spatial topology of brain activity. To address these challenges and fully exploit the potential of large-scale EEG models, we propose a novel Topology Hierarchical Derived Brain Autoregressive Modeling (THD-BAR) for EEG generic representations. The core innovation of THD-BAR lies in the introduction of the Brain Topology Hierarchy (BTH), which establishes a multi-scale spatial order for EEG channels. This hierarchical structure enables a redefinition of autoregressive learning as a \"next-scale-time prediction\" problem, effectively capturing both spatial and temporal dynamics. Based on BTH, we design a Topology-Hierarchical Vector Quantized-Variational Autoencoder (THVQ-VAE) for multi-scale tokenization and develop an enhanced Brain Autoregressive (BAR) module with specialized masking strategies for prediction. Through extensive large-scale pre-training on 17 datasets, followed by rigorous validation on 10 downstream datasets spanning 5 distinct tasks, THD-BAR consistently outperforms existing methods.

The approach incorporates the concept of smooth wing camber variation, where the camber of the wing's chord is actively adjusted during flight using a control signal to achieve the desired aerodynamic loading. The proposed method employs a deep learning-based model predictive controller designed for probability density shaping. This controller effectively solves the probability density evolution equation through a custom Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) and utilizes Automatic Differentiation for Model Predictive Control (MPC) optimization. Comprehensive numerical simulations were conducted on a compliant wing (CW) model, evaluating performance of the proposed approach against stochastic gust profiles.

Existing methods face a fundamental dilemma. On one hand, projecting all domains into a single unified visual space leads to inter-domain interference and semantic distortion, as large shifts may vary with not only visual appearance but also underlying semantics. On the other hand, isolating domain-specific parameters causes knowledge fragmentation, creating \"knowledge islands\" that hamper knowledge reuse and exacerbate forgetting. To address this issue, we propose LAVA (Language-Anchored Visual Alignment), a novel DIL framework that replaces direct feature alignment with relative alignment driven by a text-based reference anchor. LAVA guides the visual representations of each incoming domain to preserve a consistent relative geometry, which is defined by mirroring the pairwise semantic similarities between the class names. This anchored geometric structure acts as a bridge across domains, enabling the retrieval of class-aware prior knowledge and facilitating robust feature aggregation. Extensive experiments on standard DIL benchmarks demonstrate that LAVA achieves significant performance improvements over state-of-the-arts.

For evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark across ten datasets, covering clean and corrupted image recognition, texture-shape cue conflict tests, silhouette recognition, depth-order classification, and the visual cliff paradigm. All CATDiet variants demonstrate enhanced robustness in object recognition, despite being trained solely on object-centric videos. Remarkably, models also exhibit biologically aligned developmental patterns, including neural plasticity changes mirroring synaptic density in macaque V1 and behaviors resembling infants' visual cliff responses. Building on these insights, CombDiet initializes SSL with CATDiet before standard training while preserving temporal continuity. Trained on object-centric or head-mounted infant videos, CombDiet outperforms standard SSL on both in-domain and out-of-domain object recognition and depth perception.

Analytically, for unequal service rates and total-time patience, we show that total wait grows linearly so abandonment is inevitable and the probability of a successful jockey vanishes as the backlog approaches towards infinity. Furthermore, under a mild sub-linear error condition both information models yield the same asymptotic limits (robustness).

Our findings show that learned and analytic feeds produce different delays, reneging rates and transient jockeying behavior at practical sizes, but converge to the same asymptotic outcome implied by our theory.

While event cameras offer potential solutions with superior low-light sensitivity and high temporal resolution, existing fusion methods typically employ staged strategies, limiting their effectiveness against combined low-light and motion blur degradations. To overcome this, we propose CompEvent, a complex neural network framework enabling holistic full-process fusion of event data and RGB frames for enhanced joint restoration. CompEvent features two core components: 1) Complex Temporal Alignment GRU, which utilizes complex-valued convolutions and processes video and event streams iteratively via GRU to achieve temporal alignment and continuous fusion; and 2) Complex Space-Frequency Learning module, which performs unified complex-valued signal processing in both spatial and frequency domains, facilitating deep fusion through spatial structures and system-level characteristics. By leveraging the holistic representation capability of complex-valued neural networks, CompEvent achieves full-process spatiotemporal fusion, maximizes complementary learning between modalities, and significantly strengthens low-light video deblurring capability.

However, current technologies provide only sparse, static snapshots of cell states and are inherently influenced by technical noise, complicating the inference and representation of continuous transcriptional dynamics. Although embedding methods can reduce dimensionality and mitigate technical noise, the majority of existing approaches typically treat trajectory inference separately from embedding construction, often neglecting temporal structure. To address this challenge, here we introduce CellStream, a novel deep learning framework that jointly learns embedding and cellular dynamics from single-cell snapshot data by integrating an autoencoder with unbalanced dynamical optimal transport. Compared to existing methods, CellStream generates dynamics-informed embeddings that robustly capture temporal developmental processes while maintaining high consistency with the underlying data manifold.

However, naive RAG methods struggle with multi-hop question answering due to their limited capacity to capture complex dependencies across documents. Recent studies employ graph-based RAG to capture document connections. However, these approaches often result in a loss of semantic coherence and introduce irrelevant noise during node matching and subgraph construction. To address these limitations, we propose NeuroPath, an LLM-driven semantic path tracking RAG framework inspired by the path navigational planning of place cells in neurobiology. It consists of two steps: Dynamic Path Tracking and Post-retrieval Completion. Dynamic Path Tracking performs goal-directed semantic path tracking and pruning over the constructed knowledge graph (KG), improving noise reduction and semantic coherence. Post-retrieval Completion further reinforces these benefits by conducting second-stage retrieval using intermediate reasoning and the original query to refine the query goal and complete missing information in the reasoning path. NeuroPath surpasses current state-of-the-art baselines on three multi-hop QA datasets, achieving average improvements of 16.3% on recall@2 and 13.5% on recall@5 over advanced graph-based RAG methods. Moreover, compared to existing iter-based RAG methods, NeuroPath achieves higher accuracy and reduces token consumption by 22.8%. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of NeuroPath across four smaller LLMs (Llama3.1, GLM4, Mistral0.3, and Gemma3), and further validate its scalability across tasks of varying complexity.

The task is particularly challenging for smallholder farms, where accurate delineation requires the use of high resolution (HR) imagery which are available only at low revisit frequencies (e.g., annually). To support more frequent (sub-) seasonal monitoring, HR images could be combined as references (ref) with low resolution (LR) images -- having higher revisit frequency (e.g., weekly) -- using reference-based super-resolution (Ref-SR) methods. However, current Ref-SR methods optimize perceptual quality and smooth over crucial features needed for downstream tasks, and are unable to meet the large scale-factor requirements for this task. Further, previous two-step approaches of SR followed by segmentation do not effectively utilize diverse satellite sources as inputs. We address these problems through a new approach, $\\textbf{SEED-SR}$, which uses a combination of conditional latent diffusion models and large-scale multi-spectral, multi-source geo-spatial foundation models. Our key innovation is to bypass the explicit SR task in the pixel space and instead perform SR in a segmentation-aware latent space. This unique approach enables us to generate segmentation maps at an unprecedented 20$\\times$ scale factor, and rigorous experiments on two large, real datasets demonstrate up to $\\textbf{25.5}$ and $\\textbf{12.9}$ relative improvement in instance and semantic segmentation metrics respectively over approaches based on state-of-the-art Ref-SR methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "SEED-SR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u519c\u4e1a\u8fb9\u754c\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6761\u4ef6\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5272\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b020\u500d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u56e0\u5b50\u7684\u5206\u5272\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5c0f\u519c\u6237\u519c\u573a\u8fb9\u754c\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u56e0\u5b50\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4e14\u4e24\u6b65\u6cd5\uff08\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387+\u5206\u5272\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6e90\u536b\u661f\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u6761\u4ef6\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u3001\u591a\u6e90\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5272\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u6267\u884c\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u50cf\u7d20\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5927\u578b\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u6307\u6807\u5206\u522b\u76f8\u5bf9\u6700\u5148\u8fdbRef-SR\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u534725.5%\u548c12.9%\u3002", "conclusion": "SEED-SR\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u519c\u4e1a\u8fb9\u754c\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5c0f\u519c\u6237\u519c\u573a\u76d1\u6d4b\u3002", "relevance": 10.0}}

However, generalization is still a key limitation for the current system, which refers to the ability to handle unseen scenarios or unfamiliar sensor configurations.Related works have explored the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to address few-shot or zero-shot tasks. While promising, these methods introduce a new challenge: the emergence of a hybrid AD system, where two distinct systems are used to plan a trajectory, leading to potential inconsistencies. Alternative research directions have explored Vision-Language-Action (VLA) frameworks that generate control actions from VLM directly. However, these end-to-end solutions demonstrate prohibitive computational demands. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Risk Semantic Distillation (RSD), a novel framework that leverages VLMs to enhance the training of End-to-End (E2E) AD backbones. By providing risk attention for key objects, RSD addresses the issue of generalization. Specifically, we introduce RiskHead, a plug-in module that distills causal risk estimates from Vision-Language Models into Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features, yielding interpretable risk-attention maps.This approach allows BEV features to learn richer and more nuanced risk attention representations, which directly enhance the model's ability to handle spatial boundaries and risky objects.By focusing on risk attention, RSD aligns better with human-like driving behavior, which is essential to navigate in complex and dynamic environments. Our experiments on the Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of RSD in managing complex and unpredictable driving conditions. Due to the enhanced BEV representations enabled by RSD, we observed a significant improvement in both perception and planning capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRisk Semantic Distillation (RSD)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u589e\u5f3a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7RiskHead\u6a21\u5757\u5c06\u98ce\u9669\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u84b8\u998f\u5230BEV\u7279\u5f81\u4e2d\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524d\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5904\u7406\u672a\u89c1\u573a\u666f\u548c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u5bfc\u81f4\u6df7\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165RiskHead\u63d2\u4ef6\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4ece\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u84b8\u998f\u56e0\u679c\u98ce\u9669\u4f30\u8ba1\u5230BEV\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\uff0c\u4f7fBEV\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728Bench2Drive\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cRSD\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "RSD\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u98ce\u9669\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u84b8\u998f\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f7fBEV\u7279\u5f81\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5904\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u5bf9\u8c61\u3002", "relevance": 45.0}}

Inspired by the probabilistic behavior of quantum particles in a stellar core, the algorithm implements three primary components that augment standard DE mechanisms: 1) probabilistically selected mutation strategies and scaling factors; 2) rank-based crossover rates; 3) asymptotically decaying reinitialization that leverages a covariance matrix of the best solutions to introduce high-quality genetic diversity.\n  QUASAR's performance establishes it as an effective, user-friendly optimizer for complex high-dimensional problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "QUASAR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u5ea6\u968f\u673a\u67b6\u6784\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u503c\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u5dee\u5206\u8fdb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u7ef4\u975e\u53ef\u5fae\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\u707e\u96be\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u6536\u655b\u7f13\u6162\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5dee\u5206\u8fdb\u5316\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u91cf\u5b50\u7c92\u5b50\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u968f\u673a\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u6982\u7387\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u7f29\u653e\u56e0\u5b50\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u6392\u540d\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u7387\u3001\u5229\u7528\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u8870\u51cf\u91cd\u65b0\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728CEC2017\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u768429\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u4f4eFriedman\u79e9\u548c(150)\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eL-SHADE(229)\u548c\u6807\u51c6DE(305)\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u53471.4-7.8\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "QUASAR\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u9ad8\u7ef4\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u7528\u6237\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u3002", "relevance": 15.0}}

However, this comes at the price of a deterioration in image quality due to the low dose of radiation used to reduce the risk of secondary cancer development. While some efficient methods have been proposed to enhance LDCT quality, many overestimate noise and perform excessive smoothing, leading to a loss of critical details. In this paper, we introduce D-PerceptCT, a novel architecture inspired by key principles of the Human Visual System (HVS) to enhance LDCT images. The objective is to guide the model to enhance or preserve perceptually relevant features, thereby providing radiologists with CT images where critical anatomical structures and fine pathological details are perceptu- ally visible. D-PerceptCT consists of two main blocks: 1) a Visual Dual-path Extractor (ViDex), which integrates semantic priors from a pretrained DINOv2 model with local spatial features, allowing the network to incorporate semantic-awareness during enhancement; (2) a Global-Local State-Space block that captures long-range information and multiscale features to preserve the important structures and fine details for diagnosis. In addition, we propose a novel deep perceptual loss, designated as the Deep Perceptual Relevancy Loss Function (DPRLF), which is inspired by human contrast sensitivity, to further emphasize perceptually important features.

However, current deep learning methodologies in this area are frequently constrained by the scarcity of high-quality paired datasets. Since it is difficult to obtain pristine reference labels in underwater scenes, existing benchmarks often rely on manually selected results from enhancement algorithms, providing debatable reference images that lack globally consistent color and authentic supervision. This limits the model's capabilities in color restoration, image enhancement, and generalization. To overcome this limitation, we propose using in-air natural images as unambiguous reference targets and translating them into underwater-degraded versions, thereby constructing synthetic datasets that provide authentic supervision signals for model learning. Specifically, we establish a generative data framework based on unpaired image-to-image translation, producing a large-scale dataset that covers 6 representative underwater degradation types. The framework constructs synthetic datasets with precise ground-truth labels, which facilitate the learning of an accurate mapping from degraded underwater images to their pristine scene appearances. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments across 6 representative network architectures and 3 independent test sets show that models trained on our synthetic data achieve comparable or superior color restoration and generalization performance to those trained on existing benchmarks.

Yet, current-generation EMS infrastructure remains constrained by one-to-one video streaming and limited analytics capabilities, leaving dispatchers and EMTs to manually interpret overwhelming, often noisy or redundant information in high-stress environments. We present TeleEMS, a mobile live video analytics system that enables pre-arrival multimodal inference by fusing audio and video into a unified decision-making pipeline before EMTs arrive on scene.\n  TeleEMS comprises two key components: TeleEMS Client and TeleEMS Server. The TeleEMS Client runs across phones, smart glasses, and desktops to support bystanders, EMTs en route, and 911 dispatchers. The TeleEMS Server, deployed at the edge, integrates EMS-Stream, a communication backbone that enables smooth multi-party video streaming. On top of EMSStream, the server hosts three real-time analytics modules: (1) audio-to-symptom analytics via EMSLlama, a domain-specialized LLM for robust symptom extraction and normalization; (2) video-to-vital analytics using state-of-the-art rPPG methods for heart rate estimation; and (3) joint text-vital analytics via PreNet, a multimodal multitask model predicting EMS protocols, medication types, medication quantities, and procedures.\n  Evaluation shows that EMSLlama outperforms GPT-4o (exact-match 0.89 vs. 0.57) and that text-vital fusion improves inference robustness, enabling reliable pre-arrival intervention recommendations. TeleEMS demonstrates the potential of mobile live video analytics to transform EMS operations, bridging the gap between bystanders, dispatchers, and EMTs, and paving the way for next-generation intelligent EMS infrastructure.", "AI": {"tldr": "TeleEMS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u79fb\u52a8\u5b9e\u65f6\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u97f3\u9891\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u5728\u6025\u6551\u4eba\u5458\u5230\u8fbe\u524d\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4e3a\u7d27\u6025\u533b\u7597\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dEMS\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u4e00\u5bf9\u4e00\u89c6\u9891\u6d41\u548c\u6709\u9650\u7684\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6025\u6551\u4eba\u5458\u5728\u9ad8\u538b\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u9700\u8981\u624b\u52a8\u5904\u7406\u5927\u91cf\u5608\u6742\u5197\u4f59\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6025\u9700\u667a\u80fd\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u6539\u5584\u6025\u6551\u54cd\u5e94\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5305\u542b\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7aef\uff1a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u652f\u6301\u624b\u673a\u3001\u667a\u80fd\u773c\u955c\u7b49\u8bbe\u5907\uff1b\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7aef\u96c6\u6210EMS-Stream\u901a\u4fe1\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u5b9e\u65f6\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u5757\uff1a(1) EMSLlama\u4e13\u4e1aLLM\u8fdb\u884c\u75c7\u72b6\u63d0\u53d6\uff1b(2) rPPG\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5fc3\u7387\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1b(3) PreNet\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4bEMS\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u533b\u7597\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002", "result": "EMSLlama\u5728\u7cbe\u786e\u5339\u914d\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eGPT-4o(0.89 vs 0.57)\uff0c\u6587\u672c-\u751f\u547d\u4f53\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5230\u8fbe\u524d\u5e72\u9884\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "conclusion": "TeleEMS\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u79fb\u52a8\u5b9e\u65f6\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\u5728\u8f6c\u53d8EMS\u8fd0\u8425\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u667a\u80fdEMS\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002", "relevance": 45.0}}

Although their functional connectivity is low-rank, it lacks disentanglement interpretations, making it difficult to assign distinct computational roles to different latent dimensions. To address this, we propose the Disentangled Recurrent Neural Network (DisRNN), a generative lrRNN framework that assumes group-wise independence among latent dynamics while allowing flexible within-group entanglement. These independent latent groups allow latent dynamics to evolve separately, but are internally rich for complex computation. We reformulate the lrRNN under a variational autoencoder (VAE) framework, enabling us to introduce a partial correlation penalty that encourages disentanglement between groups of latent dimensions.

To enable safe and reliable use of such predictions in healthcare, we introduce a conformal method for uncertainty-calibrated prediction of biomarker trajectories resulting from randomly-timed clinical visits of patients. Our approach extends conformal prediction to the setting of randomly-timed trajectories via a novel nonconformity score that produces prediction bands guaranteed to cover the unknown biomarker trajectories with a user-prescribed probability. We apply our method across a wide range of standard and state-of-the-art predictors for two well-established brain biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease, using neuroimaging data from real clinical studies. We observe that our conformal prediction bands consistently achieve the desired coverage, while also being tighter than baseline prediction bands. To further account for population heterogeneity, we develop group-conditional conformal bands and test their coverage guarantees across various demographic and clinically relevant subpopulations. Moreover, we demonstrate the clinical utility of our conformal bands in identifying subjects at high risk of progression to Alzheimer's disease.

An SDF is an implicit function that can query signed distances at specific coordinates for recovering a 3D surface. Although implicit functions work well on a single shape or scene, they pose obstacles when analyzing multiple SDFs with high-fidelity geometry details, due to the limited information encoded in the latent space for SDFs and the loss of geometry details. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce a method to represent multiple SDFs in a common space, aiming to recover more high-fidelity geometry details with more compact latent representations. Our key idea is to take full advantage of the benefits of generalization-based and overfitting-based learning strategies, which manage to preserve high-fidelity geometry details with compact latent codes. Based on this framework, we also introduce a novel sampling strategy to sample training queries. The sampling can improve the training efficiency and eliminate artifacts caused by the influence of other SDFs. We report numerical and visual evaluations on widely used benchmarks to validate our designs and show advantages over the latest methods in terms of the representative ability and compactness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u5171\u4eab\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8868\u793a\u591a\u4e2a\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u8ddd\u79bb\u51fd\u6570(SDF)\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u7528\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u6062\u590d\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u51e0\u4f55\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecfSDF\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u5f62\u72b6\u6216\u573a\u666f\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5206\u6790\u591a\u4e2aSDF\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u6709\u9650\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ec6\u8282\u4e22\u5931\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u6d88\u9664\u5176\u4ed6SDF\u5f71\u54cd\u9020\u6210\u7684\u4f2a\u5f71\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6570\u503c\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u7528\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u6062\u590d\u66f4\u591a\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u51e0\u4f55\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591aSDF\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "relevance": 10.0}}

We follow the trend of dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting based methods, and address several significant challenges. To model complex hand-object interaction with mutual occlusion and edge blur, we present interaction-aware hand-object Gaussians with newly introduced optimizable parameters aiming to adopt piecewise linear hypothesis for clearer structural representation. Moreover, considering the complementarity and tightness of hand shape and object shape during interaction dynamics, we incorporate hand information into object deformation field, constructing interaction-aware dynamic fields to model flexible motions. To further address difficulties in the optimization process, we propose a progressive strategy that handles dynamic regions and static background step by step. Correspondingly, explicit regularizations are designed to stabilize the hand-object representations for smooth motion transition, physical interaction reality, and coherent lighting.

Its broader use is constrained by two coupled challenges: highly limited uplink bandwidth and severe sonar-specific artifacts (speckle, motion blur, reverberation, acoustic shadows) that affect up to 98% of frames. We present SCOPE, a self-supervised framework that jointly performs compression and artifact correction without clean-noise pairs or synthetic assumptions. SCOPE combines (i) Adaptive Codebook Compression (ACC), which learns frequency-encoded latent representations tailored to sonar, with (ii) Frequency-Aware Multiscale Segmentation (FAMS), which decomposes frames into low-frequency structure and sparse high-frequency dynamics while suppressing rapidly fluctuating artifacts. A hedging training strategy further guides frequency-aware learning using low-pass proxy pairs generated without labels. Evaluated on months of in-situ ARIS sonar data, SCOPE achieves a structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.77, representing a 40% improvement over prior self-supervised denoising baselines, at bitrates down to <= 0.0118 bpp. It reduces uplink bandwidth by more than 80% while improving downstream detection.

However, traditional VLA models that generate actions through flow matching (FM) typically rely on rigid and uniform time schedules, i.e., synchronous FM (SFM). Without action context awareness and asynchronous self-correction, SFM becomes unstable in long-horizon tasks, where a single action error can cascade into failure. In this work, we propose asynchronous flow matching VLA (AsyncVLA), a novel framework that introduces temporal flexibility in asynchronous FM (AFM) and enables self-correction in action generation. AsyncVLA breaks from the vanilla SFM in VLA models by generating the action tokens in a non-uniform time schedule with action context awareness. Besides, our method introduces the confidence rater to extract confidence of the initially generated actions, enabling the model to selectively refine inaccurate action tokens before execution. Moreover, we propose a unified training procedure for SFM and AFM that endows a single model with both modes, improving KV-cache utilization. Extensive experiments on robotic manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that AsyncVLA is data-efficient and exhibits self-correction ability. AsyncVLA achieves state-of-the-art results across general embodied evaluations due to its asynchronous generation in AFM.

Existing token compression methods have yet to accommodate this emerging need of jointly compressing multimodal tokens. To bridge this gap, we present OmniZip, a training-free, audio-guided audio-visual token-compression framework that optimizes multimodal token representation and accelerates inference. Specifically, OmniZip first identifies salient audio tokens, then computes an audio retention score for each time group to capture information density, thereby dynamically guiding video token pruning and preserving cues from audio anchors enhanced by cross-modal similarity. For each time window, OmniZip compresses the video tokens using an interleaved spatio-temporal scheme. Extensive empirical results demonstrate the merits of OmniZip - it achieves 3.42X inference speedup and 1.4X memory reduction over other top-performing counterparts, while maintaining performance with no training.", "AI": {"tldr": "OmniZip\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u97f3\u9891\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u97f3\u89c6\u9891token\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u97f3\u9891token\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u97f3\u9891\u4fdd\u7559\u5206\u6570\u6765\u52a8\u6001\u6307\u5bfc\u89c6\u9891token\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b03.42\u500d\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u548c1.4\u500d\u5185\u5b58\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "motivation": "\u5904\u7406\u97f3\u89c6\u9891token\u5e8f\u5217\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u9020\u6210\u663e\u8457\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u73b0\u6709token\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u6ee1\u8db3\u8054\u5408\u538b\u7f29\u591a\u6a21\u6001token\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u97f3\u9891token\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u97f3\u9891\u4fdd\u7559\u5206\u6570\u6355\u6349\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u6307\u5bfc\u89c6\u9891token\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4ea4\u9519\u65f6\u7a7a\u65b9\u6848\u538b\u7f29\u89c6\u9891token\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b03.42\u500d\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u548c1.4\u500d\u5185\u5b58\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "OmniZip\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001token\u538b\u7f29\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "relevance": 65.0}}

Although automated methods for WMH segmentation have advanced, most provide only global lesion load and overlook their spatial distribution across distinct white matter regions. We propose a deep learning framework for robust WMH segmentation and localization, evaluated across public datasets and an independent Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Our results show that the predicted lesion loads are in line with the reference WMH estimates, confirming the robustness to variations in lesion load, acquisition, and demographics. Beyond accurate segmentation, we quantify WMH load within anatomically defined regions and combine these measures with brain structure volumes to assess diagnostic value. Regional WMH volumes consistently outperform global lesion burden for disease classification, and integration with brain atrophy metrics further improves performance, reaching area under the curve (AUC) values up to 0.97. Several spatially distinct regions, particularly within anterior white matter tracts, are reproducibly associated with diagnostic status, indicating localized vulnerability in AD.

While integrating complementary information from various MRI sequences is a common practice, the frequent absence of one or more modalities in real-world clinical settings poses a significant challenge, severely compromising the performance and generalizability of deep learning-based segmentation models. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Cross-Modal Compositional Self-Distillation (CCSD) framework that can flexibly handle arbitrary combinations of input modalities. CCSD adopts a shared-specific encoder-decoder architecture and incorporates two self-distillation strategies: (i) a hierarchical modality self-distillation mechanism that transfers knowledge across modality hierarchies to reduce semantic discrepancies, and (ii) a progressive modality combination distillation approach that enhances robustness to missing modalities by simulating gradual modality dropout during training.

While tabular predictors provide robust markers of global risk, their ability to capture subtle brain changes remains limited. In this study, we evaluate the predictive contributions of tabular and imaging-based representations, with a focus on transformer-derived Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) embeddings. We introduce a trajectory-aware labeling strategy based on Dynamic Time Warping clustering to capture heterogeneous patterns of cognitive change, and train a 3D Vision Transformer (ViT) via unsupervised reconstruction on harmonized and augmented MRI data to obtain anatomy-preserving embeddings without progression labels. The pretrained encoder embeddings are subsequently assessed using both traditional machine learning classifiers and deep learning heads, and compared against tabular representations and convolutional network baselines. Results highlight complementary strengths across modalities. Clinical and volumetric features achieved the highest AUCs of around 0.70 for predicting mild and severe progression, underscoring their utility in capturing global decline trajectories. In contrast, MRI embeddings from the ViT model were most effective in distinguishing cognitively stable individuals with an AUC of 0.71. However, all approaches struggled in the heterogeneous moderate group.

However, pre-trained VLA policies still suffer from substantial performance degradation during downstream deployment. Although fine-tuning can mitigate this issue, its reliance on costly demonstration collection and intensive computation makes it impractical in real-world settings. In this work, we introduce VLA-Pilot, a plug-and-play inference-time policy steering method for zero-shot deployment of pre-trained VLA without any additional fine-tuning or data collection. We evaluate VLA-Pilot on six real-world downstream manipulation tasks across two distinct robotic embodiments, encompassing both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that VLA-Pilot substantially boosts the success rates of off-the-shelf pre-trained VLA policies, enabling robust zero-shot generalization to diverse tasks and embodiments.

Recent studies show that deep learning models can process these signals to perform emotion recognition with high accuracy. However, many existing approaches overlook the dynamic interplay between distinct brain regions, which can be crucial to understanding how emotions unfold and evolve over time, potentially aiding in more accurate emotion recognition. To address this, we propose RBTransformer, a Transformer-based neural network architecture that models inter-cortical neural dynamics of the brain in latent space to better capture structured neural interactions for effective EEG-based emotion recognition. First, the EEG signals are converted into Band Differential Entropy (BDE) tokens, which are then passed through Electrode Identity embeddings to retain spatial provenance. These tokens are processed through successive inter-cortical multi-head attention blocks that construct an electrode x electrode attention matrix, allowing the model to learn the inter-cortical neural dependencies. The resulting features are then passed through a classification head to obtain the final prediction. We conducted extensive experiments, specifically under subject-dependent settings, on the SEED, DEAP, and DREAMER datasets, over all three dimensions, Valence, Arousal, and Dominance (for DEAP and DREAMER), under both binary and multi-class classification settings. The results demonstrate that the proposed RBTransformer outperforms all previous state-of-the-art methods across all three datasets, over all three dimensions under both classification settings.

We present XAttn-BMD (Cross-Attention BMD), a multimodal deep learning framework that predicts femoral neck BMD from hip X-ray images and structured clinical metadata. It utilizes a novel bidirectional cross-attention mechanism to dynamically integrate image and metadata features for cross-modal mutual reinforcement. A Weighted Smooth L1 loss is tailored to address BMD imbalance and prioritize clinically significant cases. Extensive experiments on the data from the Hertfordshire Cohort Study show that our model outperforms the baseline models in regression generalization and robustness. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of both cross-attention fusion and the customized loss function. Experimental results show that the integration of multimodal data via cross-attention outperforms naive feature concatenation without cross-attention, reducing MSE by 16.7%, MAE by 6.03%, and increasing the R2 score by 16.4%, highlighting the effectiveness of the approach for femoral neck BMD estimation.

Most predictive algorithms that infer ST directly from histology treat each section independently and ignore 3D structure, while existing 3D-aware approaches are not generative and do not scale well. We present Holographic Tissue Expression Inpainting and Analysis (HoloTea), a 3D-aware flow-matching framework that imputes spot-level gene expression from H&E while explicitly using information from adjacent sections. Our key idea is to retrieve morphologically corresponding spots on neighboring slides in a shared feature space and fuse this cross section context into a lightweight ControlNet, allowing conditioning to follow anatomical continuity. To better capture the count nature of the data, we introduce a 3D-consistent prior for flow matching that combines a learned zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) prior with a spatial-empirical prior constructed from neighboring sections.

Vision-based fall prediction systems offer a non-invasive solution to anticipate falls seconds before impact, but their development is hindered by the scarcity of available fall data. Contributing to these efforts, this study proposes the Biomechanical Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (BioST-GCN), a dual-stream model that combines both pose and biomechanical information using a cross-attention fusion mechanism. Our model outperforms the vanilla ST-GCN baseline by 5.32% and 2.91% F1-score on the simulated MCF-UA stunt-actor and MUVIM datasets, respectively. The spatio-temporal attention mechanisms in the ST-GCN stream also provide interpretability by identifying critical joints and temporal phases. However, a critical simulation-reality gap persists. While our model achieves an 89.0% F1-score with full supervision on simulated data, zero-shot generalization to unseen subjects drops to 35.9%. This performance decline is likely due to biases in simulated data, such as `intent-to-fall' cues. For older adults, particularly those with diabetes or frailty, this gap is exacerbated by their unique kinematic profiles. To address this, we propose personalization strategies and advocate for privacy-preserving data pipelines to enable real-world validation.

Project page: https://miya-oi.github.io/SparseSurf-project", "summary": "Recent advances in optimizing Gaussian Splatting for scene geometry have enabled efficient reconstruction of detailed surfaces from images. However, when input views are sparse, such optimization is prone to overfitting, leading to suboptimal reconstruction quality. Existing approaches address this challenge by employing flattened Gaussian primitives to better fit surface geometry, combined with depth regularization to alleviate geometric ambiguities under limited viewpoints. Nevertheless, the increased anisotropy inherent in flattened Gaussians exacerbates overfitting in sparse-view scenarios, hindering accurate surface fitting and degrading novel view synthesis performance. In this paper, we propose \\net{}, a method that reconstructs more accurate and detailed surfaces while preserving high-quality novel view rendering. Our key insight is to introduce Stereo Geometry-Texture Alignment, which bridges rendering quality and geometry estimation, thereby jointly enhancing both surface reconstruction and view synthesis. In addition, we present a Pseudo-Feature Enhanced Geometry Consistency that enforces multi-view geometric consistency by incorporating both training and unseen views, effectively mitigating overfitting caused by sparse supervision.

On a publicly available bone-marrow cytology dataset, with simulated witness rates from 10% down to 0.5%, SLAM-AGS improves bag-level F1-Score and Top 400 positive cell retrieval over other pretraining methods, with the largest gains at low witness rates, showing that resolving gradient interference enables stable pretraining and better performance on downstream tasks.

Fitting splat models reduces to optimization over the space of mixing measures, which can be implemented using Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao gradient flows. As a byproduct, we recover the popular Gaussian Splatting methodology as a special case, providing a unified theoretical framework for this state-of-the-art technique that clearly disambiguates the inverse problem, the model, and the optimization algorithm.

We present RepAir, a three-stage framework for robust 3D airway segmentation that combines an nnU-Net-based network with anatomically informed topology correction. The segmentation network produces an initial airway mask, after which a skeleton-based algorithm identifies potential discontinuities and proposes reconnections. A 1D convolutional classifier then determines which candidate links correspond to true anatomical branches versus false or obstructed paths. We evaluate RepAir on two distinct datasets: ATM'22, comprising annotated CT scans from predominantly healthy subjects and AeroPath, encompassing annotated scans with severe airway pathology.

In this work, we propose a simple yet effective approach for artery-vein segmentation in temporal Doppler holograms using standard segmentation architectures. By incorporating features derived from a dedicated pulse analysis pipeline, our method allows conventional U-Nets to exploit temporal dynamics and achieve performance comparable to more complex attention- or iteration-based models. These findings demonstrate that time-resolved preprocessing can unlock the full potential of deep learning for Doppler holography, opening new perspectives for quantitative exploration of retinal hemodynamics.

Text-based methods typically encode item textual information via prompt design and generate discrete semantic IDs through item tokenization. However, in domain-specific tasks such as local-life services, simply injecting location information into prompts fails to capture fine-grained spatial characteristics and real-world distance awareness among items. To address this, we propose LGSID, an LLM-Aligned Geographic Item Tokenization Framework for Local-life Recommendation. This framework consists of two key components: (1) RL-based Geographic LLM Alignment, and (2) Hierarchical Geographic Item Tokenization. In the RL-based alignment module, we initially train a list-wise reward model to capture real-world spatial relationships among items. We then introduce a novel G-DPO algorithm that uses pre-trained reward model to inject generalized spatial knowledge and collaborative signals into LLMs while preserving their semantic understanding. Furthermore, we propose a hierarchical geographic item tokenization strategy, where primary tokens are derived from discrete spatial and content attributes, and residual tokens are refined using the aligned LLM's geographic representation vectors. Extensive experiments on real-world Kuaishou industry datasets show that LGSID consistently outperforms state-of-the-art discriminative and generative recommendation models.

Modern log anomaly detection methods rely on training deep learning models on clean, anomaly-free log sequences. However, obtaining such clean log data requires costly and tedious human labeling, and existing automatic cleaning methods fail to fully integrate the specific characteristics and actual semantics of logs in their purification process. In this paper, we propose a cost-aware, rule-enhanced purification framework, LogPurge, that automatically selects a sufficient subset of normal log sequences from contamination log sequences to train a anomaly detection model. Our approach involves a two-stage filtering algorithm: In the first stage, we use a large language model (LLM) to remove clustered anomalous patterns and enhance system rules to improve LLM's understanding of system logs; in the second stage, we utilize a divide-and-conquer strategy that decomposes the remaining contaminated regions into smaller subproblems, allowing each to be effectively purified through the first stage procedure. Our experiments, conducted on two public datasets and one industrial dataset, show that our method significantly removes an average of 98.74% of anomalies while retaining 82.39% of normal samples. Compared to the latest unsupervised log sample selection algorithms, our method achieves F-1 score improvements of 35.7% and 84.11% on the public datasets, and an impressive 149.72% F-1 improvement on the private dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLogPurge\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u548c\u89c4\u5219\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7b97\u6cd5\u81ea\u52a8\u4ece\u53d7\u6c61\u67d3\u7684\u65e5\u5fd7\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u6b63\u5e38\u5b50\u96c6\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65e5\u5fd7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5e72\u51c0\u7684\u6b63\u5e38\u65e5\u5fd7\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f46\u83b7\u53d6\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9700\u8981\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u6e05\u6d17\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u65e5\u5fd7\u7684\u7279\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u8bed\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u79fb\u9664\u805a\u7c7b\u5f02\u5e38\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c4\u5219\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u6cbb\u7b56\u7565\u5c06\u5269\u4f59\u6c61\u67d3\u533a\u57df\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u8fdb\u884c\u51c0\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5de5\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u79fb\u966498.74%\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u4fdd\u755982.39%\u7684\u6b63\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u65b0\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cF1\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u534735.7%-149.72%\u3002", "conclusion": "LogPurge\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u81ea\u52a8\u51c0\u5316\u53d7\u6c61\u67d3\u7684\u65e5\u5fd7\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u83b7\u53d6\u5e72\u51c0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u96be\u9898\u3002", "relevance": 65.0}}

Submitting to cs.CV due to relevance to general pattern recognition and time-frequency (spectrogram) analysis", "summary": "Seismic sensing has emerged as a promising solution for border surveillance and monitoring; the seismic sensors that are often buried underground are small and cannot be noticed easily, making them difficult for intruders to detect, avoid, or vandalize. This significantly enhances their effectiveness compared to highly visible cameras or fences. However, accurately detecting and distinguishing between overlapping activities that are happening simultaneously, such as human intrusions, animal movements, and vehicle rumbling, remains a major challenge due to the complex and noisy nature of seismic signals. Correctly identifying simultaneous activities is critical because failing to separate them can lead to misclassification, missed detections, and an incomplete understanding of the situation, thereby reducing the reliability of surveillance systems. To tackle this problem, we propose HyMAD (Hybrid Multi-Activity Detection), a deep neural architecture based on spatio-temporal feature fusion. The framework integrates spectral features extracted with SincNet and temporal dependencies modeled by a recurrent neural network (RNN). In addition, HyMAD employs self-attention layers to strengthen intra-modal representations and a cross-modal fusion module to achieve robust multi-label classification of seismic events. e evaluate our approach on a dataset constructed from real-world field recordings collected in the context of border surveillance and monitoring, demonstrating its ability to generalize to complex, simultaneous activity scenarios involving humans, animals, and vehicles.

Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals provide complementary physiological information, as conduction abnormalities can help localize or suggest scarred myocardial regions. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal framework that integrates ECG-derived electrophysiological information with anatomical priors from the AHA-17 atlas for physiologically consistent LGE-based scar segmentation.

However, clinical manifestations of neonatal seizures are subtle and often lead to misdiagnoses. This increases the risk of prolonged, untreated seizure activity and subsequent brain injury. Continuous video electroencephalogram (cEEG) monitoring is the gold standard for seizure detection. However, this is an expensive evaluation that requires expertise and time. In this study, we propose a convolutional neural network-based model for early prediction of neonatal seizures by distinguishing between interictal and preictal states of the EEG. Our model is patient-independent, enabling generalization across multiple subjects, and utilizes mel-frequency cepstral coefficient matrices extracted from multichannel EEG and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals as input features. Trained and validated on the Helsinki neonatal EEG dataset with 10-fold cross-validation, the proposed model achieved an average accuracy of 97.52%, sensitivity of 98.31%, specificity of 96.39%, and F1-score of 97.95%, enabling accurate seizure prediction up to 30 minutes before onset. The inclusion of ECG alongside EEG improved the F1-score by 1.42%, while the incorporation of an attention mechanism yielded an additional 0.5% improvement. To enhance transparency, we incorporated SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) as an explainable artificial intelligence method to interpret the model and provided localization of seizure focus using scalp plots. The overall results demonstrate the model's potential for minimally supervised deployment in neonatal intensive care units, enabling timely and reliable prediction of neonatal seizures, while demonstrating strong generalization capability across unseen subjects through transfer learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u533a\u5206\u8111\u7535\u56fe\u7684\u53d1\u4f5c\u95f4\u671f\u548c\u53d1\u4f5c\u524d\u671f\u72b6\u6001\u6765\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u65b0\u751f\u513f\u766b\u75eb\u53d1\u4f5c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408EEG\u548cECG\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5728\u8d6b\u5c14\u8f9b\u57fa\u65b0\u751f\u513fEEG\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523097.52%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u65b0\u751f\u513f\u766b\u75eb\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u795e\u7ecf\u529f\u80fd\u635f\u4f24\uff0c\u4f46\u4e34\u5e8a\u8868\u73b0\u5fae\u5999\u6613\u8bef\u8bca\uff0c\u8fde\u7eed\u89c6\u9891\u8111\u7535\u56fe\u76d1\u6d4b\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u591a\u901a\u9053EEG\u548cECG\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u6885\u5c14\u9891\u7387\u5012\u8c31\u7cfb\u6570\u77e9\u9635\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c10\u6298\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u6574\u5408SHAP\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u738797.52%\uff0c\u654f\u611f\u602798.31%\uff0c\u7279\u5f02\u602796.39%\uff0cF1\u5206\u657097.95%\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u766b\u75eb\u53d1\u4f5c\u524d30\u5206\u949f\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408ECG\u4f7fF1\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u53471.42%\uff0c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u989d\u5916\u63d0\u53470.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u5728\u65b0\u751f\u513f\u91cd\u75c7\u76d1\u62a4\u5ba4\u6700\u5c0f\u76d1\u7763\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u53ca\u65f6\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\u65b0\u751f\u513f\u766b\u75eb\u53d1\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "relevance": 10.0}}

Motivated by this limitation, we introduce a training-free approach that leverages video Diffusion Transformers pretrained at their native scale to synthesize higher resolution videos without any additional training or adaptation. At the core of our method lies an inward sliding window attention mechanism, which originates from a key observation: maintaining each query token's training scale receptive field is crucial for preserving visual fidelity and detail. However, naive local window attention, unfortunately, often leads to repetitive content and exhibits a lack of global coherence in the generated results. To overcome this challenge, we devise a dual-path pipeline that backs up window attention with a novel cross-attention override strategy, enabling the semantic content produced by local attention to be guided by another branch with a full receptive field and, therefore, ensuring holistic consistency. Furthermore, to improve efficiency, we incorporate a cross-attention caching strategy for this branch to avoid the frequent computation of full 3D attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method delivers ultra-high-resolution videos with fine-grained visual details and high efficiency in a training-free paradigm. Meanwhile, it achieves superior performance on VBench, even compared to training-based alternatives, with competitive or improved efficiency.

While GPU memory offloading to CPU and NVMe has made large-scale training more feasible, existing approaches suffer from high tensor migration latency and suboptimal device memory utilization, ultimately increasing training time and cloud costs. To address these challenges, we present 10Cache, a resource-aware tensor caching and migration system that accelerates LLM training by intelligently coordinating memory usage across GPU, CPU, and NVMe tiers. 10Cache profiles tensor execution order to construct prefetch policies, allocates memory buffers in pinned memory based on tensor size distributions, and reuses memory buffers to minimize allocation overhead.\n  Designed for cloud-scale deployments, 10Cache improves memory efficiency and reduces reliance on high-end GPUs. Across diverse LLM workloads, it achieves up to 2x speedup in training time, improves GPU cache hit rate by up to 86.6x, and increases CPU/GPU memory utilization by up to 2.15x and 1.33x, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art offloading methods. These results demonstrate that 10Cache is a practical and scalable solution for optimizing LLM training throughput and resource efficiency in cloud environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "10Cache\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8d44\u6e90\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5f20\u91cf\u7f13\u5b58\u548c\u8fc1\u79fb\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u534f\u8c03GPU\u3001CPU\u548cNVMe\u5c42\u7ea7\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u6765\u52a0\u901fLLM\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e91\u73af\u5883\u4e2dGPU\u5185\u5b58\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e91\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9762\u4e34GPU\u5185\u5b58\u5bb9\u91cf\u6709\u9650\u548c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u73b0\u6709GPU\u5185\u5b58\u5378\u8f7d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u5f20\u91cf\u8fc1\u79fb\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u8bbe\u5907\u5185\u5b58\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u589e\u52a0\u548c\u4e91\u6210\u672c\u4e0a\u5347\u3002", "method": "10Cache\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5f20\u91cf\u6267\u884c\u987a\u5e8f\u6784\u5efa\u9884\u53d6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u5f20\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u5206\u5e03\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u5185\u5b58\u4e2d\u5206\u914d\u5185\u5b58\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\uff0c\u5e76\u91cd\u7528\u5185\u5b58\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5206\u914d\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8GPU\u3001CPU\u548cNVMe\u5c42\u7ea7\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u667a\u80fd\u534f\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316LLM\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e2d\uff0c10Cache\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5378\u8f7d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe2\u500d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a0\u901f\uff0cGPU\u7f13\u5b58\u547d\u4e2d\u7387\u63d0\u9ad886.6\u500d\uff0cCPU\u548cGPU\u5185\u5b58\u5229\u7528\u7387\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u9ad82.15\u500d\u548c1.33\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "10Cache\u662f\u4f18\u5316\u4e91\u73af\u5883\u4e2dLLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u9ad8\u7aefGPU\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

This modular design is computationally inefficient, leads to suboptimal performance, and prevents the unification of diffusion with the single-network architectures common in vision foundation models. Our goal is to unify these three components into a single, end-to-end trainable network. We first demonstrate that a naive joint training approach fails catastrophically due to ``latent collapse'', where the diffusion training objective interferes with the network's ability to learn a good latent representation. We identify the root causes of this instability by drawing a novel analogy between diffusion and self-distillation based unsupervised learning method. Based on this insight, we propose Diffusion as Self-Distillation (DSD), a new framework with key modifications to the training objective that stabilize the latent space. This approach enables, for the first time, the stable end-to-end training of a single network that simultaneously learns to encode, decode, and perform diffusion. DSD achieves outstanding performance on the ImageNet $256\\times 256$ conditional generation task: FID=13.44/6.38/4.25 with only 42M/118M/205M parameters and 50 training epochs on ImageNet, without using classifier-free-guidance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DSD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u548c\u6269\u6563\u7f51\u7edc\u7edf\u4e00\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728ImageNet 256\u00d7256\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u7528\u590d\u6742\u7684\u4e09\u90e8\u5206\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u6b21\u4f18\u3002\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u7edf\u4e00\u8fd9\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u7edf\u4e00\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6269\u6563\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u84b8\u998f\uff08DSD\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6539\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u6765\u7a33\u5b9a\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5355\u4e00\u7f51\u7edc\u540c\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u89e3\u7801\u548c\u6269\u6563\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImageNet 256\u00d7256\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97FID=13.44/6.38/4.25\uff08\u53c2\u6570\u5206\u522b\u4e3a42M/118M/205M\uff0c50\u8bad\u7ec3\u5468\u671f\uff09\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u81ea\u7531\u5f15\u5bfc\u3002", "conclusion": "DSD\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5355\u4e00\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "relevance": 75.0}}

In practice, cyber threats evolve continuously, making the discovery of novel malicious traffic a critical necessity as well as the identification of known classes. Recent studies have advanced this goal with deep models, but they often rely on task-specific architectures that limit transferability and require per-dataset tuning. In this paper we introduce MalRAG, the first LLM driven retrieval-augmented framework for open-set malicious traffic identification. MalRAG freezes the LLM and operates via comprehensive traffic knowledge construction, adaptive retrieval, and prompt engineering. Concretely, we construct a multi-view traffic database by mining prior malicious traffic from content, structural, and temporal perspectives. Furthermore, we introduce a Coverage-Enhanced Retrieval Algorithm that queries across these views to assemble the most probable candidates, thereby improving the inclusion of correct evidence. We then employ Traffic-Aware Adaptive Pruning to select a variable subset of these candidates based on traffic-aware similarity scores, suppressing incorrect matches and yielding reliable retrieved evidence. Moreover, we develop a suite of guidance prompts where task instruction, evidence referencing, and decision guidance are integrated with the retrieved evidence to improve LLM performance. Across diverse real-world datasets and settings, MalRAG delivers state-of-the-art results in both fine-grained identification of known classes and novel malicious traffic discovery.

In fact, the intricate geometry of 3D urban environments results in high degrees of occlusion and requires extensive manual viewpoint adjustments that make large-scale exploration inefficient. To address this, we propose a view-based approach for 3D data exploration, where a vector field encodes views from the environment. To support this approach, we introduce a neural field-based method that constructs an efficient implicit representation of 3D environments. This representation enables both faster direct queries, which consist of the computation of view assessment indices, and inverse queries, which help avoid occlusion and facilitate the search for views that match desired data patterns. Our approach supports key urban analysis tasks such as visibility assessments, solar exposure evaluation, and assessing the visual impact of new developments. We validate our method through quantitative experiments, case studies informed by real-world urban challenges, and feedback from domain experts. Results show its effectiveness in finding desirable viewpoints, analyzing building facade visibility, and evaluating views from outdoor spaces.

The radius of the ambiguity set is measured via convex spectral divergence. We demonstrate that the proposed distributionally robust estimation model can be reduced to a convex optimization problem, thereby yielding quasi-analytical estimators. The joint estimators are shown to be nonlinear shrinkage estimators. The eigenvalues of the estimators are shrunk nonlinearly towards a positive scalar, where the scalar is determined by the weight coefficient of the loss terms. By tuning the coefficient carefully, the shrinkage corrects the spectral bias of the empirical covariance/precision matrix estimator. By this property, we call the proposed joint estimator the Spectral concentrated COvariance and Precision matrix Estimator (SCOPE). We demonstrate that the shrinkage effect improves the condition number of the estimator. We provide a parameter-tuning scheme that adjusts the shrinkage target and intensity that is asymptotically optimal.

This review synthesizes findings from robotic systems, animal studies, and human research to explore how different systems encode and recall place. We examine the computational and representational strategies employed across artificial systems, animals, and humans, highlighting convergent solutions such as topological mapping, cue integration, and memory management. Animal systems reveal evolved mechanisms for multimodal navigation and environmental adaptation, while human studies provide unique insights into semantic place concepts, cultural influences, and introspective capabilities. Artificial systems showcase scalable architectures and data-driven models. We propose a unifying set of concepts by which to consider and develop place recognition mechanisms and identify key challenges such as generalization, robustness, and environmental variability.

Common approaches to ARC treat it as a language-oriented problem, addressed by large language models (LLMs) or recurrent reasoning models.

In this work, we formulate ARC within a vision paradigm, framing it as an image-to-image translation problem. To incorporate visual priors, we represent the inputs on a \"canvas\" that can be processed like natural images. It is then natural for us to apply standard vision architectures, such as a vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT), to perform image-to-image mapping. Our model is trained from scratch solely on ARC data and generalizes to unseen tasks through test-time training. Our framework, termed Vision ARC (VARC), achieves 60.4% accuracy on the ARC-1 benchmark, substantially outperforming existing methods that are also trained from scratch.

Overcoming compounding errors in sequential action decisions remains a central challenge to improving BC performance. Existing approaches mitigate compounding errors through data augmentation, expressive representation, or temporal abstraction. However, they suffer from physical discontinuities and semantic-physical misalignment, leading to inaccurate action cloning and intermittent execution. In this paper, we present Continuous vision-language-action Co-Learning with Semantic-Physical Alignment (CCoL), a novel BC framework that ensures temporally consistent execution and fine-grained semantic grounding. It generates robust and smooth action execution trajectories through continuous co-learning across vision, language, and proprioceptive inputs (e.g., robot internal states). Meanwhile, we anchor language semantics to visuomotor representations by a bidirectional cross-attention to learn contextual information for action generation, successfully overcoming the problem of semantic-physical misalignment. Extensive experiments show that CCoL achieves an average 8.0% relative improvement across three simulation suites, with up to 19.2% relative gain in human-demonstrated bimanual insertion tasks. Real-world tests on a 7-DoF robot further confirm CCoL's generalization under unseen and noisy object states.", "AI": {"tldr": "CCoL\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u672c\u4f53\u611f\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u534f\u540c\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9c81\u68d2\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u6267\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49-\u7269\u7406\u9519\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\u4e2d\u590d\u5408\u8bef\u5dee\u3001\u7269\u7406\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49-\u7269\u7406\u9519\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6267\u884c\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8fde\u7eed\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u534f\u540c\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5411\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c06\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u4e49\u951a\u5b9a\u5230\u89c6\u89c9\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4eff\u771f\u5957\u4ef6\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u53478.0%\uff0c\u5728\u53cc\u624b\u63d2\u5165\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u76f8\u5bf9\u589e\u76ca\u8fbe19.2%\uff0c\u57287\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u8c61\u72b6\u6001\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "CCoL\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u534f\u540c\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8bed\u4e49-\u7269\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u6267\u884c\u3002", "relevance": 45.0}}

Although this enhances client-side privacy, it also leaves the server highly vulnerable to model theft by malicious clients. Ensuring intellectual property protection for such capability-limited servers presents a dual challenge: watermarking schemes that depend on client cooperation are unreliable in adversarial settings, whereas traditional server-side watermarking schemes are technically infeasible because the server lacks access to critical elements such as model parameters or labels.\n  To address this challenge, this paper proposes Sigil, a mandatory watermarking framework designed specifically for capability-limited servers. Sigil defines the watermark as a statistical constraint on the server-visible activation space and embeds the watermark into the client model via gradient injection, without requiring any knowledge of the data. Besides, we design an adaptive gradient clipping mechanism to ensure that our watermarking process remains both mandatory and stealthy, effectively countering existing gradient anomaly detection methods and a specifically designed adaptive subspace removal attack.

Training deep neural networks (DNNs) for AMT typically requires strongly aligned training pairs with precise frame-level annotations. Since creating such datasets is costly and impractical for many musical contexts, weakly aligned approaches using segment-level annotations have gained traction. However, existing methods often rely on Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) or soft alignment loss functions, both of which still require local semantic correspondences, making them error-prone and computationally expensive. In this article, we introduce CountEM, a novel AMT framework that eliminates the need for explicit local alignment by leveraging note event histograms as supervision, enabling lighter computations and greater flexibility. Using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) approach, CountEM iteratively refines predictions based solely on note occurrence counts, significantly reducing annotation efforts while maintaining high transcription accuracy. Experiments on piano, guitar, and multi-instrument datasets demonstrate that CountEM matches or surpasses existing weakly supervised methods, improving AMT's robustness, scalability, and efficiency.

Microstructure characterization and reconstruction provide effective means for modeling these materials, which are critical for conducting physical property simulations, structure-property linkage studies, and enhancing their performance across different applications. To achieve superior controllability and applicability with small sample sizes, we propose a statistically controllable microstructure reconstruction framework that integrates neural networks with sliced-Wasserstein metric. Specifically, our approach leverages local pattern distribution for microstructure characterization and employs a controlled sampling strategy to generate target distributions that satisfy given conditional parameters. A neural network-based model establishes the mapping from the input distribution to the target local pattern distribution, enabling microstructure reconstruction. Combinations of sliced-Wasserstein metric and gradient optimization techniques minimize the distance between these distributions, leading to a stable and reliable model. Our method can perform stochastic and controllable reconstruction tasks even with small sample sizes. Additionally, it can generate large-size (e.g. 512 and 1024) 3D microstructures using a chunking strategy. By introducing spatial location masks, our method excels at generating spatially heterogeneous and complex microstructures.

However, this often results in severe aliasing artifacts and loss of structural details in reconstructed images, posing significant challenges for clinical applications. Inspired by the success of the Poisson Flow Generative Model (PFGM++) in natural image generation, we propose a PoCGM (Poisson-Conditioned Generative Model) to address the challenges of sparse-view CT reconstruction. Since PFGM++ was originally designed for unconditional generation, it lacks direct applicability to medical imaging tasks that require integrating conditional inputs. To overcome this limitation, the PoCGM reformulates PFGM++ into a conditional generative framework by incorporating sparse-view data as guidance during both training and sampling phases. By modeling the posterior distribution of full-view reconstructions conditioned on sparse observations, PoCGM effectively suppresses artifacts while preserving fine structural details. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that PoCGM outperforms the baselines, achieving improved artifact suppression, enhanced detail preservation, and reliable performance in dose-sensitive and time-critical imaging scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPoCGM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06PFGM++\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u56feCT\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u4f2a\u5f71\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec6\u8282", "motivation": "\u51cf\u5c11CT\u6295\u5f71\u89c6\u56fe\u6570\u91cf\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u8f90\u5c04\u5242\u91cf\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u6df7\u53e0\u4f2a\u5f71\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec6\u8282\u4e22\u5931\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528", "method": "\u5c06PFGM++\u91cd\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u9636\u6bb5\u6574\u5408\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u5efa\u6a21\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u5168\u89c6\u56fe\u91cd\u5efa\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03", "result": "\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660ePoCGM\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4f2a\u5f71\u6291\u5236\u3001\u7ec6\u8282\u4fdd\u7559\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u5242\u91cf\u654f\u611f\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5173\u952e\u6210\u50cf\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d", "conclusion": "PoCGM\u6210\u529f\u5c06PFGM++\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4e3a\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u56feCT\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848", "relevance": 30.0}}

Formal methods provide strong guarantees but depend on complete models and static assumptions. Runtime verification (RV) complements them by monitoring executions at run time and, in its predictive variants, by anticipating potential violations. Large language models (LLMs), meanwhile, excel at translating natural language into formal artefacts and recognising patterns in data, yet they remain error-prone and lack formal guarantees. This vision paper argues for a symbiotic integration of RV and LLMs. RV can serve as a guardrail for LLM-driven autonomy, while LLMs can extend RV by assisting specification capture, supporting anticipatory reasoning, and helping to handle uncertainty.

We present ELiC, a real-time framework that combines cross-bit-depth feature propagation, a Bag-of-Encoders (BoE) selection scheme, and a Morton-order-preserving hierarchy. Cross-bit-depth propagation reuses features extracted at denser, lower depths to support prediction at sparser, higher depths. BoE selects, per depth, the most suitable coding network from a small pool, adapting capacity to observed occupancy statistics without training a separate model for each level.

While applying FL in cross-silo scenarios, where organizations collaborate, it is necessary that the FL system is reliable; however, participants can fail due to various reasons (e.g., communication issues or misconfigurations). In order to provide a reliable system, it is necessary to analyze the impact of participant failures. While this problem received attention in cross-device FL where mobile devices with limited resources participate, there is comparatively little research in cross-silo FL.\n  Therefore, we conduct an extensive study for analyzing the impact of participant failures on the model quality in the context of inter-organizational cross-silo FL with few participants. In our study, we focus on analyzing generally influential factors such as the impact of the timing and the data as well as the impact on the evaluation, which is important for deciding, if the model should be deployed. We show that under high skews the evaluation is optimistic and hides the real impact. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the timing impacts the quality of the trained model.

RoboTidy provides 500 photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) household scenes (covering 500 objects and containers) with collisions, formulates tidying as an \"Action (Object, Container)\" list, and supplies 6.4k high-quality manipulation demonstration trajectories and 1.5k naviagtion trajectories to support both few-shot and large-scale training.

Although some cross-subject methods being introduced, they often overfocus with subject-invariant information while neglecting subject-specific information, resulting in slow fine-tune-based adaptation strategy. To achieve fast and data-efficient new subject adaptation, we propose MindCross, a novel cross-subject framework. MindCross's N specific encoders and one shared encoder are designed to extract subject-specific and subject-invariant information, respectively. Additionally, a Top-K collaboration module is adopted to enhance new subject decoding with the knowledge learned from previous subjects' encoders. Extensive experiments on fMRI/EEG-to-video benchmarks demonstrate MindCross's efficacy and efficiency of cross-subject decoding and new subject adaptation using only one model.", "AI": {"tldr": "MindCross\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u8de8\u88ab\u8bd5\u8111\u89e3\u7801\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5b9a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u5171\u4eab\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u53d6\u88ab\u8bd5\u7279\u5b9a\u548c\u4e0d\u53d8\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Top-K\u534f\u4f5c\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u65b0\u88ab\u8bd5\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u5728fMRI/EEG\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u89e3\u7801\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u8111\u89e3\u7801\u6846\u67b6\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u88ab\u8bd5\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8de8\u88ab\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u88ab\u8bd5\u7279\u5b9a\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b0\u88ab\u8bd5\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1N\u4e2a\u7279\u5b9a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5171\u4eab\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u53d6\u88ab\u8bd5\u7279\u5b9a\u548c\u4e0d\u53d8\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Top-K\u534f\u4f5c\u6a21\u5757\u5229\u7528\u5148\u524d\u88ab\u8bd5\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\u65b0\u88ab\u8bd5\u89e3\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u5728fMRI/EEG\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMindCross\u5728\u8de8\u88ab\u8bd5\u89e3\u7801\u548c\u65b0\u88ab\u8bd5\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "MindCross\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u88ab\u8bd5\u7279\u5b9a\u548c\u4e0d\u53d8\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8de8\u88ab\u8bd5\u8111\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u4e3a\u8111\u4fe1\u53f7\u91cd\u5efa\u89c6\u9891\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "relevance": 15.0}}

MSDP is based on masked autoencoding and trains a transformer-based encoder by reconstructing multisensory observations from only a subset of sensor embeddings, leading to cross-modal prediction and sensor fusion. For downstream policy learning, we introduce a novel asymmetric architecture, where a cross-attention mechanism allows the critic to extract dynamic, task-specific features from the frozen embeddings, while the actor receives a stable pooled representation to guide its actions. Our method demonstrates accelerated learning and robust performance under diverse perturbations, including sensor noise, and changes in object dynamics. Evaluations in multiple challenging, contact-rich robot manipulation tasks in simulation and the real world showcase the effectiveness of MSDP.

Crucially, we need to be able to distinguish cause $X$ from effect $Y$ in bivariate models, that is, distinguish the two graphs $X \\to Y$ and $Y \\to X$. Location-scale noise models (LSNMs), in which the effect $Y$ is modeled based on the cause $X$ as $Y = f(X) + g(X)N$, form a flexible class of models that is general and identifiable in most cases. Estimating these models for arbitrary noise terms $N$, however, is challenging. Therefore, practical estimators are typically restricted to symmetric distributions, such as the normal distribution. As we showcase in this paper, when $N$ is a skewed random variable, which is likely in real-world domains, the reliability of these approaches decreases. To approach this limitation, we propose SkewD, a likelihood-based algorithm for bivariate causal discovery under LSNMs with skewed noise distributions. SkewD extends the usual normal-distribution framework to the skew-normal setting, enabling reliable inference under symmetric and skewed noise. For parameter estimation, we employ a combination of a heuristic search and an expectation conditional maximization algorithm. We evaluate SkewD on novel synthetically generated datasets with skewed noise as well as established benchmark datasets.

Existing state-of-the-art methods, such as MUSE, have established a strong baseline with only 0.51M parameters by introducing a Multi-path Enhanced Taylor (MET) transformer and Deformable Embedding (DE). However, an in-depth analysis reveals that MUSE still suffers from efficiency bottlenecks: the MET module relies on a complex \"approximate-compensate\" mechanism to mitigate the limitations of Taylor-expansion-based attention, while the offset calculation for deformable embedding introduces additional computational burden. This paper proposes IMSE, a systematically optimized and ultra-lightweight network. We introduce two core innovations: 1) Replacing the MET module with Amplitude-Aware Linear Attention (MALA). MALA fundamentally rectifies the \"amplitude-ignoring\" problem in linear attention by explicitly preserving the norm information of query vectors in the attention calculation, achieving efficient global modeling without an auxiliary compensation branch. 2) Replacing the DE module with Inception Depthwise Convolution (IDConv). IDConv borrows the Inception concept, decomposing large-kernel operations into efficient parallel branches (square, horizontal, and vertical strips), thereby capturing spectrogram features with extremely low parameter redundancy.

As the performance of query execution critically depends on this choice, join ordering lies at the core of query optimization. Traditional approaches cast this problem as a discrete combinatorial search over binary trees guided by a cost model, but they often suffer from high computational complexity and limited scalability. We show that, when the cost model is differentiable, the query plans can be continuously relaxed into a soft adjacency matrix representing a superposition of plans. This continuous relaxation, together with a Gumbel-Softmax parameterization of the adjacency matrix and differentiable constraints enforcing plan validity, enables gradient-based search for plans within this relaxed space. Using a learned Graph Neural Network as the cost model, we demonstrate that this gradient-based approach can find comparable and even lower-cost plans compared to traditional discrete local search methods on two different graph datasets. Furthermore, we empirically show that the runtime of this approach scales linearly with query size, in contrast to quadratic or exponential runtimes of classical approaches.

This biological principle inspired the attention mechanism in modern Transformers. Transformers now underpin large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, but at the cost of massive training and inference energy, leading to a large carbon footprint. While brain attention emerges from neural circuits, Transformer attention relies on dot-product similarity to weight elements in the input sequence. Neuromorphic computing, especially spiking neural networks (SNNs), offers a brain-inspired path to energy-efficient intelligence. Despite recent work on attention-based spiking Transformers, the core attention layer remains non-neuromorphic. Current spiking attention (i) relies on dot-product or element-wise similarity suited to floating-point operations, not event-driven spikes; (ii) keeps attention matrices that suffer from the von Neumann bottleneck, limiting in-memory computing; and (iii) still diverges from brain-like computation. To address these issues, we propose the Spiking STDP Transformer (S$^{2}$TDPT), a neuromorphic Transformer that implements self-attention through spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), embedding query--key correlations in synaptic weights. STDP, a core mechanism of memory and learning in the brain and widely studied in neuromorphic devices, naturally enables in-memory computing and supports non-von Neumann hardware. On CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, our model achieves 94.35\\% and 78.08\\% accuracy with only four timesteps and 0.49 mJ on CIFAR-100, an 88.47\\% energy reduction compared to a standard ANN Transformer.

Error Feedback (EF) mechanisms are widely adopted to mitigate this issue of distributed compression algorithms. Despite their popularity and training efficiency, existing distributed EF algorithms often require prior knowledge of problem parameters (e.g., smoothness constants) to fine-tune stepsizes. This limits their practical applicability especially in large-scale neural network training. In this paper, we study normalized error feedback algorithms that combine EF with normalized updates, various momentum variants, and parameter-agnostic, time-varying stepsizes, thus eliminating the need for problem-dependent tuning. We analyze the convergence of these algorithms for minimizing smooth functions, and establish parameter-agnostic complexity bounds that are close to the best-known bounds with carefully-tuned problem-dependent stepsizes.

Here, we propose Apo2Mol, a diffusion-based generative framework for 3D molecule design that explicitly accounts for conformational flexibility in protein binding pockets. To support this, we curate a dataset of over 24,000 experimentally resolved apo-holo structure pairs from the Protein Data Bank, enabling the characterization of protein structure changes associated with ligand binding. Apo2Mol employs a full-atom hierarchical graph-based diffusion model that simultaneously generates 3D ligand molecules and their corresponding holo pocket conformations from input apo states.

This happens because demonstrations show robots how to do a task but not what matters for that task, causing the model to focus on irrelevant state details. Natural language can more directly specify what the robot should focus on, and, in principle, disambiguate between many reward functions consistent with the demonstrations. However, existing language-conditioned reward learning methods typically treat instructions as simple conditioning signals, without fully exploiting their potential to resolve ambiguity. Moreover, real instructions are often ambiguous themselves, so naive conditioning is unreliable. Our key insight is that these two input types carry complementary information: demonstrations show how to act, while language specifies what is important. We propose Masked Inverse Reinforcement Learning (Masked IRL), a framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to combine the strengths of both input types. Masked IRL infers state-relevance masks from language instructions and enforces invariance to irrelevant state components. When instructions are ambiguous, it uses LLM reasoning to clarify them in the context of the demonstrations. In simulation and on a real robot, Masked IRL outperforms prior language-conditioned IRL methods by up to 15% while using up to 4.7 times less data, demonstrating improved sample-efficiency, generalization, and robustness to ambiguous language.

A particular strength of SNMMs is to break the joint effect of treatment sequences over time into localized, time-specific ``blip effects''. This decomposition promotes interpretability through the incremental effects and enables the efficient offline evaluation of optimal treatment policies without re-computation. However, neural frameworks for SNMMs are lacking, as their inherently sequential g-estimation scheme prevents end-to-end, gradient-based training. Here, we propose DeepBlip, the first neural framework for SNMMs, which overcomes this limitation with a novel double optimization trick to enable simultaneous learning of all blip functions.

Recent advances have demonstrated that SGS models trained via ``online'' end-to-end learning -- where the dynamical solver operating on the filtered equations participates in the training -- can outperform traditional physics-based approaches. Most studies, however, have focused on idealised periodic domains, neglecting the mechanical boundaries present e.g. in planetary interiors. To address this issue, we consider two-dimensional quasi-geostrophic turbulent flow in an axisymmetric bounded domain that we model using a pseudo-spectral differentiable solver, thereby enabling online learning. We examine three configurations, varying the geometry (between an exponential container and a spherical shell) and the rotation rate. Flow is driven by a prescribed analytical forcing, allowing for precise control over the energy injection scale and an exact estimate of the power input. We evaluate the accuracy of the online-trained SGS model against the reference direct numerical simulation using integral quantities and spectral diagnostics. In all configurations, we show that an SGS model trained on data spanning only one turnover time remains stable and accurate over integrations at least a hundred times longer than the training period. Moreover, we demonstrate the model's remarkable ability to reproduce slow processes occurring on time scales far exceeding the training duration, such as the inward drift of jets in the spherical shell. These results suggest a promising path towards developing SGS models for planetary and stellar interior dynamics, including dynamo processes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u8fb9\u754c\u57df\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u5728\u7ebf\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e9a\u7f51\u683c\u5c3a\u5ea6(SGS)\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5373\u4f7f\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ffb\u8f6c\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u80fd\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u79ef\u5206\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u91cd\u73b0\u8fdc\u8d85\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u957f\u7684\u6162\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5927\u591a\u6570\u4e9a\u7f51\u683c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u7814\u7a76\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u7684\u5468\u671f\u57df\u4e2d\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u884c\u661f\u5185\u90e8\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u673a\u68b0\u8fb9\u754c\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u8f74\u5bf9\u79f0\u6709\u754c\u57df\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3SGS\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e8c\u7ef4\u51c6\u5730\u8f6c\u6e4d\u6d41\u5728\u8f74\u5bf9\u79f0\u6709\u754c\u57df\u4e2d\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4f2a\u8c31\u53ef\u5fae\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\uff08\u6307\u6570\u5bb9\u5668\u548c\u7403\u58f3\uff09\u548c\u65cb\u8f6c\u901f\u7387\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c4\u5b9a\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u5f3a\u8feb\u9a71\u52a8\u6d41\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6240\u6709\u914d\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ffb\u8f6c\u65f6\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684SGS\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6bd4\u8bad\u7ec3\u5468\u671f\u957f\u81f3\u5c11\u4e00\u767e\u500d\u7684\u79ef\u5206\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u91cd\u73b0\u8fdc\u8d85\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u957f\u7684\u6162\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08\u5982\u7403\u58f3\u4e2d\u5c04\u6d41\u7684\u5185\u5411\u6f02\u79fb\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u884c\u661f\u548c\u6052\u661f\u5185\u90e8\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u53d1\u7535\u673a\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff09\u7684SGS\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "relevance": 10.0}}

However, both AI and humans are prone to biases. While AI and human biases have been studied extensively in isolation, this paper examines their complex interaction. Specifically, we examined how class imbalance as an AI bias affects people's ability to appropriately rely on an AI-based decision-support system, and how it interacts with base rate neglect as a human bias. In a within-subject online study (N= 46), participants classified three diseases using an AI-based decision-support system trained on either a balanced or unbalanced dataset. We found that class imbalance disrupted participants' calibration of AI reliance. Moreover, we observed mutually reinforcing effects between class imbalance and base rate neglect, offering evidence of a compound human-AI bias.

This issue arises from the lack of comprehensive benchmarks that assess both external environmental risks and in-cabin driving behavior safety simultaneously. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce DSBench, the first comprehensive Driving Safety Benchmark designed to assess a VLM's awareness of various safety risks in a unified manner. DSBench encompasses two major categories: external environmental risks and in-cabin driving behavior safety, divided into 10 key categories and a total of 28 sub-categories. This comprehensive evaluation covers a wide range of scenarios, ensuring a thorough assessment of VLMs' performance in safety-critical contexts. Extensive evaluations across various mainstream open-source and closed-source VLMs reveal significant performance degradation under complex safety-critical situations, highlighting urgent safety concerns. To address this, we constructed a large dataset of 98K instances focused on in-cabin and external safety scenarios, showing that fine-tuning on this dataset significantly enhances the safety performance of existing VLMs and paves the way for advancing autonomous driving technology.

Together, these mechanisms substantially reduce long-tail latency and improve resource efficiency during rollout.

Prior work highlights deep learning as a promising approach, but existing models depend on brute-force Doppler augmentation to achieve real-world generalization, which undermines both training efficiency and interpretability. In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture with complex-valued layers that exploits convolutional shift equivariance in the frequency domain. To establish provable frequency bin shift invariance, we use adaptive polyphase sampling (APS) as pooling layers followed by a global average pooling layer at the end of the network. Using a synthetic dataset of common interference signals, experimental results demonstrate that unlike a vanilla CNN, our model maintains consistent classification accuracy with and without random Doppler shifts despite being trained on no Doppler-shifted examples. Overall, our method establishes an invariance-driven framework for signal classification that offers provable robustness against real-world effects.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5177\u6709\u590d\u503c\u5c42\u7684\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9891\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u5377\u79ef\u79fb\u4f4d\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u76f8\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u5e73\u5747\u6c60\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u9891\u7387\u7bb1\u79fb\u4f4d\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u65e0\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u79fb\u4f4d\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u79fb\u4f4d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7ade\u4e89\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u9891\u8c31\u76d1\u6d4b\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u7c7b\u6280\u672f\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u66b4\u529b\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u589e\u5f3a\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u8fd9\u635f\u5bb3\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5177\u6709\u590d\u503c\u5c42\u7684CNN\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9891\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u5377\u79ef\u79fb\u4f4d\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u76f8\u91c7\u6837\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6c60\u5316\u5c42\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u5168\u5c40\u5e73\u5747\u6c60\u5316\u5c42\u6765\u5efa\u7acb\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u9891\u7387\u7bb1\u79fb\u4f4d\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e38\u89c1\u5e72\u6270\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u666e\u901aCNN\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6709\u65e0\u968f\u673a\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u79fb\u4f4d\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u90fd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u6ca1\u6709\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u79fb\u4f4d\u6837\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "relevance": 20.0}}

This makes them powerful priors for DNA sequence modeling, particularly over long ranges. However, two major constraints hinder their use in practice: the quadratic computational cost of self-attention and the growing memory required for key-value (KV) caches during autoregressive decoding. These constraints force the use of heuristics such as fixed-window truncation or sliding windows, which compromise fidelity on ultra-long sequences by discarding distant information. We introduce FOCUS (Feature-Oriented Compression for Ultra-long Self-attention), a progressive context-compression module that can be plugged into pretrained DNA LLMs. FOCUS combines the established k-mer representation in genomics with learnable hierarchical compression: it inserts summary tokens at k-mer granularity and progressively compresses attention key and value activations across multiple Transformer layers, retaining only the summary KV states across windows while discarding ordinary-token KV. A shared-boundary windowing scheme yields a stationary cross-window interface that propagates long-range information with minimal loss. We validate FOCUS on an Evo-2-based DNA LLM fine-tuned on GRCh38 chromosome 1 with self-supervised training and randomized compression schedules to promote robustness across compression ratios. On held-out human chromosomes, FOCUS achieves near-lossless fidelity: compressing a 1 kb context into only 10 summary tokens (about 100x) shifts the average per-nucleotide probability by only about 0.0004. Compared to a baseline without compression, FOCUS reduces KV-cache memory and converts effective inference scaling from O(N^2) to near-linear O(N), enabling about 100x longer inference windows on commodity GPUs with near-lossless fidelity.", "AI": {"tldr": "FOCUS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8eDNA\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5bfc\u5411\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u5171\u4eab\u8fb9\u754c\u7a97\u53e3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c06KV\u7f13\u5b58\u5185\u5b58\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea6100\u500d\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4eceO(N^2)\u964d\u81f3\u8fd1\u7ebf\u6027O(N)\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8fd1\u4e4e\u65e0\u635f\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u8d85\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "DNA\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8d85\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u4e8c\u6b21\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548cKV\u7f13\u5b58\u5185\u5b58\u589e\u957f\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u4e22\u5f03\u8fdc\u8ddd\u79bb\u4fe1\u606f\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684k-mer\u8868\u793a\u548c\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u5c42\u538b\u7f29\uff1a\u5728k-mer\u7c92\u5ea6\u63d2\u5165\u6458\u8981\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u8de8\u591a\u4e2aTransformer\u5c42\u6e10\u8fdb\u538b\u7f29\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u952e\u503c\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u4ec5\u4fdd\u7559\u8de8\u7a97\u53e3\u7684\u6458\u8981KV\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5171\u4eab\u8fb9\u754c\u7a97\u53e3\u65b9\u6848\u4f20\u64ad\u957f\u7a0b\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u67d3\u8272\u4f53\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c061kb\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u4ec510\u4e2a\u6458\u8981\u6807\u8bb0\uff08\u7ea6100\u500d\u538b\u7f29\uff09\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u6bcf\u6838\u82f7\u9178\u6982\u7387\u4ec5\u53d8\u5316\u7ea60.0004\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd1\u4e4e\u65e0\u635f\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "FOCUS\u6a21\u5757\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11KV\u7f13\u5b58\u5185\u5b58\u5e76\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u964d\u81f3\u8fd1\u7ebf\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5546\u54c1GPU\u4e0a\u652f\u6301\u7ea6100\u500d\u66f4\u957f\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7a97\u53e3\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8fd1\u4e4e\u65e0\u635f\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

Unfortunately, the verification of such systems remains challenging, largely due to the complexity of the controllers, which are often nonlinear, nonconvex, learning-based, and/or black-box. Prior works propose verification algorithms that are based on approximate reachability methods, but they often restrict the class of controllers and systems that can be handled or result in overly conservative analyses. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a popular formal verification tool for general nonlinear systems that can compute optimal reachable sets under worst-case system uncertainties; however, its application to perception-based systems is currently underexplored. In this work, we propose RoVer-CoRe, a framework for the Robust Verification of Controllers via HJ Reachability. To the best of our knowledge, RoVer-CoRe is the first HJ reachability-based framework for the verification of perception-based systems under perceptual uncertainty. Our key insight is to concatenate the system controller, observation function, and the state estimation modules to obtain an equivalent closed-loop system that is readily compatible with existing reachability frameworks. Within RoVer-CoRe, we propose novel methods for formal safety verification and robust controller design. We demonstrate the efficacy of the framework in case studies involving aircraft taxiing and NN-based rover navigation.

In this work, we introduce NORA-1.5, a VLA model built from the pre-trained NORA backbone by adding to it a flow-matching-based action expert. This architectural enhancement alone yields substantial performance gains, enabling NORA-1.5 to outperform NORA and several state-of-the-art VLA models across both simulated and real-world benchmarks. To further improve robustness and task success, we develop a set of reward models for post-training VLA policies. Our rewards combine (i) an action-conditioned world model (WM) that evaluates whether generated actions lead toward the desired goal, and (ii) a deviation-from-ground-truth heuristic that distinguishes good actions from poor ones. Using these reward signals, we construct preference datasets and adapt NORA-1.5 to target embodiments through direct preference optimization (DPO). Extensive evaluations show that reward-driven post-training consistently improves performance in both simulation and real-robot settings, demonstrating significant VLA model-reliability gains through simple yet effective reward models.

By using declarative equations or rewriting each real-relational hypothesis $h_i$ to $h_i-r_i$, and the thesis $t$ to $t-r$, clearing the denominators and introducing an extra expression with a slack variable, we eliminate all free and relational point variables. From the obtained ideal $I$ in $\\mathbb{Q}[r,r_1,r_2,\\ldots]$ we can find a conclusive result. It plays an important role that if $r_1,r_2,\\ldots$ are real, $r$ must also be real if there is a linear polynomial $p(r)\\in I$, unless division by zero occurs when expressing $r$. Our results are presented in Mathematica, Maple and in a new version of the Giac computer algebra system.
