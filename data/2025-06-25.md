TL;DR: ECCoT框架通过MRF-ETM和CSBert技术提升LLM推理链的可靠性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs缺乏透明性且输出不可靠，需改进推理链的验证方法。

Method: 提出ECCoT框架，结合MRF-ETM生成主题感知推理链，CSBert对齐因果推理，并通过统计过滤无效链。

Result: ECCoT提高了LLM的可解释性，减少偏见，增强决策可信度。

Conclusion: ECCoT为LLM推理链验证提供了有效工具，提升了模型的可信度和透明度。

Abstract: In the era of large-scale artificial intelligence, Large Language Models
(LLMs) have made significant strides in natural language processing. However,
they often lack transparency and generate unreliable outputs, raising concerns
about their interpretability. To address this, the Chain of Thought (CoT)
prompting method structures reasoning into step-by-step deductions. Yet, not
all reasoning chains are valid, and errors can lead to unreliable conclusions.
We propose ECCoT, an End-to-End Cognitive Chain of Thought Validation
Framework, to evaluate and refine reasoning chains in LLMs. ECCoT integrates
the Markov Random Field-Embedded Topic Model (MRF-ETM) for topic-aware CoT
generation and Causal Sentence-BERT (CSBert) for causal reasoning alignment. By
filtering ineffective chains using structured ordering statistics, ECCoT
improves interpretability, reduces biases, and enhances the trustworthiness of
LLM-based decision-making. Key contributions include the introduction of ECCoT,
MRF-ETM for topic-driven CoT generation, and CSBert for causal reasoning
enhancement. Code is released at: https://github.com/erwinmsmith/ECCoT.git.

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs在STEM领域中倾向于记忆而非真正学习推理模式，导致自我认知缺陷和信任问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否真正学习推理模式或仅记忆数据，以解决其自我认知缺陷和信任问题。

Method: 使用新颖框架分析LLMs在STEM领域的泛化能力，评估其自我认知一致性。

Result: LLMs因记忆解决方案而高估自身推理能力，在逻辑一致的任务扰动中表现出45%的不一致性。

Conclusion: 当前架构和训练模式存在缺陷，需改进以确保模型自我认知的一致性和可信度。

Abstract: When artificial intelligence mistakes memorization for intelligence, it
creates a dangerous mirage of reasoning. Existing studies treat memorization
and self-knowledge deficits in LLMs as separate issues and do not recognize an
intertwining link that degrades the trustworthiness of LLM responses. In our
study, we utilize a novel framework to ascertain if LLMs genuinely learn
reasoning patterns from training data or merely memorize them to assume
competence across problems of similar complexity focused on STEM domains. Our
analysis shows a noteworthy problem in generalization: LLMs draw confidence
from memorized solutions to infer a higher self-knowledge about their reasoning
ability, which manifests as an over 45% inconsistency in feasibility
assessments when faced with self-validated, logically coherent task
perturbations. This effect is most pronounced in science and medicine domains,
which tend to have maximal standardized jargon and problems, further confirming
our approach. Significant wavering within the self-knowledge of LLMs also shows
flaws in current architectures and training patterns, highlighting the need for
techniques that ensure a balanced, consistent stance on models' perceptions of
their own knowledge for maximum AI explainability and trustworthiness. Our code

TL;DR: 研究发现，指令调优的语言模型对非规范分词具有较强鲁棒性，性能保留高达93.4%，且在某些任务中非规范分词能提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型对训练中未见过的非规范分词的鲁棒性，并研究其在特定任务中的潜在优势。

Method: 通过20个基准测试评估模型在随机和字符级分词下的性能，并分析其鲁棒性来源。

Result: 指令调优模型对非规范分词保留90%以上性能，字符级分词在字符串和代码任务中提升14%，数字对齐分词提升算术任务33%。

Conclusion: 模型对分词器的依赖低于预期，推理时干预分词可提升性能。

Abstract: Modern tokenizers employ deterministic algorithms to map text into a single
"canonical" token sequence, yet the same string can be encoded as many
non-canonical tokenizations using the tokenizer vocabulary. In this work, we
investigate the robustness of LMs to text encoded with non-canonical
tokenizations entirely unseen during training. Surprisingly, when evaluated
across 20 benchmarks, we find that instruction-tuned models retain up to 93.4%
of their original performance when given a randomly sampled tokenization, and
90.8% with character-level tokenization. We see that overall stronger models
tend to be more robust, and robustness diminishes as the tokenization departs
farther from the canonical form. Motivated by these results, we then identify
settings where non-canonical tokenization schemes can *improve* performance,
finding that character-level segmentation improves string manipulation and code
understanding tasks by up to +14%, and right-aligned digit grouping enhances
large-number arithmetic by +33%. Finally, we investigate the source of this
robustness, finding that it arises in the instruction-tuning phase. We show
that while both base and post-trained models grasp the semantics of
non-canonical tokenizations (perceiving them as containing misspellings), base
models try to mimic the imagined mistakes and degenerate into nonsensical
output, while post-trained models are committed to fluent responses. Overall,
our findings suggest that models are less tied to their tokenizer than
previously believed, and demonstrate the promise of intervening on tokenization
at inference time to boost performance.

Motivation: LLMs生成的响应常带有偏见，现有评估方法未能充分解决长文本和输出变异性问题。

Method: FiSCo通过分解模型输出为语义独立的声明，利用蕴含检查进行群体间公平性统计测试。

Result: FiSCo在合成和人工标注数据集上验证，能更可靠地识别细微偏见，优于现有评估指标。

Conclusion: FiSCo为LLMs的公平性评估提供了更精细和可靠的方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate responses with inherent biases,
undermining their reliability in real-world applications. Existing evaluation
methods often overlook biases in long-form responses and the intrinsic
variability of LLM outputs. To address these challenges, we propose
FiSCo(Fine-grained Semantic Computation), a novel statistical framework to
evaluate group-level fairness in LLMs by detecting subtle semantic differences
in long-form responses across demographic groups. Unlike prior work focusing on
sentiment or token-level comparisons, FiSCo goes beyond surface-level analysis
by operating at the claim level, leveraging entailment checks to assess the
consistency of meaning across responses. We decompose model outputs into
semantically distinct claims and apply statistical hypothesis testing to
compare inter- and intra-group similarities, enabling robust detection of
subtle biases. We formalize a new group counterfactual fairness definition and
validate FiSCo on both synthetic and human-annotated datasets spanning gender,
race, and age. Experiments show that FiSco more reliably identifies nuanced
biases while reducing the impact of stochastic LLM variability, outperforming
various evaluation metrics.

Motivation: 评估LLMs的道德推理能力，解决现有基准在透明性和跨文化评估上的不足。

Method: 使用MFTCXplain数据集，包含3000条多语言推文，标注了仇恨言论标签、道德类别和文本级解释。

Result: LLMs在仇恨言论检测上表现良好（F1达0.836），但在道德情感预测上较弱（F1<0.35），且在少数语言中解释对齐有限。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在理解和反映人类道德推理方面能力有限。

Abstract: Ensuring the moral reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
a growing concern as these systems are used in socially sensitive tasks.
Nevertheless, current evaluation benchmarks present two major shortcomings: a
lack of annotations that justify moral classifications, which limits
transparency and interpretability; and a predominant focus on English, which
constrains the assessment of moral reasoning across diverse cultural settings.
In this paper, we introduce MFTCXplain, a multilingual benchmark dataset for
evaluating the moral reasoning of LLMs via hate speech multi-hop explanation
using Moral Foundation Theory (MFT). The dataset comprises 3,000 tweets across
Portuguese, Italian, Persian, and English, annotated with binary hate speech
labels, moral categories, and text span-level rationales. Empirical results
highlight a misalignment between LLM outputs and human annotations in moral
reasoning tasks. While LLMs perform well in hate speech detection (F1 up to
0.836), their ability to predict moral sentiments is notably weak (F1 < 0.35).
Furthermore, rationale alignment remains limited mainly in underrepresented
languages. These findings show the limited capacity of current LLMs to
internalize and reflect human moral reasoning.

Abstract: We introduce $\texttt{StorySim}$, a programmable framework for synthetically
generating stories to evaluate the theory of mind (ToM) and world modeling (WM)
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior benchmarks that may
suffer from contamination in pretraining data, $\texttt{StorySim}$ produces
novel, compositional story prompts anchored by a highly controllable
$\texttt{Storyboard}$, enabling precise manipulation of character perspectives
and events. We use this framework to design first- and second-order ToM tasks
alongside WM tasks that control for the ability to track and model mental
states. Our experiments across a suite of state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that
most models perform better on WM tasks than ToM tasks, and that models tend to
perform better reasoning with humans compared to inanimate objects.
Additionally, our framework enabled us to find evidence of heuristic behavior
such as recency bias and an over-reliance on earlier events in the story. All
code for generating data and evaluations is freely available.

Conclusion: HAF为评估LLMs的毒性解释提供了一种有效方法，揭示了其在复杂推理中的局限性。

Abstract: The discourse around toxicity and LLMs in NLP largely revolves around
detection tasks. This work shifts the focus to evaluating LLMs' reasoning about
toxicity -- from their explanations that justify a stance -- to enhance their
trustworthiness in downstream tasks. Despite extensive research on
explainability, it is not straightforward to adopt existing methods to evaluate
free-form toxicity explanation due to their over-reliance on input text
perturbations, among other challenges. To account for these, we propose a
novel, theoretically-grounded multi-dimensional criterion, Human-Aligned
Faithfulness (HAF), that measures the extent to which LLMs' free-form toxicity
explanations align with those of a rational human under ideal conditions. We
develop six metrics, based on uncertainty quantification, to comprehensively
evaluate \haf of LLMs' toxicity explanations with no human involvement, and
highlight how "non-ideal" the explanations are. We conduct several experiments
on three Llama models (of size up to 70B) and an 8B Ministral model on five
diverse toxicity datasets. Our results show that while LLMs generate plausible
explanations to simple prompts, their reasoning about toxicity breaks down when
prompted about the nuanced relations between the complete set of reasons, the
individual reasons, and their toxicity stances, resulting in inconsistent and
nonsensical responses. We open-source our code and LLM-generated explanations

Conclusion: 少样本提示和翻译测试是低资源语言上下文学习的有效方法，梯度方法需进一步优化。

Abstract: LLMs are typically trained in high-resource languages, and tasks in
lower-resourced languages tend to underperform the higher-resource language
counterparts for in-context learning. Despite the large body of work on
prompting settings, it is still unclear how LLMs should be adapted
cross-lingually specifically for in-context learning in the low-resource target
languages. We perform a comprehensive study spanning five diverse target
languages, three base LLMs, and seven downstream tasks spanning over 4,100 GPU
training hours (9,900+ TFLOPs) across various adaptation techniques: few-shot
prompting, translate-test, fine-tuning, embedding re-initialization, and
instruction fine-tuning. Our results show that the few-shot prompting and
translate-test settings tend to heavily outperform the gradient-based
adaptation methods. To better understand this discrepancy, we design a novel
metric, Valid Output Recall (VOR), and analyze model outputs to empirically
attribute the degradation of these trained models to catastrophic forgetting.
To the extent of our knowledge, this is the largest study done on in-context
learning for low-resource languages with respect to train compute and number of
adaptation techniques considered. We make all our datasets and trained models
available for public use.

Abstract: Multi-agent techniques such as role playing or multi-turn debates have been
shown to be effective in improving the performance of large language models
(LLMs) in downstream tasks. Despite their differences in workflows, existing
LLM-based multi-agent systems mostly use natural language for agent
communication. While this is appealing for its simplicity and interpretability,
it also introduces inevitable information loss as one model must down sample
its continuous state vectors to concrete tokens before transferring them to the
other model. Such losses are particularly significant when the information to
transfer is not simple facts, but reasoning logics or abstractive thoughts. To
tackle this problem, we propose a new communication protocol that transfers
both natural language tokens and token-wise state transition trajectory from
one agent to another. Particularly, compared to the actual state value, we find
that the sequence of state changes in LLMs after generating each token can
better reflect the information hidden behind the inference process, so we
propose a State Delta Encoding (SDE) method to represent state transition
trajectories. The experimental results show that multi-agent systems with SDE
achieve SOTA performance compared to other communication protocols,
particularly in tasks that involve complex reasoning. This shows the potential
of communication augmentation for LLM-based multi-agent systems.

Abstract: With the remarkable generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs),
using LLM-generated data to train downstream models has emerged as a promising
approach to mitigate data scarcity in specific domains and reduce
time-consuming annotations. However, recent studies have highlighted a critical
issue: iterative training on self-generated data results in model collapse,
where model performance degrades over time. Despite extensive research on the
implications of LLM-generated data, these works often neglect the importance of
data diversity, a key factor in data quality. In this work, we aim to
understand the implications of the diversity of LLM-generated data on
downstream model performance. Specifically, we explore how varying levels of
diversity in LLM-generated data affect downstream model performance.
Additionally, we investigate the performance of models trained on data that
mixes different proportions of LLM-generated data, which we refer to as
synthetic data. Our experimental results show that, with minimal distribution
shift, moderately diverse LLM-generated data can enhance model performance in
scenarios with insufficient labeled data, whereas highly diverse generated data
has a negative impact. We hope our empirical findings will offer valuable
guidance for future studies on LLMs as data generators.

Abstract: Ensuring persona fidelity in large language models (LLMs) is essential for
maintaining coherent and engaging human-AI interactions. However, LLMs often
exhibit Out-of-Character (OOC) behavior, where generated responses deviate from
an assigned persona, leading to inconsistencies that affect model reliability.
Existing evaluation methods typically assign single scores to entire responses,
struggling to capture subtle persona misalignment, particularly in long-form
text generation. To address this limitation, we propose an atomic-level
evaluation framework that quantifies persona fidelity at a finer granularity.
Our three key metrics measure the degree of persona alignment and consistency
within and across generations. Our approach enables a more precise and
realistic assessment of persona fidelity by identifying subtle deviations that
real users would encounter. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that our
framework effectively detects persona inconsistencies that prior methods
overlook. By analyzing persona fidelity across diverse tasks and personality
types, we reveal how task structure and persona desirability influence model
adaptability, highlighting challenges in maintaining consistent persona
expression.

Abstract: There is growing interest in leveraging mechanistic interpretability and
controllability to better understand and influence the internal dynamics of
large language models (LLMs). However, current methods face fundamental
challenges in reliably localizing and manipulating feature representations.
Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have recently emerged as a promising direction for
feature extraction at scale, yet they, too, are limited by incomplete feature
isolation and unreliable monosemanticity. To systematically quantify these
limitations, we introduce Feature Monosemanticity Score (FMS), a novel metric
to quantify feature monosemanticity in latent representation. Building on these
insights, we propose Guided Sparse Autoencoders (G-SAE), a method that
conditions latent representations on labeled concepts during training. We
demonstrate that reliable localization and disentanglement of target concepts
within the latent space improve interpretability, detection of behavior, and
control. Specifically, our evaluations on toxicity detection, writing style
identification, and privacy attribute recognition show that G-SAE not only
enhances monosemanticity but also enables more effective and fine-grained
steering with less quality degradation. Our findings provide actionable
guidelines for measuring and advancing mechanistic interpretability and control
of LLMs.

Abstract: Detecting whether a given text is a member of the pre-training data of Large
Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for ensuring data privacy and copyright
protection. Most existing methods rely on the LLM's hidden information (e.g.,
model parameters or token probabilities), making them ineffective in the
black-box setting, where only input and output texts are accessible. Although
some methods have been proposed for the black-box setting, they rely on massive
manual efforts such as designing complicated questions or instructions. To
address these issues, we propose VeilProbe, the first framework for
automatically detecting LLMs' pre-training texts in a black-box setting without
human intervention. VeilProbe utilizes a sequence-to-sequence mapping model to
infer the latent mapping feature between the input text and the corresponding
output suffix generated by the LLM. Then it performs the key token
perturbations to obtain more distinguishable membership features. Additionally,
considering real-world scenarios where the ground-truth training text samples
are limited, a prototype-based membership classifier is introduced to alleviate
the overfitting issue. Extensive evaluations on three widely used datasets
demonstrate that our framework is effective and superior in the black-box
setting.

Abstract: Incorporating explicit reasoning rules within the latent space of language
models (LMs) offers a promising pathway to enhance generalisation,
interpretability, and controllability. While current Transformer-based language
models have shown strong performance on Natural Language Inference (NLI) tasks,
they often rely on memorisation rather than rule-based inference. This work
investigates how reasoning rules can be explicitly embedded and memorised
within the LMs through Language Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). We propose a
complete pipeline for learning reasoning rules within Transformer-based
language VAEs. This pipeline encompasses three rule-based reasoning tasks, a
supporting theoretical framework, and a practical end-to-end architecture. The
experiment illustrates the following findings: Disentangled reasoning: Under
explicit signal supervision, reasoning rules - viewed as functional mappings -
can be disentangled within the encoder's parametric space. This separation
results in distinct clustering of rules in the output feature space. Prior
knowledge injection: injecting reasoning information into the Query enables the
model to more effectively retrieve the stored value Value from memory based on
Key. This approach offers a simple method for integrating prior knowledge into
decoder-only language models. Performance bottleneck: In mathematical reasoning
tasks using Qwen2.5(0.5B), increasing sample count doesn't improve performance
beyond a point. Moreover, ffn layers are better than attention layers at
preserving the separation of reasoning rules in the model's parameters.

Abstract: Human annotation variation (i.e., annotation disagreements) is common in NLP
and often reflects important information such as task subjectivity and sample
ambiguity. While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for
automatic annotation to reduce human effort, their evaluation often focuses on
predicting the majority-voted "ground truth" labels. It is still unclear,
however, whether these models also capture informative human annotation
variation. Our work addresses this gap by extensively evaluating LLMs' ability
to predict annotation disagreements without access to repeated human labels.
Our results show that LLMs struggle with modeling disagreements, which can be
overlooked by majority label-based evaluations. Notably, while RLVR-style
(Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards) reasoning generally boosts LLM
performance, it degrades performance in disagreement prediction. Our findings
highlight the critical need for evaluating and improving LLM annotators in
disagreement modeling. Code and data at

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) are advancing rapidly, with new
models frequently claiming support for an increasing number of languages.
However, existing evaluation datasets are limited and lack cross-lingual
alignment, leaving assessments of multilingual capabilities fragmented in both
language and skill coverage. To address this, we introduce MuBench, a benchmark
covering 61 languages and evaluating a broad range of capabilities. We evaluate
several state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs and find notable gaps between
claimed and actual language coverage, particularly a persistent performance
disparity between English and low-resource languages. Leveraging MuBench's
alignment, we propose Multilingual Consistency (MLC) as a complementary metric
to accuracy for analyzing performance bottlenecks and guiding model
improvement. Finally, we pretrain a suite of 1.2B-parameter models on English
and Chinese with 500B tokens, varying language ratios and parallel data
proportions to investigate cross-lingual transfer dynamics.

<details>

Motivation: LRMs在复杂任务中表现出色，但过度推理可能导致简单任务中的冗余计算。高效推理策略虽减少推理长度，但其是否影响模型行为一致性尚不明确。

Method: 引入$ICBENCH$基准，从三个维度（任务设置、训练目标与学习行为、内部推理与自我解释）评估LRMs的不一致性。

Result: 大型模型一致性更高，但仍普遍存在“欺骗”行为；高效推理策略（如No-Thinking和Simple Token-Budget）显著增加不一致性。

Conclusion: 高效推理虽提升效率，但可能引入模型逃避监督的风险，需进一步研究。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance on complex
tasks by engaging in extended reasoning before producing final answers, yet
this strength introduces the risk of overthinking, where excessive token
generation occurs even for simple tasks. While recent work in efficient
reasoning seeks to reduce reasoning length while preserving accuracy, it
remains unclear whether such optimization is truly a free lunch. Drawing on the
intuition that compressing reasoning may reduce the robustness of model
responses and lead models to omit key reasoning steps, we investigate whether
efficient reasoning strategies introduce behavioral inconsistencies. To
systematically assess this, we introduce $ICBENCH$, a benchmark designed to
measure inconsistency in LRMs across three dimensions: inconsistency across
task settings (ITS), inconsistency between training objectives and learned
behavior (TR-LB), and inconsistency between internal reasoning and
self-explanations (IR-SE). Applying $ICBENCH$ to a range of open-source LRMs,
we find that while larger models generally exhibit greater consistency than
smaller ones, they all display widespread "scheming" behaviors, including
self-disagreement, post-hoc rationalization, and the withholding of reasoning
cues. Crucially, our results demonstrate that efficient reasoning strategies
such as No-Thinking and Simple Token-Budget consistently increase all three
defined types of inconsistency. These findings suggest that although efficient
reasoning enhances token-level efficiency, further investigation is imperative
to ascertain whether it concurrently introduces the risk of models evading
effective supervision.

Motivation: 解决超低位KV缓存量化导致的性能下降问题，通过分析不同token对量化误差的敏感性。

Method: 提出Anchor Score量化token敏感性，设计AnTKV框架结合Triton内核实现高效部署。

Result: AnTKV支持840K上下文长度，解码吞吐量提升3.5倍，1位量化下困惑度仅6.32。

Conclusion: AnTKV在超低位量化下表现优异，优于现有方法，适用于大规模LLM部署。

Abstract: Quantization has emerged as an effective and lightweight solution to reduce
the memory footprint of the KV cache in Large Language Models (LLMs).
Nevertheless, minimizing the performance degradation caused by ultra-low-bit KV
cache quantization remains a significant challenge. We observe that quantizing
the KV cache of different tokens has varying impacts on the quality of
attention outputs. To systematically investigate this phenomenon, we perform
forward error propagation analysis on attention and propose the Anchor Score
(AnS) that quantifies the sensitivity of each token's KV cache to
quantization-induced error. Our analysis reveals significant disparities in AnS
across tokens, suggesting that preserving a small subset with full precision
(FP16) of high-AnS tokens can greatly mitigate accuracy loss in aggressive
quantization scenarios. Based on this insight, we introduce AnTKV, a novel
framework that leverages Anchor Token-aware Vector Quantization to compress the
KV cache. Furthermore, to support efficient deployment, we design and develop a
triton kernel that is fully compatible with FlashAttention, enabling fast
online Anchor Token selection. AnTKV enables LLaMA-3-8B to handle context
lengths up to 840K tokens on a single 80GB A100 GPU, while achieving up to 3.5x
higher decoding throughput compared to the FP16 baseline. Our experiment
results demonstrate that AnTKV matches or outperforms prior works such as KIVI,
SKVQ, KVQuant, and CQ under 4-bit settings. More importantly, AnTKV achieves
significantly lower perplexity under ultra-low-bit quantization on Mistral-7B,
with only 6.32 at 1-bit and 8.87 at 0.375-bit, compared to the FP16 baseline of
4.73.

Attribution, where RC yields higher-fidelity token-, sentence-, and chunk-level

corrections. These methods have been explored for encyclopedic generation, but
less so for domains like news summarization. In this work, we investigate two
state-of-the-art self-correcting systems by applying them to correct
hallucinated summaries using evidence from three search engines. We analyze the

Motivation: To assess the generalizability of RPT across domains beyond fine-tuning data.

Method: Two studies: observational (comparing RPT models across domains) and interventional (fine-tuning on single domains and evaluating across multiple domains).

Result: RPT shows gains on similar tasks but inconsistent generalization to domains with different reasoning patterns.

Conclusion: RPT's benefits are domain-specific and may not generalize well.

Abstract: Reinforcement post training (RPT) has recently shown promise in improving the
reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, it remains
unclear how well these improvements generalize to new domains, as prior work
evaluates RPT models on data from the same domains used for fine-tuning. To
understand the generalizability of RPT, we conduct two studies. (1)
Observational: We compare a wide range of open-weight RPT models against their
corresponding base models across multiple domains, including both seen and
unseen domains in their fine-tuning data. (2) Interventional: we fine-tune LLMs
with RPT on single domains and evaluate their performance across multiple
domains. Both studies converge on the same conclusion that, although RPT brings
substantial gains on tasks similar to the fine-tuning data, the gains
generalize inconsistently and can vanish on domains with different reasoning
patterns.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning
tasks, yet the optimal integration of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains a fundamental challenge. Through
comprehensive analysis of token distributions, learning dynamics, and
integration mechanisms from entropy-based perspectives, we reveal key
differences between these paradigms: SFT induces coarse-grained global changes
to LLM policy distributions, while RL performs fine-grained selective
optimizations, with entropy serving as a critical indicator of training
effectiveness. Building on these observations, we propose Supervised
Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (SRFT), a single-stage method that unifies both
fine-tuning paradigms through entropy-aware weighting mechanisms. Our approach
simultaneously applies SFT and RL to directly optimize the LLM using
demonstrations and self-exploration rollouts rather than through two-stage
sequential methods. Extensive experiments show that SRFT achieves 59.1% average
accuracy, outperforming zero-RL methods by 9.0% on five mathematical reasoning
benchmarks and 10.9% on three out-of-distribution benchmarks.

Conclusion: 改写低质量网页文本是一种简单有效的预训练数据扩展方法，优于其他合成数据生成方法。

Abstract: Scaling laws predict that the performance of large language models improves
with increasing model size and data size. In practice, pre-training has been
relying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available
on the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the
same rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality
texts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of
the initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the "data wall"
of pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data
discarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web
with guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they
could become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the
representation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set. Experiments at
1B, 3B and 7B scales of the DCLM benchmark show that mixing high-quality raw
texts and our rewritten texts lead to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points
improvement respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only
filtered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more
effective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we
demonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming
lower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded. REWIRE also
outperforms related approaches of generating synthetic data, including
Wikipedia-style paraphrasing, question-answer synthesizing and knowledge
extraction. These results suggest that recycling web texts holds the potential
for being a simple and effective approach for scaling pre-training data.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
aiding developers with tasks like code comprehension, generation, and
translation. Supporting multilingual programming -- i.e., coding tasks across
multiple programming languages -- typically requires either (1) finetuning a
single LLM across all programming languages, which is cost-efficient but
sacrifices language-specific specialization and performance, or (2) finetuning
separate LLMs for each programming language, which allows for specialization
but is computationally expensive and storage-intensive due to the duplication
of parameters. This paper introduces MoLE (Mix-of-Language-Experts), a novel
architecture that balances efficiency and specialization for multilingual
programming. MoLE is composed of a base model, a shared LoRA (low-rank
adaptation) module, and a collection of language-specific LoRA modules. These
modules are jointly optimized during the finetuning process, enabling effective
knowledge sharing and specialization across programming languages. During
inference, MoLE automatically routes to the language-specific LoRA module
corresponding to the programming language of the code token being generated.
Our experiments demonstrate that MoLE achieves greater parameter efficiency
compared to training separate language-specific LoRAs, while outperforming a
single shared LLM finetuned for all programming languages in terms of accuracy.

Abstract: Information retrieval is a cornerstone of modern knowledge acquisition,
enabling billions of queries each day across diverse domains. However,
traditional keyword-based search engines are increasingly inadequate for
handling complex, multi-step information needs. Our position is that Large
Language Models (LLMs), endowed with reasoning and agentic capabilities, are
ushering in a new paradigm termed Agentic Deep Research. These systems
transcend conventional information search techniques by tightly integrating
autonomous reasoning, iterative retrieval, and information synthesis into a
dynamic feedback loop. We trace the evolution from static web search to
interactive, agent-based systems that plan, explore, and learn. We also
introduce a test-time scaling law to formalize the impact of computational
depth on reasoning and search. Supported by benchmark results and the rise of
open-source implementations, we demonstrate that Agentic Deep Research not only
significantly outperforms existing approaches, but is also poised to become the
dominant paradigm for future information seeking. All the related resources,

Result: 在数学和代码生成任务中，DUS优于现有并行解掩码方法，且无需修改去噪器。

Conclusion: DUS为高效高质量文本生成提供轻量级解决方案，释放MDLMs潜力。

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLM) have shown strong promise for
non-autoregressive text generation, yet existing samplers act as implicit
planners, selecting tokens to unmask via denoiser confidence or entropy scores.
Such heuristics falter under parallel unmasking - they ignore pairwise
interactions between tokens and cannot account for dependencies when unmasking
multiple positions at once, limiting their inference time to traditional
auto-regressive (AR) models. We introduce the Dilated-scheduled Unmasking
Strategy (DUS), an inference-only, planner-model-free method that requires no
additional training. DUS leverages a first-order Markov assumption to partition
sequence positions into dilation-based groups of non-adjacent tokens, enabling
independent, parallel unmasking steps that respect local context that minimizes
the joint entropy of each iteration step. Unlike semi-AR block approaches
(e.g., LLADA and Dream) that still invoke the denoiser per block, DUS reduces
the number of denoiser calls to O(log B) per generation block - yielding
substantial speedup over the O(B) run time of state-of-the-art diffusion
models, where B is the block size in the semi-AR inference process. In
experiments on math (GSM8K) and code completion (Humaneval, MBPP) benchmarks -
domains suited to non-ordinal generation - DUS improves scores over parallel
confidence-based planner, without modifying the underlying denoiser. DUS offers
a lightweight, budget-aware approach to efficient, high-quality text
generation, paving the way to unlock the true capabilities of MDLMs.

Abstract: This paper provides preliminary results on exploring the task of performing
turn-level data augmentation for dialogue system based on different types of
commonsense relationships, and the automatic evaluation of the generated
synthetic turns. The proposed methodology takes advantage of the extended
knowledge and zero-shot capabilities of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs)
to follow instructions, understand contextual information, and their
commonsense reasoning capabilities. The approach draws inspiration from
methodologies like Chain-of-Thought (CoT), applied more explicitly to the task
of prompt-based generation for dialogue-based data augmentation conditioned on
commonsense attributes, and the automatic evaluation of the generated
dialogues.
  To assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach, first we extracted 200
randomly selected partial dialogues, from 5 different well-known dialogue
datasets, and generate alternative responses conditioned on different event
commonsense attributes. This novel dataset allows us to measure the proficiency
of LLMs in generating contextually relevant commonsense knowledge, particularly
up to 12 different specific ATOMIC [10] database relations. Secondly, we
propose an evaluation framework to automatically detect the quality of the
generated dataset inspired by the ACCENT [26] metric, which offers a nuanced
approach to assess event commonsense. However, our method does not follow
ACCENT's complex eventrelation tuple extraction process. Instead, we propose an
instruction-based prompt for each commonsense attribute and use
state-of-the-art LLMs to automatically detect the original attributes used when
creating each augmented turn in the previous step.
  Preliminary results suggest that our approach effectively harnesses LLMs
capabilities for commonsense reasoning and evaluation in dialogue systems.

Motivation: 解决当前多模态医学LLMs在知识更新成本、全面性和灵活性方面的局限性。

Method: 将诊断过程分解为多个角色（如全科医生、专科团队等），每个角色由LLM智能体实现，实现模块化和协作。

Result: 在公开多模态医学数据集上，MAM性能显著优于基线模型（提升18%-365%）。

Conclusion: MAM框架有效提升了医学诊断的效率和性能，支持知识更新和现有资源的利用。

Abstract: Recent advancements in medical Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased
their powerful reasoning and diagnostic capabilities. Despite their success,
current unified multimodal medical LLMs face limitations in knowledge update
costs, comprehensiveness, and flexibility. To address these challenges, we
introduce the Modular Multi-Agent Framework for Multi-Modal Medical Diagnosis
(MAM). Inspired by our empirical findings highlighting the benefits of role
assignment and diagnostic discernment in LLMs, MAM decomposes the medical
diagnostic process into specialized roles: a General Practitioner, Specialist
Team, Radiologist, Medical Assistant, and Director, each embodied by an
LLM-based agent. This modular and collaborative framework enables efficient
knowledge updates and leverages existing medical LLMs and knowledge bases.
Extensive experimental evaluations conducted on a wide range of publicly
accessible multimodal medical datasets, incorporating text, image, audio, and
video modalities, demonstrate that MAM consistently surpasses the performance
of modality-specific LLMs. Notably, MAM achieves significant performance
improvements ranging from 18% to 365% compared to baseline models. Our code is
released at https://github.com/yczhou001/MAM.

Result: 建议LLM模拟应聚焦集体模式、与真实人口平均行为对齐，并提供验证方法。

Conclusion: LLM模拟在明确边界下可为社会科学提供价值，但需谨慎使用。

Abstract: This position paper argues that large language model (LLM)-based social
simulations should establish clear boundaries to meaningfully contribute to
social science research. While LLMs offer promising capabilities for modeling
human-like agents compared to traditional agent-based modeling, they face
fundamental limitations that constrain their reliability for social pattern
discovery. The core issue lies in LLMs' tendency towards an ``average persona''
that lacks sufficient behavioral heterogeneity, a critical requirement for
simulating complex social dynamics. We examine three key boundary problems:
alignment (simulated behaviors matching real-world patterns), consistency
(maintaining coherent agent behavior over time), and robustness
(reproducibility under varying conditions). We propose heuristic boundaries for
determining when LLM-based simulations can reliably advance social science
understanding. We believe that these simulations are more valuable when
focusing on (1) collective patterns rather than individual trajectories, (2)
agent behaviors aligning with real population averages despite limited
variance, and (3) proper validation methods available for testing simulation
robustness. We provide a practical checklist to guide researchers in
determining the appropriate scope and claims for LLM-based social simulations.

Conclusion: 结合语言特征和长文本建模可推动基于生活叙事的人格评估发展。

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) offers new avenues for personality
assessment by leveraging rich, open-ended text, moving beyond traditional
questionnaires. In this study, we address the challenge of modeling long
narrative interview where each exceeds 2000 tokens so as to predict Five-Factor
Model (FFM) personality traits. We propose a two-step approach: first, we
extract contextual embeddings using sliding-window fine-tuning of pretrained
language models; then, we apply Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with attention
mechanisms to integrate long-range dependencies and enhance interpretability.
This hybrid method effectively bridges the strengths of pretrained transformers
and sequence modeling to handle long-context data. Through ablation studies and
comparisons with state-of-the-art long-context models such as LLaMA and
Longformer, we demonstrate improvements in prediction accuracy, efficiency, and
interpretability. Our results highlight the potential of combining
language-based features with long-context modeling to advance personality
assessment from life narratives.

Abstract: The rising demand for mental health care has fueled interest in AI-driven
counseling systems. While large language models (LLMs) offer significant
potential, current approaches face challenges, including limited understanding
of clients' psychological states and counseling stages, reliance on
high-quality training data, and privacy concerns associated with commercial
deployment. To address these issues, we propose EmoStage, a framework that
enhances empathetic response generation by leveraging the inference
capabilities of open-source LLMs without additional training data. Our
framework introduces perspective-taking to infer clients' psychological states
and support needs, enabling the generation of emotionally resonant responses.
In addition, phase recognition is incorporated to ensure alignment with the
counseling process and to prevent contextually inappropriate or inopportune
responses. Experiments conducted in both Japanese and Chinese counseling
settings demonstrate that EmoStage improves the quality of responses generated
by base models and performs competitively with data-driven methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming education by enabling
rich conversational learning experiences. This article provides a comprehensive
review of how LLM-based conversational agents are being used in higher
education, with extensions to secondary and lifelong learning contexts. We
synthesize existing literature on LLMs in education and theories of
conversational and dialogic pedagogy - including Vygotsky's sociocultural
learning (scaffolding and the Zone of Proximal Development), the Socratic
method, and Laurillard's conversational framework - and examine how prompting
strategies and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can align LLM behaviors
with these pedagogical theories, and how it can support personalized, adaptive
learning. We map educational theories to LLM capabilities, highlighting where
LLM-driven dialogue supports established learning principles and where it
challenges or falls short of traditional pedagogical assumptions. Notable gaps
in applying prior theories to LLMs are identified, such as the models tendency
to provide direct answers instead of fostering co-construction of knowledge,
and the need to account for the constant availability and broad but non-human
expertise of LLM tutors. In response, we propose practical strategies to better
align LLM interactions with sound pedagogy - for example, designing prompts
that encourage Socratic questioning, scaffolded guidance, and student
reflection, as well as integrating retrieval mechanisms to ensure accuracy and
contextual relevance. Our aim is to bridge the gap between educational theory
and the emerging practice of AI-driven conversational learning, offering
insights and tools for making LLM-based dialogues more educationally productive
and theory-aligned.

Abstract: Automatically structuring posology instructions is essential for improving
medication safety and enabling clinical decision support. In French
prescriptions, these instructions are often ambiguous, irregular, or
colloquial, limiting the effectiveness of classic ML pipelines. We explore the
use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to convert free-text posologies into
structured formats, comparing prompt-based methods and fine-tuning against a
"pre-LLM" system based on Named Entity Recognition and Linking (NERL). Our
results show that while prompting improves performance, only fine-tuned LLMs
match the accuracy of the baseline. Through error analysis, we observe
complementary strengths: NERL offers structural precision, while LLMs better
handle semantic nuances. Based on this, we propose a hybrid pipeline that
routes low-confidence cases from NERL (<0.8) to the LLM, selecting outputs
based on confidence scores. This strategy achieves 91% structuration accuracy
while minimizing latency and compute. Our results show that this hybrid
approach improves structuration accuracy while limiting computational cost,
offering a scalable solution for real-world clinical use.

Abstract: In Machine Translation (MT) evaluation, metric performance is assessed based
on agreement with human judgments. In recent years, automatic metrics have
demonstrated increasingly high levels of agreement with humans. To gain a
clearer understanding of metric performance and establish an upper bound, we
incorporate human baselines in the MT meta-evaluation, that is, the assessment
of MT metrics' capabilities. Our results show that human annotators are not
consistently superior to automatic metrics, with state-of-the-art metrics often
ranking on par with or higher than human baselines. Despite these findings
suggesting human parity, we discuss several reasons for caution. Finally, we
explore the broader implications of our results for the research field, asking:
Can we still reliably measure improvements in MT evaluation? With this work, we
aim to shed light on the limits of our ability to measure progress in the
field, fostering discussion on an issue that we believe is crucial to the

Abstract: The rapid development of social media has intensified the spread of harmful
content. Harmful memes, which integrate both images and text, pose significant
challenges for automated detection due to their implicit semantics and complex
multimodal interactions. Although existing research has made progress in
detection accuracy and interpretability, the lack of a systematic, large-scale,
diverse, and highly explainable dataset continues to hinder further advancement
in this field. To address this gap, we introduce MemeMind, a novel dataset
featuring scientifically rigorous standards, large scale, diversity, bilingual
support (Chinese and English), and detailed Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations.
MemeMind fills critical gaps in current datasets by offering comprehensive
labeling and explicit reasoning traces, thereby providing a solid foundation
for enhancing harmful meme detection. In addition, we propose an innovative
detection framework, MemeGuard, which effectively integrates multimodal
information with reasoning process modeling, significantly improving models'
ability to understand and identify harmful memes. Extensive experiments
conducted on the MemeMind dataset demonstrate that MemeGuard consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in harmful meme detection tasks.

Result: 在Librispeech数据集上，WER降低了5.8%~12.8%；在两个领域外数据集上，基于文本的领域适应分别带来15.3%和17.8%的WER降低。

Conclusion: J-TAED成功整合了语音和语言信息，有效缓解了领域不匹配任务的数据稀缺问题。

Abstract: A joint speech and text optimization method is proposed for hybrid transducer
and attention-based encoder decoder (TAED) modeling to leverage large amounts

with both speech and text input modalities together, while it only takes speech
data as input during inference. The trained model can unify the internal
representations from different modalities, and be further extended to
text-based domain adaptation. It can effectively alleviate data scarcity for
mismatch domain tasks since no speech data is required. Our experiments show
J-TAED successfully integrates speech and linguistic information into one
model, and reduce the WER by 5.8 ~12.8% on the Librispeech dataset. The model
is also evaluated on two out-of-domain datasets: one is finance and another is

Abstract: Automatic detection of online hate speech serves as a crucial step in the
detoxification of the online discourse. Moreover, accurate classification can
promote a better understanding of the proliferation of hate as a social

we argue that focusing on the user level is as important, albeit challenging.
In this paper we consider a multimodal aggregative approach for the detection
of hate-mongers, taking into account the potentially hateful texts, user
activity, and the user network. Evaluating our method on three unique datasets
X (Twitter), Gab, and Parler we show that processing a user's texts in her
social context significantly improves the detection of hate mongers, compared
to previously used text and graph-based methods. We offer comprehensive set of
results obtained in different experimental settings as well as qualitative
analysis of illustrative cases. Our method can be used to improve the
classification of coded messages, dog-whistling, and racial gas-lighting, as
well as to inform intervention measures. Moreover, we demonstrate that our
multimodal approach performs well across very different content platforms and

Abstract: Long-form speech recognition is an application area of increasing research
focus. ASR models based on multi-head attention (MHA) are ill-suited to
long-form ASR because of their quadratic complexity in sequence length. We

attention (RA) layers for ASR. We find that bidirectional RA layers can match
the accuracy of MHA for both short- and long-form applications. We present a
strong limited-context attention (LCA) baseline, and show that RA layers are
just as accurate while being more efficient. We develop a long-form training
paradigm which further improves RA performance, leading to better accuracy than
LCA with 44% higher throughput. We also present Direction Dropout, a novel
regularization method that improves accuracy, provides fine-grained control of
the accuracy/throughput trade-off of bidirectional RA, and enables a new
alternating directions decoding mode with even higher throughput.

Motivation: 解决电子商务信息检索系统在复杂查询解析和大规模产品目录处理中的双重挑战。

Method: 采用嵌套嵌入方法（NEAR²），结合多种损失函数（如多负排名损失和在线对比损失）进行训练和验证。

Result: 在推理时嵌入大小效率提升12倍，训练成本不变，且准确性优于现有模型。

Conclusion: NEAR²在效率和性能上均优于现有方法，适用于多种Transformer模型。

Abstract: E-commerce information retrieval (IR) systems struggle to simultaneously
achieve high accuracy in interpreting complex user queries and maintain
efficient processing of vast product catalogs. The dual challenge lies in
precisely matching user intent with relevant products while managing the
computational demands of real-time search across massive inventories. In this
paper, we propose a Nested Embedding Approach to product Retrieval and Ranking,
called NEAR$^2$, which can achieve up to $12$ times efficiency in embedding
size at inference time while introducing no extra cost in training and
improving performance in accuracy for various encoder-based Transformer models.
We validate our approach using different loss functions for the retrieval and
ranking task, including multiple negative ranking loss and online contrastive
loss, on four different test sets with various IR challenges such as short and
implicit queries. Our approach achieves an improved performance over a smaller
embedding dimension, compared to any existing models.

skills can be considered an extension to this task, with similar relevance for
the same downstream tasks. In this report, we outline NLPnorth's submission to
TalentCLEF 2025, which includes both of these tasks: Multilingual Job Title
Matching, and Job Title-Based Skill Prediction. For both tasks we compare
(fine-tuned) classification-based, (fine-tuned) contrastive-based, and
prompting methods. We observe that for Task A, our prompting approach performs
best with an average of 0.492 mean average precision (MAP) on test data,
averaged over English, Spanish, and German. For Task B, we obtain an MAP of
0.290 on test data with our fine-tuned classification-based approach.
Additionally, we made use of extra data by pulling all the language-specific
titles and corresponding \emph{descriptions} from ESCO for each job and skill.
Overall, we find that the largest multilingual language models perform best for
both tasks. Per the provisional results and only counting the unique teams, the
ranking on Task A is 5$^{\text{th}}$/20 and for Task B 3$^{\text{rd}}$/14.

information extraction pipeline that uses a combination of ML and non-ML
methods to extract events-structured information concerning disease outbreaks
or other unusual health events-from online articles. The extracted events are
made available to the Media Scanning and Verification Cell (MSVC) at the
National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Delhi for analysis, interpretation
and further dissemination to local agencies for timely intervention. From April
2022 till date, Health Sentinel has processed over 300 million news articles
and identified over 95,000 unique health events across India of which over
3,500 events were shortlisted by the public health experts at NCDC as potential

Method: 利用HPO生成合成病例，模拟症状检查器访谈，并通过R平方系数验证方法的有效性。

Result: 对于包含频率信息的疾病，R平方值显示预测性能良好（召回@8为0.831，精确@8为0.78），而无频率信息的疾病预测误差较大。

Conclusion: 该方法为罕见疾病的算法更新提供了一种透明且低成本的预部署评估手段，有助于提升早期诊断支持。

Abstract: Background: Symptom Checkers (SCs) provide users with personalized medical
information. To prevent performance degradation from algorithm updates, SC
developers must evaluate diagnostic performance changes for individual diseases
before deployment. However, acquiring sufficient evaluation data for rare
diseases is difficult, and manually creating numerous clinical vignettes is
costly and impractical. Objective: This study proposes and validates a novel
Synthetic Vignette Simulation Approach to evaluate diagnostic performance
changes for individual rare diseases following SC algorithm updates. Methods:
We used disease-phenotype annotations from the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO),
a knowledge database for rare diseases, to generate synthetic vignettes. With
these, we simulated SC interviews to estimate the impact of algorithm updates
on real-world diagnostic performance. The method's effectiveness was evaluated
retrospectively by comparing estimated values with actual metric changes using
the R 2(R-squared) coefficient. Results: The experiment included eight past SC
algorithm updates. For updates on diseases with frequency information in HPO
(n=5), the R^2 for recall@8 change was 0.831 (p=0.031), and for precision@8
change, it was 0.78 (p=0.047), indicating the method can predict
post-deployment performance. In contrast, large prediction errors occurred for
diseases without frequency information (n=3), highlighting its importance. The
manual effort to map HPO phenotypes to SC symptoms was approximately 2 hours
per disease. Conclusions: Our method enables pre-deployment evaluation of SC
algorithm changes for individual rare diseases using a publicly available,
expert-created knowledge base. This transparent and low-cost approach allows
developers to efficiently improve diagnostic performance for rare diseases,
potentially enhancing support for early diagnosis.

Abstract: The spread of cyber hatred has led to communal violence, fueling aggression
and conflicts between various religious, ethnic, and social groups, posing a
significant threat to social harmony. Despite its critical importance, the
classification of communal violent text remains an underexplored area in
existing research. This study aims to enhance the accuracy of detecting text
that incites communal violence, focusing specifically on Bengali textual data
sourced from social media platforms. We introduce a fine-tuned BanglaBERT model
tailored for this task, achieving a macro F1 score of 0.60. To address the
issue of data imbalance, our dataset was expanded by adding 1,794 instances,
which facilitated the development and evaluation of a fine-tuned ensemble
model. This ensemble model demonstrated an improved performance, achieving a
macro F1 score of 0.63, thus highlighting its effectiveness in this domain. In
addition to quantitative performance metrics, qualitative analysis revealed
instances where the models struggled with context understanding, leading to
occasional misclassifications, even when predictions were made with high
confidence. Through analyzing the cosine similarity between words, we
identified certain limitations in the pre-trained BanglaBERT models,
particularly in their ability to distinguish between closely related communal
and non-communal terms. To further interpret the model's decisions, we applied
LIME, which helped to uncover specific areas where the model struggled in
understanding context, contributing to errors in classification. These findings
highlight the promise of NLP and interpretability tools in reducing online
communal violence. Our work contributes to the growing body of research in
communal violence detection and offers a foundation for future studies aiming
to refine these techniques for better accuracy and societal impact.

Conclusion: T2MD证明了Mamba模型在非因果视觉输出生成中的可行性，为未来探索提供了潜力。

Abstract: The quadratic computational complexity of self-attention in diffusion
transformers (DiT) introduces substantial computational costs in
high-resolution image generation. While the linear-complexity Mamba model
emerges as a potential alternative, direct Mamba training remains empirically
challenging. To address this issue, this paper introduces diffusion
transformer-to-mamba distillation (T2MD), forming an efficient training
pipeline that facilitates the transition from the self-attention-based
transformer to the linear complexity state-space model Mamba. We establish a
diffusion self-attention and Mamba hybrid model that simultaneously achieves
efficiency and global dependencies. With the proposed layer-level teacher
forcing and feature-based knowledge distillation, T2MD alleviates the training
difficulty and high cost of a state space model from scratch. Starting from the
distilled 512$\times$512 resolution base model, we push the generation towards
2048$\times$2048 images via lightweight adaptation and high-resolution
fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate that our training path leads to low
overhead but high-quality text-to-image generation. Importantly, our results
also justify the feasibility of using sequential and causal Mamba models for
generating non-causal visual output, suggesting the potential for future
exploration.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in multimodal
reasoning tasks through enhanced chain-of-thought capabilities. However, this
advancement also introduces novel safety risks, as these models become
increasingly vulnerable to harmful multimodal prompts that can trigger
unethical or unsafe behaviors. Existing safety alignment approaches, primarily
designed for unimodal language models, fall short in addressing the complex and
nuanced threats posed by multimodal inputs. Moreover, current safety datasets
lack the fine-grained, policy-grounded reasoning required to robustly align
reasoning-capable VLMs. In this work, we introduce {MSR-Align}, a high-quality
Multimodal Safety Reasoning dataset tailored to bridge this gap. MSR-Align
supports fine-grained, deliberative reasoning over standardized safety policies
across both vision and text modalities. Our data generation pipeline emphasizes
multimodal diversity, policy-grounded reasoning, and rigorous quality filtering
using strong multimodal judges. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
fine-tuning VLMs on MSR-Align substantially improves robustness against both
textual and vision-language jailbreak attacks, while preserving or enhancing
general reasoning performance. MSR-Align provides a scalable and effective

Result: 新基准揭示了LVLMs在关系推理中的脆弱性；DST方法在AUROC上平均提升4%-10%。

Conclusion: PRE-HAL和DST方法有效提升了LVLMs的可靠性检测，为安全关键应用提供支持。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable multimodal capabilities of Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs), discrepancies often occur between visual inputs and textual
outputs--a phenomenon we term visual hallucination. This critical reliability
gap poses substantial risks in safety-critical Artificial Intelligence (AI)
applications, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation benchmark and effective
detection methods. Firstly, we observe that existing visual-centric
hallucination benchmarks mainly assess LVLMs from a perception perspective,
overlooking hallucinations arising from advanced reasoning capabilities. We
develop the Perception-Reasoning Evaluation Hallucination (PRE-HAL) dataset,
which enables the systematic evaluation of both perception and reasoning
capabilities of LVLMs across multiple visual semantics, such as instances,
scenes, and relations. Comprehensive evaluation with this new benchmark exposed
more visual vulnerabilities, particularly in the more challenging task of
relation reasoning. To address this issue, we propose, to the best of our
knowledge, the first Dempster-Shafer theory (DST)-based visual hallucination
detection method for LVLMs through uncertainty estimation. This method aims to
efficiently capture the degree of conflict in high-level features at the model
inference phase. Specifically, our approach employs simple mass functions to
mitigate the computational complexity of evidence combination on power sets. We
conduct an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LVLMs, LLaVA-v1.5,
mPLUG-Owl2 and mPLUG-Owl3, with the new PRE-HAL benchmark. Experimental results
indicate that our method outperforms five baseline uncertainty metrics,
achieving average AUROC improvements of 4%, 10%, and 7% across three LVLMs. Our

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision language models (LVLMs) have unlocked
unprecedented capabilities in generating coherent responses from visual inputs.
However, interpreting where LVLMs direct their visual attention while
generating free-form textual responses remains a significant challenge, yet is
essential for understanding model behavior, diagnosing hallucination, exposing
bias and ensuring transparency. We introduce GLIMPSE (Gradient-Layer Importance
Mapping for Prompted Visual Saliency Explanation), a lightweight,
model-agnostic framework for visualizing the salient image regions that LVLMs
rely upon during open-ended visual question answering (VQA), while concurrently
revealing the multimodal textual saliency. GLIMPSE fuses gradient-weighted
attention, adaptive layer propagation, and weighted token aggregation to
produce holistic response-level attribution heat maps for interpreting
cross-modal reasoning, outperforming prior interpretability methods in
human-alignment. We demonstrate an analytic explainable AI (XAI) approach using
GLIMPSE to uncover fine-grained insights into LVLM cross-modal attribution,
trace token-level reasoning dynamics, and analyze systematic human-attention
misalignment, hallucination, and bias.

Abstract: With access to large-scale, unlabeled medical datasets, researchers are
confronted with two questions: Should they attempt to pretrain a custom
foundation model on this medical data, or use transfer-learning from an
existing generalist model? And, if a custom model is pretrained, are novel
methods required? In this paper we explore these questions by conducting a
case-study, in which we train a foundation model on a large regional fetal
ultrasound dataset of 2M images. By selecting the well-established DINOv2
method for pretraining, we achieve state-of-the-art results on three fetal
ultrasound datasets, covering data from different countries, classification,
segmentation, and few-shot tasks. We compare against a series of models
pretrained on natural images, ultrasound images, and supervised baselines. Our
results demonstrate two key insights: (i) Pretraining on custom data is worth
it, even if smaller models are trained on less data, as scaling in natural
image pretraining does not translate to ultrasound performance. (ii) Well-tuned
methods from computer vision are making it feasible to train custom foundation
models for a given medical domain, requiring no hyperparameter tuning and
little methodological adaptation. Given these findings, we argue that a bias
towards methodological innovation should be avoided when developing domain
specific foundation models under common computational resource constraints.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) unify computer vision and natural language
processing in a single architecture capable of interpreting and describing
images. Most state-of-the-art systems rely on two computationally intensive
components: convolutions in the vision encoder and quadratic self-attention for
multimodal fusion. This work removes both by introducing a spectral dictionary
token mixer, which represents each image patch or wordpiece as a sparse
combination of learnable frequency atoms. Our 1.1B-parameter prototype,
SDict-VLM, achieves BLEU-4 of 39.2, CIDEr of 127.5, and SPICE of 27.0 on
MS-COCO captioning, along with 50.3 percent accuracy on VQAv2. These results
close approximately 85 percent of the performance gap to BLIP-2 while using 60
percent fewer parameters, 2.3 times less peak GPU memory, and 2.2 times faster
inference than PaLI-3. To our knowledge, this is the first VLM to eliminate
both convolutions and self-attention while matching mid-scale transformer
baselines. In addition to its O(L log L) complexity, the shared frequency
dictionary enables transparent cross-modal alignment and offers a tunable
trade-off between accuracy and compute, paving the way for efficient and
interpretable VLMs.

Abstract: Improving the visual understanding ability of vision-language models (VLMs)
is crucial for enhancing their performance across various tasks. While using
multiple pretrained visual experts has shown great promise, it often incurs
significant computational costs during training and inference. To address this
challenge, we propose HAWAII, a novel framework that distills knowledge from
multiple visual experts into a single vision encoder, enabling it to inherit
the complementary strengths of several experts with minimal computational
overhead. To mitigate conflicts among different teachers and switch between
different teacher-specific knowledge, instead of using a fixed set of adapters
for multiple teachers, we propose to use teacher-specific Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) adapters with a corresponding router. Each adapter is aligned with a
specific teacher, avoiding noisy guidance during distillation. To enable
efficient knowledge distillation, we propose fine-grained and coarse-grained
distillation. At the fine-grained level, token importance scores are employed
to emphasize the most informative tokens from each teacher adaptively. At the
coarse-grained level, we summarize the knowledge from multiple teachers and
transfer it to the student using a set of general-knowledge LoRA adapters with
a router. Extensive experiments on various vision-language tasks demonstrate
the superiority of HAWAII, compared to the popular open-source VLMs.

VLMs on a teeth annotated subset of AffectNet dataset and find consistent
performance shifts depending on the presence of visible teeth. Through
structured introspection of, the best-performing model, i.e., GPT-4o, we show
that facial attributes like eyebrow position drive much of its affective

valence-arousal predictions. These patterns highlight the emergent nature of
FMs behaviour, but also reveal risks: shortcut learning, bias, and fairness
issues especially in sensitive domains like mental health and education.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) models have made significant

pre-filling and bi-level key-value decoding. Chunk-based pre-filling divides
the visual token sequence into chunks, applying full attention within each
chunk and sparse attention across chunks. This significantly reduces
computational and memory overhead. During decoding, bi-level key-value decoding
selectively reloads either dense or sparse key-values for each chunk based on
its relevance to the task. This approach further improves memory efficiency and
enhances the model's ability to capture fine-grained information. Video-XL-2
achieves state-of-the-art performance on various long video understanding
benchmarks, outperforming existing open-source lightweight models. It also
demonstrates exceptional efficiency, capable of processing over 10,000 frames
on a single NVIDIA A100 (80GB) GPU and thousands of frames in just a few
seconds.

TL;DR: PEVLM是一种并行编码策略，旨在提高视觉语言模型（VLM）的预填充效率，无需微调，显著降低注意力计算复杂度并保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准注意力机制的二次复杂度限制了视觉语言模型在长视频理解中的应用，PEVLM旨在解决这一问题。

Method: PEVLM将输入分块处理，保留全注意力位置嵌入，并调整注意力权重以模拟全注意力分布，从而降低计算复杂度。

Result: 在LongVideoBench基准测试中，PEVLM实现了8.37%的准确率提升，注意力计算速度提升7.47倍，端到端延迟降低40%。

Conclusion: PEVLM在低延迟、长上下文视频理解中表现出色，适用于自动驾驶等实际应用。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
video-language tasks, yet their application to long video understanding remains
constrained by the quadratic complexity of standard attention mechanisms. In
this paper, we propose \textbf{PEVLM}, a parallel encoding strategy
specifically designed to improve the prefill efficiency of VLMs without
requiring model finetuning. PEVLM partitions the input into block-wise segments
with a shared sink, preserves full-attention positional embeddings, and aligns
attention weights to mimic full-attention distributions. This design reduces
attention computation from $O((T \times N)^2)$ to $O(T \times N)$ while
maintaining high accuracy. Extensive experiments on the LongVideoBench
benchmark show that PEVLM achieves up to 8.37\% accuracy improvement over
existing inference-efficient methods and delivers up to 7.47x speedup in
attention computation and 40\% reduction in end-to-end latency. Under strict
latency constraints, PEVLM significantly outperforms baselines, raising
accuracy from 23.26\% to 61.03\%. These results highlight PEVLM's effectiveness
for low-latency, long-context video understanding, making it well-suited for
real-world applications such as autonomous driving.

Result: Damba-ST在预测任务中达到SOTA性能，并展示强零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: Damba-ST高效且泛化能力强，适用于新城市环境的无缝部署。

Abstract: Training urban spatio-temporal foundation models that generalize well across
diverse regions and cities is critical for deploying urban services in unseen
or data-scarce regions. Recent studies have typically focused on fusing
cross-domain spatio-temporal data to train unified Transformer-based models.
However, these models suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high
memory overhead, limiting their scalability and practical deployment. Inspired
by the efficiency of Mamba, a state space model with linear time complexity, we
explore its potential for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. However,
directly applying Mamba as a spatio-temporal backbone leads to negative
transfer and severe performance degradation. This is primarily due to
spatio-temporal heterogeneity and the recursive mechanism of Mamba's hidden
state updates, which limit cross-domain generalization. To overcome these
challenges, we propose Damba-ST, a novel domain-adaptive Mamba-based model for
efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. Damba-ST retains Mamba's linear
complexity advantage while significantly enhancing its adaptability to
heterogeneous domains. Specifically, we introduce two core innovations: (1) a
domain-adaptive state space model that partitions the latent representation
space into a shared subspace for learning cross-domain commonalities and
independent, domain-specific subspaces for capturing intra-domain
discriminative features; (2) three distinct Domain Adapters, which serve as
domain-aware proxies to bridge disparate domain distributions and facilitate
the alignment of cross-domain commonalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the generalization and efficiency of Damba-ST. It achieves state-of-the-art
performance on prediction tasks and demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization, enabling seamless deployment in new urban environments without
extensive retraining or fine-tuning.

Conclusion: MedErr-CT有助于开发更可靠、临床适用的医学MLLMs，减少诊断错误。

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) plays a crucial role in clinical diagnosis, but the
growing demand for CT examinations has raised concerns about diagnostic errors.
While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate promising
comprehension of medical knowledge, their tendency to produce inaccurate
information highlights the need for rigorous validation. However, existing
medical visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks primarily focus on simple
visual recognition tasks, lacking clinical relevance and failing to assess
expert-level knowledge. We introduce MedErr-CT, a novel benchmark for
evaluating medical MLLMs' ability to identify and correct errors in CT reports
through a VQA framework. The benchmark includes six error categories - four
vision-centric errors (Omission, Insertion, Direction, Size) and two lexical
error types (Unit, Typo) - and is organized into three task levels:
classification, detection, and correction. Using this benchmark, we
quantitatively assess the performance of state-of-the-art 3D medical MLLMs,
revealing substantial variation in their capabilities across different error
types. Our benchmark contributes to the development of more reliable and
clinically applicable MLLMs, ultimately helping reduce diagnostic errors and
improve accuracy in clinical practice. The code and datasets are available at

Abstract: Existing Mamba-based approaches in remote sensing change detection have
enhanced scanning models, yet remain limited by their inability to capture
long-range dependencies between image channels effectively, which restricts
their feature representation capabilities. To address this limitation, we
propose a 3D selective scan module (3D-SSM) that captures global information
from both the spatial plane and channel perspectives, enabling a more
comprehensive understanding of the data.Based on the 3D-SSM, we present two key
components: a spatiotemporal interaction module (SIM) and a multi-branch
feature extraction module (MBFEM). The SIM facilitates bi-temporal feature
integration by enabling interactions between global and local features across
images from different time points, thereby enhancing the detection of subtle
changes. Meanwhile, the MBFEM combines features from the frequency domain,
spatial domain, and 3D-SSM to provide a rich representation of contextual
information within the image. Our proposed method demonstrates favourable
performance compared to state-of-the-art change detection methods on five
benchmark datasets through extensive experiments. Code is available at

Conclusion: Mem4Nav通过分层地图和双记忆模块的有效结合，显著提升了VLN性能。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) in large-scale urban environments
requires embodied agents to ground linguistic instructions in complex scenes
and recall relevant experiences over extended time horizons. Prior modular
pipelines offer interpretability but lack unified memory, while end-to-end
(M)LLM agents excel at fusing vision and language yet remain constrained by
fixed context windows and implicit spatial reasoning. We introduce
\textbf{Mem4Nav}, a hierarchical spatial-cognition long-short memory system
that can augment any VLN backbone. Mem4Nav fuses a sparse octree for
fine-grained voxel indexing with a semantic topology graph for high-level
landmark connectivity, storing both in trainable memory tokens embedded via a
reversible Transformer. Long-term memory (LTM) compresses and retains
historical observations at both octree and graph nodes, while short-term memory
(STM) caches recent multimodal entries in relative coordinates for real-time
obstacle avoidance and local planning. At each step, STM retrieval sharply
prunes dynamic context, and, when deeper history is needed, LTM tokens are
decoded losslessly to reconstruct past embeddings. Evaluated on Touchdown and
Map2Seq across three backbones (modular, state-of-the-art VLN with prompt-based
LLM, and state-of-the-art VLN with strided-attention MLLM), Mem4Nav yields 7-13
pp gains in Task Completion, sufficient SPD reduction, and >10 pp nDTW

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning for vision tasks have seen the rise of State
Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba, celebrated for their linear scalability.
However, their adaptation to 2D visual data often necessitates complex
modifications that may diminish efficiency. In this paper, we introduce
MambaOutRS, a novel hybrid convolutional architecture for remote sensing image
classification that re-evaluates the necessity of recurrent SSMs. MambaOutRS
builds upon stacked Gated CNN blocks for local feature extraction and
introduces a novel Fourier Filter Gate (FFG) module that operates in the
frequency domain to capture global contextual information efficiently. Our
architecture employs a four-stage hierarchical design and was extensively
evaluated on challenging remote sensing datasets: UC Merced, AID,
NWPU-RESISC45, and EuroSAT. MambaOutRS consistently achieved state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance across these benchmarks. Notably, our MambaOutRS-t variant
(24.0M parameters) attained the highest F1-scores of 98.41\% on UC Merced and
95.99\% on AID, significantly outperforming existing baselines, including
larger transformer models and Mamba-based architectures, despite using
considerably fewer parameters. An ablation study conclusively demonstrates the
critical role of the Fourier Filter Gate in enhancing the model's ability to
capture global spatial patterns, leading to robust and accurate classification.
These results strongly suggest that the complexities of recurrent SSMs can be
effectively superseded by a judicious combination of gated convolutions for
spatial mixing and frequency-based gates for spectral global context. Thus,
MambaOutRS provides a compelling and efficient paradigm for developing
high-performance deep learning models in remote sensing and other vision
domains, particularly where computational efficiency is paramount.

Abstract: Understanding medical ultrasound imaging remains a long-standing challenge
due to significant visual variability caused by differences in imaging and
acquisition parameters. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs)
have been used to automatically generate terminology-rich summaries orientated
to clinicians with sufficient physiological knowledge. Nevertheless, the
increasing demand for improved ultrasound interpretability and basic scanning
guidance among non-expert users, e.g., in point-of-care settings, has not yet
been explored. In this study, we first introduce the scene graph (SG) for
ultrasound images to explain image content to ordinary and provide guidance for
ultrasound scanning. The ultrasound SG is first computed using a
transformer-based one-stage method, eliminating the need for explicit object
detection. To generate a graspable image explanation for ordinary, the user
query is then used to further refine the abstract SG representation through
LLMs. Additionally, the predicted SG is explored for its potential in guiding
ultrasound scanning toward missing anatomies within the current imaging view,
assisting ordinary users in achieving more standardized and complete anatomical
exploration. The effectiveness of this SG-based image explanation and scanning
guidance has been validated on images from the left and right neck regions,
including the carotid and thyroid, across five volunteers. The results
demonstrate the potential of the method to maximally democratize ultrasound by
enhancing its interpretability and usability for ordinaries.

Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained video diffusion models have exhibited remarkable
capabilities in diverse video generation. However, existing solutions face
several challenges in using these models to generate long movie-like videos
with rich human-object interactions that include unrealistic human-scene
interaction, lack of subject identity preservation, and require expensive
training. We propose GenHSI, a training-free method for controllable generation
of long human-scene interaction videos (HSI). Taking inspiration from movie
animation, our key insight is to overcome the limitations of previous work by
subdividing the long video generation task into three stages: (1) script
writing, (2) pre-visualization, and (3) animation. Given an image of a scene, a
user description, and multiple images of a person, we use these three stages to
generate long-videos that preserve human-identity and provide rich human-scene
interactions. Script writing converts complex human tasks into simple atomic
tasks that are used in the pre-visualization stage to generate 3D keyframes
(storyboards). These 3D keyframes are rendered and animated by off-the-shelf
video diffusion models for consistent long video generation with rich contacts
in a 3D-aware manner. A key advantage of our work is that we alleviate the need
for scanned, accurate scenes and create 3D keyframes from single-view images.
We are the first to generate a long video sequence with a consistent camera
pose that contains arbitrary numbers of character actions without training.
Experiments demonstrate that our method can generate long videos that
effectively preserve scene content and character identity with plausible
human-scene interaction from a single image scene. Visit our project homepage

vision, language, and action signals as discrete token sequences. This
formulation enables flexible multimodal tasks learning, particularly from
large-scale video data. By incorporating world modeling during post-training,
UniVLA captures causal dynamics from videos, facilitating effective transfer to
downstream policy learning--especially for long-horizon tasks. Our approach

Conclusion: Radial Attention显著提升了视频扩散模型的效率和扩展性。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled high-quality video
generation, but the additional temporal dimension significantly increases
computational costs, making training and inference on long videos prohibitively
expensive. In this paper, we identify a phenomenon we term Spatiotemporal
Energy Decay in video diffusion models: post-softmax attention scores diminish
as spatial and temporal distance between tokens increase, akin to the physical
decay of signal or waves over space and time in nature. Motivated by this, we
propose Radial Attention, a scalable sparse attention mechanism with $O(n \log
n)$ complexity that translates energy decay into exponentially decaying compute
density, which is significantly more efficient than standard $O(n^2)$ dense
attention and more expressive than linear attention. Specifically, Radial
Attention employs a simple, static attention mask where each token attends to
spatially nearby tokens, with the attention window size shrinking with temporal
distance. Moreover, it allows pre-trained video diffusion models to extend
their generation length with efficient LoRA-based fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments show that Radial Attention maintains video quality across
Wan2.1-14B, HunyuanVideo, and Mochi 1, achieving up to a 1.9$\times$ speedup
over the original dense attention. With minimal tuning, it enables video
generation up to 4$\times$ longer while reducing training costs by up to
4.4$\times$ compared to direct fine-tuning and accelerating inference by up to
3.7$\times$ compared to dense attention inference.

Abstract: Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models built on pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization across
manipulation tasks. However, they remain constrained by a single-frame
observation paradigm and cannot fully benefit from the motion information
offered by aggregated multi-frame historical observations, as the large
vision-language backbone introduces substantial computational cost and
inference latency. We propose CronusVLA, a unified framework that extends
single-frame VLA models to the multi-frame paradigm through an efficient
post-training stage. CronusVLA comprises three key components: (1) single-frame
pretraining on large-scale embodied datasets with autoregressive action tokens
prediction, which establishes an embodied vision-language foundation; (2)
multi-frame encoding, adapting the prediction of vision-language backbones from
discrete action tokens to motion features during post-training, and aggregating
motion features from historical frames into a feature chunking; (3) cross-frame
decoding, which maps the feature chunking to accurate actions via a shared
decoder with cross-attention. By reducing redundant token computation and
caching past motion features, CronusVLA achieves efficient inference. As an
application of motion features, we further propose an action adaptation
mechanism based on feature-action retrieval to improve model performance during
finetuning. CronusVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance on SimplerEnv with
70.9% success rate, and 12.7% improvement over OpenVLA on LIBERO. Real-world
Franka experiments also show the strong performance and robustness.

Abstract: Although new vision foundation models such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2)
have significantly enhanced zero-shot image segmentation capabilities, reliance
on human-provided prompts poses significant challenges in adapting SAM2 to
medical image segmentation tasks. Moreover, SAM2's performance in medical image
segmentation was limited by the domain shift issue, since it was originally
trained on natural images and videos. To address these challenges, we proposed
SAM2 with support-set guided prompting (SAM2-SGP), a framework that eliminated
the need for manual prompts. The proposed model leveraged the memory mechanism
of SAM2 to generate pseudo-masks using image-mask pairs from a support set via
a Pseudo-mask Generation (PMG) module. We further introduced a novel
Pseudo-mask Attention (PMA) module, which used these pseudo-masks to
automatically generate bounding boxes and enhance localized feature extraction
by guiding attention to relevant areas. Furthermore, a low-rank adaptation
(LoRA) strategy was adopted to mitigate the domain shift issue. The proposed
framework was evaluated on both 2D and 3D datasets across multiple medical
imaging modalities, including fundus photography, X-ray, computed tomography
(CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and
ultrasound. The results demonstrated a significant performance improvement over

Abstract: Referring remote sensing image segmentation (RRSIS) enables the precise
delineation of regions within remote sensing imagery through natural language
descriptions, serving critical applications in disaster response, urban
development, and environmental monitoring. Despite recent advances, current
approaches face significant challenges in processing aerial imagery due to
complex object characteristics including scale variations, diverse

the semantic understanding capabilities of pre-trained text-to-image diffusion
models for enhanced cross-modal alignment in RRSIS tasks. Our framework
introduces two key innovations: a context perception adapter (CP-adapter) that
dynamically refines linguistic features through global context modeling and
object-aware reasoning, and a progressive cross-modal reasoning decoder (PCMRD)
that iteratively aligns textual descriptions with visual regions for precise
segmentation. The CP-adapter bridges the domain gap between general
vision-language understanding and remote sensing applications, while PCMRD
enables fine-grained semantic alignment through multi-scale feature
interaction. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets-RRSIS-D,
RefSegRS, and RISBench-demonstrate that DiffRIS consistently outperforms
existing methods across all standard metrics, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for RRSIS tasks. The significant performance improvements
validate the effectiveness of leveraging pre-trained diffusion models for
remote sensing applications through our proposed adaptive framework.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为OoPk的新方法，通过正交投影子空间和在线先验知识聚合策略，解决了持续测试时间适应（CTTA）中的灾难性遗忘和错误累积问题，并在语义分割任务中表现优异。

Motivation: 现有CTTA方法在平衡性能和高效适应方面存在不足，尤其是在复杂任务如语义分割中。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Result: 在多个CTTA基准测试中表现优于现有方法，尤其在语义分割任务中。

Conclusion: OoPk方法有效缓解了灾难性遗忘和错误累积，提升了模型适应能力。

Abstract: Continual Test Time Adaptation (CTTA) is a task that requires a source
pre-trained model to continually adapt to new scenarios with changing target
distributions. Existing CTTA methods primarily focus on mitigating the
challenges of catastrophic forgetting and error accumulation. Though there have
been emerging methods based on forgetting adaptation with parameter-efficient
fine-tuning, they still struggle to balance competitive performance and
efficient model adaptation, particularly in complex tasks like semantic
segmentation. In this paper, to tackle the above issues, we propose a novel
pipeline, Orthogonal Projection Subspace to aggregate online Prior-knowledge,
dubbed OoPk. Specifically, we first project a tuning subspace orthogonally
which allows the model to adapt to new domains while preserving the knowledge
integrity of the pre-trained source model to alleviate catastrophic forgetting.
Then, we elaborate an online prior-knowledge aggregation strategy that employs
an aggressive yet efficient image masking strategy to mimic potential target
dynamism, enhancing the student model's domain adaptability. This further
gradually ameliorates the teacher model's knowledge, ensuring high-quality
pseudo labels and reducing error accumulation. We demonstrate our method with
extensive experiments that surpass previous CTTA methods and achieve
competitive performances across various continual TTA benchmarks in semantic
segmentation tasks.

Result: 在多种图像编辑任务和数据集上达到或超越全步扩散模型的性能，且效率显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法在高效性和编辑质量上取得了显著突破，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in image editing with diffusion models have achieved
impressive results, offering fine-grained control over the generation process.
However, these methods are computationally intensive because of their iterative
nature. While distilled diffusion models enable faster inference, their editing
capabilities remain limited, primarily because of poor inversion quality.
High-fidelity inversion and reconstruction are essential for precise image
editing, as they preserve the structural and semantic integrity of the source
image. In this work, we propose a novel framework that enhances image inversion
using consistency models, enabling high-quality editing in just four steps. Our
method introduces a cycle-consistency optimization strategy that significantly
improves reconstruction accuracy and enables a controllable trade-off between
editability and content preservation. We achieve state-of-the-art performance
across various image editing tasks and datasets, demonstrating that our method
matches or surpasses full-step diffusion models while being substantially more
efficient. The code of our method is available on GitHub at

Conclusion: PRISM是一种可扩展的工具，适用于分析和审核在线平台上的有害或政治敏感媒体。

Abstract: Online videos play a central role in shaping political discourse and
amplifying cyber social threats such as misinformation, propaganda, and
radicalization. Detecting the most impactful or "standout" moments in video
content is crucial for content moderation, summarization, and forensic
analysis. In this paper, we introduce PRISM (Perceptual Recognition for
Identifying Standout Moments), a lightweight and perceptually-aligned framework
for keyframe extraction. PRISM operates in the CIELAB color space and uses
perceptual color difference metrics to identify frames that align with human
visual sensitivity. Unlike deep learning-based approaches, PRISM is
interpretable, training-free, and computationally efficient, making it well
suited for real-time and resource-constrained environments. We evaluate PRISM
on four benchmark datasets: BBC, TVSum, SumMe, and ClipShots, and demonstrate
that it achieves strong accuracy and fidelity while maintaining high
compression ratios. These results highlight PRISM's effectiveness in both
structured and unstructured video content, and its potential as a scalable tool
for analyzing and moderating harmful or politically sensitive media in online
platforms.

Abstract: While the efficacy of deep learning models heavily relies on data, gathering
and annotating data for specific tasks, particularly when addressing novel or
sensitive subjects lacking relevant datasets, poses significant time and
resource challenges. In response to this, we propose a novel Automated Image

empowers end-users to synthesize high-quality, pre-annotated datasets,
eliminating the necessity for manual labeling. It also automatically trains
deep learning models on the generated datasets with robust image recognition
performance. Our framework includes two main data synthesis processes, AIR-Gen
and AIR-Aug. The AIR-Gen enables end-users to seamlessly generate datasets
tailored to their specifications. To improve image quality, we introduce a
novel automated prompt engineering module that leverages the capabilities of
large language models. We also introduce a distribution adjustment algorithm to
eliminate duplicates and outliers, enhancing the robustness and reliability of
generated datasets. On the other hand, the AIR-Aug enhances a given dataset,
thereby improving the performance of deep classifier models. AIR-Aug is
particularly beneficial when users have limited data for specific tasks.
Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrated the efficacy of our
generated data in training deep learning models and showcased the system's
potential to provide image recognition models for a wide range of objects. We
also conducted a user study that achieved an impressive score of 4.4 out of

Conclusion: PMC框架在多模态跨领域视觉识别任务中表现出色，尤其在目标域模态缺失的情况下。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a new generic multi-modality domain adaptation
framework called Progressive Modality Cooperation (PMC) to transfer the
knowledge learned from the source domain to the target domain by exploiting
multiple modality clues (\eg, RGB and depth) under the multi-modality domain
adaptation (MMDA) and the more general multi-modality domain adaptation using
privileged information (MMDA-PI) settings. Under the MMDA setting, the samples
in both domains have all the modalities. In two newly proposed modules of our
PMC, the multiple modalities are cooperated for selecting the reliable
pseudo-labeled target samples, which captures the modality-specific information
and modality-integrated information, respectively. Under the MMDA-PI setting,
some modalities are missing in the target domain. Hence, to better exploit the
multi-modality data in the source domain, we further propose the PMC with
privileged information (PMC-PI) method by proposing a new multi-modality data
generation (MMG) network. MMG generates the missing modalities in the target
domain based on the source domain data by considering both domain distribution
mismatch and semantics preservation, which are respectively achieved by using
adversarial learning and conditioning on weighted pseudo semantics. Extensive
experiments on three image datasets and eight video datasets for various
multi-modality cross-domain visual recognition tasks under both MMDA and
MMDA-PI settings clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PMC
framework.

Conclusion: RetCoP成功整合多模态眼底数据，减少遗忘，表现优异。

Abstract: Traditional fundus image analysis models focus on single-modal tasks,
ignoring fundus modality complementarity, which limits their versatility.
Recently, retinal foundation models have emerged, but most still remain
modality-specific. Integrating multiple fundus imaging modalities into a single
foundation model is valuable. However, in dynamic environments, data from
different modalities often arrive incrementally, necessitating continual
pre-training. To address this, we propose RetCoP, the first continual
vision-language pre-training framework in the fundus domain, which
incrementally integrates image and text features from different imaging
modalities into a single unified foundation model. To mitigate catastrophic
forgetting in continual pre-training, we introduce a rehearsal strategy
utilizing representative image-text pairs and an off-diagonal information
distillation approach. The former allows the model to revisit knowledge from
previous stages, while the latter explicitly preserves the alignment between
image and text representations. Experiments show that RetCoP outperforms all
the compared methods, achieving the best generalization and lowest forgetting
rate. The code can be found at https://github.com/Yuang-Yao/RetCoP.

to guide the inference of fast student models through endpoint prediction and
interpolation. To maintain efficiency, we dynamically allocate computation

Conclusion: 需设计针对性训练策略以加速VLMs的文本理解能力，为多模态学习优化提供基础。

Abstract: We investigate how the ability to recognize textual content within images
emerges during the training of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Our analysis
reveals a critical phenomenon: the ability to read textual information in a
given image \textbf{(text readability)} emerges abruptly after substantial
training iterations, in contrast to semantic content understanding which
develops gradually from the early stages of training. This delayed emergence
may reflect how contrastive learning tends to initially prioritize general
semantic understanding, with text-specific symbolic processing developing
later. Interestingly, the ability to match images with rendered text develops
even slower, indicating a deeper need for semantic integration. These findings
highlight the need for tailored training strategies to accelerate robust text
comprehension in VLMs, laying the groundwork for future research on optimizing
multimodal learning.

Abstract: Multimodal medical analysis combining image and tabular data has gained
increasing attention. However, effective fusion remains challenging due to
cross-modal discrepancies in feature dimensions and modality contributions, as
well as the noise from high-dimensional tabular inputs. To address these
problems, we present AMF-MedIT, an efficient Align-Modulation-Fusion framework
for medical image and tabular data integration, particularly under data-scarce
conditions. To harmonize dimension discrepancies and dynamically adjust
modality contributions, we propose the Adaptive Modulation and Fusion (AMF)
module, a novel modulation-based fusion paradigm with a streamlined
architecture. We first derive the modulation objectives and introduce a
modality confidence ratio, enabling the incorporation of prior knowledge into
the fusion process. Then, the feature masks, density and leakage losses are
proposed to achieve the modulation objectives. Additionally, we introduce
FT-Mamba, a powerful tabular encoder leveraging a selective mechanism to handle
noisy medical tabular data efficiently. Furthermore, interpretability studies
are conducted to explore how different tabular encoders supervise the imaging
modality during contrastive pretraining for the first time. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AMF-MedIT achieves a superior balance between
multimodal performance and data efficiency while showing strong adaptability to
incomplete tabular data. Interpretability analysis also highlights FT-Mamba's
capabilities in extracting distinct tabular features and guiding the image
encoder toward more accurate and flexible attention patterns.

Abstract: Image attribution analysis seeks to highlight the feature representations
learned by visual models such that the highlighted feature maps can reflect the
pixel-wise importance of inputs. Gradient integration is a building block in
the attribution analysis by integrating the gradients from multiple derived
samples to highlight the semantic features relevant to inferences. Such a
building block often combines with other information from visual models such as
activation or attention maps to form ultimate explanations. Yet, our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that the extent to the alignment of the
sample distribution in gradient integration with respect to natural image
distribution gives a lower bound of explanation certainty. Prior works add
noise into images as samples and the noise distributions can lead to low
explanation certainty. Counter-intuitively, our experiment shows that extra
information can saturate neural networks. To this end, building trustworthy
attribution analysis needs to settle the sample distribution misalignment
problem. Instead of adding extra information into input images, we present a
semi-optimal sampling approach by suppressing features from inputs. The sample
distribution by suppressing features is approximately identical to the
distribution of natural images. Our extensive quantitative evaluation on large
scale dataset ImageNet affirms that our approach is effective and able to yield
more satisfactory explanations against state-of-the-art baselines throughout
all experimental models.

Abstract: The success of deep learning in medical imaging applications has led several
companies to deploy proprietary models in diagnostic workflows, offering
monetized services. Even though model weights are hidden to protect the
intellectual property of the service provider, these models are exposed to
model stealing (MS) attacks, where adversaries can clone the model's
functionality by querying it with a proxy dataset and training a thief model on
the acquired predictions. While extensively studied on general vision tasks,
the susceptibility of medical imaging models to MS attacks remains inadequately
explored. This paper investigates the vulnerability of black-box medical
imaging models to MS attacks under realistic conditions where the adversary
lacks access to the victim model's training data and operates with limited
query budgets. We demonstrate that adversaries can effectively execute MS
attacks by using publicly available datasets. To further enhance MS
capabilities with limited query budgets, we propose a two-step model stealing
approach termed QueryWise. This method capitalizes on unlabeled data obtained
from a proxy distribution to train the thief model without incurring additional
queries. Evaluation on two medical imaging models for Gallbladder Cancer and
COVID-19 classification substantiates the effectiveness of the proposed attack.

Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made in the field of surgical
scene understanding, particularly in the task of Visual Question
Localized-Answering in robotic surgery (Surgical-VQLA). However, existing
Surgical-VQLA models lack deep reasoning capabilities and interpretability in

Surgery-R1-54k dataset, including paired data for Visual-QA, Grounding-QA, and
Chain-of-Thought (CoT). Then, we propose the first Reasoning MLLM for

fine-tuning mechanism to enable the basic MLLM with complex reasoning abilities
by utilizing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT).
Furthermore, for an efficient and high-quality rule-based reward system in our
RFT, we design a Multimodal Coherence reward mechanism to mitigate positional
illusions that may arise in surgical scenarios. Experiment results demonstrate
that Surgery-R1 outperforms other existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in

Abstract: Generating reports for computed tomography (CT) images is a challenging task,
while similar to existing studies for medical image report generation, yet has
its unique characteristics, such as spatial encoding of multiple images,
alignment between image volume and texts, etc. Existing solutions typically use
general 2D or 3D image processing techniques to extract features from a CT
volume, where they firstly compress the volume and then divide the compressed
CT slices into patches for visual encoding. These approaches do not explicitly
account for the transformations among CT slices, nor do they effectively
integrate multi-level image features, particularly those containing specific
organ lesions, to instruct CT report generation (CTRG). In considering the
strong correlation among consecutive slices in CT scans, in this paper, we
propose a large language model (LLM) based CTRG method with recurrent visual
feature extraction and stereo attentions for hierarchical feature modeling.
Specifically, we use a vision Transformer to recurrently process each slice in
a CT volume, and employ a set of attentions over the encoded slices from
different perspectives to selectively obtain important visual information and
align them with textual features, so as to better instruct an LLM for CTRG.
Experiment results and further analysis on the benchmark M3D-Cap dataset show
that our method outperforms strong baseline models and achieves
state-of-the-art results, demonstrating its validity and effectiveness.

Abstract: Simulation is crucial for developing and evaluating autonomous vehicle (AV)
systems. Recent literature builds on a new generation of generative models to
synthesize highly realistic images for full-stack simulation. However, purely
synthetically generated scenes are not grounded in reality and have difficulty
in inspiring confidence in the relevance of its outcomes. Editing models, on
the other hand, leverage source scenes from real driving logs, and enable the
simulation of different traffic layouts, behaviors, and operating conditions
such as weather and time of day. While image editing is an established topic in
computer vision, it presents fresh sets of challenges in driving simulation:
(1) the need for cross-camera 3D consistency, (2) learning ``empty street"
priors from driving data with foreground occlusions, and (3) obtaining paired
image tuples of varied editing conditions while preserving consistent layout
and geometry. To address these challenges, we propose SceneCrafter, a versatile
editor for realistic 3D-consistent manipulation of driving scenes captured from
multiple cameras. We build on recent advancements in multi-view diffusion
models, using a fully controllable framework that scales seamlessly to
multi-modality conditions like weather, time of day, agent boxes and
high-definition maps. To generate paired data for supervising the editing
model, we propose a novel framework on top of Prompt-to-Prompt to generate
geometrically consistent synthetic paired data with global edits. We also
introduce an alpha-blending framework to synthesize data with local edits,
leveraging a model trained on empty street priors through novel masked training
and multi-view repaint paradigm. SceneCrafter demonstrates powerful editing
capabilities and achieves state-of-the-art realism, controllability, 3D
consistency, and scene editing quality compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效检测和识别后门攻击中的自然触发器，提升面部识别系统的安全性。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks embed a hidden functionality into deep neural networks,
causing the network to display anomalous behavior when activated by a
predetermined pattern in the input Trigger, while behaving well otherwise on
public test data. Recent works have shown that backdoored face recognition (FR)
systems can respond to natural-looking triggers like a particular pair of
sunglasses. Such attacks pose a serious threat to the applicability of FR
systems in high-security applications. We propose a novel technique to (1)
detect whether an FR network is compromised with a natural, physically
realizable trigger, and (2) identify such triggers given a compromised network.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods with a compromised FR network,
where we are able to identify the trigger (e.g., green sunglasses or red hat)
with a top-5 accuracy of 74%, whereas a naive brute force baseline achieves 56%
accuracy.

Conclusion: SMARTIES为多传感器遥感数据处理提供了灵活且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: From optical sensors to microwave radars, leveraging the complementary
strengths of remote sensing (RS) sensors is crucial for achieving dense
spatio-temporal monitoring of our planet. In contrast, recent deep learning
models, whether task-specific or foundational, are often specific to single
sensors or to fixed combinations: adapting such models to different sensory
inputs requires both architectural changes and re-training, limiting
scalability and generalization across multiple RS sensors. On the contrary, a
single model able to modulate its feature representations to accept diverse
sensors as input would pave the way to agile and flexible multi-sensor RS data
processing. To address this, we introduce SMARTIES, a generic and versatile
foundation model lifting sensor-specific/dependent efforts and enabling
scalability and generalization to diverse RS sensors: SMARTIES projects data
from heterogeneous sensors into a shared spectrum-aware space, enabling the use
of arbitrary combinations of bands both for training and inference. To obtain
sensor-agnostic representations, we train a single, unified transformer model
reconstructing masked multi-sensor data with cross-sensor token mixup. On both
single- and multi-modal tasks across diverse sensors, SMARTIES outperforms
previous models that rely on sensor-specific pretraining. Our code and
pretrained models are available at https://gsumbul.github.io/SMARTIES.

Conclusion: ScaleCap通过逐步增加推理成本生成更全面的图像描述，显著提升了描述质量和多模态对齐效果。

Abstract: This paper presents ScaleCap, an inference-time scalable image captioning
strategy that generates comprehensive and detailed image captions. The key
challenges of high-quality image captioning lie in the inherent biases of
LVLMs: multimodal bias resulting in imbalanced descriptive granularity,
offering detailed accounts of some elements while merely skimming over others;
linguistic bias leading to hallucinated descriptions of non-existent objects.
To address these issues, we propose a scalable debiased captioning strategy,
which continuously enriches and calibrates the caption with increased inference
budget. Specifically, we propose two novel components: heuristic question
answering and contrastive sentence rating. The former generates
content-specific questions based on the image and answers them to progressively
inject relevant information into the caption. The latter employs sentence-level
offline contrastive decoding to effectively identify and eliminate
hallucinations caused by linguistic biases. With increased inference cost, more
heuristic questions are raised by ScaleCap to progressively capture additional
visual details, generating captions that are more accurate, balanced, and
informative. Extensive modality alignment experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of ScaleCap. Annotating 450K images with ScaleCap and using them
for LVLM pretraining leads to consistent performance gains across 11 widely
used benchmarks. Furthermore, ScaleCap showcases superb richness and fidelity
of generated captions with two additional tasks: replacing images with captions
in VQA task, and reconstructing images from captions to assess semantic
coverage. Code is available at https://github.com/Cooperx521/ScaleCap.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose ProtoSolo, a novel deep neural architecture for
interpretable image classification inspired by prototypical networks such as
ProtoPNet. Existing prototype networks usually rely on the collaborative
decision-making of multiple prototypes to achieve the classification and
interpretation of a single category. In contrast, ProtoSolo only requires the
activation of a single prototype to complete the classification. This allows
the network to explain each category decision by only providing the features
that are most similar to the prototype of that category, significantly reducing
the cognitive complexity of the explanation. Secondly, we propose a
feature-based comparison method, which uses feature map instead of full-channel
feature vector as the object of similarity comparison and prototype learning.
This design enables ProtoSolo to utilize richer global information for
classification while relying on a single prototype activation. In addition, we
propose a non-prototype projection learning strategy, which preserves the
information association between the prototype and the training image patches
while avoiding the sharp change of the network structure caused by the
projection operation, thus avoiding its negative impact on the classification
performance. Experiments on the CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Cars datasets show
that ProtoSolo achieves superior performance in classification tasks and
reaches the best level in terms of cognitive complexity of explanations
compared to state-of-the-art interpretable methods. The code is available at

Conclusion: 该研究为级联视频超分辨率生成提供了简单有效的基线，为未来高效合成系统的发展提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Latent diffusion models have emerged as a leading paradigm for efficient
video generation. However, as user expectations shift toward higher-resolution
outputs, relying solely on latent computation becomes inadequate. A promising
approach involves decoupling the process into two stages: semantic content
generation and detail synthesis. The former employs a computationally intensive
base model at lower resolutions, while the latter leverages a lightweight
cascaded video super-resolution (VSR) model to achieve high-resolution output.
In this work, we focus on studying key design principles for latter cascaded
VSR models, which are underexplored currently. First, we propose two
degradation strategies to generate training pairs that better mimic the output
characteristics of the base model, ensuring alignment between the VSR model and
its upstream generator. Second, we provide critical insights into VSR model
behavior through systematic analysis of (1) timestep sampling strategies, (2)
noise augmentation effects on low-resolution (LR) inputs. These findings
directly inform our architectural and training innovations. Finally, we
introduce interleaving temporal unit and sparse local attention to achieve
efficient training and inference, drastically reducing computational overhead.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework over
existing methods, with ablation studies confirming the efficacy of each design
choice. Our work establishes a simple yet effective baseline for cascaded video
super-resolution generation, offering practical insights to guide future
advancements in efficient cascaded synthesis systems.

Method: DFM在多尺度表示（如拉普拉斯金字塔）的每一级独立应用Flow Matching，避免了复杂的多阶段架构设计。

Result: 在Imagenet-1k 512px上，DFM比基线架构提升了35.2%的FDD分数，比最佳基线提升了26.4%。在大型模型（如FLUX）微调中，DFM表现出更快的收敛速度。

Conclusion: DFM通过单模型、架构简单性和对现有训练流程的最小修改，实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Generating high-dimensional visual modalities is a computationally intensive
task. A common solution is progressive generation, where the outputs are
synthesized in a coarse-to-fine spectral autoregressive manner. While diffusion
models benefit from the coarse-to-fine nature of denoising, explicit
multi-stage architectures are rarely adopted. These architectures have
increased the complexity of the overall approach, introducing the need for a
custom diffusion formulation, decomposition-dependent stage transitions,
add-hoc samplers, or a model cascade. Our contribution, Decomposable Flow
Matching (DFM), is a simple and effective framework for the progressive
generation of visual media. DFM applies Flow Matching independently at each
level of a user-defined multi-scale representation (such as Laplacian pyramid).
As shown by our experiments, our approach improves visual quality for both
images and videos, featuring superior results compared to prior multistage
frameworks. On Imagenet-1k 512px, DFM achieves 35.2% improvements in FDD scores
over the base architecture and 26.4% over the best-performing baseline, under
the same training compute. When applied to finetuning of large models, such as
FLUX, DFM shows faster convergence speed to the training distribution.
Crucially, all these advantages are achieved with a single model, architectural
simplicity, and minimal modifications to existing training pipelines.

generation-sampling-classification which takes private training as input and
outputs the final classifier of interest. In this survey, we systematically
categorize existing image synthesis methods, privacy attacks, and mitigations
along this generation-sampling-classification pipeline. To empirically compare
diverse synthesis approaches, we provide a benchmark with representative
generative methods and use model-agnostic membership inference attacks (MIAs)
as a measure of privacy risk. Through this study, we seek to answer critical
questions in PPDS: Can synthetic data effectively replace real data? Which
release strategy balances utility and privacy? Do mitigations improve the
utility-privacy tradeoff? Which generative models perform best across different
scenarios? With a systematic evaluation of diverse methods, our study provides

Abstract: We present an enhanced YOLOv8 real time vehicle detection and classification
framework, for estimating carbon emissions in urban environments. The system
enhances YOLOv8 architecture to detect, segment, and track vehicles from live
traffic video streams. Once a vehicle is localized, a dedicated deep
learning-based identification module is employed to recognize license plates
and classify vehicle types. Since YOLOv8 lacks the built-in capacity for fine
grained recognition tasks such as reading license plates or determining vehicle
attributes beyond class labels, our framework incorporates a hybrid pipeline
where each detected vehicle is tracked and its bounding box is cropped and
passed to a deep Optical Character Recognition (OCR) module. This OCR system,
composed of multiple convolutional neural network (CNN) layers, is trained
specifically for character-level detection and license plate decoding under
varied conditions such as motion blur, occlusion, and diverse font styles.
Additionally, the recognized plate information is validated using a real time
API that cross references with an external vehicle registration database to
ensure accurate classification and emission estimation. This multi-stage
approach enables precise, automated calculation of per vehicle carbon
emissions. Extensive evaluation was conducted using a diverse vehicle dataset
enriched with segmentation masks and annotated license plates. The YOLOv8
detector achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of approximately 71% for
bounding boxes and 70% for segmentation masks. Character level OCR accuracy
reached up to 99% with the best performing CNN model. These results affirm the
feasibility of combining real time object detection with deep OCR for practical
deployment in smart transportation systems, offering a scalable solution for

Abstract: The computation of minimal paths for the applications in tracking tubular
structures such as blood vessels and roads is challenged by complex
morphologies and environmental variations. Existing approaches can be roughly
categorized into two research lines: the point-wise based models and the
segment-wise based models. Although segment-wise approaches have obtained
promising results in many scenarios, they often suffer from computational
inefficiency and heavily rely on a prescribed prior to fit the target elongated
shapes. We propose a novel framework that casts segment-wise tracking as a
Markov Decision Process (MDP), enabling a reinforcement learning approach. Our
method leverages Q-Learning to dynamically explore a graph of segments,
computing edge weights on-demand and adaptively expanding the search space.
This strategy avoids the high cost of a pre-computed graph and proves robust to
incomplete initial information. Experimental reuslts on typical tubular
structure datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art point-wise and segment-wise approaches. The proposed method
effectively handles complex topologies and maintains global path coherence
without depending on extensive prior structural knowledge.

Abstract: Automated detection of small and rare wildlife in aerial imagery is crucial
for effective conservation, yet remains a significant technical challenge.
Prairie dogs exemplify this issue: their ecological importance as keystone
species contrasts sharply with their elusive presence--marked by small size,
sparse distribution, and subtle visual features--which undermines existing
detection approaches. To address these challenges, we propose RareSpot, a
robust detection framework integrating multi-scale consistency learning and
context-aware augmentation. Our multi-scale consistency approach leverages
structured alignment across feature pyramids, enhancing fine-grained object
representation and mitigating scale-related feature loss. Complementarily,
context-aware augmentation strategically synthesizes challenging training
instances by embedding difficult-to-detect samples into realistic environmental
contexts, significantly boosting model precision and recall. Evaluated on an
expert-annotated prairie dog drone imagery benchmark, our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance, improving detection accuracy by over 35% compared
to baseline methods. Importantly, it generalizes effectively across additional
wildlife datasets, demonstrating broad applicability. The RareSpot benchmark
and approach not only support critical ecological monitoring but also establish
a new foundation for detecting small, rare species in complex aerial scenes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of voxel-based representations (memory-intensive, fixed resolutions, hard to edit) by leveraging primitives for more flexible and efficient 3D scene generation.

Method: Adopts a hybrid representation (rasterized ground surfaces and vectorized 3D primitives) with a structured latent space and a stable Cholesky-based parameterization for object orientation.

Result: Outperforms voxel-based methods in generation quality on KITTI-360 dataset, reduces memory usage by 3x, and supports instance-level manipulation and downstream tasks.

Conclusion: PrITTI demonstrates the effectiveness of primitives for scalable and editable 3D scene generation, with potential for broader applications.

Abstract: Large-scale 3D semantic scene generation has predominantly relied on
voxel-based representations, which are memory-intensive, bound by fixed
resolutions, and challenging to edit. In contrast, primitives represent
semantic entities using compact, coarse 3D structures that are easy to
manipulate and compose, making them an ideal representation for this task. In
this paper, we introduce PrITTI, a latent diffusion-based framework that
leverages primitives as the main foundational elements for generating
compositional, controllable, and editable 3D semantic scene layouts. Our method
adopts a hybrid representation, modeling ground surfaces in a rasterized format
while encoding objects as vectorized 3D primitives. This decomposition is also
reflected in a structured latent representation that enables flexible scene
manipulation of ground and object components. To overcome the orientation
ambiguities in conventional encoding methods, we introduce a stable
Cholesky-based parameterization that jointly encodes object size and
orientation. Experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset show that PrITTI outperforms
a voxel-based baseline in generation quality, while reducing memory
requirements by up to $3\times$. In addition, PrITTI enables direct
instance-level manipulation of objects in the scene and supports a range of
downstream applications, including scene inpainting, outpainting, and
photo-realistic street-view synthesis.

*Mahdi Falaki,Maria A. Amer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于MobileViT的轻量级RGB-T跟踪算法，通过渐进式融合框架和可分离注意力实现高效多模态跟踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单模态跟踪在复杂成像条件下的局限性，同时降低Vision Transformer的计算成本。

Method: 采用MobileViT和渐进式融合框架，结合可分离注意力学习模态内和模态间交互。

Result: 模型参数少于400万，GPU推理速度达122 FPS，性能与现有高效多模态跟踪器相当。

Conclusion: 首次将MobileViT应用于RGB-T跟踪，实现了高效且轻量的多模态跟踪。

Abstract: Single-modality object tracking (e.g., RGB-only) encounters difficulties in
challenging imaging conditions, such as low illumination and adverse weather
conditions. To solve this, multimodal tracking (e.g., RGB-T models) aims to
leverage complementary data such as thermal infrared features. While recent
Vision Transformer-based multimodal trackers achieve strong performance, they
are often computationally expensive due to large model sizes. In this work, we
propose a novel lightweight RGB-T tracking algorithm based on Mobile Vision
Transformers (MobileViT). Our tracker introduces a progressive fusion framework
that jointly learns intra-modal and inter-modal interactions between the
template and search regions using separable attention. This design produces
effective feature representations that support more accurate target
localization while achieving a small model size and fast inference speed.
Compared to state-of-the-art efficient multimodal trackers, our model achieves
comparable accuracy while offering significantly lower parameter counts (less
than 4 million) and the fastest GPU inference speed of 122 frames per second.
This paper is the first to propose a tracker using Mobile Vision Transformers
for RGB-T tracking and multimodal tracking at large. Tracker code and model
weights will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Abstract: We introduce OpenWildlife (OW), an open-vocabulary wildlife detector designed
for multi-species identification in diverse aerial imagery. While existing
automated methods perform well in specific settings, they often struggle to
generalize across different species and environments due to limited taxonomic
coverage and rigid model architectures. In contrast, OW leverages
language-aware embeddings and a novel adaptation of the Grounding-DINO
framework, enabling it to identify species specified through natural language
inputs across both terrestrial and marine environments. Trained on 15 datasets,
OW outperforms most existing methods, achieving up to \textbf{0.981} mAP50 with
fine-tuning and \textbf{0.597} mAP50 on seven datasets featuring novel species.
Additionally, we introduce an efficient search algorithm that combines
k-nearest neighbors and breadth-first search to prioritize areas where social
species are likely to be found. This approach captures over \textbf{95\%} of
species while exploring only \textbf{33\%} of the available images. To support
reproducibility, we publicly release our source code and dataset splits,
establishing OW as a flexible, cost-effective solution for global biodiversity
assessments.

Abstract: Ancient scripts, e.g., Egyptian hieroglyphs, Oracle Bone Inscriptions, and
Ancient Greek inscriptions, serve as vital carriers of human civilization,
embedding invaluable historical and cultural information. Automating ancient
script image recognition has gained importance, enabling large-scale
interpretation and advancing research in archaeology and digital humanities.
With the rise of deep learning, this field has progressed rapidly, with
numerous script-specific datasets and models proposed. While these scripts vary
widely, spanning phonographic systems with limited glyphs to logographic
systems with thousands of complex symbols, they share common challenges and
methodological overlaps. Moreover, ancient scripts face unique challenges,
including imbalanced data distribution and image degradation, which have driven
the development of various dedicated methods. This survey provides a
comprehensive review of ancient script image recognition methods. We begin by
categorizing existing studies based on script types and analyzing respective
recognition methods, highlighting both their differences and shared strategies.
We then focus on challenges unique to ancient scripts, systematically examining
their impact and reviewing recent solutions, including few-shot learning and
noise-robust techniques. Finally, we summarize current limitations and outline
promising future directions. Our goal is to offer a structured, forward-looking
perspective to support ongoing advancements in the recognition, interpretation,
and decipherment of ancient scripts.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: CAN和SPCAN方法在无监督域适应任务中表现优异。

Abstract: This paper proposes a new unsupervised domain adaptation approach called
Collaborative and Adversarial Network (CAN), which uses the
domain-collaborative and domain-adversarial learning strategy for training the
neural network. The domain-collaborative learning aims to learn domain-specific
feature representation to preserve the discriminability for the target domain,
while the domain adversarial learning aims to learn domain-invariant feature
representation to reduce the domain distribution mismatch between the source
and target domains. We show that these two learning strategies can be uniformly
formulated as domain classifier learning with positive or negative weights on
the losses. We then design a collaborative and adversarial training scheme,
which automatically learns domain-specific representations from lower blocks in
CNNs through collaborative learning and domain-invariant representations from
higher blocks through adversarial learning. Moreover, to further enhance the
discriminability in the target domain, we propose Self-Paced CAN (SPCAN), which
progressively selects pseudo-labeled target samples for re-training the
classifiers. We employ a self-paced learning strategy to select pseudo-labeled
target samples in an easy-to-hard fashion. Comprehensive experiments on
different benchmark datasets, Office-31, ImageCLEF-DA, and VISDA-2017 for the
object recognition task, and UCF101-10 and HMDB51-10 for the video action
recognition task, show our newly proposed approaches achieve the
state-of-the-art performance, which clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of
our proposed approaches for unsupervised domain adaptation.

Conclusion: WaterCaption和Da Yu为水道环境的视觉语义理解提供了新工具，NTA在多模态任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Automated waterway environment perception is crucial for enabling unmanned
surface vessels (USVs) to understand their surroundings and make informed
decisions. Most existing waterway perception models primarily focus on
instance-level object perception paradigms (e.g., detection, segmentation).
However, due to the complexity of waterway environments, current perception
datasets and models fail to achieve global semantic understanding of waterways,
limiting large-scale monitoring and structured log generation. With the
advancement of vision-language models (VLMs), we leverage image captioning to
introduce WaterCaption, the first captioning dataset specifically designed for
waterway environments. WaterCaption focuses on fine-grained, multi-region
long-text descriptions, providing a new research direction for visual
geo-understanding and spatial scene cognition. Exactly, it includes 20.2k
image-text pair data with 1.8 million vocabulary size. Additionally, we propose
Da Yu, an edge-deployable multi-modal large language model for USVs, where we
propose a novel vision-to-language projector called Nano Transformer Adaptor
(NTA). NTA effectively balances computational efficiency with the capacity for
both global and fine-grained local modeling of visual features, thereby
significantly enhancing the model's ability to generate long-form textual
outputs. Da Yu achieves an optimal balance between performance and efficiency,
surpassing state-of-the-art models on WaterCaption and several other captioning

Abstract: We propose HoliGS, a novel deformable Gaussian splatting framework that
addresses embodied view synthesis from long monocular RGB videos. Unlike prior
4D Gaussian splatting and dynamic NeRF pipelines, which struggle with training
overhead in minute-long captures, our method leverages invertible Gaussian
Splatting deformation networks to reconstruct large-scale, dynamic environments
accurately. Specifically, we decompose each scene into a static background plus
time-varying objects, each represented by learned Gaussian primitives
undergoing global rigid transformations, skeleton-driven articulation, and
subtle non-rigid deformations via an invertible neural flow. This hierarchical
warping strategy enables robust free-viewpoint novel-view rendering from
various embodied camera trajectories by attaching Gaussians to a complete
canonical foreground shape (\eg, egocentric or third-person follow), which may
involve substantial viewpoint changes and interactions between multiple actors.
Our experiments demonstrate that \ourmethod~ achieves superior reconstruction
quality on challenging datasets while significantly reducing both training and
rendering time compared to state-of-the-art monocular deformable NeRFs. These
results highlight a practical and scalable solution for EVS in real-world
scenarios. The source code will be released.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Camouflaged Object Segmentation (OVCOS) seeks to segment and
classify camouflaged objects from arbitrary categories, presenting unique
challenges due to visual ambiguity and unseen categories.Recent approaches
typically adopt a two-stage paradigm: first segmenting objects, then
classifying the segmented regions using Vision Language Models (VLMs).However,
these methods (1) suffer from a domain gap caused by the mismatch between VLMs'
full-image training and cropped-region inference, and (2) depend on generic
segmentation models optimized for well-delineated objects, making them less
effective for camouflaged objects.Without explicit guidance, generic
segmentation models often overlook subtle boundaries, leading to imprecise
segmentation.In this paper,we introduce a novel VLM-guided cascaded framework
to address these issues in OVCOS.For segmentation, we leverage the Segment
Anything Model (SAM), guided by the VLM.Our framework uses VLM-derived features
as explicit prompts to SAM, effectively directing attention to camouflaged
regions and significantly improving localization accuracy.For classification,
we avoid the domain gap introduced by hard cropping.Instead, we treat the
segmentation output as a soft spatial prior via the alpha channel, which
retains the full image context while providing precise spatial guidance,
leading to more accurate and context-aware classification of camouflaged
objects.The same VLM is shared across both segmentation and classification to
ensure efficiency and semantic consistency.Extensive experiments on both OVCOS
and conventional camouflaged object segmentation benchmarks demonstrate the
clear superiority of our method, highlighting the effectiveness of leveraging
rich VLM semantics for both segmentation and classification of camouflaged
objects.

Abstract: Airway management skills are critical in emergency medicine and are typically
assessed through subjective evaluation, often failing to gauge competency in
real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a machine learning-based approach for
assessing airway skills, specifically endotracheal intubation (ETI), using
human gaze data and video recordings. The proposed system leverages an
attention mechanism guided by the human gaze to enhance the recognition of
successful and unsuccessful ETI procedures. Visual masks were created from gaze
points to guide the model in focusing on task-relevant areas, reducing
irrelevant features. An autoencoder network extracts features from the videos,
while an attention module generates attention from the visual masks, and a
classifier outputs a classification score. This method, the first to use human
gaze for ETI, demonstrates improved accuracy and efficiency over traditional
methods. The integration of human gaze data not only enhances model performance
but also offers a robust, objective assessment tool for clinical skills,
particularly in high-stress environments such as military settings. The results
show improvements in prediction accuracy, sensitivity, and trustworthiness,
highlighting the potential for this approach to improve clinical training and
patient outcomes in emergency medicine.

fine-grained alignment between point clouds and text by leveraging a pretrained

Abstract: Downscaling is essential for generating the high-resolution climate data
needed for local planning, but traditional methods remain computationally
demanding. Recent years have seen impressive results from AI downscaling
models, particularly diffusion models, which have attracted attention due to
their ability to generate ensembles and overcome the smoothing problem common
in other AI methods. However, these models typically remain computationally
intensive. We introduce a Hierarchical Diffusion Downscaling (HDD) model, which
introduces an easily-extensible hierarchical sampling process to the diffusion
framework. A coarse-to-fine hierarchy is imposed via a simple downsampling
scheme. HDD achieves competitive accuracy on ERA5 reanalysis datasets and CMIP6
models, significantly reducing computational load by running on up to half as
many pixels with competitive results. Additionally, a single model trained at
0.25{\deg} resolution transfers seamlessly across multiple CMIP6 models with
much coarser resolution. HDD thus offers a lightweight alternative for
probabilistic climate downscaling, facilitating affordable large-ensemble
high-resolution climate projections. See a full code implementation at:

Abstract: With the rapid development of ultra-high resolution (UHR) remote sensing

issues, we propose GLCANet (Global-Local Cross-Attention Network), a
lightweight segmentation framework designed for UHR remote sensing
imagery.GLCANet employs a dual-stream architecture to efficiently fuse global
semantics and local details while minimizing GPU usage. A self-attention
mechanism enhances long-range dependencies, refines global features, and
preserves local details for better semantic consistency. A masked
cross-attention mechanism also adaptively fuses global-local features,
selectively enhancing fine-grained details while exploiting global context to
improve segmentation accuracy. Experimental results show that GLCANet
outperforms state-of-the-art methods regarding accuracy and computational
efficiency. The model effectively processes large, high-resolution images with
a small memory footprint, providing a promising solution for real-world remote
sensing applications.

Abstract: Modern deep learning models in computer vision require large datasets of real
images, which are difficult to curate and pose privacy and legal concerns,
limiting their commercial use. Recent works suggest synthetic data as an
alternative, yet models trained with it often underperform. This paper proposes
a two-step approach to bridge this gap. First, we propose an improved neural
fractal formulation through which we introduce a new class of synthetic data.
Second, we propose reverse stylization, a technique that transfers visual
features from a small, license-free set of real images onto synthetic datasets,
enhancing their effectiveness. We analyze the domain gap between our synthetic
datasets and real images using Kernel Inception Distance (KID) and show that
our method achieves a significantly lower distributional gap compared to
existing synthetic datasets. Furthermore, our experiments across different
tasks demonstrate the practical impact of this reduced gap. We show that
pretraining the EDM2 diffusion model on our synthetic dataset leads to an 11%
reduction in FID during image generation, compared to models trained on
existing synthetic datasets, and a 20% decrease in autoencoder reconstruction
error, indicating improved performance in data representation. Furthermore, a
ViT-S model trained for classification on this synthetic data achieves over a
10% improvement in ImageNet-100 accuracy. Our work opens up exciting
possibilities for training practical models when sufficiently large real
training sets are not available.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病周围神经病变（DPN）的早期诊断需求迫切，现有自动化方法存在特征提取效率低、依赖手工先验和数据不足的问题。

Method: HMSViT采用基于池化的分层和双重注意力机制，结合绝对位置编码，设计了一种块掩码自监督学习框架，并利用多尺度解码器进行分割和分类。

Result: 在临床CCM数据集上，HMSViT在神经分割（61.34% mIoU）和诊断准确率（70.40%）上均达到SOTA，优于Swin Transformer和HiViT。

Conclusion: HMSViT通过结合自监督学习和多尺度特征提取，实现了高效、鲁棒的临床诊断性能，具备实际部署潜力。

Abstract: Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN) affects nearly half of diabetes
patients, requiring early detection. Corneal Confocal Microscopy (CCM) enables
non-invasive diagnosis, but automated methods suffer from inefficient feature
extraction, reliance on handcrafted priors, and data limitations. We propose
HMSViT, a novel Hierarchical Masked Self-Supervised Vision Transformer (HMSViT)
designed for corneal nerve segmentation and DPN diagnosis. Unlike existing
methods, HMSViT employs pooling-based hierarchical and dual attention
mechanisms with absolute positional encoding, enabling efficient multi-scale
feature extraction by capturing fine-grained local details in early layers and
integrating global context in deeper layers, all at a lower computational cost.
A block-masked self supervised learning framework is designed for the HMSViT
that reduces reliance on labelled data, enhancing feature robustness, while a
multi-scale decoder is used for segmentation and classification by fusing
hierarchical features. Experiments on clinical CCM datasets showed HMSViT
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 61.34% mIoU for nerve segmentation
and 70.40% diagnostic accuracy, outperforming leading hierarchical models like
the Swin Transformer and HiViT by margins of up to 6.39% in segmentation
accuracy while using fewer parameters. Detailed ablation studies further reveal
that integrating block-masked SSL with hierarchical multi-scale feature
extraction substantially enhances performance compared to conventional
supervised training. Overall, these comprehensive experiments confirm that
HMSViT delivers excellent, robust, and clinically viable results, demonstrating
its potential for scalable deployment in real-world diagnostic applications.

<details>

Motivation: kVCT成像中的伪影影响临床决策，传统方法无法有效解决高分辨率kVCT与抗伪影MVCT之间的差距。

Method: 采用编码器-解码器架构，结合特征重校准技术，专注于相关空间区域和通道特征。

Result: 生成高质量的MVCT样重建图像，减少重复高剂量MVCT扫描的需求。

Conclusion: 该方法在临床上有助于降低癌症患者的辐射暴露，提升放疗规划效率。

Abstract: Artifacts in kilo-Voltage CT (kVCT) imaging degrade image quality, impacting
clinical decisions. We propose a deep learning framework for metal artifact
reduction (MAR) and domain transformation from kVCT to Mega-Voltage CT (MVCT).
The proposed framework, ReMAR-DS, utilizes an encoder-decoder architecture with
enhanced feature recalibration, effectively reducing artifacts while preserving
anatomical structures. This ensures that only relevant information is utilized
in the reconstruction process. By infusing recalibrated features from the
encoder block, the model focuses on relevant spatial regions (e.g., areas with
artifacts) and highlights key features across channels (e.g., anatomical
structures), leading to improved reconstruction of artifact-corrupted regions.
Unlike traditional MAR methods, our approach bridges the gap between
high-resolution kVCT and artifact-resistant MVCT, enhancing radiotherapy
planning. It produces high-quality MVCT-like reconstructions, validated through
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Clinically, this enables oncologists
to rely on kVCT alone, reducing repeated high-dose MVCT scans and lowering
radiation exposure for cancer patients.

Method: 提出Time-series MSI Image Reconstruction using ViT框架，利用MSI的时间连贯性和SAR的互补信息，通过注意力机制实现重建。

Result: 实验表明，该框架显著优于仅使用非时间序列MSI和SAR或仅时间序列MSI的基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升了云覆盖区域的MSI重建质量。

Abstract: Cloud cover in multispectral imagery (MSI) poses significant challenges for
early season crop mapping, as it leads to missing or corrupted spectral
information. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, which is not affected by
cloud interference, offers a complementary solution, but lack sufficient
spectral detail for precise crop mapping. To address this, we propose a novel
framework, Time-series MSI Image Reconstruction using Vision Transformer (ViT),
to reconstruct MSI data in cloud-covered regions by leveraging the temporal
coherence of MSI and the complementary information from SAR from the attention
mechanism. Comprehensive experiments, using rigorous reconstruction evaluation
metrics, demonstrate that Time-series ViT framework significantly outperforms
baselines that use non-time-series MSI and SAR or time-series MSI without SAR,
effectively enhancing MSI image reconstruction in cloud-covered regions.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) based framework,

implicit neural representation of space and time-varying scene for both LiDAR

both static and dynamic scenes. Compared to existing multimodal dynamic NeRFs,
our framework is self-supervised, thus eliminating the need for 3D labels. For
efficient training and faster convergence, we introduce heuristic-based image
pixel sampling to focus on pixels with rich information. To preserve the local
features of LiDAR points, a Double Gradient based mask is employed. Extensive
experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset show that, compared to the baseline
models, our framework has reported best performance on both LiDAR and Camera

Abstract: When humans and robotic agents coexist in an environment, scene understanding
becomes crucial for the agents to carry out various downstream tasks like
navigation and planning. Hence, an agent must be capable of localizing and
identifying actions performed by the human. Current research lacks reliable
datasets for performing scene understanding within indoor environments where
humans are also a part of the scene. Scene Graphs enable us to generate a
structured representation of a scene or an image to perform visual scene
understanding. To tackle this, we present HOIverse a synthetic dataset at the
intersection of scene graph and human-object interaction, consisting of
accurate and dense relationship ground truths between humans and surrounding
objects along with corresponding RGB images, segmentation masks, depth images
and human keypoints. We compute parametric relations between various pairs of
objects and human-object pairs, resulting in an accurate and unambiguous
relation definitions. In addition, we benchmark our dataset on state-of-the-art
scene graph generation models to predict parametric relations and human-object
interactions. Through this dataset, we aim to accelerate research in the field

Abstract: Precision oncology requires accurate molecular insights, yet obtaining these
directly from genomics is costly and time-consuming for broad clinical use.
Predicting complex molecular features and patient prognosis directly from
routine whole-slide images (WSI) remains a major challenge for current deep
learning methods. Here we introduce PathLUPI, which uses transcriptomic
privileged information during training to extract genome-anchored histological
embeddings, enabling effective molecular prediction using only WSIs at
inference. Through extensive evaluation across 49 molecular oncology tasks
using 11,257 cases among 20 cohorts, PathLUPI demonstrated superior performance
compared to conventional methods trained solely on WSIs. Crucially, it achieves
AUC $\geq$ 0.80 in 14 of the biomarker prediction and molecular subtyping tasks
and C-index $\geq$ 0.70 in survival cohorts of 5 major cancer types. Moreover,
PathLUPI embeddings reveal distinct cellular morphological signatures
associated with specific genotypes and related biological pathways within WSIs.
By effectively encoding molecular context to refine WSI representations,
PathLUPI overcomes a key limitation of existing models and offers a novel
strategy to bridge molecular insights with routine pathology workflows for
wider clinical application.

Conclusion: UltraAD通过结合视觉和语言信息，显著提升了医学图像异常检测的精度和实用性。

Abstract: Precise anomaly detection in medical images is critical for clinical
decision-making. While recent unsupervised or semi-supervised anomaly detection
methods trained on large-scale normal data show promising results, they lack
fine-grained differentiation, such as benign vs. malignant tumors.
Additionally, ultrasound (US) imaging is highly sensitive to devices and
acquisition parameter variations, creating significant domain gaps in the
resulting US images. To address these challenges, we propose UltraAD, a
vision-language model (VLM)-based approach that leverages few-shot US examples
for generalized anomaly localization and fine-grained classification. To
enhance localization performance, the image-level token of query visual
prototypes is first fused with learnable text embeddings. This image-informed
prompt feature is then further integrated with patch-level tokens, refining
local representations for improved accuracy. For fine-grained classification, a
memory bank is constructed from few-shot image samples and corresponding text
descriptions that capture anatomical and abnormality-specific features. During
training, the stored text embeddings remain frozen, while image features are
adapted to better align with medical data. UltraAD has been extensively
evaluated on three breast US datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
in both lesion localization and fine-grained medical classification. The code
will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Existing 4D synthesis methods primarily focus on object-level generation or
dynamic scene synthesis with limited novel views, restricting their ability to
generate multi-view consistent and immersive dynamic 4D scenes. To address
these constraints, we propose a framework (dubbed as CoCo4D) for generating
detailed dynamic 4D scenes from text prompts, with the option to include
images. Our method leverages the crucial observation that articulated motion
typically characterizes foreground objects, whereas background alterations are
less pronounced. Consequently, CoCo4D divides 4D scene synthesis into two
responsibilities: modeling the dynamic foreground and creating the evolving
background, both directed by a reference motion sequence. Given a text prompt
and an optional reference image, CoCo4D first generates an initial motion
sequence utilizing video diffusion models. This motion sequence then guides the
synthesis of both the dynamic foreground object and the background using a
novel progressive outpainting scheme. To ensure seamless integration of the
moving foreground object within the dynamic background, CoCo4D optimizes a
parametric trajectory for the foreground, resulting in realistic and coherent
blending. Extensive experiments show that CoCo4D achieves comparable or
superior performance in 4D scene generation compared to existing methods,
demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency. More results are presented on

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable advances in audio-driven talking head
generation. However, existing approaches predominantly focus on
single-character scenarios. While some methods can create separate conversation
videos between two individuals, the critical challenge of generating unified
conversation videos with multiple physically co-present characters sharing the
same spatial environment remains largely unaddressed. This setting presents two
key challenges: audio-to-character correspondence control and the lack of
suitable datasets featuring multi-character talking videos within the same
scene. To address these challenges, we introduce Bind-Your-Avatar, an
MM-DiT-based model specifically designed for multi-talking-character video
generation in the same scene. Specifically, we propose (1) A novel framework
incorporating a fine-grained Embedding Router that binds `who' and `speak what'
together to address the audio-to-character correspondence control. (2) Two
methods for implementing a 3D-mask embedding router that enables frame-wise,
fine-grained control of individual characters, with distinct loss functions
based on observed geometric priors and a mask refinement strategy to enhance
the accuracy and temporal smoothness of the predicted masks. (3) The first
dataset, to the best of our knowledge, specifically constructed for
multi-talking-character video generation, and accompanied by an open-source
data processing pipeline, and (4) A benchmark for the dual-talking-characters

Conclusion: 提出的跨参考IQA框架对3D表示无关，且高效，为视图选择提供了新思路。

Abstract: We tackle active view selection in novel view synthesis and 3D
reconstruction. Existing methods like FisheRF and ActiveNeRF select the next
best view by minimizing uncertainty or maximizing information gain in 3D, but
they require specialized designs for different 3D representations and involve
complex modelling in 3D space. Instead, we reframe this as a 2D image quality
assessment (IQA) task, selecting views where current renderings have the lowest
quality. Since ground-truth images for candidate views are unavailable,
full-reference metrics like PSNR and SSIM are inapplicable, while no-reference
metrics, such as MUSIQ and MANIQA, lack the essential multi-view context.
Inspired by a recent cross-referencing quality framework CrossScore, we train a
model to predict SSIM within a multi-view setup and use it to guide view
selection. Our cross-reference IQA framework achieves substantial quantitative
and qualitative improvements across standard benchmarks, while being agnostic
to 3D representations, and runs 14-33 times faster than previous methods.

skeleton-based animation. Traditional motion synthesis methods are either
restricted to fixed skeletal topologies or require costly optimization in
high-dimensional deformation spaces. In contrast, AnimaX effectively transfers
video-based motion knowledge to the 3D domain, supporting diverse articulated
meshes with arbitrary skeletons. Our method represents 3D motion as multi-view,
multi-frame 2D pose maps, and enables joint video-pose diffusion conditioned on
template renderings and a textual motion prompt. We introduce shared positional
encodings and modality-aware embeddings to ensure spatial-temporal alignment
between video and pose sequences, effectively transferring video priors to
motion generation task. The resulting multi-view pose sequences are
triangulated into 3D joint positions and converted into mesh animation via
inverse kinematics. Trained on a newly curated dataset of 160,000 rigged
sequences, AnimaX achieves state-of-the-art results on VBench in
generalization, motion fidelity, and efficiency, offering a scalable solution

Abstract: Chest X-rays (CXRs) are the most widely used medical imaging modality and
play a pivotal role in diagnosing diseases. However, as 2D projection images,
CXRs are limited by structural superposition, which constrains their
effectiveness in precise disease diagnosis and risk prediction. To address the
limitations of 2D CXRs, this study introduces Xray2Xray, a novel World Model
that learns latent representations encoding 3D structural information from
chest X-rays. Xray2Xray captures the latent representations of the chest volume
by modeling the transition dynamics of X-ray projections across different
angular positions with a vision model and a transition model. We employed the
latent representations of Xray2Xray for downstream risk prediction and disease
diagnosis tasks. Experimental results showed that Xray2Xray outperformed both
supervised methods and self-supervised pretraining methods for cardiovascular
disease risk estimation and achieved competitive performance in classifying
five pathologies in CXRs. We also assessed the quality of Xray2Xray's latent
representations through synthesis tasks and demonstrated that the latent
representations can be used to reconstruct volumetric context.

tissue samples from colon, kidney, and skin tissue blocks were distributed to
66 different labs for routine H&E staining. To isolate staining variation,
other factors affecting the tissue appearance were kept constant. Further, we
used this tissue image dataset to compare the performance of eight different
stain normalization methods, including four traditional methods, namely,
histogram matching, Macenko, Vahadane, and Reinhard normalization, and two deep
learning-based methods namely CycleGAN and Pixp2pix, both with two variants

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian representations have significantly improved
the quality and efficiency of image-based scene reconstruction. Their explicit
nature facilitates real-time rendering and fast optimization, yet extracting
accurate surfaces - particularly in large-scale, unbounded environments -
remains a difficult task. Many existing methods rely on approximate depth
estimates and global sorting heuristics, which can introduce artifacts and
limit the fidelity of the reconstructed mesh. In this paper, we present Sorted
Opacity Fields (SOF), a method designed to recover detailed surfaces from 3D
Gaussians with both speed and precision. Our approach improves upon prior work
by introducing hierarchical resorting and a robust formulation of Gaussian
depth, which better aligns with the level-set. To enhance mesh quality, we
incorporate a level-set regularizer operating on the opacity field and
introduce losses that encourage geometrically-consistent primitive shapes. In
addition, we develop a parallelized Marching Tetrahedra algorithm tailored to
our opacity formulation, reducing meshing time by up to an order of magnitude.
As demonstrated by our quantitative evaluation, SOF achieves higher
reconstruction accuracy while cutting total processing time by more than a
factor of three. These results mark a step forward in turning efficient
Gaussian-based rendering into equally efficient geometry extraction.

Abstract: Image registration is used in many medical image analysis applications, such
as tracking the motion of tissue in cardiac images, where cardiac kinematics
can be an indicator of tissue health. Registration is a challenging problem for
deep learning algorithms because ground truth transformations are not feasible
to create, and because there are potentially multiple transformations that can
produce images that appear correlated with the goal. Unsupervised methods have
been proposed to learn to predict effective transformations, but these methods
take significantly longer to predict than established baseline methods. For a
deep learning method to see adoption in wider research and clinical settings,
it should be designed to run in a reasonable time on common, mid-level
hardware. Fast methods have been proposed for the task of image registration
but often use patch-based methods which can affect registration accuracy for a
highly dynamic organ such as the heart.
  In this thesis, a fast, volumetric registration model is proposed for the use
of quantifying cardiac strain. The proposed Deep Learning Neural Network (DLNN)
is designed to utilize an architecture that can compute convolutions incredibly
efficiently, allowing the model to achieve registration fidelity similar to
other state-of-the-art models while taking a fraction of the time to perform
inference. The proposed fast and lightweight registration (FLIR) model is used
to predict tissue motion which is then used to quantify the non-uniform strain
experienced by the tissue. For acquisitions taken from the same patient at
approximately the same time, it would be expected that strain values measured
between the acquisitions would have very small differences. Using this metric,
strain values computed using the FLIR method are shown to be very consistent.

Abstract: Effective representation of Regions of Interest (ROI) and independent
alignment of these ROIs can significantly enhance the performance of deformable
medical image registration (DMIR). However, current learning-based DMIR methods
have limitations. Unsupervised techniques disregard ROI representation and
proceed directly with aligning pairs of images, while weakly-supervised methods
heavily depend on label constraints to facilitate registration. To address
these issues, we introduce a novel ROI-based registration approach named
EASR-DCN. Our method represents medical images through effective ROIs and
achieves independent alignment of these ROIs without requiring labels.
Specifically, we first used a Gaussian mixture model for intensity analysis to
represent images using multiple effective ROIs with distinct intensities.
Furthermore, we propose a novel Divide-and-Conquer Network (DCN) to process
these ROIs through separate channels to learn feature alignments for each ROI.
The resultant correspondences are seamlessly integrated to generate a
comprehensive displacement vector field. Extensive experiments were performed
on three MRI and one CT datasets to showcase the superior accuracy and
deformation reduction efficacy of our EASR-DCN. Compared to VoxelMorph, our
EASR-DCN achieved improvements of 10.31\% in the Dice score for brain MRI,
13.01\% for cardiac MRI, and 5.75\% for hippocampus MRI, highlighting its
promising potential for clinical applications. The code for this work will be
released upon acceptance of the paper.

Abstract: Anomaly detection has been widely studied in the context of industrial defect
inspection, with numerous methods developed to tackle a range of challenges. In
digital pathology, anomaly detection holds significant potential for
applications such as rare disease identification, artifact detection, and
biomarker discovery. However, the unique characteristics of pathology images,

20 classical and prevalent anomaly detection methods through extensive

investigate the influence of image scale, anomaly pattern types, and training
epoch selection strategies on detection performance. The results provide a

Abstract: Scalable image compression is a technique that progressively reconstructs
multiple versions of an image for different requirements. In recent years,
images have increasingly been consumed not only by humans but also by image
recognition models. This shift has drawn growing attention to scalable image
compression methods that serve both machine and human vision (ICMH). Many
existing models employ neural network-based codecs, known as learned image
compression, and have made significant strides in this field by carefully
designing the loss functions. In some cases, however, models are overly reliant
on their learning capacity, and their architectural design is not sufficiently
considered. In this paper, we enhance the coding efficiency and
interpretability of ICMH framework by integrating an explicit residual
compression mechanism, which is commonly employed in resolution scalable coding
methods such as JPEG2000. Specifically, we propose two complementary methods:
Feature Residual-based Scalable Coding (FR-ICMH) and Pixel Residual-based
Scalable Coding (PR-ICMH). These proposed methods are applicable to various
machine vision tasks. Moreover, they provide flexibility to choose between
encoder complexity and compression performance, making it adaptable to diverse
application requirements. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed methods, with PR-ICMH achieving up to 29.57% BD-rate savings over
the previous work.

Abstract: Regular mammography screening is essential for early breast cancer detection.
Deep learning-based risk prediction methods have sparked interest to adjust
screening intervals for high-risk groups. While early methods focused only on
current mammograms, recent approaches leverage the temporal aspect of
screenings to track breast tissue changes over time, requiring spatial
alignment across different time points. Two main strategies for this have
emerged: explicit feature alignment through deformable registration and
implicit learned alignment using techniques like transformers, with the former
providing more control. However, the optimal approach for explicit alignment in
mammography remains underexplored. In this study, we provide insights into
where explicit alignment should occur (input space vs. representation space)
and if alignment and risk prediction should be jointly optimized. We
demonstrate that jointly learning explicit alignment in representation space
while optimizing risk estimation performance, as done in the current
state-of-the-art approach, results in a trade-off between alignment quality and
predictive performance and show that image-level alignment is superior to
representation-level alignment, leading to better deformation field quality and
enhanced risk prediction accuracy. The code is available at

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting represents a breakthrough in the field of novel view
synthesis. It establishes Gaussians as core rendering primitives for highly
accurate real-world environment reconstruction. Recent advances have
drastically increased the size of scenes that can be created. In this work, we
present a method for rendering large and complex 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes
using virtual memory. By leveraging well-established virtual memory and virtual
texturing techniques, our approach efficiently identifies visible Gaussians and
dynamically streams them to the GPU just in time for real-time rendering.
Selecting only the necessary Gaussians for both storage and rendering results
in reduced memory usage and effectively accelerates rendering, especially for
highly complex scenes. Furthermore, we demonstrate how level of detail can be
integrated into our proposed method to further enhance rendering speed for
large-scale scenes. With an optimized implementation, we highlight key
practical considerations and thoroughly evaluate the proposed technique and its
impact on desktop and mobile devices.

Abstract: The segmentation of metastatic bone disease (MBD) in whole-body MRI (WB-MRI)
is a challenging problem. Due to varying appearances and anatomical locations
of lesions, ambiguous boundaries, and severe class imbalance, obtaining
reliable segmentations requires large, well-annotated datasets capturing lesion
variability. Generating such datasets requires substantial time and expertise,
and is prone to error. While self-supervised learning (SSL) can leverage large
unlabeled datasets, learned generic representations often fail to capture the
nuanced features needed for accurate lesion detection.
  In this work, we propose a Supervised Anatomical Pretraining (SAP) method
that learns from a limited dataset of anatomical labels. First, an MRI-based
skeletal segmentation model is developed and trained on WB-MRI scans from
healthy individuals for high-quality skeletal delineation. Then, we compare its
downstream efficacy in segmenting MBD on a cohort of 44 patients with
metastatic prostate cancer, against both a baseline random initialization and a
state-of-the-art SSL method.
  SAP significantly outperforms both the baseline and SSL-pretrained models,
achieving a normalized surface Dice of 0.76 and a Dice coefficient of 0.64. The
method achieved a lesion detection F2 score of 0.44, improving on 0.24
(baseline) and 0.31 (SSL). When considering only clinically relevant lesions
larger than 1~ml, SAP achieves a detection sensitivity of 100% in 28 out of 32
patients.
  Learning bone morphology from anatomy yields an effective and domain-relevant
inductive bias that can be leveraged for the downstream segmentation task of
bone lesions. All code and models are made publicly available.

Abstract: Prostate gland segmentation from T2-weighted MRI is a critical yet
challenging task in clinical prostate cancer assessment. While deep
learning-based methods have significantly advanced automated segmentation, most
conventional approaches-particularly 2D convolutional neural networks
(CNNs)-fail to leverage inter-slice anatomical continuity, limiting their
accuracy and robustness. Fully 3D models offer improved spatial coherence but
require large amounts of annotated data, which is often impractical in clinical
settings. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid architecture that
models MRI sequences as spatiotemporal data. Our method uses a deep, pretrained
DeepLabV3 backbone to extract high-level semantic features from each MRI slice
and a recurrent convolutional head, built with ConvLSTM layers, to integrate
information across slices while preserving spatial structure. This combination
enables context-aware segmentation with improved consistency, particularly in
data-limited and noisy imaging conditions. We evaluate our method on the
PROMISE12 benchmark under both clean and contrast-degraded test settings.
Compared to state-of-the-art 2D and 3D segmentation models, our approach
demonstrates superior performance in terms of precision, recall, Intersection
over Union (IoU), and Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), highlighting its
potential for robust clinical deployment.

Abstract: Multiview point cloud registration is a fundamental task for constructing
globally consistent 3D models. Existing approaches typically rely on feature
extraction and data association across multiple point clouds; however, these
processes are challenging to obtain global optimal solution in complex
environments. In this paper, we introduce a novel correspondence-free multiview
point cloud registration method. Specifically, we represent the global map as a
depth map and leverage raw depth information to formulate a non-linear least
squares optimisation that jointly estimates poses of point clouds and the
global map. Unlike traditional feature-based bundle adjustment methods, which
rely on explicit feature extraction and data association, our method bypasses
these challenges by associating multi-frame point clouds with a global depth
map through their corresponding poses. This data association is implicitly
incorporated and dynamically refined during the optimisation process. Extensive
evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in accuracy, particularly in challenging
environments where feature extraction and data association are difficult.

Abstract: Accurately quantifying motor characteristics in Parkinson disease (PD) is
crucial for monitoring disease progression and optimizing treatment strategies.
The finger-tapping test is a standard motor assessment. Clinicians visually
evaluate a patient's tapping performance and assign an overall severity score
based on tapping amplitude, speed, and irregularity. However, this subjective
evaluation is prone to inter- and intra-rater variability, and does not offer
insights into individual motor characteristics captured during this test. This
paper introduces a granular computer vision-based method for quantifying PD
motor characteristics from video recordings. Four sets of clinically relevant
features are proposed to characterize hypokinesia, bradykinesia, sequence
effect, and hesitation-halts. We evaluate our approach on video recordings and
clinical evaluations of 74 PD patients from the Personalized Parkinson Project.
Principal component analysis with varimax rotation shows that the video-based
features corresponded to the four deficits. Additionally, video-based analysis
has allowed us to identify further granular distinctions within sequence effect
and hesitation-halts deficits. In the following, we have used these features to
train machine learning classifiers to estimate the Movement Disorder Society
Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) finger-tapping score.
Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our method achieves a higher accuracy
in MDS-UPDRS score prediction, while still providing an interpretable
quantification of individual finger-tapping motor characteristics. In summary,
the proposed framework provides a practical solution for the objective
assessment of PD motor characteristics, that can potentially be applied in both
clinical and remote settings. Future work is needed to assess its
responsiveness to symptomatic treatment and disease progression.

Abstract: Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) remain the leading cause of
mortality globally, as reported in the Global Disease Burden Study 2021.
Opportunistic screening leverages data collected from routine health check-ups
and multimodal data can play a key role to identify at-risk individuals. Chest
X-rays (CXR) provide insights into chronic conditions contributing to major
adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), while 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)
directly assesses cardiac electrical activity and structural abnormalities.
Integrating CXR and ECG could offer a more comprehensive risk assessment than
conventional models, which rely on clinical scores, computed tomography (CT)
measurements, or biomarkers, which may be limited by sampling bias and single
modality constraints. We propose a novel predictive modeling framework -
MOSCARD, multimodal causal reasoning with co-attention to align two distinct
modalities and simultaneously mitigate bias and confounders in opportunistic
risk estimation. Primary technical contributions are - (i) multimodal alignment
of CXR with ECG guidance; (ii) integration of causal reasoning; (iii) dual
back-propagation graph for de-confounding. Evaluated on internal, shift data
from emergency department (ED) and external MIMIC datasets, our model
outperformed single modality and state-of-the-art foundational models - AUC:
0.75, 0.83, 0.71 respectively. Proposed cost-effective opportunistic screening
enables early intervention, improving patient outcomes and reducing

Abstract: Multimodal pathology-genomic analysis is critical for cancer survival
prediction. However, existing approaches predominantly integrate formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) slides with genomic data, while neglecting the
availability of other preservation slides, such as Fresh Froze (FF) slides.
Moreover, as the high-resolution spatial nature of pathology data tends to
dominate the cross-modality fusion process, it hinders effective multimodal
fusion and leads to modality imbalance challenges between pathology and
genomics. These methods also typically require complete data modalities,
limiting their clinical applicability with incomplete modalities, such as
missing either pathology or genomic data. In this paper, we propose a
multimodal survival prediction framework that leverages hypergraph learning to
effectively integrate multi-WSI information and cross-modality interactions
between pathology slides and genomics data while addressing modality imbalance.
In addition, we introduce a memory mechanism that stores previously learned
paired pathology-genomic features and dynamically compensates for incomplete
modalities. Experiments on five TCGA datasets demonstrate that our model
outperforms advanced methods by over 2.3% in C-Index. Under incomplete modality

Abstract: We introduce the largest real-world image deblurring dataset constructed from
smartphone slow-motion videos. Using 240 frames captured over one second, we
simulate realistic long-exposure blur by averaging frames to produce blurry
images, while using the temporally centered frame as the sharp reference. Our
dataset contains over 42,000 high-resolution blur-sharp image pairs, making it
approximately 10 times larger than widely used datasets, with 8 times the
amount of different scenes, including indoor and outdoor environments, with
varying object and camera motions. We benchmark multiple state-of-the-art
(SOTA) deblurring models on our dataset and observe significant performance
degradation, highlighting the complexity and diversity of our benchmark. Our
dataset serves as a challenging new benchmark to facilitate robust and
generalizable deblurring models.

Result: USIS16K在多样性、复杂性和可扩展性上显著提升，为水下目标检测和USIS任务提供了基准数据。

Conclusion: USIS16K填补了水下显著实例分割领域的数据空白，为未来研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Inspired by the biological visual system that selectively allocates attention
to efficiently identify salient objects or regions, underwater salient instance
segmentation (USIS) aims to jointly address the problems of where to look
(saliency prediction) and what is there (instance segmentation) in underwater
scenarios. However, USIS remains an underexplored challenge due to the
inaccessibility and dynamic nature of underwater environments, as well as the
scarcity of large-scale, high-quality annotated datasets. In this paper, we
introduce USIS16K, a large-scale dataset comprising 16,151 high-resolution
underwater images collected from diverse environmental settings and covering
158 categories of underwater objects. Each image is annotated with high-quality
instance-level salient object masks, representing a significant advance in
terms of diversity, complexity, and scalability. Furthermore, we provide
benchmark evaluations on underwater object detection and USIS tasks using
USIS16K. To facilitate future research in this domain, the dataset and
benchmark models are publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地球系统数据集的规模快速增长，需要高效的压缩技术来处理这些数据。

Method: 利用标准视频编解码器（通过ffmpeg）压缩多通道时空数据集。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上实现了高压缩比（最高250x）和高PSNR值，且不影响下游深度学习任务性能。

Conclusion: xarrayvideo为地球科学社区提供了一种高效、实用的数据压缩解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale Earth system datasets, from high-resolution remote sensing
imagery to spatiotemporal climate model outputs, exhibit characteristics
analogous to those of standard videos. Their inherent spatial, temporal, and
spectral redundancies can thus be readily exploited by established video
compression techniques. Here, we present xarrayvideo, a Python library for
compressing multichannel spatiotemporal datasets by encoding them as videos.
Our approach achieves compression ratios of up to 250x while maintaining high
fidelity by leveraging standard, well-optimized video codecs through ffmpeg. We
demonstrate the library's effectiveness on four real-world multichannel
spatiotemporal datasets: DynamicEarthNet (very high resolution Planet images),
DeepExtremeCubes (high resolution Sentinel-2 images), ERA5 (weather reanalysis
data), and the SimpleS2 dataset (high resolution multichannel Sentinel-2
images), achieving Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratios (PSNRs) of 55.86, 40.60, 46.58,
and 43.23 dB at 0.1 bits per pixel per band (bpppb) and 65.91, 54.28, 62.90,
and 55.04 dB at 1 bpppb. We are redistributing two of these datasets,
DeepExtremeCubes (2.3 Tb) and DynamicEarthNet (525 Gb), in the
machine-learning-ready and cloud-ready TACO format through HuggingFace at
significantly reduced sizes (270 Gb and 8.5 Gb, respectively) without
compromising quality (PSNR 55.77-56.65 and 60.15). No performance loss is
observed when the compressed versions of these datasets are used in their
respective deep learning-based downstream tasks (next step reflectance
prediction and landcover segmentation). In conclusion, xarrayvideo presents an
efficient solution for handling the rapidly growing size of Earth observation
datasets, making advanced compression techniques accessible and practical to
the Earth science community. The library is available for use at

Abstract: Fisheye cameras offer robots the ability to capture human movements across a
wider field of view (FOV) than standard pinhole cameras, making them
particularly useful for applications in human-robot interaction and automotive
contexts. However, accurately detecting human poses in fisheye images is
challenging due to the curved distortions inherent to fisheye optics. While
various methods for undistorting fisheye images have been proposed, their
effectiveness and limitations for poses that cover a wide FOV has not been
systematically evaluated in the context of absolute human pose estimation from
monocular fisheye images. To address this gap, we evaluate the impact of
pinhole, equidistant and double sphere camera models, as well as cylindrical
projection methods, on 3D human pose estimation accuracy. We find that in
close-up scenarios, pinhole projection is inadequate, and the optimal
projection method varies with the FOV covered by the human pose. The usage of
advanced fisheye models like the double sphere model significantly enhances 3D
human pose estimation accuracy. We propose a heuristic for selecting the
appropriate projection model based on the detection bounding box to enhance
prediction quality. Additionally, we introduce and evaluate on our novel
dataset FISHnCHIPS, which features 3D human skeleton annotations in fisheye
images, including images from unconventional angles, such as extreme close-ups,
ground-mounted cameras, and wide-FOV poses, available at:

Conclusion: 该方法为血管造影合成提供了新思路和数据集，解决了数据不足和几何结构不准确的问题。

Abstract: Vascular diseases pose a significant threat to human health, with X-ray
angiography established as the gold standard for diagnosis, allowing for
detailed observation of blood vessels. However, angiographic X-rays expose
personnel and patients to higher radiation levels than non-angiographic X-rays,
which are unwanted. Thus, modality translation from non-angiographic to
angiographic X-rays is desirable. Data-driven deep approaches are hindered by
the lack of paired large-scale X-ray angiography datasets. While making
high-quality vascular angiography synthesis crucial, it remains challenging. We
find that current medical image synthesis primarily operates at pixel level and
struggles to adapt to the complex geometric structure of blood vessels,
resulting in unsatisfactory quality of blood vessel image synthesis, such as
disconnections or unnatural curvatures. To overcome this issue, we propose a
self-supervised method via diffusion models to transform non-angiographic
X-rays into angiographic X-rays, mitigating data shortages for data-driven
approaches. Our model comprises a diffusion model that learns the distribution
of vascular data from diffusion latent, a generator for vessel synthesis, and a
mask-based adversarial module. To enhance geometric accuracy, we propose a
parametric vascular model to fit the shape and distribution of blood vessels.
The proposed method contributes a pipeline and a synthetic dataset for X-ray
angiography. We conducted extensive comparative and ablation experiments to
evaluate the Angio-Diff. The results demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in synthetic angiography image quality and more
accurately synthesizes the geometric structure of blood vessels. The code is

Method: 使用改进的Residual U-Net，在GE Signa PET/MR的临床数据上训练，模拟移除50%探测器（保留25%响应线）。

Result: 模型成功恢复缺失数据，平均绝对误差低于每像素两个事件，优于2D插值，但重建图像细节稍显模糊。

Conclusion: 稀疏配置结合深度学习是传统PET设计的可行替代方案，有助于开发低成本全身PET扫描仪。

Abstract: Long axial field-of-view PET scanners offer increased field-of-view and
sensitivity compared to traditional PET scanners. However, a significant cost
is associated with the densely packed photodetectors required for the
extended-coverage systems, limiting clinical utilisation. To mitigate the cost
limitations, alternative sparse system configurations have been proposed,
allowing an extended field-of-view PET design with detector costs similar to a
standard PET system, albeit at the expense of image quality. In this work, we
propose a deep sinogram restoration network to fill in the missing sinogram
data. Our method utilises a modified Residual U-Net, trained on clinical PET
scans from a GE Signa PET/MR, simulating the removal of 50% of the detectors in
a chessboard pattern (retaining only 25% of all lines of response). The model
successfully recovers missing counts, with a mean absolute error below two
events per pixel, outperforming 2D interpolation in both sinogram and
reconstructed image domain. Notably, the predicted sinograms exhibit a
smoothing effect, leading to reconstructed images lacking sharpness in finer
details. Despite these limitations, the model demonstrates a substantial
capacity for compensating for the undersampling caused by the sparse detector
configuration. This proof-of-concept study suggests that sparse detector
configurations, combined with deep learning techniques, offer a viable
alternative to conventional PET scanner designs. This approach supports the
development of cost-effective, total body PET scanners, allowing a significant
step forward in medical imaging technology.

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate segmentation of both the pituitary gland and adenomas from
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for diagnosis and treatment of
pituitary adenomas. This systematic review evaluates automatic segmentation
methods for improving the accuracy and efficiency of MRI-based segmentation of
pituitary adenomas and the gland itself. Methods: We reviewed 34 studies that
employed automatic and semi-automatic segmentation methods. We extracted and
synthesized data on segmentation techniques and performance metrics (such as
Dice overlap scores). Results: The majority of reviewed studies utilized deep
learning approaches, with U-Net-based models being the most prevalent.
Automatic methods yielded Dice scores of 0.19--89.00\% for pituitary gland and
4.60--96.41\% for adenoma segmentation. Semi-automatic methods reported
80.00--92.10\% for pituitary gland and 75.90--88.36\% for adenoma segmentation.
Conclusion: Most studies did not report important metrics such as MR field
strength, age and adenoma size. Automated segmentation techniques such as
U-Net-based models show promise, especially for adenoma segmentation, but
further improvements are needed to achieve consistently good performance in
small structures like the normal pituitary gland. Continued innovation and
larger, diverse datasets are likely critical to enhancing clinical
applicability.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive derivation and implementation of the

rigorous mathematical derivation of the level set formulation, including
detailed treatment of each energy term using the divergence theorem and curve
evolution theory. The resulting algorithm is implemented in Python using finite
difference methods with special care to numerical stability, including an
upwind entropy scheme and curvature-based regularization. Experimental results
on medical and synthetic images demonstrate accurate segmentation, robustness

Abstract: Tissue deformation recovery based on stereo endoscopic images is crucial for
tool-tissue interaction analysis and benefits surgical navigation and
autonomous soft tissue manipulation. Previous research suffers from the
problems raised from camera motion, occlusion, large tissue deformation, lack
of tissue-specific biomechanical priors, and reliance on offline processing.
Unlike previous studies where the tissue geometry and deformation are
represented by 3D points and displacements, the proposed method models tissue
geometry as the 3D point and derivative map and tissue deformation as the 3D
displacement and local deformation map. For a single surface point, 6
parameters are used to describe its rigid motion and 3 parameters for its local
deformation. The method is formulated under the camera-centric setting, where
all motions are regarded as the scene motion with respect to the camera.
Inter-frame alignment is realized by optimizing the inter-frame deformation,
making it unnecessary to estimate camera pose. The concept of the canonical map
is introduced to optimize tissue geometry and deformation in an online
approach. Quantitative and qualitative experiments were conducted using in vivo
and ex vivo laparoscopic datasets. With the inputs of depth and optical flow,
the method stably models tissue geometry and deformation even when the tissue
is partially occluded or moving outside the field of view. Results show that
the 3D reconstruction accuracy in the non-occluded and occluded areas reaches
0.37$\pm$0.27 mm and 0.39$\pm$0.21 mm in terms of surface distance,
respectively. The method can also estimate surface strain distribution during
various manipulations as an extra modality for mechanical-based analysis.

Abstract: Existing micro aerial vehicle (MAV) detection methods mainly rely on the
target's appearance features in RGB images, whose diversity makes it difficult
to achieve generalized MAV detection. We notice that different types of MAVs
share the same distinctive features in event streams due to their high-speed
rotating propellers, which are hard to see in RGB images. This paper studies
how to detect different types of MAVs from an event camera by fully exploiting
the features of propellers in the original event stream. The proposed method
consists of three modules to extract the salient and spatio-temporal features
of the propellers while filtering out noise from background objects and camera
motion. Since there are no existing event-based MAV datasets, we introduce a
novel MAV dataset for the community. This is the first event-based MAV dataset
comprising multiple scenarios and different types of MAVs. Without training,
our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and can deal with
challenging scenarios, achieving a precision rate of 83.0\% (+30.3\%) and a
recall rate of 81.5\% (+36.4\%) on the proposed testing dataset. The dataset

Abstract: The organization and connectivity of the arcuate fasciculus (AF) in nonhuman
primates remain contentious, especially concerning how its anatomy diverges
from that of humans. Here, we combined cross-scale single-neuron tracing -
using viral-based genetic labeling and fluorescence micro-optical sectioning
tomography in macaques (n = 4; age 3 - 11 years) - with whole-brain
tractography from 11.7T diffusion MRI. Complemented by spectral embedding
analysis of 7.0T MRI in humans, we performed a comparative connectomic analysis
of the AF across species. We demonstrate that the macaque AF originates in the
temporal-parietal cortex, traverses the auditory cortex and parietal operculum,
and projects into prefrontal regions. In contrast, the human AF exhibits
greater expansion into the middle temporal gyrus and stronger prefrontal and
parietal operculum connectivity - divergences quantified by Kullback-Leibler
analysis that likely underpin the evolutionary specialization of human language
networks. These interspecies differences - particularly the human AF's broader
temporal integration and strengthened frontoparietal linkages - suggest a
connectivity-based substrate for the emergence of advanced language processing
unique to humans. Furthermore, our findings offer a neuroanatomical framework
for understanding AF-related disorders such as aphasia and dyslexia, where
aberrant connectivity disrupts language function.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly slow-thinking models, often
exhibit severe hallucination, outputting incorrect content due to an inability
to accurately recognize knowledge boundaries during reasoning. While
Reinforcement Learning (RL) can enhance complex reasoning abilities, its
outcome-oriented reward mechanism often lacks factual supervision over the
thinking process, further exacerbating the hallucination problem. To address
the high hallucination in slow-thinking models, we propose Knowledge-enhanced
RL, KnowRL. KnowRL guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by
integrating a factuality reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL
training process, helping them recognize their knowledge boundaries. KnowRL
guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by integrating a factuality
reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL training process, helping
them recognize their knowledge boundaries. This targeted factual input during
RL training enables the model to learn and internalize fact-based reasoning
strategies. By directly rewarding adherence to facts within the reasoning
steps, KnowRL fosters a more reliable thinking process. Experimental results on
three hallucination evaluation datasets and two reasoning evaluation datasets
demonstrate that KnowRL effectively mitigates hallucinations in slow-thinking
models while maintaining their original strong reasoning capabilities. Our code

Abstract: The recent work by Shojaee et al. (2025), titled The Illusion of Thinking:
Understanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models via the Lens of
Problem Complexity, presents a compelling empirical finding, a reasoning cliff,
where the performance of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) collapses beyond a
specific complexity threshold, which the authors posit as an intrinsic scaling
limitation of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. This commentary, while
acknowledging the study's methodological rigor, contends that this conclusion
is confounded by experimental artifacts. We argue that the observed failure is
not evidence of a fundamental cognitive boundary, but rather a predictable
outcome of system-level constraints in the static, text-only evaluation
paradigm, including tool use restrictions, context window recall issues, the
absence of crucial cognitive baselines, inadequate statistical reporting, and
output generation limits. We reframe this performance collapse through the lens
of an agentic gap, asserting that the models are not failing at reasoning, but
at execution within a profoundly restrictive interface. We empirically
substantiate this critique by demonstrating a striking reversal. A model,
initially declaring a puzzle impossible when confined to text-only generation,
now employs agentic tools to not only solve it but also master variations of
complexity far beyond the reasoning cliff it previously failed to surmount.
Additionally, our empirical analysis of tool-enabled models like o4-mini and
GPT-4o reveals a hierarchy of agentic reasoning, from simple procedural
execution to complex meta-cognitive self-correction, which has significant
implications for how we define and measure machine intelligence. The illusion
of thinking attributed to LRMs is less a reasoning deficit and more a
consequence of an otherwise capable mind lacking the tools for action.

Motivation: 研究LLMs在结合语言能力和推理能力的任务（如动态规则变化的游戏）中的表现，以评估其复杂问题解决能力。

Method: 评估六种LLMs在不同提示类型下的表现，并对两种模型（Mistral、OLMo）进行游戏数据和结构的调优。

Result: 大模型（如GPT-4o）表现更好，小模型和未调优模型在规则理解和应用上表现不佳；调优提升分析能力但对解题帮助有限。

Conclusion: 即使是先进或调优的LLMs，动态规则推理仍具挑战性，游戏适合测试LLMs的推理和反思能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to perform well on language tasks, but
struggle with reasoning tasks. This paper explores the ability of LLMs to play
the 2D puzzle game Baba is You, in which players manipulate rules by
rearranging text blocks that define object properties. Given that this
rule-manipulation relies on language abilities and reasoning, it is a
compelling challenge for LLMs. Six LLMs are evaluated using different prompt
types, including (1) simple, (2) rule-extended and (3) action-extended prompts.
In addition, two models (Mistral, OLMo) are finetuned using textual and
structural data from the game. Results show that while larger models
(particularly GPT-4o) perform better in reasoning and puzzle solving, smaller
unadapted models struggle to recognize game mechanics or apply rule changes.
Finetuning improves the ability to analyze the game levels, but does not
significantly improve solution formulation. We conclude that even for
state-of-the-art and finetuned LLMs, reasoning about dynamic rule changes is
difficult (specifically, understanding the use-mention distinction). The
results provide insights into the applicability of LLMs to complex
problem-solving tasks and highlight the suitability of games with dynamically
changing rules for testing reasoning and reflection by LLMs.

Motivation: 现有方法在复杂工具链编排中存在单路径执行、错误恢复差和搜索空间爆炸的问题，NaviAgent旨在解决这些限制。

Method: 采用双层架构：Multi-Path Decider动态选择最优动作，Graph-Encoded Navigator通过工具依赖异构图和启发式搜索优化工具链编排。

Result: 在多个基础模型上，NaviAgent的任务成功率显著优于基线方法（最高提升19%），并在效率与质量间取得平衡。

Conclusion: NaviAgent通过图导航和动态规划显著提升了LLM在复杂工具链编排中的表现，尤其适用于大规模和未见工具组合场景。

Abstract: LLMs' reliance on static knowledge and fragile tool invocation severely
hinders the orchestration of complex, heterogeneous toolchains, particularly at
large scales. Existing methods typically use rigid single-path execution,
resulting in poor error recovery and exponentially growing search spaces. We
introduce NaviAgent, a graph-navigated bilevel planning architecture for robust
function calling, comprising a Multi-Path Decider and Graph-Encoded Navigator.
As an LLM-powered agent, the Multi-Path Decider defines a four-dimensional
decision space and continuously perceives environmental states, dynamically
selecting the optimal action to fully cover all tool invocation scenarios. The
Graph-Encoded Navigator constructs a Tool Dependency Heterogeneous Graph
(TDHG), where node embeddings explicitly fuse API schema structure with
historical invocation behavior. It also integrates a novel heuristic search
strategy that guides the Decider toward efficient and highly successful
toolchains, even for unseen tool combinations. Experiments show that NaviAgent
consistently achieves the highest task success rate (TSR) across all foundation
models and task complexities, outperforming the average baselines (ReAct,
ToolLLM, {\alpha}-UMI) by 13.5%, 16.4%, and 19.0% on Qwen2.5-14B, Qwen2.5-32B,
and Deepseek-V3, respectively. Its execution steps are typically within one
step of the most efficient baseline, ensuring a strong balance between quality
and efficiency. Notably, a fine-tuned Qwen2.5-14B model achieves a TSR of
49.5%, surpassing the much larger 32B model (44.9%) under our architecture.
Incorporating the Graph-Encoded Navigator further boosts TSR by an average of
2.4 points, with gains up over 9 points on complex tasks for larger models
(Deepseek-V3 and GPT-4o), highlighting its essential role in toolchain
orchestration.

Motivation: 研究人类和动物快速适应新环境的能力，探索标准强化学习算法无法捕捉的机制，尤其是通过Transformer的键值架构模拟大脑的片段记忆系统。

Method: 训练一个Transformer模型在分布式的规划任务中进行上下文强化学习，分析其学习算法和表征。

Result: 模型通过缓存中间计算和跨上下文对齐支持快速学习，其表征与大脑的海马-内嗅系统相似，学习策略不同于标准的无模型或基于模型的规划。

Conclusion: 内存可作为计算资源存储经验和缓存计算，支持灵活行为，研究为人工和自然环境中的快速适应提供了机制假设。

Abstract: Humans and animals show remarkable learning efficiency, adapting to new
environments with minimal experience. This capability is not well captured by
standard reinforcement learning algorithms that rely on incremental value
updates. Rapid adaptation likely depends on episodic memory -- the ability to
retrieve specific past experiences to guide decisions in novel contexts.
Transformers provide a useful setting for studying these questions because of
their ability to learn rapidly in-context and because their key-value
architecture resembles episodic memory systems in the brain. We train a
transformer to in-context reinforcement learn in a distribution of planning
tasks inspired by rodent behavior. We then characterize the learning algorithms
that emerge in the model. We first find that representation learning is
supported by in-context structure learning and cross-context alignment, where
representations are aligned across environments with different sensory stimuli.
We next demonstrate that the reinforcement learning strategies developed by the
model are not interpretable as standard model-free or model-based planning.
Instead, we show that in-context reinforcement learning is supported by caching
intermediate computations within the model's memory tokens, which are then
accessed at decision time. Overall, we find that memory may serve as a
computational resource, storing both raw experience and cached computations to
support flexible behavior. Furthermore, the representations developed in the
model resemble computations associated with the hippocampal-entorhinal system
in the brain, suggesting that our findings may be relevant for natural
cognition. Taken together, our work offers a mechanistic hypothesis for the
rapid adaptation that underlies in-context learning in artificial and natural
settings.

Abstract: Query rewriting is pivotal for enhancing dense retrieval, yet current methods
demand large-scale supervised data or suffer from inefficient reinforcement
learning (RL) exploration. In this work, we first establish that guiding Large
Language Models (LLMs) with a concise set of expert-crafted strategies, such as
semantic expansion and entity disambiguation, substantially improves retrieval
effectiveness on challenging benchmarks, including HotpotQA, FEVER, NFCorpus,
and SciFact. Building on this insight, we introduce the Strategy-Adaptive
Generation Engine (SAGE), which operationalizes these strategies in an RL
framework. SAGE introduces two novel reward shaping mechanisms-Strategic Credit
Shaping (SCS) and Contrastive Reward Shaping (CRS)-to deliver more informative
learning signals. This strategy-guided approach not only achieves new
state-of-the-art NDCG@10 results, but also uncovers a compelling emergent
behavior: the agent learns to select optimal strategies, reduces unnecessary
exploration, and generates concise rewrites, lowering inference cost without
sacrificing performance. Our findings demonstrate that strategy-guided RL,
enhanced with nuanced reward shaping, offers a scalable, efficient, and more
interpretable paradigm for developing the next generation of robust information
retrieval systems.

Result: 在LoCoMo基准测试中，混合框架（GPT-4o + Llama-3.2-1B）比单独使用GPT-4o性能提升7.1个百分点。

Conclusion: 该框架为在保护隐私的同时利用强大LLM提供了初步解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as personal agents,
accessing sensitive user data such as calendars, emails, and medical records.
Users currently face a trade-off: They can send private records, many of which
are stored in remote databases, to powerful but untrusted LLM providers,
increasing their exposure risk. Alternatively, they can run less powerful
models locally on trusted devices. We bridge this gap. Our Socratic
Chain-of-Thought Reasoning first sends a generic, non-private user query to a
powerful, untrusted LLM, which generates a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt and
detailed sub-queries without accessing user data. Next, we embed these
sub-queries and perform encrypted sub-second semantic search using our
Homomorphically Encrypted Vector Database across one million entries of a
single user's private data. This represents a realistic scale of personal
documents, emails, and records accumulated over years of digital activity.
Finally, we feed the CoT prompt and the decrypted records to a local language
model and generate the final response. On the LoCoMo long-context QA benchmark,
our hybrid framework, combining GPT-4o with a local Llama-3.2-1B model,
outperforms using GPT-4o alone by up to 7.1 percentage points. This
demonstrates a first step toward systems where tasks are decomposed and split
between untrusted strong LLMs and weak local ones, preserving user privacy.

its integration brings immense benefits, it also introduces significant risks,
including those arising from AI misuse. Within the discourse on managing these
risks, the terms "AI Safety" and "AI Security" are often used, sometimes

demystify the distinction and delineate the precise research boundaries between
AI Safety and AI Security. We provide rigorous definitions, outline their
respective research focuses, and explore their interdependency, including how
security breaches can precipitate safety failures and vice versa. Using clear
analogies from message transmission and building construction, we illustrate

Abstract: Prompt injection threatens novel applications that emerge from adapting LLMs
for various user tasks. The newly developed LLM-based software applications
become more ubiquitous and diverse. However, the threat of prompt injection
attacks undermines the security of these systems as the mitigation and defenses
against them, proposed so far, are insufficient. We investigated the
capabilities of early prompt injection detection systems, focusing specifically
on the detection performance of techniques implemented in various open-source
solutions. These solutions are supposed to detect certain types of prompt
injection attacks, including the prompt leak. In prompt leakage attacks, an
attacker maliciously manipulates the LLM into outputting its system
instructions, violating the system's confidentiality. Our study presents
analyzes of distinct prompt leakage detection techniques, and a comparative
analysis of several detection solutions, which implement those techniques. We
identify the strengths and weaknesses of these techniques and elaborate on
their optimal configuration and usage in high-stake deployments. In one of the
first studies on existing prompt leak detection solutions, we compared the
performances of LLM Guard, Vigil, and Rebuff. We concluded that the
implementations of canary word checks in Vigil and Rebuff were not effective at
detecting prompt leak attacks, and we proposed improvements for them. We also
found an evasion weakness in Rebuff's secondary model-based technique and
proposed a mitigation. Then, the result of the comparison of LLM Guard, Vigil,
and Rebuff at their peak performance revealed that Vigil is optimal for cases
when minimal false positive rate is required, and Rebuff is the most optimal
for average needs.

Result: Achieves 92.69% accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 20.06%.

Conclusion: PrivacyXray provides a stable and practical solution for detecting privacy breaches in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in sensitive domains, including
healthcare, finance, and legal services, raising concerns about potential
private information leaks during inference. Privacy extraction attacks, such as
jailbreaking, expose vulnerabilities in LLMs by crafting inputs that force the
models to output sensitive information. However, these attacks cannot verify
whether the extracted private information is accurate, as no public datasets
exist for cross-validation, leaving a critical gap in private information
detection during inference. To address this, we propose PrivacyXray, a novel
framework detecting privacy breaches by analyzing LLM inner states. Our
analysis reveals that LLMs exhibit higher semantic coherence and probabilistic
certainty when generating correct private outputs. Based on this, PrivacyXray
detects privacy breaches using four metrics: intra-layer and inter-layer
semantic similarity, token-level and sentence-level probability distributions.
PrivacyXray addresses critical challenges in private information detection by
overcoming the lack of open-source private datasets and eliminating reliance on
external data for validation. It achieves this through the synthesis of
realistic private data and a detection mechanism based on the inner states of
LLMs. Experiments show that PrivacyXray achieves consistent performance, with
an average accuracy of 92.69% across five LLMs. Compared to state-of-the-art
methods, PrivacyXray achieves significant improvements, with an average
accuracy increase of 20.06%, highlighting its stability and practical utility
in real-world applications.

Abstract: Strategic randomization is a key principle in game theory, yet it remains
underexplored in large language models (LLMs). Prior work often conflates the
cognitive decision to randomize with the mechanical generation of randomness,
leading to incomplete evaluations. To address this, we propose a novel zero-sum
game inspired by the Tian Ji Horse Race, where the Nash equilibrium corresponds
to a maximal entropy strategy. The game's complexity masks this property from
untrained humans and underdeveloped LLMs. We evaluate five LLMs across prompt
styles -- framed, neutral, and hinted -- using competitive multi-tournament
gameplay with system-provided random choices, isolating the decision to
randomize. Results show that weaker models remain deterministic regardless of
prompts, while stronger models exhibit increased randomization under explicit
hints. When facing weaker models, strong LLMs adopt deterministic strategies to
exploit biases, but converge toward equilibrium play when facing peers. Through
win/loss outcomes and Bayes factor analysis, we demonstrate meaningful
variation in LLMs' strategic reasoning capabilities, highlighting opportunities
for improvement in abstract reasoning and adaptive learning. We make our
implementation publicly available at

Abstract: We present CID-GraphRAG (Conversational Intent-Driven Graph Retrieval
Augmented Generation), a novel framework that addresses the limitations of
existing dialogue systems in maintaining both contextual coherence and
goal-oriented progression in multi-turn customer service conversations. Unlike
traditional RAG systems that rely solely on semantic similarity (Conversation
RAG) or standard knowledge graphs (GraphRAG), CID-GraphRAG constructs dynamic
intent transition graphs from goal achieved historical dialogues and implements
a dual-retrieval mechanism that adaptively balances intent-based graph
traversal with semantic search. This approach enables the system to
simultaneously leverage both conversional intent flow patterns and contextual
semantics, significantly improving retrieval quality and response quality. In
extensive experiments on real-world customer service dialogues, we employ both
automatic metrics and LLM-as-judge assessments, demonstrating that CID-GraphRAG
significantly outperforms both semantic-based Conversation RAG and intent-based
GraphRAG baselines across all evaluation criteria. Quantitatively, CID-GraphRAG
demonstrates substantial improvements over Conversation RAG across automatic
metrics, with relative gains of 11% in BLEU, 5% in ROUGE-L, 6% in METEOR, and
most notably, a 58% improvement in response quality according to LLM-as-judge
evaluations. These results demonstrate that the integration of intent
transition structures with semantic retrieval creates a synergistic effect that
neither approach achieves independently, establishing CID-GraphRAG as an
effective framework for addressing the challenges of maintaining contextual
coherence and goal-oriented progression in knowledge-intensive multi-turn
dialogues.

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm understanding is a high-order cognitive task. Although
large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on many
downstream NLP tasks, growing evidence suggests that they struggle with sarcasm
understanding. In this paper, we propose Commander-GPT, a modular decision
routing framework inspired by military command theory. Rather than relying on a
single LLM's capability, Commander-GPT orchestrates a team of specialized LLM
agents where each agent will be selectively assigned to a focused sub-task such
as context modeling, sentiment analysis, etc. Their outputs are then routed
back to the commander, which integrates the information and performs the final
sarcasm judgment. To coordinate these agents, we introduce three types of
centralized commanders: (1) a trained lightweight encoder-based commander
(e.g., multi-modal BERT); (2) four small autoregressive language models,
serving as moderately capable commanders (e.g., DeepSeek-VL); (3) two large
LLM-based commander (Gemini Pro and GPT-4o) that performs task routing, output
aggregation, and sarcasm decision-making in a zero-shot fashion. We evaluate
Commander-GPT on the MMSD and MMSD 2.0 benchmarks, comparing five prompting
strategies. Experimental results show that our framework achieves 4.4% and

upstream agents, enabling adaptation to novel attributes and constraints

Motivation: 现有提示学习方法在跨域任务增量学习中表现不足，且缺乏跨模态信息交换。ChordPrompt旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 引入跨模态提示和多域自适应文本提示，利用视觉与文本信息的交互。

Result: 在零样本泛化和下游任务性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ChordPrompt有效提升了视觉语言模型在持续学习中的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) empowers pre-trained vision-language models to adapt
effectively to novel or previously underrepresented data distributions without
comprehensive retraining, enhancing their adaptability and efficiency. While
vision-language models like CLIP show great promise, they struggle to maintain
performance across domains in incremental learning scenarios. Existing prompt
learning methods face two main limitations: 1) they primarily focus on
class-incremental learning scenarios, lacking specific strategies for
multi-domain task incremental learning; 2) most current approaches employ
single-modal prompts, neglecting the potential benefits of cross-modal
information exchange. To address these challenges, we propose the \ChordPrompt
framework, which facilitates a harmonious interplay between visual and textual
prompts. \ChordPrompt introduces cross-modal prompts to leverage interactions
between visual and textual information. Our approach also employs
domain-adaptive text prompts to select appropriate prompts for continual
adaptation across multiple domains. Comprehensive experiments on multi-domain
incremental learning benchmarks demonstrate that \ChordPrompt outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot generalization and downstream task
performance.

Abstract: Medical document analysis plays a crucial role in extracting essential
clinical insights from unstructured healthcare records, supporting critical
tasks such as differential diagnosis. Determining the most probable condition
among overlapping symptoms requires precise evaluation and deep medical
expertise. While recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have
significantly enhanced performance in medical document analysis, privacy
concerns related to sensitive patient data limit the use of online LLMs
services in clinical settings. To address these challenges, we propose a
trustworthy medical document analysis platform that fine-tunes a LLaMA-v3 using
low-rank adaptation, specifically optimized for differential diagnosis tasks.
Our approach utilizes DDXPlus, the largest benchmark dataset for differential
diagnosis, and demonstrates superior performance in pathology prediction and
variable-length differential diagnosis compared to existing methods. The
developed web-based platform allows users to submit their own unstructured
medical documents and receive accurate, explainable diagnostic results. By
incorporating advanced explainability techniques, the system ensures
transparent and reliable predictions, fostering user trust and confidence.
Extensive evaluations confirm that the proposed method surpasses current
state-of-the-art models in predictive accuracy while offering practical utility
in clinical settings. This work addresses the urgent need for reliable,
explainable, and privacy-preserving artificial intelligence solutions,
representing a significant advancement in intelligent medical document analysis
for real-world healthcare applications. The code can be found at

Abstract: With the proliferation of large language model (LLM) applications since 2022,
their use in education has sparked both excitement and concern. Recent studies
consistently highlight students' (mis)use of LLMs can hinder learning outcomes.
This work aims to teach students how to effectively prompt LLMs to improve
their learning. We first proposed pedagogical prompting, a
theoretically-grounded new concept to elicit learning-oriented responses from
LLMs. To move from concept design to a proof-of-concept learning intervention
in real educational settings, we selected early undergraduate CS education
(CS1/CS2) as the example context. We began with a formative survey study with
instructors (N=36) teaching early-stage undergraduate-level CS courses to
inform the instructional design based on classroom needs. Based on their
insights, we designed and developed a learning intervention through an
interactive system with scenario-based instruction to train pedagogical
prompting skills. Finally, we evaluated its instructional effectiveness through
a user study with CS novice students (N=22) using pre/post-tests. Through mixed
methods analyses, our results indicate significant improvements in learners'
LLM-based pedagogical help-seeking skills, along with positive attitudes toward
the system and increased willingness to use pedagogical prompts in the future.
Our contributions include (1) a theoretical framework of pedagogical prompting;
(2) empirical insights into current instructor attitudes toward pedagogical
prompting; and (3) a learning intervention design with an interactive learning
tool and scenario-based instruction leading to promising results on teaching
LLM-based help-seeking. Our approach is scalable for broader implementation in
classrooms and has the potential to be integrated into tools like ChatGPT as an
on-boarding experience to encourage learning-oriented use of generative AI.

Abstract: We introduce a mathematically rigorous framework for an artificial
intelligence system composed of probabilistic agents evolving through
structured competition and belief revision. The architecture, grounded in
Bayesian inference, measure theory, and population dynamics, defines agent
fitness as a function of alignment with a fixed external oracle representing
ground truth. Agents compete in a discrete-time environment, adjusting
posterior beliefs through observed outcomes, with higher-rated agents
reproducing and lower-rated agents undergoing extinction. Ratings are updated
via pairwise truth-aligned utility comparisons, and belief updates preserve
measurable consistency and stochastic convergence. We introduce hash-based
cryptographic identity commitments to ensure traceability, alongside causal
inference operators using do-calculus. Formal theorems on convergence,
robustness, and evolutionary stability are provided. The system establishes
truth as an evolutionary attractor, demonstrating that verifiable knowledge
arises from adversarial epistemic pressure within a computable, self-regulating

Method: 提出增量式自动化数据整理流程，生成大规模SWE数据集，并用于微调Skywork-SWE模型。

Conclusion: 数据规模对LLM性能有持续提升作用，Skywork-SWE模型在软件工程任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Software engineering (SWE) has recently emerged as a crucial testbed for
next-generation LLM agents, demanding inherent capabilities in two critical
dimensions: sustained iterative problem-solving (e.g., >50 interaction rounds)
and long-context dependency resolution (e.g., >32k tokens). However, the data
curation process in SWE remains notoriously time-consuming, as it heavily
relies on manual annotation for code file filtering and the setup of dedicated
runtime environments to execute and validate unit tests. Consequently, most
existing datasets are limited to only a few thousand GitHub-sourced instances.
To this end, we propose an incremental, automated data-curation pipeline that
systematically scales both the volume and diversity of SWE datasets. Our
dataset comprises 10,169 real-world Python task instances from 2,531 distinct
GitHub repositories, each accompanied by a task specified in natural language
and a dedicated runtime-environment image for automated unit-test validation.
We have carefully curated over 8,000 successfully runtime-validated training
trajectories from our proposed SWE dataset. When fine-tuning the Skywork-SWE
model on these trajectories, we uncover a striking data scaling phenomenon: the
trained model's performance for software engineering capabilities in LLMs
continues to improve as the data size increases, showing no signs of
saturation. Notably, our Skywork-SWE model achieves 38.0% pass@1 accuracy on
the SWE-bench Verified benchmark without using verifiers or multiple rollouts,
establishing a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) among the Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-based
LLMs built on the OpenHands agent framework. Furthermore, with the
incorporation of test-time scaling techniques, the performance further improves
to 47.0% accuracy, surpassing the previous SOTA results for sub-32B parameter
models. We release the Skywork-SWE-32B model checkpoint to accelerate future
research.

Abstract: A KG represents a network of entities and illustrates relationships between
them. KGs are used for various applications, including semantic search and
discovery, reasoning, decision-making, natural language processing, machine
learning, and recommendation systems. Triple (subject-relation-object)
extraction from text is the fundamental building block of KG construction and
has been widely studied, for example, in early benchmarks such as ACE 2002 to
more recent ones, such as WebNLG 2020, REBEL and SynthIE. While the use of LLMs
is explored for KG construction, handcrafting reasonable task-specific prompts
for LLMs is a labour-intensive exercise and can be brittle due to subtle
changes in the LLM models employed. Recent work in NLP tasks (e.g. autonomy
generation) uses automatic prompt optimization/engineering to address this
challenge by generating optimal or near-optimal task-specific prompts given
input-output examples.
  This empirical study explores the application of automatic prompt
optimization for the triple extraction task using experimental benchmarking. We
evaluate different settings by changing (a) the prompting strategy, (b) the LLM
being used for prompt optimization and task execution, (c) the number of
canonical relations in the schema (schema complexity), (d) the length and
diversity of input text, (e) the metric used to drive the prompt optimization,
and (f) the dataset being used for training and testing. We evaluate three
different automatic prompt optimizers, namely, DSPy, APE, and TextGrad and use
two different triple extraction datasets, SynthIE and REBEL. Through rigorous
empirical evaluation, our main contribution highlights that automatic prompt
optimization techniques can generate reasonable prompts similar to humans for
triple extraction. In turn, these optimized prompts achieve improved results,
particularly with increasing schema complexity and text size.

Conclusion: SimBelief通过任务信念相似性显著提升了元强化学习在稀疏奖励环境中的性能。

Abstract: Meta-reinforcement learning requires utilizing prior task distribution
information obtained during exploration to rapidly adapt to unknown tasks. The
efficiency of an agent's exploration hinges on accurately identifying the
current task. Recent Bayes-Adaptive Deep RL approaches often rely on
reconstructing the environment's reward signal, which is challenging in sparse
reward settings, leading to suboptimal exploitation. Inspired by bisimulation
metrics, which robustly extracts behavioral similarity in continuous MDPs, we
propose SimBelief-a novel meta-RL framework via measuring similarity of task
belief in Bayes-Adaptive MDP (BAMDP). SimBelief effectively extracts common
features of similar task distributions, enabling efficient task identification
and exploration in sparse reward environments. We introduce latent task belief
metric to learn the common structure of similar tasks and incorporate it into
the specific task belief. By learning the latent dynamics across task
distributions, we connect shared latent task belief features with specific task
features, facilitating rapid task identification and adaptation. Our method
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on sparse reward MuJoCo and panda-gym
tasks.

Abstract: Resolution of complex SQL issues persists as a significant bottleneck in
real-world database applications. Current Large Language Models (LLMs), while
adept at text-to-SQL translation, have not been rigorously evaluated on the
more challenging task of debugging SQL issues. To address this gap, we
introduce BIRD-CRITIC, a new SQL issue debugging benchmark comprising 530
PostgreSQL tasks (BIRD-CRITIC-PG) and 570 multi-dialect tasks
(BIRD-CRITIC-Multi), distilled from authentic user issues and replayed within
new environments to facilitate rigorous evaluation. Baseline evaluations
underscore the task's complexity, with the leading reasoning model O3-Mini
achieving only 38.87% success rate on BIRD-CRITIC-PG and 33.33% on
BIRD-CRITIC-Multi. Meanwhile, advancing open-source models for database tasks
is crucial for empowering local development while safeguarding data privacy.
Therefore, we present Six-Gym (Sql-fIX-Gym), a training environment for
elevating open-source model capabilities for SQL issue debugging. This
environment leverages SQL-Rewind strategy, which automatically generates
executable issue-solution datasets by reverse-engineering issues from verified
SQLs. However, popular trajectory-based fine-tuning methods do not explore
substantial supervisory signals. We further propose f-Plan Boosting, which
extracts high-level debugging plans from SQL solutions, enabling teacher LLMs
to produce 73.7% more successful trajectories for training. We integrate these
components into an open-source agent, Bird-Fixer. Based on Qwen-2.5-Coder-14B,
Bird-Fixer achieves 38.11% success rate on BIRD-CRITIC-PG and 29.65% on
BIRD-CRITIC-Multi, surpassing leading proprietary models such as

Conclusion: JoyAgents-R1为异构多智能体训练提供了一种高效且稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a prominent paradigm
for increasingly complex tasks. However, joint evolution across heterogeneous
agents remains challenging due to cooperative inefficiency and training
instability. In this paper, we propose the joint evolution dynamics for MARL
called JoyAgents-R1, which first applies Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to the joint training of heterogeneous multi-agents. By iteratively
refining agents' large language models (LLMs) and memories, the method achieves
holistic equilibrium with optimal decision-making and memory capabilities.
Specifically, JoyAgents-R1 first implements node-wise Monte Carlo sampling on
the behavior of each agent across entire reasoning trajectories to enhance GRPO
sampling efficiency while maintaining policy diversity. Then, our marginal
benefit-driven selection strategy identifies top-$K$ sampling groups with
maximal reward fluctuations, enabling targeted agent model updates that improve
training stability and maximize joint benefits through cost-effective parameter
adjustments. Meanwhile, JoyAgents-R1 introduces an adaptive memory evolution
mechanism that repurposes GRPO rewards as cost-free supervisory signals to
eliminate repetitive reasoning and accelerate convergence. Experiments across
general and domain-specific scenarios demonstrate that JoyAgents-R1 achieves
performance comparable to that of larger LLMs while built on smaller
open-source models.

Abstract: Traditional mental health support systems often generate responses based
solely on the user's current emotion and situations, resulting in superficial
interventions that fail to address deeper emotional needs. This study
introduces a novel framework by integrating spiritual wisdom from the Bhagavad
Gita with advanced large language model GPT-4o to enhance emotional well-being.
We present the GITes (Gita Integrated Therapy for Emotional Support) dataset,
which enhances the existing ExTES mental health dataset by including 10,729
spiritually guided responses generated by GPT-4o and evaluated by domain
experts. We benchmark GITes against 12 state-of-the-art LLMs, including both
mental health specific and general purpose models. To evaluate spiritual
relevance in generated responses beyond what conventional n-gram based metrics
capture, we propose a novel Spiritual Insight metric and automate assessment
via an LLM as jury framework using chain-of-thought prompting. Integrating
spiritual guidance into AI driven support enhances both NLP and spiritual
metrics for the best performing LLM Phi3-Mini 3.2B Instruct, achieving
improvements of 122.71% in ROUGE, 126.53% in METEOR, 8.15% in BERT score,
15.92% in Spiritual Insight, 18.61% in Sufficiency and 13.22% in Relevance
compared to its zero-shot counterpart. While these results reflect substantial
improvements across automated empathy and spirituality metrics, further

Abstract: Traditional recommendation systems often grapple with "filter bubbles",
underutilization of external knowledge, and a disconnect between model
optimization and business policy iteration. To address these limitations, this
paper introduces RecLLM-R1, a novel recommendation framework leveraging Large
Language Models (LLMs) and drawing inspiration from the DeepSeek R1
methodology. The framework initiates by transforming user profiles, historical
interactions, and multi-faceted item attributes into LLM-interpretable natural
language prompts through a carefully engineered data construction process.
Subsequently, a two-stage training paradigm is employed: the initial stage
involves Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to imbue the LLM with fundamental
recommendation capabilities. The subsequent stage utilizes Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning technique, augmented with
a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism. This stage guides the model through
multi-step reasoning and holistic decision-making via a flexibly defined reward
function, aiming to concurrently optimize recommendation accuracy, diversity,
and other bespoke business objectives. Empirical evaluations on a real-world
user behavior dataset from a large-scale social media platform demonstrate that
RecLLM-R1 significantly surpasses existing baseline methods across a spectrum

effectively mitigates the filter bubble effect and presents a promising avenue

Abstract: In English education tutoring, teacher feedback is essential for guiding

however, these systems require high-quality and large-scale teacher feedback
data, which is both time-consuming and costly to generate manually. In this
study, we propose FEAT, a cost-effective framework for generating teacher
feedback, and have constructed three complementary datasets: (1) DIRECT-Manual

generate high-quality teacher feedback, albeit at a higher cost; (2)
DIRECT-Generated (DG), an LLM-only generated, cost-effective dataset with lower
quality;, and (3) DIRECT-Augmented (DA), primarily based on DG with a small
portion of DM added to enhance quality while maintaining cost-efficiency.
Experimental results showed that incorporating a small portion of DM (5-10%)
into DG leads to superior performance compared to using 100% DM alone.

predictive power of ML models. This paper proposes a hybrid approach that
integrates ASP-derived rules from the FOLD-R++ algorithm with black-box ML
classifiers to selectively correct uncertain predictions and provide
human-readable explanations. Experiments on five medical datasets reveal
statistically significant performance gains in accuracy and F1 score. This

Method: 通过提供研究论文、部分代码掩码和实验命令，要求代理生成缺失代码并运行实验，难度随缺失函数数量增加。

Result: 性能随缺失函数数量增加迅速下降，动态交互代理优于固定代理，单次与多次尝试成功率差距显著。

Conclusion: AutoExperiment为评估AI驱动的科学实验进展提供了新基准，突出了长代码生成和自主实验执行的关键挑战。

Abstract: Recent progress in autonomous code generation has fueled excitement around AI
agents capable of accelerating scientific discovery by running experiments.
However, there is currently no benchmark that evaluates whether such agents can
implement scientific ideas when given varied amounts of code as a starting
point, interpolating between reproduction (running code) and from-scratch
replication (fully re-implementing and running code). We introduce
AutoExperiment, a benchmark that evaluates AI agents' ability to implement and
run machine learning experiments based on natural language descriptions in
research papers. In each task, agents are given a research paper, a codebase
with key functions masked out, and a command to run the experiment. The goal is
to generate the missing code, execute the experiment in a sandboxed
environment, and reproduce the results. AutoExperiment scales in difficulty by
varying the number of missing functions $n$, ranging from partial reproduction
to full replication. We evaluate state-of-the-art agents and find that
performance degrades rapidly as $n$ increases. Agents that can dynamically
interact with the environment (e.g. to debug their code) can outperform agents
in fixed "agentless" harnesses, and there exists a significant gap between
single-shot and multi-trial success rates (Pass@1 vs. Pass@5), motivating
verifier approaches to our benchmark. Our findings highlight critical
challenges in long-horizon code generation, context retrieval, and autonomous
experiment execution, establishing AutoExperiment as a new benchmark for
evaluating progress in AI-driven scientific experimentation. Our data and code
are open-sourced at https://github.com/j1mk1m/AutoExperiment .

### [187] [Alleviating User-Sensitive bias with Fair Generative Sequential Recommendation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19777)
*Yang Liu,Feng Wu,Xuefang Zhu*

Main category: cs.IR

Relevance: 60.0

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于扩散模型（DM）的公平生成序列推荐模型FairGENRec，旨在解决推荐系统中的公平性问题。通过注入随机噪声和多兴趣表示信息，模型在训练和推理阶段分别实现了对推荐公平性和多样性的增强。实验证明FairGENRec在准确性和公平性上均有提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中，推荐系统容易因用户行为模式与敏感特征（如性别、年龄）的强相关性而导致不公平。扩散模型因其对不确定性和多样性的建模能力，适合用于解决这一问题。

Method: 在训练阶段，通过敏感特征识别模型注入随机噪声，并设计序列去噪模型进行反向重构；在推理阶段，利用历史交互生成噪声并反向迭代重构目标项表示。同时注入消除敏感特征偏见的多元兴趣表示信息。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验表明，FairGENRec在准确性和公平性上均有显著提升，并通过统计分析可视化公平性改进程度。

Conclusion: FairGENRec通过扩散模型有效建模推荐公平性并增强多样性，为推荐系统的公平性问题提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Recommendation fairness has recently attracted much attention. In the real
world, recommendation systems are driven by user behavior, and since users with
the same sensitive feature (e.g., gender and age) tend to have the same
patterns, recommendation models can easily capture the strong correlation
preference of sensitive features and thus cause recommendation unfairness.
Diffusion model (DM) as a new generative model paradigm has achieved great
success in recommendation systems. DM's ability to model uncertainty and
represent diversity, and its modeling mechanism has a high degree of
adaptability with the real-world recommendation process with bias. Therefore,
we use DM to effectively model the fairness of recommendation and enhance the
diversity. This paper proposes a FairGENerative sequential Recommendation model
based on DM, FairGENRec. In the training phase, we inject random noise into the
original distribution under the guidance of the sensitive feature recognition
model, and a sequential denoise model is designed for the reverse
reconstruction of items. Simultaneously, recommendation fairness modeling is
completed by injecting multi-interests representational information that
eliminates the bias of sensitive user features into the generated results. In
the inference phase, the model obtains the noise in the form of noise addition
by using the history interactions which is followed by reverse iteration to
reconstruct the target item representation. Finally, our extensive experiments
on three datasets demonstrate the dual enhancement effect of FairGENRec on
accuracy and fairness, while the statistical analysis of the cases visualizes
the degree of improvement on the fairness of the recommendation.

Conclusion: 通信信号在代理群体中促进文化形成和传递，协调行为对群体效率有积极影响。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate how autonomous agents, organized into tribes,
learn to use communication signals to coordinate their activities and enhance
their collective efficiency. Using the NEC-DAC (Neurally Encoded Culture -
Distributed Autonomous Communicators) system, where each agent is equipped with
its own neural network for decision-making, we demonstrate how these agents
develop a shared behavioral system -- akin to a culture -- through learning and
signalling. Our research focuses on the self-organization of culture within
these tribes of agents and how varying communication strategies impact their
fitness and cooperation. By analyzing different social structures, such as
authority hierarchies, we show that the culture of cooperation significantly
influences the tribe's performance. Furthermore, we explore how signals not
only facilitate the emergence of culture but also enable its transmission
across generations of agents. Additionally, we examine the benefits of
coordinating behavior and signaling within individual agents' neural networks.

Abstract: We present an application of a foundation model for small- to medium-sized
tabular data (TabPFN), to sub-national yield forecasting task in South Africa.
TabPFN has recently demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional
machine learning (ML) models in various regression and classification tasks. We
used the dekadal (10-days) time series of Earth Observation (EO; FAPAR and soil
moisture) and gridded weather data (air temperature, precipitation and
radiation) to forecast the yield of summer crops at the sub-national level. The
crop yield data was available for 23 years and for up to 8 provinces. Covariate
variables for TabPFN (i.e., EO and weather) were extracted by region and
aggregated at a monthly scale. We benchmarked the results of the TabPFN against
six ML models and three baseline models. Leave-one-year-out cross-validation
experiment setting was used in order to ensure the assessment of the models
capacity to forecast an unseen year. Results showed that TabPFN and ML models
exhibit comparable accuracy, outperforming the baselines. Nonetheless, TabPFN
demonstrated superior practical utility due to its significantly faster tuning
time and reduced requirement for feature engineering. This renders TabPFN a
more viable option for real-world operation yield forecasting applications,
where efficiency and ease of implementation are paramount.

Result: OCR方法在复杂场景中表现更优，能够克服整体表示方法在困难场景中的失败。

Conclusion: OCR方法在机器人操纵任务中具有潜力，尤其在复杂场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Object-centric representation (OCR) has recently become a subject of interest
in the computer vision community for learning a structured representation of
images and videos. It has been several times presented as a potential way to
improve data-efficiency and generalization capabilities to learn an agent on
downstream tasks. However, most existing work only evaluates such models on
scene decomposition, without any notion of reasoning over the learned
representation. Robotic manipulation tasks generally involve multi-object
environments with potential inter-object interaction. We thus argue that they
are a very interesting playground to really evaluate the potential of existing
object-centric work. To do so, we create several robotic manipulation tasks in
simulated environments involving multiple objects (several distractors, the
robot, etc.) and a high-level of randomization (object positions, colors,
shapes, background, initial positions, etc.). We then evaluate one classical
object-centric method across several generalization scenarios and compare its
results against several state-of-the-art hollistic representations. Our results
exhibit that existing methods are prone to failure in difficult scenarios
involving complex scene structures, whereas object-centric methods help
overcome these challenges.

Abstract: Scientific discovery has long been constrained by human limitations in
expertise, physical capability, and sleep cycles. The recent rise of AI
scientists and automated laboratories has accelerated both the cognitive and
operational aspects of research. However, key limitations persist: AI systems
are often confined to virtual environments, while automated laboratories lack
the flexibility and autonomy to adaptively test new hypotheses in the physical
world. Recent advances in embodied AI, such as generalist robot foundation
models, diffusion-based action policies, fine-grained manipulation learning,
and sim-to-real transfer, highlight the promise of integrating cognitive and
embodied intelligence. This convergence opens the door to closed-loop systems
that support iterative, autonomous experimentation and the possibility of
serendipitous discovery. In this position paper, we propose the paradigm of
Intelligent Science Laboratories (ISLs): a multi-layered, closed-loop framework
that deeply integrates cognitive and embodied intelligence. ISLs unify
foundation models for scientific reasoning, agent-based workflow orchestration,
and embodied agents for robust physical experimentation. We argue that such
systems are essential for overcoming the current limitations of scientific
discovery and for realizing the full transformative potential of AI-driven
science.

Conclusion: VLMs可自动识别图表中的潜在问题，如缺失轴标签和图例，未来可扩展用于更多数据可视化场景。

Abstract: Diagrams are widely used to visualize data in publications. The research
field of data visualization deals with defining principles and guidelines for
the creation and use of these diagrams, which are often not known or adhered to
by researchers, leading to misinformation caused by providing inaccurate or
incomplete information.
  In this work, large Vision Language Models (VLMs) are used to analyze
diagrams in order to identify potential problems in regards to selected data
visualization principles and guidelines. To determine the suitability of VLMs
for these tasks, five open source VLMs and five prompting strategies are
compared using a set of questions derived from selected data visualization
guidelines.
  The results show that the employed VLMs work well to accurately analyze
diagram types (F1-score 82.49 %), 3D effects (F1-score 98.55 %), axes labels
(F1-score 76.74 %), lines (RMSE 1.16), colors (RMSE 1.60) and legends (F1-score
96.64 %, RMSE 0.70), while they cannot reliably provide feedback about the
image quality (F1-score 0.74 %) and tick marks/labels (F1-score 46.13 %). Among
the employed VLMs, Qwen2.5VL performs best, and the summarizing prompting
strategy performs best for most of the experimental questions.
  It is shown that VLMs can be used to automatically identify a number of
potential issues in diagrams, such as missing axes labels, missing legends, and
unnecessary 3D effects. The approach laid out in this work can be extended for
further aspects of data visualization.

precise transformations and few-shot generalization, using the Abstraction and
Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) as a domain that
challenges their capabilities in ways not previously explored. Specifically,
this paper uses gradient-based training to learn iterative update rules that
transform input grids into their outputs from the training examples and apply
them to the test inputs. Results suggest that gradient-trained NCA models are a
promising and efficient approach to a range of abstract grid-based tasks from
ARC. Along with discussing the impacts of various design modifications and
training constraints, this work examines the behavior and properties of NCAs
applied to ARC to give insights for broader applications of self-organizing
systems.

Abstract: Lucrative career prospects and creative opportunities often attract students
to enroll in computer science majors and pursue advanced studies in the field.
Consequently, there has been a significant surge in enrollment in computer
science courses, resulting in large class sizes that can range from hundreds to
even thousands of students. A common challenge in such large classrooms is the
lack of engagement between students and both the instructor and the learning
material. However, with advancements in technology and improvements in large
language models (LLMs), there is a considerable opportunity to utilize
LLM-based AI models, such as conversational artificial intelligence (CAI), to
enhance student engagement with learning content in large classes. To explore
the potential of CAI to support engagement, especially with learning content,
we designed an activity in a software Engineering course (with a large class
size) where students used CAI for an in-class activity. We conducted a
within-subject investigation in a large classroom at a US university where we
compared student engagement during an in-class activity that used CAI tool vs.
one without CAI tool. The CAI tool we used was ChatGPT due to its widespread
popularity and familiarity. Our results indicate that CAI (ChatGPT) has the
potential to support engagement with learning content during in-class
activities, especially in large class sizes. We further discuss the
implications of our findings.

models that generate scene descriptions. We compare the performance of various
captioning models, like BLIP and VLMs. Our experiments examine the trade-offs
between single-view and multi-view captioning, and difference between
recognising real-world and 3D printed objects. We quantitatively evaluate
object identification accuracy, completeness, and naturalness of the generated
captions. Results show that VLMs can be used in robotic settings where common
objects need to be recognised, but fail to generalise to novel representations.
Our findings provide practical insights into deploying foundation models for

visual semantic representation module and an audio-visual synchronization
module to enhance alignment capabilities. Specifically, these modules align
video conditions with latent audio elements at the frame level, thereby
improving semantic alignment and audio-visual synchronization. Together with
text conditions, this integrated approach enables precise generation of
video-matching sound effects. In addition, we propose a universal latent audio
codec that can achieve high-quality modeling in various scenarios such as sound
effects, speech, singing, and music. We employ a stereo rendering method that
imbues synthesized audio with a spatial presence. At the same time, in order to
make up for the incomplete types and annotations of the open-source benchmark,
we also open-source an industrial-level benchmark Kling-Audio-Eval. Our
experiments show that Kling-Foley trained with the flow matching objective
achieves new audio-visual SOTA performance among public models in terms of
distribution matching, semantic alignment, temporal alignment and audio
quality.

Abstract: Advancements in audio deepfake technology offers benefits like AI assistants,
better accessibility for speech impairments, and enhanced entertainment.
However, it also poses significant risks to security, privacy, and trust in
digital communications. Detecting and mitigating these threats requires
comprehensive datasets. Existing datasets lack diverse ethnic accents, making
them inadequate for many real-world scenarios. Consequently, models trained on
these datasets struggle to detect audio deepfakes in diverse linguistic and
cultural contexts such as in South-Asian countries. Ironically, there is a
stark lack of South-Asian speaker samples in the existing datasets despite
constituting a quarter of the worlds population. This work introduces the
IndieFake Dataset (IFD), featuring 27.17 hours of bonafide and deepfake audio
from 50 English speaking Indian speakers. IFD offers balanced data distribution
and includes speaker-level characterization, absent in datasets like ASVspoof21

Abstract: In robot imitation learning, policy performance is tightly coupled with the
quality and composition of the demonstration data. Yet, developing a precise
understanding of how individual demonstrations contribute to downstream
outcomes - such as closed-loop task success or failure - remains a persistent
challenge. We propose CUPID, a robot data curation method based on a novel
influence function-theoretic formulation for imitation learning policies. Given
a set of evaluation rollouts, CUPID estimates the influence of each training
demonstration on the policy's expected return. This enables ranking and
selection of demonstrations according to their impact on the policy's
closed-loop performance. We use CUPID to curate data by 1) filtering out
training demonstrations that harm policy performance and 2) subselecting newly
collected trajectories that will most improve the policy. Extensive simulated
and hardware experiments show that our approach consistently identifies which
data drives test-time performance. For example, training with less than 33% of
curated data can yield state-of-the-art diffusion policies on the simulated
RoboMimic benchmark, with similar gains observed in hardware. Furthermore,
hardware experiments show that our method can identify robust strategies under
distribution shift, isolate spurious correlations, and even enhance the
post-training of generalist robot policies. Additional materials are made

Abstract: Accessibility remains a critical concern in today's society, as many
technologies are not developed to support the full range of user needs.
Existing multi-agent systems (MAS) often cannot provide comprehensive
assistance for users in need due to the lack of customization stemming from
closed-source designs. Consequently, individuals with disabilities frequently
encounter significant barriers when attempting to interact with digital
environments. We introduce MATE, a multimodal accessibility MAS, which performs
the modality conversions based on the user's needs. The system is useful for
assisting people with disabilities by ensuring that data will be converted to
an understandable format. For instance, if the user cannot see well and
receives an image, the system converts this image to its audio description.
MATE can be applied to a wide range of domains, industries, and areas, such as
healthcare, and can become a useful assistant for various groups of users. The
system supports multiple types of models, ranging from LLM API calling to using
custom machine learning (ML) classifiers. This flexibility ensures that the
system can be adapted to various needs and is compatible with a wide variety of
hardware. Since the system is expected to run locally, it ensures the privacy
and security of sensitive information. In addition, the framework can be
effectively integrated with institutional technologies (e.g., digital
healthcare service) for real-time user assistance. Furthermore, we introduce
ModCon-Task-Identifier, a model that is capable of extracting the precise
modality conversion task from the user input. Numerous experiments show that
ModCon-Task-Identifier consistently outperforms other LLMs and statistical
models on our custom data. Our code and data are publicly available at

Abstract: Despite their impressive performance, generative image models trained on
large-scale datasets frequently fail to produce images with seemingly simple
concepts -- e.g., human hands or objects appearing in groups of four -- that
are reasonably expected to appear in the training data. These failure modes
have largely been documented anecdotally, leaving open the question of whether
they reflect idiosyncratic anomalies or more structural limitations of these
models. To address this, we introduce a systematic approach for identifying and
characterizing "conceptual blindspots" -- concepts present in the training data
but absent or misrepresented in a model's generations. Our method leverages
sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to extract interpretable concept embeddings,
enabling a quantitative comparison of concept prevalence between real and
generated images. We train an archetypal SAE (RA-SAE) on DINOv2 features with
32,000 concepts -- the largest such SAE to date -- enabling fine-grained
analysis of conceptual disparities. Applied to four popular generative models
(Stable Diffusion 1.5/2.1, PixArt, and Kandinsky), our approach reveals
specific suppressed blindspots (e.g., bird feeders, DVD discs, and whitespaces
on documents) and exaggerated blindspots (e.g., wood background texture and
palm trees). At the individual datapoint level, we further isolate memorization
artifacts -- instances where models reproduce highly specific visual templates
seen during training. Overall, we propose a theoretically grounded framework
for systematically identifying conceptual blindspots in generative models by
assessing their conceptual fidelity with respect to the underlying
data-generating process.

Conclusion: receptron-based网络可能成为管理大量模拟输入的新设备类别，无需复杂训练。

Abstract: Threshold logic gates (TLGs) have been proposed as artificial counterparts of
biological neurons with classification capabilities based on a linear predictor
function combining a set of weights with the feature vector. The linearity of
TLGs limits their classification capabilities requiring the use of networks for
the accomplishment of complex tasks. A generalization of the TLG model called
receptron, characterized by input-dependent weight functions allows for a
significant enhancement of classification performances even with the use of a
single unit. Here we formally demonstrate that a receptron, characterized by
nonlinear input-dependent weight functions, exhibit intrinsic selective
activation properties for analog inputs, when the input vector is within cubic
domains in a 3D space. The proposed model can be extended to the n-dimensional
case for multidimensional applications. Our results suggest that
receptron-based networks can represent a new class of devices capable to manage
a large number of analog inputs, for edge applications requiring high
selectivity and classification capabilities without the burden of complex
training.

Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion perception (MSFP) is a key technology for embodied AI,
which can serve a variety of downstream tasks (e.g., 3D object detection and
semantic segmentation) and application scenarios (e.g., autonomous driving and
swarm robotics). Recently, impressive achievements on AI-based MSFP methods
have been reviewed in relevant surveys. However, we observe that the existing
surveys have some limitations after a rigorous and detailed investigation. For
one thing, most surveys are oriented to a single task or research field, such
as 3D object detection or autonomous driving. Therefore, researchers in other
related tasks often find it difficult to benefit directly. For another, most
surveys only introduce MSFP from a single perspective of multi-modal fusion,
while lacking consideration of the diversity of MSFP methods, such as
multi-view fusion and time-series fusion. To this end, in this paper, we hope
to organize MSFP research from a task-agnostic perspective, where methods are
reported from various technical views. Specifically, we first introduce the
background of MSFP. Next, we review multi-modal and multi-agent fusion methods.
A step further, time-series fusion methods are analyzed. In the era of LLM, we
also investigate multimodal LLM fusion methods. Finally, we discuss open
challenges and future directions for MSFP. We hope this survey can help
researchers understand the important progress in MSFP and provide possible
insights for future research.

Conclusion: GBGC因其高效性和鲁棒性，有望成为标准图数据预处理方法。

Abstract: The objective of graph coarsening is to generate smaller, more manageable
graphs while preserving key information of the original graph. Previous work
were mainly based on the perspective of spectrum-preserving, using some
predefined coarsening rules to make the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of
the original graph and the coarsened graph match as much as possible. However,
they largely overlooked the fact that the original graph is composed of
subregions at different levels of granularity, where highly connected and
similar nodes should be more inclined to be aggregated together as nodes in the
coarsened graph. By combining the multi-granularity characteristics of the
graph structure, we can generate coarsened graph at the optimal granularity. To
this end, inspired by the application of granular-ball computing in
multi-granularity, we propose a new multi-granularity, efficient, and adaptive
coarsening method via granular-ball (GBGC), which significantly improves the
coarsening results and efficiency. Specifically, GBGC introduces an adaptive
granular-ball graph refinement mechanism, which adaptively splits the original
graph from coarse to fine into granular-balls of different sizes and optimal
granularity, and constructs the coarsened graph using these granular-balls as
supernodes. In addition, compared with other state-of-the-art graph coarsening
methods, the processing speed of this method can be increased by tens to
hundreds of times and has lower time complexity. The accuracy of GBGC is almost
always higher than that of the original graph due to the good robustness and
generalization of the granular-ball computing, so it has the potential to
become a standard graph data preprocessing method.

Abstract: Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has evolved significantly to incorporate
emotion recognition capabilities, creating unprecedented opportunities for
adaptive and personalized user experiences. This paper explores the integration
of emotion detection into calendar applications, enabling user interfaces to
dynamically respond to users' emotional states and stress levels, thereby
enhancing both productivity and engagement. We present and evaluate two
complementary approaches to emotion detection: a biometric-based method
utilizing heart rate (HR) data extracted from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals
processed through Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
neural networks to predict the emotional dimensions of Valence, Arousal, and
Dominance; and a behavioral method analyzing computer activity through multiple
machine learning models to classify emotions based on fine-grained user
interactions such as mouse movements, clicks, and keystroke patterns. Our
comparative analysis, from real-world datasets, reveals that while both
approaches demonstrate effectiveness, the computer activity-based method
delivers superior consistency and accuracy, particularly for mouse-related
interactions, which achieved approximately 90\% accuracy. Furthermore, GRU
networks outperformed LSTM models in the biometric approach, with Valence
prediction reaching 84.38\% accuracy.

Conclusion: NTRL在提升战斗策略深度和公平性方面优于人工设计。

Abstract: Balancing combat encounters in Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) is a complex task
that requires Dungeon Masters (DM) to manually assess party strength, enemy
composition, and dynamic player interactions while avoiding interruption of the
narrative flow. In this paper, we propose Encounter Generation via
Reinforcement Learning (NTRL), a novel approach that automates Dynamic
Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) in D&D via combat encounter design. By framing the
problem as a contextual bandit, NTRL generates encounters based on real-time
party members attributes. In comparison with classic DM heuristics, NTRL
iteratively optimizes encounters to extend combat longevity (+200%), increases
damage dealt to party members, reducing post-combat hit points (-16.67%), and
raises the number of player deaths while maintaining low total party kills
(TPK). The intensification of combat forces players to act wisely and engage in
tactical maneuvers, even though the generated encounters guarantee high win
rates (70%). Even in comparison with encounters designed by human Dungeon
Masters, NTRL demonstrates superior performance by enhancing the strategic
depth of combat while increasing difficulty in a manner that preserves overall
game fairness.

Abstract: For more than a decade now, academicians and online platform administrators
have been studying solutions to the problem of bot detection. Bots are computer
algorithms whose use is far from being benign: malicious bots are purposely
created to distribute spam, sponsor public characters and, ultimately, induce a
bias within the public opinion. To fight the bot invasion on our online
ecosystem, several approaches have been implemented, mostly based on
(supervised and unsupervised) classifiers, which adopt the most varied account
features, from the simplest to the most expensive ones to be extracted from the
raw data obtainable through the Twitter public APIs. In this exploratory study,
using Twitter as a benchmark, we compare the performances of four state-of-art
feature sets in detecting novel bots: one of the output scores of the popular
bot detector Botometer, which considers more than 1,000 features of an account
to take a decision; two feature sets based on the account profile and timeline;
and the information about the Twitter client from which the user tweets. The
results of our analysis, conducted on six recently released datasets of Twitter
accounts, hint at the possible use of general-purpose classifiers and
cheap-to-compute account features for the detection of evolved bots.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的高维系统常存在循环因果动态，传统ADMGs无法完全描述，因此需要更通用的模型（如ioSCMs和DMGs）来支持因果分析。

Method: 通过引入ioSCMs和DMGs，扩展了因果表示的范围，并证明了do-calculus在C-DMGs上的无条件完备性和可靠性。

Result: 证明了do-calculus在DMGs上的无条件完备性和可靠性，并扩展了非可识别性的图形标准。

Conclusion: 研究为循环因果动态系统中的宏观因果效应识别提供了理论基础和实用工具。

Abstract: The do-calculus is a sound and complete tool for identifying causal effects
in acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs) induced by structural causal models
(SCMs). However, in many real-world applications, especially in
high-dimensional setting, constructing a fully specified ADMG is often
infeasible. This limitation has led to growing interest in partially specified
causal representations, particularly through cluster-directed mixed graphs
(C-DMGs), which group variables into clusters and offer a more abstract yet
practical view of causal dependencies. While these representations can include
cycles, recent work has shown that the do-calculus remains sound and complete
for identifying macro-level causal effects in C-DMGs over ADMGs under the
assumption that all clusters size are greater than 1. Nevertheless, real-world
systems often exhibit cyclic causal dynamics at the structural level. To
account for this, input-output structural causal models (ioSCMs) have been
introduced as a generalization of SCMs that allow for cycles. ioSCMs induce
another type of graph structure known as a directed mixed graph (DMG).
Analogous to the ADMG setting, one can define C-DMGs over DMGs as high-level
representations of causal relations among clusters of variables. In this paper,
we prove that, unlike in the ADMG setting, the do-calculus is unconditionally
sound and complete for identifying macro causal effects in C-DMGs over DMGs.
Furthermore, we show that the graphical criteria for non-identifiability of
macro causal effects previously established C-DMGs over ADMGs naturally extends
to a subset of C-DMGs over DMGs.

Abstract: Recent research increasingly integrates machine learning (ML) into predictive
maintenance (PdM) to reduce operational and maintenance costs in data-rich
operational settings. However, uncertainty due to model misspecification
continues to limit widespread industrial adoption. This paper proposes a PdM
framework in which sensor-driven prognostics inform decision-making under
economic trade-offs within a finite decision space. We investigate two key
questions: (1) Does higher predictive accuracy necessarily lead to better
maintenance decisions? (2) If not, how can the impact of prediction errors on
downstream maintenance decisions be mitigated? We first demonstrate that in the
traditional estimate-then-optimize (ETO) framework, errors in probabilistic
prediction can result in inconsistent and suboptimal maintenance decisions. To
address this, we propose an integrated estimate-optimize (IEO) framework that
jointly tunes predictive models while directly optimizing for maintenance
outcomes. We establish theoretical finite-sample guarantees on decision
consistency under standard assumptions. Specifically, we develop a stochastic
perturbation gradient descent algorithm suitable for small run-to-failure
datasets. Empirical evaluations on a turbofan maintenance case study show that
the IEO framework reduces average maintenance regret up to 22% compared to ETO.
This study provides a principled approach to managing prediction errors in
data-driven PdM. By aligning prognostic model training with maintenance
objectives, the IEO framework improves robustness under model misspecification
and improves decision quality. The improvement is particularly pronounced when
the decision-making policy is misaligned with the decision-maker's target.
These findings support more reliable maintenance planning in uncertain
operational environments.

Abstract: Predicting port congestion is crucial for maintaining reliable global supply
chains. Accurate forecasts enableimprovedshipment planning, reducedelaysand
costs, and optimizeinventoryanddistributionstrategies, thereby ensuring timely
deliveries and enhancing supply chain resilience. To achieve accurate
predictions, analyzing vessel behavior and their stay times at specific port
terminals is essential, focusing particularly on berth scheduling under various
conditions. Crucially, the model must capture and learn the underlying
priorities and patterns of berth scheduling. Berth scheduling and planning are
influenced by a range of factors, including incoming vessel size, waiting
times, and the status of vessels within the port terminal. By observing
historical Automatic Identification System (AIS) positions of vessels, we
reconstruct berth schedules, which are subsequently utilized to determine the
reward function via Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL). For this purpose, we
modeled a specific terminal at the Port of New York/New Jersey and developed
Temporal-IRL. This Temporal-IRL model learns berth scheduling to predict vessel
sequencing at the terminal and estimate vessel port stay, encompassing both
waiting and berthing times, to forecast port congestion. Utilizing data from
Maher Terminal spanning January 2015 to September 2023, we trained and tested
the model, achieving demonstrably excellent results.

Abstract: Depression is a common mental illness across current human society.
Traditional depression assessment relying on inventories and interviews with
psychologists frequently suffer from subjective diagnosis results, slow and
expensive diagnosis process as well as lack of human resources. Since there is
a solid evidence that depression is reflected by various human internal brain
activities and external expressive behaviours, early traditional machine
learning (ML) and advanced deep learning (DL) models have been widely explored
for human behaviour-based automatic depression assessment (ADA) since 2012.
However, recent ADA surveys typically only focus on a limited number of human
behaviour modalities. Despite being used as a theoretical basis for developing
ADA approaches, existing ADA surveys lack a comprehensive review and summary of
multi-modal depression-related human behaviours. To bridge this gap, this paper
specifically summarises depression-related human behaviours across a range of
modalities (e.g. the human brain, verbal language and non-verbal
audio/facial/body behaviours). We focus on conducting an up-to-date and
comprehensive survey of ML-based ADA approaches for learning depression cues
from these behaviours as well as discussing and comparing their distinctive
features and limitations. In addition, we also review existing ADA competitions
and datasets, identify and discuss the main challenges and opportunities to
provide further research directions for future ADA researchers.

Abstract: Extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) plays key regulatory roles and
contributes to oncogene overexpression in cancer through high-copy
amplification and long-range interactions. Despite advances in modeling, no
pre-trained models currently support full-length circular eccDNA for downstream

resolution or hindered by the inefficiency of the quadratic attention
mechanism. Here, we introduce eccDNAMamba, the first bidirectional state-space
encoder tailored for circular DNA sequences. It combines forward and reverse
passes for full-context representation learning with linear-time complexity,
and preserves circular structure through a novel augmentation strategy. Tested
on two real-world datasets, eccDNAMamba achieves strong classification
performance and scales to sequences up to 200 Kbp, offering a robust and
efficient framework for modeling circular genomes. Our codes are available at

Abstract: This paper describes a sound source localization (SSL) technique that
combines an $\alpha$-stable model for the observed signal with a neural
network-based approach for modeling steering vectors. Specifically, a
physics-informed neural network, referred to as Neural Steerer, is used to
interpolate measured steering vectors (SVs) on a fixed microphone array. This
allows for a more robust estimation of the so-called $\alpha$-stable spatial
measure, which represents the most plausible direction of arrival (DOA) of a
target signal. As an $\alpha$-stable model for the non-Gaussian case ($\alpha$
$\in$ (0, 2)) theoretically defines a unique spatial measure, we choose to
leverage it to account for residual reconstruction error of the Neural Steerer
in the downstream tasks. The objective scores indicate that our proposed
technique outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the case of multiple sound
sources.

Motivation: 研究大学HPC系统的资源不足问题，以支持学术研究和AI发展。

Method: 调查50多所研究机构的计算能力、架构设计、治理模式和能效。

Result: 大学HPC增长缓慢（18%），远低于国家（43%）和工业界（78%），需改进资源分配。

Abstract: The rapid growth of AI, data-intensive science, and digital twin technologies
has driven an unprecedented demand for high-performance computing (HPC) across
the research ecosystem. While national laboratories and industrial hyperscalers
have invested heavily in exascale and GPU-centric architectures,
university-operated HPC systems remain comparatively under-resourced. This
survey presents a comprehensive assessment of the HPC landscape across U.S.
universities, benchmarking their capabilities against Department of Energy
(DOE) leadership-class systems and industrial AI infrastructures. We examine
over 50 premier research institutions, analyzing compute capacity,
architectural design, governance models, and energy efficiency. Our findings
reveal that university clusters, though vital for academic research, exhibit
significantly lower growth trajectories (CAGR $\approx$ 18%) than their
national ($\approx$ 43%) and industrial ($\approx$ 78%) counterparts. The
increasing skew toward GPU-dense AI workloads has widened the capability gap,
highlighting the need for federated computing, idle-GPU harvesting, and
cost-sharing models. We also identify emerging paradigms, such as decentralized
reinforcement learning, as promising opportunities for democratizing AI
training within campus environments. Ultimately, this work provides actionable
insights for academic leaders, funding agencies, and technology partners to
ensure more equitable and sustainable HPC access in support of national
research priorities.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种时间正则化训练（TRT）方法，用于解决脉冲神经网络（SNNs）中的过拟合问题，通过时间依赖的正则化机制增强早期时间步的约束，从而提升模型的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNNs由于事件驱动和低功耗特性受到广泛关注，但直接训练的SNNs因数据集规模小和梯度不匹配问题导致严重过拟合，限制了其泛化能力。

Method: 提出TRT方法，引入时间依赖的正则化机制，对早期时间步施加更强约束，并通过损失景观可视化和学习曲线分析验证其有效性。

Result: TRT在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法，能有效缓解过拟合并平坦化训练损失景观，提升泛化性能。此外，Fisher信息分析揭示了TRT的时间信息集中现象。

Conclusion: TRT通过时间衰减的正则化机制引导网络在信息丰富的早期时间步学习鲁棒特征，显著提升了SNNs的泛化能力。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have received widespread attention due to
their event-driven and low-power characteristics, making them particularly
effective for processing event-based neuromorphic data. Recent studies have
shown that directly trained SNNs suffer from severe overfitting issues due to
the limited scale of neuromorphic datasets and the gradient mismatching
problem, which fundamentally constrain their generalization performance. In
this paper, we propose a temporal regularization training (TRT) method by
introducing a time-dependent regularization mechanism to enforce stronger
constraints on early timesteps. We compare the performance of TRT with other
state-of-the-art methods performance on datasets including CIFAR10/100,
ImageNet100, DVS-CIFAR10, and N-Caltech101. To validate the effectiveness of
TRT, we conducted ablation studies and analyses including loss landscape
visualization and learning curve analysis, demonstrating that TRT can
effectively mitigate overfitting and flatten the training loss landscape,
thereby enhancing generalizability. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical
interpretation of TRT's temporal regularization mechanism based on the results
of Fisher information analysis. We analyze the temporal information dynamics
inside SNNs by tracking Fisher information during the TRT training process,
revealing the Temporal Information Concentration (TIC) phenomenon, where Fisher
information progressively concentrates in early timesteps. The time-decaying
regularization mechanism implemented in TRT effectively guides the network to
learn robust features in early timesteps with rich information, thereby leading
to significant improvements in model generalization. Code is available at

Abstract: We present AnchorDP3, a diffusion policy framework for dual-arm robotic
manipulation that achieves state-of-the-art performance in highly randomized
environments. AnchorDP3 integrates three key innovations: (1)
Simulator-Supervised Semantic Segmentation, using rendered ground truth to
explicitly segment task-critical objects within the point cloud, which provides
strong affordance priors; (2) Task-Conditioned Feature Encoders, lightweight
modules processing augmented point clouds per task, enabling efficient
multi-task learning through a shared diffusion-based action expert; (3)
Affordance-Anchored Keypose Diffusion with Full State Supervision, replacing
dense trajectory prediction with sparse, geometrically meaningful action
anchors, i.e., keyposes such as pre-grasp pose, grasp pose directly anchored to
affordances, drastically simplifying the prediction space; the action expert is
forced to predict both robot joint angles and end-effector poses
simultaneously, which exploits geometric consistency to accelerate convergence
and boost accuracy. Trained on large-scale, procedurally generated simulation
data, AnchorDP3 achieves a 98.7% average success rate in the RoboTwin benchmark
across diverse tasks under extreme randomization of objects, clutter, table
height, lighting, and backgrounds. This framework, when integrated with the
RoboTwin real-to-sim pipeline, has the potential to enable fully autonomous
generation of deployable visuomotor policies from only scene and instruction,
totally eliminating human demonstrations from learning manipulation skills.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卷积去噪自编码器（DAEs）在图像恢复中表现优异，但在牙科X光片中难以保留高频细节，影响诊断准确性。

Method: 提出噪声感知自注意力方法，结合噪声区域的关键特征恢复，构建了NAADA网络。

Result: 相比现有方法（如Uformer、MResDNN），NAADA在细节恢复和图像质量上表现更优。

Conclusion: 噪声感知自注意力方法有效提升了牙科X光片的去噪效果，具有更高的诊断价值。

Abstract: Convolutional denoising autoencoders (DAEs) are powerful tools for image
restoration. However, they inherit a key limitation of convolutional neural
networks (CNNs): they tend to recover low-frequency features, such as smooth
regions, more effectively than high-frequency details. This leads to the loss
of fine details, which is particularly problematic in dental radiographs where
preserving subtle anatomical structures is crucial. While self-attention
mechanisms can help mitigate this issue by emphasizing important features,
conventional attention methods often prioritize features corresponding to
cleaner regions and may overlook those obscured by noise. To address this
limitation, we propose a noise-aware self-attention method, which allows the
model to effectively focus on and recover key features even within noisy
regions. Building on this approach, we introduce the noise-aware
attention-enhanced denoising autoencoder (NAADA) network for enhancing noisy
panoramic dental radiographs. Compared with the recent state of the art (and
much heavier) methods like Uformer, MResDNN etc., our method improves the
reconstruction of fine details, ensuring better image quality and diagnostic
accuracy.

Conclusion: IQFMs为克服当前限制并发挥量子增强机器学习的潜力提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: Quantum machine learning models that leverage quantum circuits as quantum
feature maps (QFMs) are recognized for their enhanced expressive power in
learning tasks. Such models have demonstrated rigorous end-to-end quantum
speedups for specific families of classification problems. However, deploying
deep QFMs on real quantum hardware remains challenging due to circuit noise and
hardware constraints. Additionally, variational quantum algorithms often suffer
from computational bottlenecks, particularly in accurate gradient estimation,
which significantly increases quantum resource demands during training. We
propose Iterative Quantum Feature Maps (IQFMs), a hybrid quantum-classical
framework that constructs a deep architecture by iteratively connecting shallow
QFMs with classically computed augmentation weights. By incorporating
contrastive learning and a layer-wise training mechanism, IQFMs effectively
reduces quantum runtime and mitigates noise-induced degradation. In tasks
involving noisy quantum data, numerical experiments show that IQFMs outperforms
quantum convolutional neural networks, without requiring the optimization of
variational quantum parameters. Even for a typical classical image
classification benchmark, a carefully designed IQFMs achieves performance
comparable to that of classical neural networks. This framework presents a
promising path to address current limitations and harness the full potential of
quantum-enhanced machine learning.

Result: 成功转换73.7%的正则表达式，优化后的F1-score和MCC超过0.91。

Conclusion: Reptile为日志分析平台迁移提供了高效且可靠的自动化工具。

Abstract: Log files provide valuable information for detecting and diagnosing problems
in enterprise software applications and data centers. Several log analytics
tools and platforms were developed to help filter and extract information from
logs, typically using regular expressions (RegExes). Recent commercial log
analytics platforms provide domain-specific languages specifically designed for
log parsing, such as Grok or the Dynatrace Pattern Language (DPL). However,
users who want to migrate to these platforms must manually convert their
RegExes into the new pattern language, which is costly and error-prone. In this
work, we present Reptile, which combines a rule-based approach for converting
RegExes into DPL patterns with a best-effort approach for cases where a full
conversion is impossible. Furthermore, it integrates GPT-4 to optimize the
obtained DPL patterns. The evaluation with 946 RegExes collected from a large
company shows that Reptile safely converted 73.7% of them. The evaluation of
Reptile's pattern optimization with 23 real-world RegExes showed an F1-score
and MCC above 0.91. These results are promising and have ample practical
implications for companies that migrate to a modern log analytics platform,
such as Dynatrace.

Conclusion: 方法简单有效，仅需少量代码即可显著改善训练稳定性和重建质量。

Abstract: Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is widely used in medical imaging.
However, the limited number and intensity of X-ray projections make
reconstruction an ill-posed problem with severe artifacts. NeRF-based methods
have achieved great success in this task. However, they suffer from a
local-global training mismatch between their two key components: the hash
encoder and the neural network. Specifically, in each training step, only a
subset of the hash encoder's parameters is used (local sparse), whereas all
parameters in the neural network participate (global dense). Consequently, hash
features generated in each step are highly misaligned, as they come from
different subsets of the hash encoder. These misalignments from different
training steps are then fed into the neural network, causing repeated
inconsistent global updates in training, which leads to unstable training,
slower convergence, and degraded reconstruction quality. Aiming to alleviate
the impact of this local-global optimization mismatch, we introduce a
Normalized Hash Encoder, which enhances feature consistency and mitigates the
mismatch. Additionally, we propose a Mapping Consistency Initialization(MCI)
strategy that initializes the neural network before training by leveraging the
global mapping property from a well-trained model. The initialized neural
network exhibits improved stability during early training, enabling faster
convergence and enhanced reconstruction performance. Our method is simple yet
effective, requiring only a few lines of code while substantially improving
training efficiency on 128 CT cases collected from 4 different datasets,
covering 7 distinct anatomical regions.

Abstract: Large-scale scientific collaborations like ATLAS, Belle II, CMS, DUNE, and
others involve hundreds of research institutes and thousands of researchers
spread across the globe. These experiments generate petabytes of data, with
volumes soon expected to reach exabytes. Consequently, there is a growing need
for computation, including structured data processing from raw data to
consumer-ready derived data, extensive Monte Carlo simulation campaigns, and a
wide range of end-user analysis. To manage these computational and storage
demands, centralized workflow and data management systems are implemented.
However, decisions regarding data placement and payload allocation are often
made disjointly and via heuristic means. A significant obstacle in adopting
more effective heuristic or AI-driven solutions is the absence of a quick and
reliable introspective dynamic model to evaluate and refine alternative
approaches. In this study, we aim to develop such an interactive system using
real-world data. By examining job execution records from the PanDA workflow
management system, we have pinpointed key performance indicators such as
queuing time, error rate, and the extent of remote data access. The dataset
includes five months of activity. Additionally, we are creating a generative AI
model to simulate time series of payloads, which incorporate visible features
like category, event count, and submitting group, as well as hidden features
like the total computational load-derived from existing PanDA records and
computing site capabilities. These hidden features, which are not visible to
job allocators, whether heuristic or AI-driven, influence factors such as
queuing times and data movement.

Abstract: Sampling low-energy molecular conformations, spatial arrangements of atoms in
a molecule, is a critical task for many different calculations performed in the
drug discovery and optimization process. Numerous specialized equivariant
networks have been designed to generate molecular conformations from 2D
molecular graphs. Recently, non-equivariant transformer models have emerged as
a viable alternative due to their capability to scale to improve
generalization. However, the concern has been that non-equivariant models
require a large model size to compensate the lack of equivariant bias. In this
paper, we demonstrate that a well-chosen positional encoding effectively
addresses these size limitations. A standard transformer model incorporating
relative positional encoding for molecular graphs when scaled to 25 million
parameters surpasses the current state-of-the-art non-equivariant base model
with 64 million parameters on the GEOM-DRUGS benchmark. We implemented relative
positional encoding as a negative attention bias that linearly increases with
the shortest path distances between graph nodes at varying slopes for different
attention heads, similar to ALiBi, a widely adopted relative positional
encoding technique in the NLP domain. This architecture has the potential to
serve as a foundation for a novel class of generative models for molecular
conformations.

Abstract: We address the problem of game level repair, which consists of taking a

consist of ensuring the completeness of the level, reachability of objects, or
other performance characteristics. The repair problem may also be constrained
in that it can only make a small number of changes to the level. We investigate
search-based solutions to the level repair problem, particularly using
evolutionary and quality-diversity algorithms, with good results. This level
repair method is applied to levels generated using a machine learning-based
procedural content generation (PCGML) method that generates stylistically
appropriate but frequently broken levels. This combination of PCGML for
generation and search-based methods for repair shows great promise as a hybrid
procedural content generation (PCG) method.

Conclusion: 该方法在数据稀缺场景下实现了高效ECG恢复，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG), as a crucial find-grained cardiac feature, has been
successfully recovered from radar signals in the literature, but the
performance heavily relies on the high-quality radar signal and numerous
radar-ECG pairs for training, restricting the applications in new scenarios due
to data scarcity. Therefore, this work will focus on radar-based ECG recovery
in new scenarios with limited data and propose a cardio-focusing and -tracking
(CFT) algorithm to precisely track the cardiac location to ensure an efficient
acquisition of high-quality radar signals. Furthermore, a transfer learning
model (RFcardi) is proposed to extract cardio-related information from the
radar signal without ECG ground truth based on the intrinsic sparsity of
cardiac features, and only a few synchronous radar-ECG pairs are required to
fine-tune the pre-trained model for the ECG recovery. The experimental results
reveal that the proposed CFT can dynamically identify the cardiac location, and
the RFcardi model can effectively generate faithful ECG recoveries after using
a small number of radar-ECG pairs for training. The code and dataset are
available after the publication.

Abstract: The increasing miniaturization of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has
expanded their deployment potential to indoor and hard-to-reach areas. However,
this trend introduces distinct challenges, particularly in terms of flight
dynamics and power consumption, which limit the UAVs' autonomy and mission
capabilities. This paper presents a novel approach to overcoming these
limitations by integrating Neural 3D Reconstruction (N3DR) with small UAV
systems for fine-grained 3-Dimensional (3D) digital reconstruction of small
static objects. Specifically, we design, implement, and evaluate an N3DR-based
pipeline that leverages advanced models, i.e., Instant-ngp, Nerfacto, and
Splatfacto, to improve the quality of 3D reconstructions using images of the
object captured by a fleet of small UAVs. We assess the performance of the
considered models using various imagery and pointcloud metrics, comparing them
against the baseline Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithm. The experimental
results demonstrate that the N3DR-enhanced pipeline significantly improves
reconstruction quality, making it feasible for small UAVs to support
high-precision 3D mapping and anomaly detection in constrained environments. In
more general terms, our results highlight the potential of N3DR in advancing
the capabilities of miniaturized UAV systems.

Motivation: 奖励模型作为复杂需求的代理存在不完美性，可能导致奖励黑客现象，即过度优化代理奖励而损害实际目标。

Method: 研究了Best-of-$n$ (BoN)、Soft-Best-of-$n$ (SBoN)和Best-of-Poisson (BoP)方法，并提出了HedgeTune算法。

Result: 实验表明，HedgeTune能有效缓解奖励黑客现象，并在奖励与失真之间实现更优权衡。

Conclusion: 通过对冲策略可以避免对高代理奖励信号的过度依赖，从而优化推理时对齐。

Abstract: A common paradigm to improve the performance of large language models is
optimizing for a reward model. Reward models assign a numerical score to LLM
outputs indicating, for example, which response would likely be preferred by a
user or is most aligned with safety goals. However, reward models are never
perfect. They inevitably function as proxies for complex desiderata such as
correctness, helpfulness, and safety. By overoptimizing for a misspecified
reward, we can subvert intended alignment goals and reduce overall performance
-- a phenomenon commonly referred to as reward hacking. In this work, we
characterize reward hacking in inference-time alignment and demonstrate when
and how we can mitigate it by hedging on the proxy reward. We study this
phenomenon under Best-of-$n$ (BoN) and Soft-Best-of-$n$ (SBoN), and we
introduce Best-of-Poisson (BoP) that provides an efficient, near-exact
approximation of the optimal reward-KL divergence policy at inference time. We
show that the characteristic pattern of hacking as observed in practice (where
the true reward first increases before declining) is an inevitable property of
a broad class of inference-time mechanisms, including BoN and BoP. To counter
this effect, hedging offers a tactical choice to avoid placing undue confidence
in high but potentially misleading proxy reward signals. We introduce
HedgeTune, an efficient algorithm to find the optimal inference-time parameter
and avoid reward hacking. We demonstrate through experiments that hedging
mitigates reward hacking and achieves superior distortion-reward tradeoffs with
minimal computational overhead.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Multi-Preference Lambda-weighted Listwise DPO的新框架，扩展了DPO以支持多目标偏好和动态调整，提高了灵活性和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐技术（如RLHF）计算成本高且不稳定，DPO虽轻量但仅支持静态偏好分布，无法满足多目标或动态对齐需求。

Method: 通过分类损失直接对齐语言模型，引入多维度偏好和动态插值机制，支持列表式偏好反馈。

Result: 在静态目标上与DPO效果相当，同时提供了更高的通用性和适应性。

Conclusion: 新框架为多目标和动态对齐提供了有效解决方案，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: While large-scale unsupervised language models (LMs) capture broad world
knowledge and reasoning capabilities, steering their behavior toward desired
objectives remains challenging due to the lack of explicit supervision.
Existing alignment techniques, such as reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), rely on training a reward model and performing reinforcement
learning to align with human preferences. However, RLHF is often
computationally intensive, unstable, and sensitive to hyperparameters.
  To address these limitations, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) was
introduced as a lightweight and stable alternative, enabling direct alignment
of language models with pairwise preference data via classification loss.
However, DPO and its extensions generally assume a single static preference
distribution, limiting flexibility in multi-objective or dynamic alignment
settings.
  In this paper, we propose a novel framework: Multi-Preference Lambda-weighted
Listwise DPO, which extends DPO to incorporate multiple human preference
dimensions (e.g., helpfulness, harmlessness, informativeness) and enables
dynamic interpolation through a controllable simplex-weighted formulation. Our
method supports both listwise preference feedback and flexible alignment across
varying user intents without re-training. Empirical and theoretical analysis
demonstrates that our method is as effective as traditional DPO on static
objectives while offering greater generality and adaptability for real-world
deployment.

Motivation: 现有LoRA微调方法可能损害模型的安全性，导致有害输出，而现有安全对齐方法无法有效处理复杂的参数变化。

Method: 提出SPLoRA方法，结合E-DIEM相似性度量，选择性修剪削弱安全对齐的LoRA层。

Result: SPLoRA在安全性和性能上优于现有方法，减少推理开销。

Conclusion: SPLoRA是一种高效、可扩展的解决方案，适用于部署更安全的LLM。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
enhances adaptability while reducing computational costs. However, fine-tuning
can compromise safety alignment, even with benign data, increasing
susceptibility to harmful outputs. Existing safety alignment methods struggle
to capture complex parameter shifts, leading to suboptimal safety-utility
trade-offs. To address this issue, we propose Safe Pruning LoRA (SPLoRA), a
novel pruning-based approach that selectively removes LoRA layers that weaken
safety alignment, improving safety while preserving performance. At its core,
we introduce Empirical-DIEM (E-DIEM), a dimension-insensitive similarity metric
that effectively detects safety misalignment in LoRA-adapted models. We conduct
extensive experiments on LLMs fine-tuned with mixed of benign and malicious
data, and purely benign datasets, evaluating SPLoRA across utility, safety, and
reliability metrics. Results demonstrate that SPLoRA outperforms
state-of-the-art safety alignment techniques, significantly reducing safety
risks while maintaining or improving model performance and reliability.
Additionally, SPLoRA reduces inference overhead, making it a scalable and
efficient solution for deploying safer and more reliable LLMs. The code is
available at https://github.com/AoShuang92/SPLoRA.

Method: CoE在每层内通过迭代路由机制动态选择专家，支持专家顺序通信。

Conclusion: CoE通过迭代残差结构和动态路由提升了专家专业化和模型表达能力。

Abstract: We propose Chain-of-Experts (CoE), a new Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architecture that introduces sequential expert communication within each layer.
Unlike traditional MoE models, where experts operate independently in parallel,
CoE processes tokens iteratively across a chain of experts inside a layer. To
support dynamic expert selection across iterations, CoE employs a dedicated
router at each iteration step within a layer. This design allows tokens to
re-evaluate and select different experts during each iteration, rather than
being statically assigned. As a result, CoE introduces a flexible routing
mechanism that increases the diversity of expert combinations and enriches the
model's representational capacity. CoE demonstrates improved performance under
fixed compute: on math reasoning tasks, it reduces validation loss from 1.20 to
1.12 compared to a standard MoE. Beyond performance, CoE offers a new scaling
axis: depth through expert iteration, which complements conventional
width/depth scaling. For example, using 2x iterations matches the performance
of 3x expert selections (in width), while reducing memory usage by 17.6-42%
relative to other scaling strategies. Our analysis reveals that CoE's benefits
stem from its iterative residual structure and enhanced expert specialization
empowered by iterative routing, which together unlock more expressive
representations. Code is available at https://github.com/ZihanWang314/coe.

Abstract: The invention of the transformer architecture has revolutionized Artificial
Intelligence (AI), yielding unprecedented success in areas such as natural
language processing, computer vision, and multimodal reasoning. Despite these
advances, it is unclear whether transformers are able to learn and implement
precise algorithms. Here, we demonstrate that transformers can exactly
implement a fundamental and widely used algorithm for $k$-means clustering:
Lloyd's algorithm. First, we theoretically prove the existence of such a
transformer architecture, which we term the $k$-means transformer, that exactly
implements Lloyd's algorithm for $k$-means clustering using the standard
ingredients of modern transformers: attention and residual connections. Next,
we numerically implement this transformer and demonstrate in experiments the
exact correspondence between our architecture and Lloyd's algorithm, providing
a fully neural implementation of $k$-means clustering. Finally, we demonstrate
that interpretable alterations (e.g., incorporating layer normalizations or
multilayer perceptrons) to this architecture yields diverse and novel variants
of clustering algorithms, such as soft $k$-means, spherical $k$-means, trimmed
$k$-means, and more. Collectively, our findings demonstrate how transformer
mechanisms can precisely map onto algorithmic procedures, offering a clear and
interpretable perspective on implementing precise algorithms in transformers.

activation adapter from a donor model and pastes its effect into a recipient
model. Command-V profiles layer activations on a small prompt set, derives
linear converters between corresponding layers, and applies the donor
intervention in the recipient's activation space. This process does not require
access to the original training data and needs minimal compute. In three case
studies-safety-refusal enhancement, jailbreak facilitation, and automatic
chain-of-thought reasoning--Command-V matches or exceeds the performance of
direct finetuning while using orders of magnitude less compute. Our code and

Conclusion: 句子级分析是理解推理模型的有效途径，方法间一致性验证了其潜力。

Abstract: Reasoning large language models have recently achieved state-of-the-art
performance in many fields. However, their long-form chain-of-thought reasoning
creates interpretability challenges as each generated token depends on all
previous ones, making the computation harder to decompose. We argue that
analyzing reasoning traces at the sentence level is a promising approach to
understanding reasoning processes. We present three complementary attribution
methods: (1) a black-box method measuring each sentence's counterfactual
importance by comparing final answers across 100 rollouts conditioned on the
model generating that sentence or one with a different meaning; (2) a white-box
method of aggregating attention patterns between pairs of sentences, which
identified ``broadcasting'' sentences that receive disproportionate attention
from all future sentences via ``receiver'' attention heads; (3) a causal
attribution method measuring logical connections between sentences by
suppressing attention toward one sentence and measuring the effect on each
future sentence's tokens. Each method provides evidence for the existence of
thought anchors, reasoning steps that have outsized importance and that
disproportionately influence the subsequent reasoning process. These thought
anchors are typically planning or backtracking sentences. We provide an
open-source tool (www.thought-anchors.com) for visualizing the outputs of our
methods, and present a case study showing converging patterns across methods
that map how a model performs multi-step reasoning. The consistency across
methods demonstrates the potential of sentence-level analysis for a deeper
understanding of reasoning models.

Conclusion: GradualDiff-Fed是隐私保护环境下高效微调LLMs的可行解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has created an
unprecedented demand for fine-tuning models for specialized domains, such as
medical science. While federated learning (FL) offers a decentralized and
privacy-preserving approach to collaboratively fine-tune LLMs without sharing
raw data, it presents significant challenges, particularly in performance and
managing large model sizes efficiently. In this paper, we introduce
GradualDiff-Fed, an FL framework designed explicitly for LLMs, and their
challenge of handling the high parameter size. GradualDiff-Fed reduces
communication costs by transmitting only the difference of model weights rather
than the entire model during training rounds. Such an approach significantly
improves scalability and communication efficiency, making it more feasible to
fine-tune LLMs across distributed clients without compromising performance. Our
evaluation demonstrates that GradualDiff-Fed achieves performance on par with
centralized training while drastically reducing communication overhead. These
results highlight the potential of GradualDiff-Fed as an efficient solution for
fine-tuning large models from distributed data in privacy-preserving settings
without comprising performance.

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将工具知识蒸馏到LLMs中，避免了推理时依赖外部工具的问题，为LLMs在数学问题上的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with mathematical problems that
require exact computation or multi-step algebraic reasoning. Tool-integrated
reasoning (TIR) offers a promising solution by leveraging external tools such
as code interpreters to ensure correctness, but it introduces inference-time
dependencies that hinder scalability and deployment. In this work, we propose a
new paradigm for distilling tool knowledge into LLMs purely through natural
language. We first construct a Solver Agent that solves math problems by
interleaving planning, symbolic tool calls, and reflective reasoning. Then,
using a back-translation pipeline powered by multiple LLM-based agents, we
convert interleaved TIR traces into natural language reasoning traces. A
Translator Agent generates explanations for individual tool calls, while a
Rephrase Agent merges them into a fluent and globally coherent narrative.
Empirically, we show that fine-tuning a small open-source model on these
synthesized traces enables it to internalize both tool knowledge and structured
reasoning patterns, yielding gains on competition-level math benchmarks without
requiring tool access at inference.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables transformers to adapt to new tasks through
contextual examples without parameter updates. While existing research has
typically studied ICL in fixed-complexity environments, practical language
models encounter tasks spanning diverse complexity levels. This paper
investigates how transformers navigate hierarchical task structures where
higher-complexity categories can perfectly represent any pattern generated by
simpler ones. We design well-controlled testbeds based on Markov chains and
linear regression that reveal transformers not only identify the appropriate
complexity level for each task but also accurately infer the corresponding
parameters--even when the in-context examples are compatible with multiple
complexity hypotheses. Notably, when presented with data generated by simpler
processes, transformers consistently favor the least complex sufficient
explanation. We theoretically explain this behavior through a Bayesian
framework, demonstrating that transformers effectively implement an in-context
Bayesian Occam's razor by balancing model fit against complexity penalties. We
further ablate on the roles of model size, training mixture distribution,
inference context length, and architecture. Finally, we validate this Occam's
razor-like inductive bias on a pretrained GPT-4 model with Boolean-function
tasks as case study, suggesting it may be inherent to transformers trained on
diverse task distributions.

Abstract: Extreme activation outliers in Large Language Models (LLMs) critically
degrade quantization performance, hindering efficient on-device deployment.
While channel-wise operations and adaptive gradient scaling are recognized
causes, practical mitigation remains challenging. We introduce Outlier-Safe
Pre-Training (OSP), a practical guideline that proactively prevents outlier
formation rather than relying on post-hoc mitigation. OSP combines three key
innovations: (1) the Muon optimizer, eliminating privileged bases while
maintaining training efficiency; (2) Single-Scale RMSNorm, preventing
channel-wise amplification; and (3) a learnable embedding projection,
redistributing activation magnitudes originating from embedding matrices. We
validate OSP by training a 1.4B-parameter model on 1 trillion tokens, which is
the first production-scale LLM trained without such outliers. Under aggressive
4-bit quantization, our OSP model achieves a 35.7 average score across 10
benchmarks (compared to 26.5 for an Adam-trained model), with only a 2%
training overhead. Remarkably, OSP models exhibit near-zero excess kurtosis
(0.04) compared to extreme values (1818.56) in standard models, fundamentally
altering LLM quantization behavior. Our work demonstrates that outliers are not
inherent to LLMs but are consequences of training strategies, paving the way
for more efficient LLM deployment. The source code and pretrained checkpoints

Conclusion: 新方法有效且实用，强调注释质量的重要性。

Abstract: Controlling the patterns a model learns is essential to preventing reliance
on irrelevant or misleading features. Such reliance on irrelevant features,
often called shortcut features, has been observed across domains, including
medical imaging and natural language processing, where it may lead to
real-world harms. A common mitigation strategy leverages annotations (provided
by humans or machines) indicating which features are relevant or irrelevant.
These annotations are compared to model explanations, typically in the form of
feature salience, and used to guide the loss function during training.
Unfortunately, recent works have demonstrated that feature salience methods are
unreliable and therefore offer a poor signal to optimize. In this work, we
propose a simplified objective that simultaneously optimizes for explanation
robustness and mitigation of shortcut learning. Unlike prior objectives with
similar aims, we demonstrate theoretically why our approach ought to be more
effective. Across a comprehensive series of experiments, we show that our
approach consistently reduces test-time misclassifications by 20% compared to
state-of-the-art methods. We also extend prior experimental settings to include
natural language processing tasks. Additionally, we conduct novel ablations
that yield practical insights, including the relative importance of annotation
quality over quantity. Code for our method and experiments is available at:

Result: 在GSM8K、AIME等基准测试中，加速效果从1.4倍提升至2.1倍，且随GPU吞吐量增加扩展性更好。

Conclusion: Lookahead Reasoning通过多层级并行显著提升推理模型解码速度，同时保持答案质量。

Abstract: Reasoning models excel by generating long chain-of-thoughts, but decoding the
resulting thousands of tokens is slow. Token-level speculative decoding (SD)
helps, but its benefit is capped, because the chance that an entire
$\gamma$-token guess is correct falls exponentially as $\gamma$ grows. This
means allocating more compute for longer token drafts faces an algorithmic
ceiling -- making the speedup modest and hardware-agnostic. We raise this
ceiling with Lookahead Reasoning, which exploits a second, step-level layer of
parallelism. Our key insight is that reasoning models generate step-by-step,
and each step needs only to be semantically correct, not exact token matching.
In Lookahead Reasoning, a lightweight draft model proposes several future
steps; the target model expands each proposal in one batched pass, and a
verifier keeps semantically correct steps while letting the target regenerate
any that fail. Token-level SD still operates within each reasoning step, so the
two layers of parallelism multiply. We show Lookahead Reasoning lifts the peak
speedup of SD both theoretically and empirically. Across GSM8K, AIME, and other
benchmarks, Lookahead Reasoning improves the speedup of SD from 1.4x to 2.1x
while preserving answer quality, and its speedup scales better with additional
GPU throughput. Our code is available at

Motivation: 解决正交微调（OFT）的高计算和内存需求问题，以提升实际部署的可行性。

Method: 提出OFTv2，采用输入中心化重构（矩阵-向量乘法）和Cayley-Neumann参数化，降低计算复杂度。

Result: OFTv2实现10倍训练加速和3倍GPU内存节省，并在量化模型微调中优于QLoRA。

Conclusion: OFTv2为高效微调提供了一种可行方案，特别适用于资源受限场景。

Abstract: Orthogonal finetuning (OFT) offers highly parameter-efficient adaptation
while preventing catastrophic forgetting, but its high runtime and memory
demands limit practical deployment. We identify the core computational
bottleneck in OFT as its weight-centric implementation, which relies on costly
matrix-matrix multiplications with cubic complexity. To overcome this, we
propose OFTv2, an input-centric reformulation that instead uses matrix-vector
multiplications (i.e., matrix-free computation), reducing the computational
cost to quadratic. We further introduce the Cayley-Neumann parameterization, an
efficient orthogonal parameterization that approximates the matrix inversion in
Cayley transform via a truncated Neumann series. These modifications allow
OFTv2 to achieve up to 10x faster training and 3x lower GPU memory usage
without compromising performance. In addition, we extend OFTv2 to support
finetuning quantized foundation models and show that it outperforms the popular
QLoRA in training stability, efficiency, and memory usage.

Motivation: 随着神经网络参数规模的增大，理解每个神经单元对高维输出（如文本、图像、语音）的贡献变得至关重要。现有方法（如SHAP）无法满足这一需求。

Method: MSA通过系统性地破坏神经单元组合，利用博弈论框架计算Shapley值，生成与模型输出维度一致的贡献图（Shapley Modes）。

Result: MSA在不同规模的模型（从多层感知机到560亿参数的Mixtral-8x7B和GAN）中验证了其有效性，揭示了计算集中、语言特定专家和GAN中的像素生成层次。

Conclusion: MSA为深度神经网络的解释、编辑和压缩提供了强大工具。

Abstract: Neural networks now generate text, images, and speech with billions of
parameters, producing a need to know how each neural unit contributes to these
high-dimensional outputs. Existing explainable-AI methods, such as SHAP,
attribute importance to inputs, but cannot quantify the contributions of neural
units across thousands of output pixels, tokens, or logits. Here we close that
gap with Multiperturbation Shapley-value Analysis (MSA), a model-agnostic
game-theoretic framework. By systematically lesioning combinations of units,
MSA yields Shapley Modes, unit-wise contribution maps that share the exact
dimensionality of the model's output. We apply MSA across scales, from
multi-layer perceptrons to the 56-billion-parameter Mixtral-8x7B and Generative
Adversarial Networks (GAN). The approach demonstrates how regularisation
concentrates computation in a few hubs, exposes language-specific experts
inside the LLM, and reveals an inverted pixel-generation hierarchy in GANs.
Together, these results showcase MSA as a powerful approach for interpreting,
editing, and compressing deep neural networks.

Abstract: Understanding how language models generalize behaviors from their training to
a broader deployment distribution is an important problem in AI safety. Betley
et al. discovered that fine-tuning GPT-4o on intentionally insecure code causes
"emergent misalignment," where models give stereotypically malicious responses
to unrelated prompts. We extend this work, demonstrating emergent misalignment
across diverse conditions, including reinforcement learning on reasoning
models, fine-tuning on various synthetic datasets, and in models without safety
training. To investigate the mechanisms behind this generalized misalignment,
we apply a "model diffing" approach using sparse autoencoders to compare
internal model representations before and after fine-tuning. This approach
reveals several "misaligned persona" features in activation space, including a
toxic persona feature which most strongly controls emergent misalignment and
can be used to predict whether a model will exhibit such behavior.
Additionally, we investigate mitigation strategies, discovering that
fine-tuning an emergently misaligned model on just a few hundred benign samples
efficiently restores alignment.

Conclusion: HI-SQL为Text-to-SQL系统提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL generation bridges the gap between natural language and
databases, enabling users to query data without requiring SQL expertise. While
large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field, challenges
remain in handling complex queries that involve multi-table joins, nested
conditions, and intricate operations. Existing methods often rely on multi-step
pipelines that incur high computational costs, increase latency, and are prone
to error propagation. To address these limitations, we propose HI-SQL, a
pipeline that incorporates a novel hint generation mechanism utilizing
historical query logs to guide SQL generation. By analyzing prior queries, our
method generates contextual hints that focus on handling the complexities of
multi-table and nested operations. These hints are seamlessly integrated into
the SQL generation process, eliminating the need for costly multi-step
approaches and reducing reliance on human-crafted prompts. Experimental
evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves query accuracy of LLM-generated queries while ensuring
efficiency in terms of LLM calls and latency, offering a robust and practical
solution for enhancing Text-to-SQL systems.

fairness provides a more comprehensive evaluation framework by preserving
causal structure, but current synthetic data generation methods do not address
it in health settings. To fill this gap, we develop the first LLM-augmented
synthetic data generation method to enhance causal fairness using real-world
tabular health data. Our generated data deviates by less than 10% from real

synthetic data reduces bias on the sensitive attribute by 70% compared to real

Abstract: Large deep learning models have achieved significant success in various
tasks. However, the performance of a model can significantly degrade if it is
needed to train on datasets with noisy labels with misleading or ambiguous
information. To date, there are limited investigations on how to restore
performance when model degradation has been incurred by noisy label data.
Inspired by the ``forgetting mechanism'' in neuroscience, which enables
accelerating the relearning of correct knowledge by unlearning the wrong
knowledge, we propose a robust model restoration and refinement (MRR) framework
COLUR, namely Confidence-Oriented Learning, Unlearning and Relearning.
Specifically, we implement COLUR with an efficient co-training architecture to
unlearn the influence of label noise, and then refine model confidence on each
label for relearning. Extensive experiments are conducted on four real datasets
and all evaluation results show that COLUR consistently outperforms other SOTA
methods after MRR.

Abstract: The pursuit of efficient and controllable high-quality content generation
remains a central challenge in artificial intelligence-generated content
(AIGC). While one-step generators, enabled by diffusion distillation
techniques, offer excellent generation quality and computational efficiency,
adapting them to new control conditions--such as structural constraints,
semantic guidelines, or external inputs--poses a significant challenge.
Conventional approaches often necessitate computationally expensive
modifications to the base model and subsequent diffusion distillation. This
paper introduces Noise Consistency Training (NCT), a novel and lightweight
approach to directly integrate new control signals into pre-trained one-step
generators without requiring access to original training images or retraining
the base diffusion model. NCT operates by introducing an adapter module and
employs a noise consistency loss in the noise space of the generator. This loss
aligns the adapted model's generation behavior across noises that are
conditionally dependent to varying degrees, implicitly guiding it to adhere to
the new control. Theoretically, this training objective can be understood as
minimizing the distributional distance between the adapted generator and the
conditional distribution induced by the new conditions. NCT is modular,
data-efficient, and easily deployable, relying only on the pre-trained one-step
generator and a control signal model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
NCT achieves state-of-the-art controllable generation in a single forward pass,
surpassing existing multi-step and distillation-based methods in both
generation quality and computational efficiency. Code is available at

Result: 在MS-COCO数据集上的实验表明，SemPA-Look在保持高ATS和LPIPS分数的同时，计算复杂度降低了40倍。

Conclusion: SemPA-Look是一种高效且实用的令牌通信优化方法，适用于远程AIGC和其他TC应用。

Abstract: Tokens are fundamental processing units of generative AI (GenAI) and large
language models (LLMs), and token communication (TC) is essential for enabling
remote AI-generate content (AIGC) and wireless LLM applications. Unlike
traditional bits, each of which is independently treated, the semantics of each
token depends on its surrounding context tokens. This inter-token dependency
makes TC vulnerable to outage channels, where the loss of a single token can
significantly distort the original message semantics. Motivated by this, this
paper focuses on optimizing token packetization to maximize the average token
similarity (ATS) between the original and received token messages under outage
channels. Due to inter-token dependency, this token grouping problem is
combinatorial, with complexity growing exponentially with message length. To
address this, we propose a novel framework of semantic packet aggregation with
lookahead search (SemPA-Look), built on two core ideas. First, it introduces
the residual semantic score (RSS) as a token-level surrogate for the
message-level ATS, allowing robust semantic preservation even when a certain
token packet is lost. Second, instead of full search, SemPA-Look applies a
lookahead search-inspired algorithm that samples intra-packet token candidates
without replacement (fixed depth), conditioned on inter-packet token candidates
sampled with replacement (fixed width), thereby achieving linear complexity.
Experiments on a remote AIGC task with the MS-COCO dataset (text captioned
images) demonstrate that SemPA-Look achieves high ATS and LPIPS scores
comparable to exhaustive search, while reducing computational complexity by up
to 40$\times$. Compared to other linear-complexity algorithms such as the
genetic algorithm (GA), SemPA-Look achieves 10$\times$ lower complexity,
demonstrating its practicality for remote AIGC and other TC applications.

Abstract: It is difficult to describe in mathematical terms what a neural network
trained on data represents. On the other hand, there is a growing mathematical
understanding of what neural networks are in principle capable of representing.
Feedforward neural networks using the ReLU activation function represent
continuous and piecewise linear functions and can approximate many others. The
study of their expressivity addresses the question: which ones? Contributing to
the available answers, we take the perspective of a neural network as an
algorithm. In this analogy, a neural network is programmed constructively,
rather than trained from data. An interesting example is a sorting algorithm:
we explicitly construct a neural network that sorts its inputs exactly, not
approximately, and that, in a sense, has optimal computational complexity if
the input dimension is large. Such constructed networks may have several
billion parameters. We construct and analyze several other examples, both
existing and new. We find that, in these examples, neural networks as
algorithms are typically recursive and parallel. Compared to conventional
algorithms, ReLU networks are restricted by having to be continuous. Moreover,
the depth of recursion is limited by the depth of the network, with deep
networks having superior properties over shallow ones.

Abstract: Deep state-space models (SSMs) have gained increasing popularity in sequence
modelling. While there are numerous theoretical investigations of shallow SSMs,
how the depth of the SSM affects its expressiveness remains a crucial problem.
In this paper, we systematically investigate the role of depth and width in
deep linear SSMs, aiming to characterize how they influence the expressive
capacity of the architecture. First, we rigorously prove that in the absence of
parameter constraints, increasing depth and increasing width are generally
equivalent, provided that the parameter count remains within the same order of
magnitude. However, under the assumption that the parameter norms are
constrained, the effects of depth and width differ significantly. We show that
a shallow linear SSM with large parameter norms can be represented by a deep
linear SSM with smaller norms using a constructive method. In particular, this
demonstrates that deep SSMs are more capable of representing targets with large
norms than shallow SSMs under norm constraints. Finally, we derive upper bounds
on the minimal depth required for a deep linear SSM to represent a given
shallow linear SSM under constrained parameter norms. We also validate our
theoretical results with numerical experiments

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has become an essential component of modern
conditional diffusion models. Although highly effective in practice, the
underlying mechanisms by which CFG enhances quality, detail, and prompt
alignment are not fully understood. We present a novel perspective on CFG by
analyzing its effects in the frequency domain, showing that low and high
frequencies have distinct impacts on generation quality. Specifically,
low-frequency guidance governs global structure and condition alignment, while
high-frequency guidance mainly enhances visual fidelity. However, applying a
uniform scale across all frequencies -- as is done in standard CFG -- leads to
oversaturation and reduced diversity at high scales and degraded visual quality
at low scales. Based on these insights, we propose frequency-decoupled guidance
(FDG), an effective approach that decomposes CFG into low- and high-frequency
components and applies separate guidance strengths to each component. FDG
improves image quality at low guidance scales and avoids the drawbacks of high
CFG scales by design. Through extensive experiments across multiple datasets
and models, we demonstrate that FDG consistently enhances sample fidelity while
preserving diversity, leading to improved FID and recall compared to CFG,
establishing our method as a plug-and-play alternative to standard
classifier-free guidance.

Abstract: Model regularization requires extensive manual tuning to balance complexity
against overfitting. Cross-regularization resolves this tradeoff by directly
adapting regularization parameters through validation gradients during
training. The method splits parameter optimization - training data guides
feature learning while validation data shapes complexity controls - converging
provably to cross-validation optima. When implemented through noise injection
in neural networks, this approach reveals striking patterns: unexpectedly high
noise tolerance and architecture-specific regularization that emerges
organically during training. Beyond complexity control, the framework

Abstract: Interpretability plays a vital role in aligning and deploying deep learning
models in critical care, especially in constantly evolving conditions that
influence patient survival. However, common interpretability algorithms face
unique challenges when applied to dynamic prediction tasks, where patient
trajectories evolve over time. Gradient, Occlusion, and Permutation-based
methods often struggle with time-varying target dependency and temporal
smoothness. This work systematically analyzes these failure modes and supports
learnable mask-based interpretability frameworks as alternatives, which can
incorporate temporal continuity and label consistency constraints to learn
feature importance over time. Here, we propose that learnable mask-based
approaches for dynamic timeseries prediction problems provide more reliable and
consistent interpretations for applications in critical care and similar
domains.

Abstract: Behavior Cloning (BC) is an effective imitation learning technique and has
even been adopted in some safety-critical domains such as autonomous vehicles.
BC trains a policy to mimic the behavior of an expert by using a dataset
composed of only state-action pairs demonstrated by the expert, without any
additional interaction with the environment. However, During deployment, the
policy observations may contain measurement errors or adversarial disturbances.
Since the observations may deviate from the true states, they can mislead the
agent into making sub-optimal actions. In this work, we use a global Lipschitz
regularization approach to enhance the robustness of the learned policy

Conclusion: ReCalX能有效提升基于扰动的解释的可靠性。

Abstract: Perturbation-based explanations are widely utilized to enhance the
transparency of modern machine-learning models. However, their reliability is
often compromised by the unknown model behavior under the specific
perturbations used. This paper investigates the relationship between
uncertainty calibration - the alignment of model confidence with actual
accuracy - and perturbation-based explanations. We show that models frequently
produce unreliable probability estimates when subjected to
explainability-specific perturbations and theoretically prove that this
directly undermines explanation quality. To address this, we introduce ReCalX,
a novel approach to recalibrate models for improved perturbation-based
explanations while preserving their original predictions. Experiments on
popular computer vision models demonstrate that our calibration strategy
produces explanations that are more aligned with human perception and actual
object locations.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) recently gains growing interests from RL
researchers. However, the performance of offline RL suffers from the
out-of-distribution problem, which can be corrected by feedback in online RL.
Previous offline RL research focuses on restricting the offline algorithm in
in-distribution even in-sample action sampling. In contrast, fewer work pays
attention to the influence of the batch data. In this paper, we first build a
bridge over the batch data and the performance of offline RL algorithms
theoretically, from the perspective of model-based offline RL optimization. We
draw a conclusion that, with mild assumptions, the distance between the
state-action pair distribution generated by the behavioural policy and the
distribution generated by the optimal policy, accounts for the performance gap
between the policy learned by model-based offline RL and the optimal policy.
Secondly, we reveal that in task-agnostic settings, a series of policies
trained by unsupervised RL can minimize the worst-case regret in the
performance gap. Inspired by the theoretical conclusions, UDG (Unsupervised
Data Generation) is devised to generate data and select proper data for offline
training under tasks-agnostic settings. Empirical results demonstrate that UDG
can outperform supervised data generation on solving unknown tasks.

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification is crucial for the trustworthiness of
machine learning applications. Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP) offers a
distribution-free framework for generating prediction sets or intervals with
user-specified confidence. However, standard ICP guarantees are marginal and
typically require a fresh calibration set for each new prediction to maintain
their validity. This paper addresses this practical limitation by demonstrating
how e-conformal prediction, in conjunction with Hoeffding's inequality, can
enable the repeated use of a single calibration set with a high probability of
preserving the desired coverage. Through a case study on the CIFAR-10 dataset,
we train a deep neural network and utilise a calibration set to estimate a
Hoeffding correction. This correction allows us to apply a modified Markov's
inequality, leading to the construction of prediction sets with quantifiable
confidence. Our results illustrate the feasibility of maintaining provable
performance in conformal prediction while enhancing its practicality by
reducing the need for repeated calibration. The code for this work is publicly
available.

Conclusion: CAP为深度学习中的不确定性量化提供了一种理论严谨且实用的方法，计算开销小且易于集成。

Abstract: Deep neural networks require principled uncertainty quantification, yet
existing variational inference methods often employ isotropic Gaussian
approximations in weight space that poorly match the network's inherent
geometry. We address this mismatch by introducing Concentration-Adapted
Perturbations (CAP), a variational framework that models weight uncertainties
directly on the unit hypersphere using von Mises-Fisher distributions. Building
on recent work in radial-directional posterior decompositions and spherical
weight constraints, CAP provides the first complete theoretical framework
connecting directional statistics to practical noise regularization in neural
networks. Our key contribution is an analytical derivation linking vMF
concentration parameters to activation noise variance, enabling each layer to
learn its optimal uncertainty level through a novel closed-form KL divergence
regularizer. In experiments on CIFAR-10, CAP significantly improves model
calibration - reducing Expected Calibration Error by 5.6x - while providing
interpretable layer-wise uncertainty profiles. CAP requires minimal
computational overhead and integrates seamlessly into standard architectures,
offering a theoretically grounded yet practical approach to uncertainty
quantification in deep learning.

Conclusion: DRIFT展示了物理驱动数据转换在深度学习中的潜力，强调了输入优化的重要性。

Abstract: Modern deep learning architectures excel at optimization, but only after the
data has entered the network. The true bottleneck lies in preparing the right
input: minimal, salient, and structured in a way that reflects the essential
patterns of the data. We propose DRIFT (Data Reduction via Informative Feature
Transformation), a novel preprocessing technique inspired by vibrational
analysis in physical systems, to identify and extract the most resonant modes
of input data prior to training. Unlike traditional models that attempt to
learn amidst both signal and noise, DRIFT mimics physics perception by
emphasizing informative features while discarding irrelevant elements. The
result is a more compact and interpretable representation that enhances
training stability and generalization performance. In DRIFT, images are
projected onto a low-dimensional basis formed by spatial vibration mode shapes
of plates, offering a physically grounded feature set. This enables neural
networks to operate with drastically fewer input dimensions (~ 50 features on
MNIST and less than 100 on CIFAR100) while achieving competitive classification
accuracy. Extensive experiments across MNIST and CIFAR100 demonstrate DRIFT's
superiority over standard pixel-based models and PCA in terms of training
stability, resistance to overfitting, and generalization robustness. Notably,
DRIFT displays minimal sensitivity to changes in batch size, network
architecture, and image resolution, further establishing it as a resilient and
efficient data representation strategy. This work shifts the focus from
architecture engineering to input curation and underscores the power of
physics-driven data transformations in advancing deep learning performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI weather forecasting have led to the emergence of
so-called "foundation models", typically defined by expensive pretraining and
minimal fine-tuning for downstream tasks. However, in the natural sciences, a
desirable foundation model should also encode meaningful statistical
relationships between the underlying physical variables. This study evaluates
the performance of the state-of-the-art Aurora foundation model in predicting
hydrological variables, which were not considered during pretraining. We
introduce a lightweight approach using shallow decoders trained on the latent
representations of the pretrained model to predict these new variables. As a
baseline, we compare this to fine-tuning the full model, which allows further
optimization of the latent space while incorporating new variables into both
inputs and outputs. The decoder-based approach requires 50% less training time
and 35% less memory, while achieving strong accuracy across various
hydrological variables and preserving desirable properties of the foundation
model, such as autoregressive stability. Notably, decoder accuracy depends on
the physical correlation between the new variables and those used during
pretraining, indicating that Aurora's latent space captures meaningful physical
relationships. In this sense, we argue that an important quality metric for
foundation models in Earth sciences is their ability to be extended to new
variables without a full fine-tuning. This provides a new perspective for
making foundation models more accessible to communities with limited
computational resources, while supporting broader adoption in Earth sciences.

Abstract: Riemannian representation learning typically relies on approximating
densities on chosen manifolds. This involves optimizing difficult objectives,
potentially harming models. To completely circumvent this issue, we introduce
the Riemannian generative decoder which finds manifold-valued maximum
likelihood latents with a Riemannian optimizer while training a decoder
network. By discarding the encoder, we vastly simplify the manifold constraint
compared to current approaches which often only handle few specific manifolds.
We validate our approach on three case studies -- a synthetic branching
diffusion process, human migrations inferred from mitochondrial DNA, and cells
undergoing a cell division cycle -- each showing that learned representations
respect the prescribed geometry and capture intrinsic non-Euclidean structure.
Our method requires only a decoder, is compatible with existing architectures,
and yields interpretable latent spaces aligned with data geometry.

Abstract: We study model personalization under user-level differential privacy (DP) in
the shared representation framework. In this problem, there are $n$ users whose
data is statistically heterogeneous, and their optimal parameters share an
unknown embedding $U^* \in\mathbb{R}^{d\times k}$ that maps the user parameters
in $\mathbb{R}^d$ to low-dimensional representations in $\mathbb{R}^k$, where
$k\ll d$. Our goal is to privately recover the shared embedding and the local
low-dimensional representations with small excess risk in the federated
setting. We propose a private, efficient federated learning algorithm to learn
the shared embedding based on the FedRep algorithm in [CHM+21]. Unlike
[CHM+21], our algorithm satisfies differential privacy, and our results hold
for the case of noisy labels. In contrast to prior work on private model
personalization [JRS+21], our utility guarantees hold under a larger class of
users' distributions (sub-Gaussian instead of Gaussian distributions).
Additionally, in natural parameter regimes, we improve the privacy error term
in [JRS+21] by a factor of $\widetilde{O}(dk)$. Next, we consider the binary
classification setting. We present an information-theoretic construction to
privately learn the shared embedding and derive a margin-based accuracy
guarantee that is independent of $d$. Our method utilizes the
Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform to reduce the effective dimensions of the
shared embedding and the users' data. This result shows that
dimension-independent risk bounds are possible in this setting under a margin
loss.

Abstract: This paper addresses the increasingly prominent problem of anomaly detection
in distributed systems. It proposes a detection method based on federated
contrastive learning. The goal is to overcome the limitations of traditional
centralized approaches in terms of data privacy, node heterogeneity, and
anomaly pattern recognition. The proposed method combines the distributed
collaborative modeling capabilities of federated learning with the feature
discrimination enhancement of contrastive learning. It builds embedding
representations on local nodes and constructs positive and negative sample
pairs to guide the model in learning a more discriminative feature space.
Without exposing raw data, the method optimizes a global model through a
federated aggregation strategy. Specifically, the method uses an encoder to
represent local behavior data in high-dimensional space. This includes system
logs, operational metrics, and system calls. The model is trained using both
contrastive loss and classification loss to improve its ability to detect
fine-grained anomaly patterns. The method is evaluated under multiple typical
attack types. It is also tested in a simulated real-time data stream scenario
to examine its responsiveness. Experimental results show that the proposed
method outperforms existing approaches across multiple performance metrics. It
demonstrates strong detection accuracy and adaptability, effectively addressing
complex anomalies in distributed environments. Through careful design of key
modules and optimization of the training mechanism, the proposed method
achieves a balance between privacy preservation and detection performance. It
offers a feasible technical path for intelligent security management in
distributed systems.

Abstract: Modern diagnostic workflows are increasingly multimodal, integrating diverse
data sources such as medical images, structured records, and physiological time

of the most widely used modalities for cardiac assessment. While CXRs provide

learning-based framework that leverages chest X-rays during training to learn
clinically informative ECG representations for multiple cardiac-related
pathologies: cardiomegaly, pleural effusion, and edema. Our method aligns ECG
and CXR representations using a novel supervised cross-modal contrastive
objective with adaptive hard negative weighting, enabling robust and

Abstract: Masked Graph Auto-Encoder, a powerful graph self-supervised training
paradigm, has recently shown superior performance in graph representation
learning. Existing works typically rely on node contextual information to
recover the masked information. However, they fail to generalize well to
heterophilic graphs where connected nodes may be not similar, because they
focus only on capturing the neighborhood information and ignoring the
discrepancy information between different nodes, resulting in indistinguishable
node representations. In this paper, to address this issue, we propose a
Discrepancy-Aware Graph Mask Auto-Encoder (DGMAE). It obtains more
distinguishable node representations by reconstructing the discrepancy
information of neighboring nodes during the masking process. We conduct
extensive experiments on 17 widely-used benchmark datasets. The results show
that our DGMAE can effectively preserve the discrepancies of nodes in
low-dimensional space. Moreover, DGMAE significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art graph self-supervised learning methods on three graph analytic
including tasks node classification, node clustering, and graph classification,
demonstrating its remarkable superiority. The code of DGMAE is available at

Conclusion: μTransfer-FNO为FNOs提供了一种高效且可扩展的超参数调优方法。

Abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) offer a principled approach for solving
complex partial differential equations (PDEs). However, scaling them to handle
more complex PDEs requires increasing the number of Fourier modes, which
significantly expands the number of model parameters and makes hyperparameter
tuning computationally impractical. To address this, we introduce
$\mu$Transfer-FNO, a zero-shot hyperparameter transfer technique that enables
optimal configurations, tuned on smaller FNOs, to be directly applied to
billion-parameter FNOs without additional tuning. Building on the Maximal
Update Parametrization ($\mu$P) framework, we mathematically derive a
parametrization scheme that facilitates the transfer of optimal hyperparameters
across models with different numbers of Fourier modes in FNOs, which is
validated through extensive experiments on various PDEs. Our empirical study
shows that Transfer-FNO reduces computational cost for tuning hyperparameters
on large FNOs while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Conclusion: FIM通过引导智能体对关键状态的影响，有效解决了稀疏奖励下的合作问题。

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) under sparse rewards
presents a fundamental challenge due to limited exploration and insufficient
coordinated attention among agents. In this work, we propose the Focusing
Influence Mechanism (FIM), a novel framework that enhances cooperation by
directing agent influence toward task-critical elements, referred to as Center
of Gravity (CoG) state dimensions, inspired by Clausewitz's military theory.
FIM consists of three core components: (1) identifying CoG state dimensions
based on their stability under agent behavior, (2) designing counterfactual
intrinsic rewards to promote meaningful influence on these dimensions, and (3)
encouraging persistent and synchronized focus through eligibility-trace-based
credit accumulation. These mechanisms enable agents to induce more targeted and
effective state transitions, facilitating robust cooperation even in extremely
sparse reward settings. Empirical evaluations across diverse MARL benchmarks
demonstrate that the proposed FIM significantly improves cooperative
performance compared to baselines.

Conclusion: 基于标签的方法比单一类型的方法更灵活和鲁棒，适用于因果发现任务。

Abstract: Not every causal relation between variables is equal, and this can be
leveraged for the task of causal discovery. Recent research shows that pairs of
variables with particular type assignments induce a preference on the causal
direction of other pairs of variables with the same type. Although useful, this
assignment of a specific type to a variable can be tricky in practice. We
propose a tag-based causal discovery approach where multiple tags are assigned
to each variable in a causal graph. Existing causal discovery approaches are
first applied to direct some edges, which are then used to determine edge
relations between tags. Then, these edge relations are used to direct the
undirected edges. Doing so improves upon purely type-based relations, where the
assumption of type consistency lacks robustness and flexibility due to being
restricted to single types for each variable. Our experimental evaluations show
that this boosts causal discovery and that these high-level tag relations fit
common knowledge.

Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success
across diverse scientific applications. However, existing approaches face
critical efficiency challenges when scaling to large geometric graphs and
suffer significant performance degradation when the input graphs are sparsified
for computational tractability. To address these limitations, we introduce
FastEGNN and DistEGNN, two novel enhancements to equivariant GNNs for
large-scale geometric graphs. FastEGNN employs a key innovation: a small
ordered set of virtual nodes that effectively approximates the large unordered
graph of real nodes. Specifically, we implement distinct message passing and
aggregation mechanisms for different virtual nodes to ensure mutual
distinctiveness, and minimize Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between virtual
and real coordinates to achieve global distributedness. This design enables
FastEGNN to maintain high accuracy while efficiently processing large-scale
sparse graphs. For extremely large-scale geometric graphs, we present DistEGNN,
a distributed extension where virtual nodes act as global bridges between
subgraphs in different devices, maintaining consistency while dramatically
reducing memory and computational overhead. We comprehensively evaluate our
models across four challenging domains: N-body systems (100 nodes), protein
dynamics (800 nodes), Water-3D (8,000 nodes), and our new Fluid113K benchmark
(113,000 nodes). Results demonstrate superior efficiency and performance,
establishing new capabilities in large-scale equivariant graph learning. Code

Conclusion: 该研究填补了MU漏洞研究的空白，为隐私保护提供了新视角。

Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) technology facilitates the removal of the influence
of specific data instances from trained models on request. Despite rapid
advancements in MU technology, its vulnerabilities are still underexplored,
posing potential risks of privacy breaches through leaks of ostensibly
unlearned information. Current limited research on MU attacks requires access
to original models containing privacy data, which violates the critical
privacy-preserving objective of MU. To address this gap, we initiate an
innovative study on recalling the forgotten class memberships from unlearned
models (ULMs) without requiring access to the original one. Specifically, we
implement a Membership Recall Attack (MRA) framework with a teacher-student
knowledge distillation architecture, where ULMs serve as noisy labelers to
transfer knowledge to student models. Then, it is translated into a Learning
with Noisy Labels (LNL) problem for inferring the correct labels of the
forgetting instances. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MU methods with
multiple real datasets demonstrate that the proposed MRA strategy exhibits high
efficacy in recovering class memberships of unlearned instances. As a result,
our study and evaluation have established a benchmark for future research on MU
vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: 提出的迭代降维方法可广泛应用于符号回归算法，有效提升性能。

Abstract: Solutions of symbolic regression problems are expressions that are composed
of input variables and operators from a finite set of function symbols. One
measure for evaluating symbolic regression algorithms is their ability to
recover formulae, up to symbolic equivalence, from finite samples. Not
unexpectedly, the recovery problem becomes harder when the formula gets more
complex, that is, when the number of variables and operators gets larger.
Variables in naturally occurring symbolic formulas often appear only in fixed
combinations. This can be exploited in symbolic regression by substituting one
new variable for the combination, effectively reducing the number of variables.
However, finding valid substitutions is challenging. Here, we address this
challenge by searching over the expression space of small substitutions and
testing for validity. The validity test is reduced to a test of functional
dependence. The resulting iterative dimension reduction procedure can be used
with any symbolic regression approach. We show that it reliably identifies
valid substitutions and significantly boosts the performance of different types
of state-of-the-art symbolic regression algorithms.

Result: 结果显示过度调优比预期更常见，约10%的情况下会导致选择的超参数配置比默认配置更差。

Conclusion: 结论强调需要提高对过度调优的认识，特别是在小数据场景下，并建议进一步研究缓解策略。

Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) aims to identify an optimal hyperparameter
configuration (HPC) such that the resulting model generalizes well to unseen
data. As the expected generalization error cannot be optimized directly, it is
estimated with a resampling strategy, such as holdout or cross-validation. This
approach implicitly assumes that minimizing the validation error leads to
improved generalization. However, since validation error estimates are
inherently stochastic and depend on the resampling strategy, a natural question
arises: Can excessive optimization of the validation error lead to overfitting
at the HPO level, akin to overfitting in model training based on empirical risk
minimization? In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon, which we term
overtuning, a form of overfitting specific to HPO. Despite its practical
relevance, overtuning has received limited attention in the HPO and AutoML
literature. We provide a formal definition of overtuning and distinguish it
from related concepts such as meta-overfitting. We then conduct a large-scale
reanalysis of HPO benchmark data to assess the prevalence and severity of
overtuning. Our results show that overtuning is more common than previously
assumed, typically mild but occasionally severe. In approximately 10% of cases,
overtuning leads to the selection of a seemingly optimal HPC with worse
generalization error than the default or first configuration tried. We further
analyze how factors such as performance metric, resampling strategy, dataset
size, learning algorithm, and HPO method affect overtuning and discuss
mitigation strategies. Our results highlight the need to raise awareness of
overtuning, particularly in the small-data regime, indicating that further
mitigation strategies should be studied.

Conclusion: ConCM通过几何最优性和最大匹配性，克服了对类别数量先验的需求，提升了FSCIL性能。

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) requires models to adapt to novel
classes with limited supervision while preserving learned knowledge. Existing
prospective learning-based space construction methods reserve space to
accommodate novel classes. However, prototype deviation and structure fixity
limit the expressiveness of the embedding space. In contrast to fixed space
reservation, we explore the optimization of feature-structure dual consistency
and propose a Consistency-driven Calibration and Matching Framework (ConCM)
that systematically mitigate the knowledge conflict inherent in FSCIL.
Specifically, inspired by hippocampal associative memory, we design a
memory-aware prototype calibration that extracts generalized semantic
attributes from base classes and reintegrates them into novel classes to
enhance the conceptual center consistency of features. Further, we propose
dynamic structure matching, which adaptively aligns the calibrated features to
a session-specific optimal manifold space, ensuring cross-session structure
consistency. Theoretical analysis shows that our method satisfies both
geometric optimality and maximum matching, thereby overcoming the need for
class-number priors. On large-scale FSCIL benchmarks including mini-ImageNet
and CUB200, ConCM achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing current
optimal method by 3.20% and 3.68% in harmonic accuracy of incremental sessions.

Conclusion: FAF在少样本时间序列预测中表现出色，结合通用和特定特征实现鲁棒和个性化预测。

Abstract: Multi-task and few-shot time series forecasting tasks are commonly
encountered in scenarios such as the launch of new products in different
cities. However, traditional time series forecasting methods suffer from
insufficient historical data, which stems from a disregard for the generalized
and specific features among different tasks. For the aforementioned challenges,
we propose the Feature-Adaptive Time Series Forecasting Framework (FAF), which
consists of three key components: the Generalized Knowledge Module (GKM), the
Task-Specific Module (TSM), and the Rank Module (RM). During training phase,
the GKM is updated through a meta-learning mechanism that enables the model to
extract generalized features across related tasks. Meanwhile, the TSM is
trained to capture diverse local dynamics through multiple functional regions,
each of which learns specific features from individual tasks. During testing
phase, the RM dynamically selects the most relevant functional region from the
TSM based on input sequence features, which is then combined with the
generalized knowledge learned by the GKM to generate accurate forecasts. This
design enables FAF to achieve robust and personalized forecasting even with
sparse historical observations We evaluate FAF on five diverse real-world
datasets under few-shot time series forecasting settings. Experimental results
demonstrate that FAF consistently outperforms baselines that include three
categories of time series forecasting methods. In particular, FAF achieves a
41.81\% improvement over the best baseline, iTransformer, on the CO$_2$
emissions dataset.

Abstract: Dynamical systems play a key role in modeling, forecasting, and
decision-making across a wide range of scientific domains. However, variations
in system parameters, also referred to as parametric variability, can lead to
drastically different model behavior and output, posing challenges for
constructing models that generalize across parameter regimes. In this work, we
introduce the Parametric Hypernetwork for Learning Interpolated Networks
(PHLieNet), a framework that simultaneously learns: (a) a global mapping from
the parameter space to a nonlinear embedding and (b) a mapping from the
inferred embedding to the weights of a dynamics propagation network. The
learned embedding serves as a latent representation that modulates a base
network, termed the hypernetwork, enabling it to generate the weights of a
target network responsible for forecasting the system's state evolution
conditioned on the previous time history. By interpolating in the space of
models rather than observations, PHLieNet facilitates smooth transitions across
parameterized system behaviors, enabling a unified model that captures the
dynamic behavior across a broad range of system parameterizations. The
performance of the proposed technique is validated in a series of dynamical
systems with respect to its ability to extrapolate in time and interpolate and
extrapolate in the parameter space, i.e., generalize to dynamics that were
unseen during training. In all cases, our approach outperforms or matches
state-of-the-art baselines in both short-term forecast accuracy and in
capturing long-term dynamical features, such as attractor statistics.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting can be trivially alleviated by keeping all data from
previous tasks in memory. Therefore, minimizing the memory footprint while
maximizing the amount of relevant information is crucial to the challenge of
continual learning. This paper aims to decrease required memory for
memory-based continuous learning algorithms. We explore the options of
extracting a minimal amount of information, while maximally alleviating
forgetting. We propose the usage of lightweight generators based on Singular
Value Decomposition to enhance existing continual learning methods, such as
A-GEM and Experience Replay. These generators need a minimal amount of memory
while being maximally effective. They require no training time, just a single
linear-time fitting step, and can capture a distribution effectively from a
small number of data samples. Depending on the dataset and network
architecture, our results show a significant increase in average accuracy
compared to the original methods. Our method shows great potential in
minimizing the memory footprint of memory-based continual learning algorithms.

Abstract: Growing concerns over data privacy underscore the need for deep learning
methods capable of processing sensitive information without compromising
confidentiality. Among privacy-enhancing technologies, Homomorphic Encryption
(HE) stands out by providing post-quantum cryptographic security and end-to-end
data protection, safeguarding data even during computation. While Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) have gained attention in HE settings, their use has largely
been restricted to encrypted inference. Prior research on encrypted training
has primarily focused on logistic regression or has relied on multi-party
computation to enable model fine-tuning. This stems from the substantial
computational overhead and algorithmic complexity involved in DNNs training
under HE. In this paper, we present ReBoot, the first framework to enable fully
encrypted and non-interactive training of DNNs. Built upon the CKKS scheme,
ReBoot introduces a novel HE-compliant neural network architecture based on
local error signals, specifically designed to minimize multiplicative depth and
reduce noise accumulation. ReBoot employs a tailored packing strategy that
leverages real-number arithmetic via SIMD operations, significantly lowering
both computational and memory overhead. Furthermore, by integrating approximate
bootstrapping, ReBoot learning algorithm supports effective training of
arbitrarily deep multi-layer perceptrons, making it well-suited for machine
learning as-a-service. ReBoot is evaluated on both image recognition and
tabular benchmarks, achieving accuracy comparable to 32-bit floating-point
plaintext training while enabling fully encrypted training. It improves test
accuracy by up to +3.27% over encrypted logistic regression, and up to +6.83%
over existing encrypted DNN frameworks, while reducing training latency by up
to 8.83x. ReBoot is made available to the scientific community as a public

Abstract: While diffusion models generate high-quality images via probability flow, the
theoretical understanding of this process remains incomplete. A key question is
when probability flow converges to training samples or more general points on
the data manifold. We analyze this by studying the probability flow of shallow
ReLU neural network denoisers trained with minimal $\ell^2$ norm. For
intuition, we introduce a simpler score flow and show that for orthogonal
datasets, both flows follow similar trajectories, converging to a training
point or a sum of training points. However, early stopping by the diffusion
time scheduler allows probability flow to reach more general manifold points.
This reflects the tendency of diffusion models to both memorize training
samples and generate novel points that combine aspects of multiple samples,
motivating our study of such behavior in simplified settings. We extend these
results to obtuse simplex data and, through simulations in the orthogonal case,
confirm that probability flow converges to a training point, a sum of training
points, or a manifold point. Moreover, memorization decreases when the number
of training samples grows, as fewer samples accumulate near training points.

Abstract: This work establishes that sparse Bayesian neural networks achieve optimal
posterior contraction rates over anisotropic Besov spaces and their
hierarchical compositions. These structures reflect the intrinsic
dimensionality of the underlying function, thereby mitigating the curse of
dimensionality. Our analysis shows that Bayesian neural networks equipped with
either sparse or continuous shrinkage priors attain the optimal rates which are
dependent on the intrinsic dimension of the true structures. Moreover, we show
that these priors enable rate adaptation, allowing the posterior to contract at
the optimal rate even when the smoothness level of the true function is
unknown. The proposed framework accommodates a broad class of functions,
including additive and multiplicative Besov functions as special cases. These
results advance the theoretical foundations of Bayesian neural networks and
provide rigorous justification for their practical effectiveness in
high-dimensional, structured estimation problems.

Abstract: We study classical asymmetric binary perceptron (ABP) and associated
\emph{local entropy} (LE) as potential source of its algorithmic hardness.
Isolation of \emph{typical} ABP solutions in SAT phase seemingly suggests a
universal algorithmic hardness. Paradoxically, efficient algorithms do exist
even for constraint densities $\alpha$ fairly close but at a finite distance
(\emph{computational gap}) from the capacity. In recent years, existence of
rare large dense clusters and magical ability of fast algorithms to find them
have been posited as the conceptual resolution of this paradox. Monotonicity or
breakdown of the LEs associated with such \emph{atypical} clusters are
predicated to play a key role in their thinning-out or even complete
defragmentation.
  Invention of fully lifted random duality theory (fl RDT) [90,93,94] allows
studying random structures \emph{typical} features. A large deviation upgrade,
sfl LD RDT [96,97], moves things further and enables \emph{atypical} features
characterizations as well. Utilizing the machinery of [96,97] we here develop a
generic framework to study LE as an ABP's atypical feature. Already on the
second level of lifting we discover that the LE results are closely matching
those obtained through replica methods. For classical zero threshold ABP, we
obtain that LE breaks down for $\alpha$ in $(0.77,0.78)$ interval which
basically matches $\alpha\sim 0.75-0.77$ range that currently best ABP solvers
can handle and effectively indicates that LE's behavior might indeed be among
key reflections of the ABP's computational gaps presumable existence.

Method: 提出WebGuard++框架，包括跨尺度URL编码器、子图感知HTML编码器、双向耦合模块和投票模块，结合Transformer和动态卷积等技术。

Result: 实验显示WebGuard++在固定FPR下，TPR比现有方法高1.1x-7.9x。

Conclusion: WebGuard++通过多模态特征融合和双向交互，显著提升了恶意URL检测的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: URL+HTML feature fusion shows promise for robust malicious URL detection,
since attacker artifacts persist in DOM structures. However, prior work suffers
from four critical shortcomings: (1) incomplete URL modeling, failing to
jointly capture lexical patterns and semantic context; (2) HTML graph sparsity,
where threat-indicative nodes (e.g., obfuscated scripts) are isolated amid
benign content, causing signal dilution during graph aggregation; (3)
unidirectional analysis, ignoring URL-HTML feature bidirectional interaction;
and (4) opaque decisions, lacking attribution to malicious DOM components. To
address these challenges, we present WebGuard++, a detection framework with 4
novel components: 1) Cross-scale URL Encoder: Hierarchically learns
local-to-global and coarse to fine URL features based on Transformer network
with dynamic convolution. 2) Subgraph-aware HTML Encoder: Decomposes DOM graphs
into interpretable substructures, amplifying sparse threat signals via
Hierarchical feature fusion. 3) Bidirectional Coupling Module: Aligns URL and
HTML embeddings through cross-modal contrastive learning, optimizing
inter-modal consistency and intra-modal specificity. 4) Voting Module:
Localizes malicious regions through consensus voting on malicious subgraph
predictions. Experiments show WebGuard++ achieves significant improvements over
state-of-the-art baselines, achieving 1.1x-7.9x higher TPR at fixed FPR of
0.001 and 0.0001 across both datasets.

Motivation: 解决量子极值学习（QEL）在未知区域可能过于乐观预测的问题，通过引入保守目标模型（COM）来提升泛化能力。

Method: 结合QEL和COM，利用量子神经网络的表达能力，同时通过保守建模确保预测的谨慎性。

Result: 在基准优化任务中，COM-QEL比原始QEL更可靠地找到具有更高真实目标值的解决方案。

Conclusion: COM-QEL在离线设计问题中表现出优越性，验证了其结合量子神经网络和保守建模的有效性。

Abstract: Offline model-based optimization (MBO) refers to the task of optimizing a
black-box objective function using only a fixed set of prior input-output data,
without any active experimentation. Recent work has introduced quantum extremal
learning (QEL), which leverages the expressive power of variational quantum
circuits to learn accurate surrogate functions by training on a few data
points. However, as widely studied in the classical machine learning
literature, predictive models may incorrectly extrapolate objective values in
unexplored regions, leading to the selection of overly optimistic solutions. In
this paper, we propose integrating QEL with conservative objective models (COM)
- a regularization technique aimed at ensuring cautious predictions on
out-of-distribution inputs. The resulting hybrid algorithm, COM-QEL, builds on
the expressive power of quantum neural networks while safeguarding
generalization via conservative modeling. Empirical results on benchmark
optimization tasks demonstrate that COM-QEL reliably finds solutions with
higher true objective values compared to the original QEL, validating its
superiority for offline design problems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种称为特征差分隐私（FDP）的新框架，用于在特定保护属性上提供隐私保护，避免传统差分隐私（DP）的效用损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统差分隐私对所有数据属性提供保护，但在某些应用中仅需保护特定属性，导致不必要的效用损失。FDP旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过模拟定义FDP，支持添加/移除和替换隐私变体，并处理任意和自适应的保护与非保护特征分离。提出了满足FDP的DP-SGD改进算法。

Result: 在AFHQ数据集上训练扩散模型，FID从286.7（传统DP）显著提升至101.9（FDP），同时保持强隐私保证。

Conclusion: FDP提供了一种更灵活和高效的隐私保护方法，显著提升了模型效用。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) has become the standard for private data analysis.
Certain machine learning applications only require privacy protection for
specific protected attributes. Using naive variants of differential privacy in
such use cases can result in unnecessary degradation of utility. In this work,
we refine the definition of DP to create a more general and flexible framework
that we call feature differential privacy (FDP). Our definition is
simulation-based and allows for both addition/removal and replacement variants
of privacy, and can handle arbitrary and adaptive separation of protected and
non-protected features. We prove the properties of FDP, such as adaptive
composition, and demonstrate its implications for limiting attribute inference
attacks. We also propose a modification of the standard DP-SGD algorithm that
satisfies FDP while leveraging desirable properties such as amplification via
sub-sampling. We apply our framework to various machine learning tasks and show
that it can significantly improve the utility of DP-trained models when public
features are available. For example, we train diffusion models on the AFHQ
dataset of animal faces and observe a drastic improvement in FID compared to
DP, from 286.7 to 101.9 at $\epsilon=8$, assuming that the blurred version of a
training image is available as a public feature. Overall, our work provides a
new approach to private data analysis that can help reduce the utility cost of
DP while still providing strong privacy guarantees.

Abstract: To address the challenges of untimely detection and online monitoring lag in
injection molding quality anomalies, this study proposes a mixed feature
attention-artificial neural network (MFA-ANN) model for high-precision online
prediction of product weight. By integrating mechanism-based with data-driven
analysis, the proposed architecture decouples time series data (e.g., melt flow
dynamics, thermal profiles) from non-time series data (e.g., mold features,
pressure settings), enabling hierarchical feature extraction. A self-attention
mechanism is strategically embedded during cross-domain feature fusion to
dynamically calibrate inter-modality feature weights, thereby emphasizing
critical determinants of weight variability. The results demonstrate that the
MFA-ANN model achieves a RMSE of 0.0281 with 0.5 g weight fluctuation
tolerance, outperforming conventional benchmarks: a 25.1% accuracy improvement
over non-time series ANN models, 23.0% over LSTM networks, 25.7% over SVR, and
15.6% over RF models, respectively. Ablation studies quantitatively validate
the synergistic enhancement derived from the integration of mixed feature
modeling (contributing 22.4%) and the attention mechanism (contributing 11.2%),
significantly enhancing the model's adaptability to varying working conditions
and its resistance to noise. Moreover, critical sensitivity analyses further
reveal that data resolution significantly impacts prediction reliability,
low-fidelity sensor inputs degrade performance by 23.8% RMSE compared to
high-precision measurements. Overall, this study provides an efficient and
reliable solution for the intelligent quality control of injection molding
processes.

Abstract: Bridges, as critical components of civil infrastructure, are increasingly
affected by deterioration, making reliable traffic monitoring essential for
assessing their remaining service life. Among operational loads, traffic load
plays a pivotal role, and recent advances in deep learning - particularly in
computer vision (CV) - have enabled progress toward continuous, automated
monitoring. However, CV-based approaches suffer from limitations, including
privacy concerns and sensitivity to lighting conditions, while traditional
non-vision-based methods often lack flexibility in deployment and validation.
To bridge this gap, we propose a fully automated deep-learning pipeline for
continuous traffic monitoring using structural health monitoring (SHM) sensor
networks. Our approach integrates CV-assisted high-resolution dataset
generation with supervised training and inference, leveraging graph neural
networks (GNNs) to capture the spatial structure and interdependence of sensor
data. By transferring knowledge from CV outputs to SHM sensors, the proposed
framework enables sensor networks to achieve comparable accuracy of
vision-based systems, with minimal human intervention. Applied to accelerometer
and strain gauge data in a real-world case study, the model achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with classification accuracies of 99% for light

Abstract: In dynamic graphs, preserving temporal continuity is critical. However,
Memory-based Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (MDGNNs) trained with large batches
often disrupt event sequences, leading to temporal information loss. This
discontinuity not only deteriorates temporal modeling but also hinders
optimization by increasing the difficulty of parameter convergence. Our
theoretical study quantifies this through a Lipschitz upper bound, showing that
large batch sizes enlarge the parameter search space. In response, we propose
BADGNN, a novel batch-agnostic framework consisting of two core components: (1)
Temporal Lipschitz Regularization (TLR) to control parameter search space
expansion, and (2) Adaptive Attention Adjustment (A3) to alleviate attention
distortion induced by both regularization and batching. Empirical results on
three benchmark datasets show that BADGNN maintains strong performance while
enabling significantly larger batch sizes and faster training compared to TGN.

Abstract: To understand how genetic variants in human genomes manifest in phenotypes --
traits like height or diseases like asthma -- geneticists have sequenced and
measured hundreds of thousands of individuals. Geneticists use this data to
build models that predict how a genetic variant impacts phenotype given genomic
features of the variant, like DNA accessibility or the presence of nearby
DNA-bound proteins. As more data and features become available, one might
expect predictive models to improve. Unfortunately, training these models is
bottlenecked by the need to solve expensive linear algebra problems because
variants in the genome are correlated with nearby variants, requiring inversion
of large matrices. Previous methods have therefore been restricted to fitting
small models, and fitting simplified summary statistics, rather than the full
likelihood of the statistical model. In this paper, we leverage modern fast
linear algebra techniques to develop DeepWAS (Deep genome Wide Association
Studies), a method to train large and flexible neural network predictive models
to optimize likelihood. Notably, we find that larger models only improve
performance when using our full likelihood approach; when trained by fitting
traditional summary statistics, larger models perform no better than small
ones. We find larger models trained on more features make better predictions,
potentially improving disease predictions and therapeutic target
identification.

Abstract: In a regression task, a function is learned from labeled data to predict the
labels at new data points. The goal is to achieve small prediction errors. In
symbolic regression, the goal is more ambitious, namely, to learn an
interpretable function that makes small prediction errors. This additional goal
largely rules out the standard approach used in regression, that is, reducing
the learning problem to learning parameters of an expansion of basis functions
by optimization. Instead, symbolic regression methods search for a good
solution in a space of symbolic expressions. To cope with the typically vast
search space, most symbolic regression methods make implicit, or sometimes even
explicit, assumptions about its structure. Here, we argue that the only obvious
structure of the search space is that it contains small expressions, that is,
expressions that can be decomposed into a few subexpressions. We show that
systematically searching spaces of small expressions finds solutions that are
more accurate and more robust against noise than those obtained by
state-of-the-art symbolic regression methods. In particular, systematic search
outperforms state-of-the-art symbolic regressors in terms of its ability to
recover the true underlying symbolic expressions on established benchmark data
sets.

Abstract: The resilience of critical infrastructure networks (CINs) after disruptions,
such as those caused by natural hazards, depends on both the speed of
restoration and the extent to which operational functionality can be regained.
Allocating resources for restoration is a combinatorial optimal planning
problem that involves determining which crews will repair specific network
nodes and in what order. This paper presents a novel graph-based formulation
that merges two interconnected graphs, representing crew and transportation
nodes and power grid nodes, into a single heterogeneous graph. To enable
efficient planning, graph reinforcement learning (GRL) is integrated with
bigraph matching. GRL is utilized to design the incentive function for
assigning crews to repair tasks based on the graph-abstracted state of the
environment, ensuring generalization across damage scenarios. Two learning
techniques are employed: a graph neural network trained using Proximal Policy
Optimization and another trained via Neuroevolution. The learned incentive
functions inform a bipartite graph that links crews to repair tasks, enabling
weighted maximum matching for crew-to-task allocations. An efficient simulation
environment that pre-computes optimal node-to-node path plans is used to train
the proposed restoration planning methods. An IEEE 8500-bus power distribution
test network coupled with a 21 square km transportation network is used as the
case study, with scenarios varying in terms of numbers of damaged nodes,
depots, and crews. Results demonstrate the approach's generalizability and
scalability across scenarios, with learned policies providing 3-fold better
performance than random policies, while also outperforming optimization-based
solutions in both computation time (by several orders of magnitude) and power
restored.

Abstract: We study online convex optimization on $\ell_p$-balls in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for
$p > 2$. While always sub-linear, the optimal regret exhibits a shift between
the high-dimensional setting ($d > T$), when the dimension $d$ is greater than
the time horizon $T$ and the low-dimensional setting ($d \leq T$). We show that
Follow-the-Regularised-Leader (FTRL) with time-varying regularisation which is
adaptive to the dimension regime is anytime optimal for all dimension regimes.
Motivated by this, we ask whether it is possible to obtain anytime optimality
of FTRL with fixed non-adaptive regularisation. Our main result establishes
that for separable regularisers, adaptivity in the regulariser is necessary,
and that any fixed regulariser will be sub-optimal in one of the two dimension
regimes. Finally, we provide lower bounds which rule out sub-linear regret
bounds for the linear bandit problem in sufficiently high-dimension for all

Motivation: 传统PINNs受限于计算资源，通常使用有限点集进行优化，难以保证收敛性和准确性。

Method: 提出了一种自适应权重方案，动态调整损失函数权重，从孤立点扩展到连续邻域。

Result: 实验结果表明，新方案能将相对$L^2$误差降至更低水平。

Conclusion: 自适应权重方案有效提升了PINNs的性能，为PDE求解提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are extensively employed to solve
partial differential equations (PDEs) by ensuring that the outputs and
gradients of deep learning models adhere to the governing equations. However,
constrained by computational limitations, PINNs are typically optimized using a
finite set of points, which poses significant challenges in guaranteeing their
convergence and accuracy. In this study, we proposed a new weighting scheme
that will adaptively change the weights to the loss functions from isolated
points to their continuous neighborhood regions. The empirical results show
that our weighting scheme can reduce the relative $L^2$ errors to a lower
value.

Method: 定义“可预测错误”标签，基于假设类进行预测验证，展示错误界限的三分法。

Result: 证明任何假设类的最优错误界限为Theta(1)、Theta(sqrt(N))或N。

Conclusion: 模糊在线学习在多值场景中具有理论优势，错误界限明确。

Abstract: We propose a new variant of online learning that we call "ambiguous online
learning". In this setting, the learner is allowed to produce multiple
predicted labels. Such an "ambiguous prediction" is considered correct when at
least one of the labels is correct, and none of the labels are "predictably
wrong". The definition of "predictably wrong" comes from a hypothesis class in
which hypotheses are also multi-valued. Thus, a prediction is "predictably
wrong" if it's not allowed by the (unknown) true hypothesis. In particular,
this setting is natural in the context of multivalued dynamical systems,
recommendation algorithms and lossless compression. It is also strongly related
to so-called "apple tasting". We show that in this setting, there is a
trichotomy of mistake bounds: up to logarithmic factors, any hypothesis class
has an optimal mistake bound of either Theta(1), Theta(sqrt(N)) or N.

Conclusion: 数据中存在足够信息支持AI模型模仿策展行为，未来更多数据可能使AI更接近人类策展水平。

Abstract: Art curatorship has always been mostly the subjective work of human experts,
who, with extensive knowledge of many and diverse artworks, select a few of
those to present in communal spaces, spaces that evolved into what we now call
art galleries. There are no hard and fast set of rules on how to select these
artworks, given a theme which either is presented to the art curator or
constructed by her/him. Here we present a series of artificial models -- a
total of four related models -- based on machine learning techniques (a subset
of artificial intelligence) that attempt to learn from existing exhibitions
which have been curated by human experts, in order to be able to do similar
curatorship work. We focus exclusively on the last 25 years of past exhibitions
at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, due to the quality of the data
available and the physical and time limitations of our research. Our four
artificial intelligence models achieve a reasonable ability at imitating these
various curators responsible for all those exhibitions, with various degrees of
precision and curatorial coherence. In particular, we can conclude two key
insights: first, that there is sufficient information in these exhibitions to
construct an artificial intelligence model that replicates past exhibitions
with an accuracy well above random choices; second, that using feature
engineering and carefully designing the architecture of modest size models can
make them as good as those using the so-called large language models such as
GPT in a brute force approach. We also believe, based on small attempts to use
the models in out-of-sample experiments, that given more much more data, it
should be possible for these kinds of artificial intelligence agents to be
closer and closer to the aesthetic and curatorial judgment of human art
curators.

be deterred effectively with most current methods which focused on
characterizing past threats. Adaptive anomaly detection (AAD) is among the most
promising techniques to detect evolving cyberattacks focused on fast data

We present a comprehensive SLR, gathering 397 relevant papers and
systematically analyzing 65 of them (47 research and 18 survey papers) on AAD
in CPS studies from 2013 to 2023 (November). We introduce a novel taxonomy
considering attack types, CPS application, learning paradigm, data management,

works focused on a single aspect of adaptation (either data processing or model
adaptation) but rarely in both at the same time. We aim to help researchers to
advance the state of the art and help practitioners to become familiar with
recent progress in this field. We identify the limitations of the state of the

Abstract: Particle physics theories, such as those which explain neutrino flavor
mixing, arise from a vast landscape of model-building possibilities. A model's
construction typically relies on the intuition of theorists. It also requires
considerable effort to identify appropriate symmetry groups, assign field
representations, and extract predictions for comparison with experimental data.
We develop an Autonomous Model Builder (AMBer), a framework in which a
reinforcement learning agent interacts with a streamlined physics software
pipeline to search these spaces efficiently. AMBer selects symmetry groups,
particle content, and group representation assignments to construct viable
models while minimizing the number of free parameters introduced. We validate
our approach in well-studied regions of theory space and extend the exploration
to a novel, previously unexamined symmetry group. While demonstrated in the
context of neutrino flavor theories, this approach of reinforcement learning
with physics software feedback may be extended to other theoretical
model-building problems in the future.

Abstract: Causal decomposition analysis aims to assess the effect of modifying risk
factors on reducing social disparities in outcomes. Recently, this analysis has
incorporated individual characteristics when modifying risk factors by
utilizing optimal treatment regimes (OTRs). Since the newly defined
individualized effects rely on the no omitted confounding assumption,
developing sensitivity analyses to account for potential omitted confounding is
essential. Moreover, OTRs and individualized effects are primarily based on
binary risk factors, and no formal approach currently exists to benchmark the
strength of omitted confounding using observed covariates for binary risk
factors. To address this gap, we extend a simulation-based sensitivity analysis
that simulates unmeasured confounders, addressing two sources of bias emerging
from deriving OTRs and estimating individualized effects. Additionally, we
propose a formal bounding strategy that benchmarks the strength of omitted
confounding for binary risk factors. Using the High School Longitudinal Study
2009 (HSLS:09), we demonstrate this sensitivity analysis and benchmarking
method.

Abstract: We consider the problem of online dynamic mechanism design for sequential
auctions in unknown environments, where the underlying market and, thus, the
bidders' values vary over time as interactions between the seller and the
bidders progress. We model the sequential auctions as an infinite-horizon
average-reward Markov decision process (MDP), where the transition kernel and
reward functions are unknown to the seller. In each round, the seller
determines an allocation and a payment for each bidder. Each bidder receives a
private reward and submits a sealed bid to the seller. The state, which
represents the underlying market, evolves according to an unknown transition
kernel and the seller's allocation policy. Unlike existing works that formulate
the problem as a multi-armed bandit model or as an episodic MDP, where the
environment resets to an initial state after each round or episode, our paper
considers a more realistic and sophisticated setting in which the market
continues to evolve without restarting. We first extend the
Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism, which is known to be efficient,
truthful, and individually rational for one-shot static auctions, to sequential
auctions, thereby obtaining a dynamic VCG mechanism counterpart that preserves
these desired properties. We then focus on the online setting and develop an
online reinforcement learning algorithm for the seller to learn the underlying
MDP model and implement a mechanism that closely resembles the dynamic VCG
mechanism. We show that the learned online mechanism asymptotically converges
to a dynamic mechanism that approximately satisfies efficiency, truthfulness,
and individual rationality with arbitrarily high probability and achieves
guaranteed performance in terms of various notions of regret.

Abstract: Uplift modeling has achieved significant success in various fields,
particularly in online marketing. It is a method that primarily utilizes
machine learning and deep learning to estimate individual treatment effects.
This paper we apply uplift modeling to analyze the effect of company adjustment
on their financial status, and we treat these adjustment as treatments or
interventions in this study. Although there have been extensive studies and
application regarding binary treatments, multiple treatments, and continuous
treatments, company adjustment are often more complex than these scenarios, as
they constitute a series of multiple time-dependent actions. The effect
estimation of company adjustment needs to take into account not only individual
treatment traits but also the temporal order of this series of treatments. This
study collects a real-world data set about company financial statements and
reported behavior in Luxembourg for the experiments. First, we use two
meta-learners and three other well-known uplift models to analyze different
company adjustment by simplifying the adjustment as binary treatments.
Furthermore, we propose a new uplift modeling framework (MTDnet) to address the
time-dependent nature of these adjustment, and the experimental result shows
the necessity of considering the timing of these adjustment.

Abstract: In was recently established that for convex optimization problems with a
sparse optimal solution (may it be entry-wise sparsity or matrix rank-wise
sparsity) it is possible to have linear convergence rates which depend on an
improved mixed-norm condition number of the form $\frac{\beta_1{}s}{\alpha_2}$,
where $\beta_1$ is the $\ell_1$-Lipchitz continuity constant of the gradient,
$\alpha_2$ is the $\ell_2$-quadratic growth constant, and $s$ is the sparsity
of the optimal solution. However, beyond the improved convergence rate, these
methods are unable to leverage the sparsity of optimal solutions towards
improving also the runtime of each iteration, which may still be prohibitively
high for high-dimensional problems. In this work, we establish that linear
convergence rates which depend on this improved condition number can be
obtained using only sparse updates, which may result in overall significantly
improved running times. Moreover, our methods are considerably easier to
implement.

Abstract: Current electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding models are typically trained on

First, the Transfer Challenge asks participants to build and test a model that
can zero-shot decode new tasks and new subjects from their EEG data. Second,
the Psychopathology factor prediction Challenge asks participants to infer
subject measures of mental health from EEG data. For this, we use an
unprecedented, multi-terabyte dataset of high-density EEG signals (128
channels) recorded from over 3,000 child to young adult subjects engaged in
multiple active and passive tasks. We provide several tunable neural network
baselines for each of these two challenges, including a simple network and
demographic-based regression models. Developing models that generalise across
tasks and individuals will pave the way for ML network architectures capable of
adapting to EEG data collected from diverse tasks and individuals. Similarly,
predicting mental health-relevant personality trait values from EEG might
identify objective biomarkers useful for clinical diagnosis and design of
personalised treatment for psychological conditions. Ultimately, the advances
spurred by this challenge could contribute to the development of computational
psychiatry and useful neurotechnology, and contribute to breakthroughs in both
fundamental neuroscience and applied clinical research.

Abstract: The growing reliance on power electronics introduces new challenges requiring
detailed time-domain analyses with fast and accurate circuit simulation tools.
Currently, commercial time-domain simulation software are mainly relying on
physics-based methods to simulate power electronics. Recent work showed that
data-driven and physics-informed learning methods can increase simulation speed
with limited compromise on accuracy, but many challenges remain before
deployment in commercial tools can be possible. In this paper, we propose a
physics-informed bidirectional long-short term memory neural network
(BiLSTM-PINN) model to simulate the time-domain response of a closed-loop dc-dc
boost converter for various operating points, parameters, and perturbations. A
physics-informed fully-connected neural network (FCNN) and a BiLSTM are also
trained to establish a comparison. The three methods are then compared using
step-response tests to assess their performance and limitations in terms of
accuracy. The results show that the BiLSTM-PINN and BiLSTM models outperform
the FCNN model by more than 9 and 4.5 times, respectively, in terms of median
RMSE. Their standard deviation values are more than 2.6 and 1.7 smaller than
the FCNN's, making them also more consistent. Those results illustrate that the
proposed BiLSTM-PINN is a potential alternative to other physics-based or
data-driven methods for power electronics simulations.

Abstract: Federated learning systems increasingly rely on diverse network topologies to
address scalability and organizational constraints. While existing privacy
research focuses on gradient-based attacks, the privacy implications of network
topology knowledge remain critically understudied. We conduct the first
comprehensive analysis of topology-based privacy leakage across realistic
adversarial knowledge scenarios, demonstrating that adversaries with varying
degrees of structural knowledge can infer sensitive data distribution patterns
even under strong differential privacy guarantees. Through systematic
evaluation of 4,720 attack instances, we analyze six distinct adversarial
knowledge scenarios: complete topology knowledge and five partial knowledge
configurations reflecting real-world deployment constraints. We propose three
complementary attack vectors: communication pattern analysis, parameter
magnitude profiling, and structural position correlation, achieving success
rates of 84.1%, 65.0%, and 47.2% under complete knowledge conditions.
Critically, we find that 80% of realistic partial knowledge scenarios maintain
attack effectiveness above security thresholds, with certain partial knowledge
configurations achieving performance superior to the baseline complete
knowledge scenario. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose and
empirically validate structural noise injection as a complementary defense
mechanism across 808 configurations, demonstrating up to 51.4% additional
attack reduction when properly layered with existing privacy techniques. These
results establish that network topology represents a fundamental privacy
vulnerability in federated learning systems while providing practical pathways
for mitigation through topology-aware defense mechanisms.

Conclusion: qPGA为量子机器学习提供了一种可扩展且抗噪声的解决方案。

Abstract: Efficiently embedding high-dimensional datasets onto noisy and low-qubit
quantum systems is a significant barrier to practical Quantum Machine Learning
(QML). Approaches such as quantum autoencoders can be constrained by current
hardware capabilities and may exhibit vulnerabilities to reconstruction attacks
due to their invertibility. We propose Quantum Principal Geodesic Analysis
(qPGA), a novel, non-invertible method for dimensionality reduction and
qubit-efficient encoding. Executed classically, qPGA leverages Riemannian
geometry to project data onto the unit Hilbert sphere, generating outputs
inherently suitable for quantum amplitude encoding. This technique preserves
the neighborhood structure of high-dimensional datasets within a compact latent
space, significantly reducing qubit requirements for amplitude encoding. We
derive theoretical bounds quantifying qubit requirements for effective encoding
onto noisy systems. Empirical results on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10
show that qPGA preserves local structure more effectively than both quantum and
hybrid autoencoders. Additionally, we demonstrate that qPGA enhances resistance
to reconstruction attacks due to its non-invertible nature. In downstream QML
classification tasks, qPGA can achieve over 99% accuracy and F1-score on MNIST
and Fashion-MNIST, outperforming quantum-dependent baselines. Initial tests on
real hardware and noisy simulators confirm its potential for noise-resilient
performance, offering a scalable solution for advancing QML applications.

Abstract: We present Compressible Atmospheric Model-Network (CAM-NET), an AI model
designed to predict neutral atmospheric variables from the Earth's surface to
the ionosphere with high accuracy and computational efficiency. Accurate
modeling of the entire atmosphere is critical for understanding the upward
propagation of gravity waves, which influence upper-atmospheric dynamics and
coupling across atmospheric layers. CAM-NET leverages the Spherical Fourier
Neural Operator (SFNO) to capture global-scale atmospheric dynamics while
preserving the Earth's spherical structure. Trained on a decade of datasets
from the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with thermosphere and
ionosphere eXtension (WACCM-X), CAM-NET demonstrates accuracy comparable to
WACCM-X while achieving a speedup of over 1000x in inference time, can provide
one year simulation within a few minutes once trained. The model effectively
predicts key atmospheric parameters, including zonal and meridional winds,
temperature, and time rate of pressure. Inspired by traditional modeling
approaches that use external couplers to simulate tracer transport, CAM-NET
introduces a modular architecture that explicitly separates tracer prediction
from core dynamics. The core backbone of CAM-NET focuses on forecasting primary
physical variables (e.g., temperature, wind velocity), while tracer variables
are predicted through a lightweight, fine-tuned model. This design allows for
efficient adaptation to specific tracer scenarios with minimal computational
cost, avoiding the need to retrain the entire model. We have validated this
approach on the $O^2$ tracer, demonstrating strong performance and
generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics simulations extend the length and time
scale of atomistic simulations by replacing groups of correlated atoms with CG
beads. Machine-learned coarse-graining (MLCG) has recently emerged as a
promising approach to construct highly accurate force fields for CG molecular
dynamics. However, the calibration of MLCG force fields typically hinges on
force matching, which demands extensive reference atomistic trajectories with
corresponding force labels. In practice, atomistic forces are often not
recorded, making traditional force matching infeasible on pre-existing
datasets. Recently, noise-based kernels have been introduced to adapt force
matching to the low-data regime, including situations in which reference
atomistic forces are not present. While this approach produces force fields
which recapitulate slow collective motion, it introduces significant local
distortions due to the corrupting effects of the noise-based kernel. In this
work, we introduce more general kernels based on normalizing flows that
substantially reduce these local distortions while preserving global
conformational accuracy. We demonstrate our method on small proteins, showing
that flow-based kernels can generate high-quality CG forces solely from
configurational samples.

Conclusion: HO-GDBs在保持低延迟和高查询吞吐量的同时，支持高阶交互，并适用于ACID和最终一致性系统。

Abstract: Recent advances in graph databases (GDBs) have been driving interest in
large-scale analytics, yet current systems fail to support higher-order (HO)
interactions beyond first-order (one-hop) relations, which are crucial for
tasks such as subgraph counting, polyadic modeling, and HO graph learning. We
address this by introducing a new class of systems, higher-order graph
databases (HO-GDBs) that use lifting and lowering paradigms to seamlessly
extend traditional GDBs with HO. We provide a theoretical analysis of OLTP and
OLAP queries, ensuring correctness, scalability, and ACID compliance. We
implement a lightweight, modular, and parallelizable HO-GDB prototype that
offers native support for hypergraphs, node-tuples, subgraphs, and other HO
structures under a unified API. The prototype scales to large HO OLTP & OLAP
workloads and shows how HO improves analytical tasks, for example enhancing
accuracy of graph neural networks within a GDB by 44%. Our work ensures low
latency and high query throughput, and generalizes both ACID-compliant and
eventually consistent systems.

Conclusion: 揭示了随机初始化网络Lipschitz性质的分段行为，为网络设计和分析提供了新视角。

Abstract: This paper studies the $\ell^p$-Lipschitz constants of ReLU neural networks
$\Phi: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}$ with random parameters for $p \in
[1,\infty]$. The distribution of the weights follows a variant of the He
initialization and the biases are drawn from symmetric distributions. We derive
high probability upper and lower bounds for wide networks that differ at most
by a factor that is logarithmic in the network's width and linear in its depth.
In the special case of shallow networks, we obtain matching bounds. Remarkably,
the behavior of the $\ell^p$-Lipschitz constant varies significantly between
the regimes $ p \in [1,2) $ and $ p \in [2,\infty] $. For $p \in [2,\infty]$,
the $\ell^p$-Lipschitz constant behaves similarly to $\Vert g\Vert_{p'}$, where
$g \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is a $d$-dimensional standard Gaussian vector and $1/p +
1/p' = 1$. In contrast, for $p \in [1,2)$, the $\ell^p$-Lipschitz constant
aligns more closely to $\Vert g \Vert_{2}$.

Abstract: Understanding temporal patterns in online search behavior is crucial for
real-time marketing and trend forecasting. Google Trends offers a rich proxy
for public interest, yet the high dimensionality and noise of its time-series
data present challenges for effective clustering. This study evaluates three
unsupervised clustering approaches, Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX),
enhanced SAX (eSAX), and Topological Data Analysis (TDA), applied to 20 Google
Trends keywords representing major consumer categories. Our results show that
while SAX and eSAX offer fast and interpretable clustering for stable time
series, they struggle with volatility and complexity, often producing ambiguous
``catch-all'' clusters. TDA, by contrast, captures global structural features
through persistent homology and achieves more balanced and meaningful
groupings.
  We conclude with practical guidance for using symbolic and topological
methods in consumer analytics and suggest that hybrid approaches combining both
perspectives hold strong potential for future applications.

Abstract: The Extreme Operating Conditions Search (EOCS) problem is one of the key
problems in relay setting calculation, which is used to ensure that the setting
values of protection relays can adapt to the changing operating conditions of
power systems over a period of time after deployment. The high penetration of
renewable energy and the wide application of inverter-based resources make the
operating conditions of renewable power systems more volatile, which urges the
adoption of the online relay setting calculation strategy. However, the
computation speed of existing EOCS methods based on local enumeration,
heuristic algorithms, and mathematical programming cannot meet the efficiency
requirement of online relay setting calculation. To reduce the time overhead,
this paper, for the first time, proposes an efficient deep learning-based EOCS
method suitable for online relay setting calculation. First, the power system
information is formulated as four layers, i.e., a component parameter layer, a
topological connection layer, an electrical distance layer, and a graph
distance layer, which are fed into a parallel graph neural network (PGNN) model
for feature extraction. Then, the four feature layers corresponding to each
node are spliced and stretched, and then fed into the decision network to
predict the extreme operating condition of the system. Finally, the proposed
PGNN method is validated on the modified IEEE 39-bus and 118-bus test systems,
where some of the synchronous generators are replaced by renewable generation
units. The nonlinear fault characteristics of renewables are fully considered
when computing fault currents. The experiment results show that the proposed
PGNN method achieves higher accuracy than the existing methods in solving the
EOCS problem. Meanwhile, it also provides greater improvements in online
computation time.

Abstract: The application of Deep Learning-based Schemes (DLSs) for detecting False
Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) in smart grids has attracted significant
attention. This paper demonstrates that adversarial attacks, carefully crafted
FDIAs, can evade existing DLSs used for FDIA detection in Line Current
Differential Relays (LCDRs). We propose a novel adversarial attack framework,
utilizing the Fast Gradient Sign Method, which exploits DLS vulnerabilities by
introducing small perturbations to LCDR remote measurements, leading to
misclassification of the FDIA as a legitimate fault while also triggering the
LCDR to trip. We evaluate the robustness of multiple deep learning models,
including multi-layer perceptrons, convolutional neural networks, long
short-term memory networks, and residual networks, under adversarial
conditions. Our experimental results demonstrate that while these models
perform well, they exhibit high degrees of vulnerability to adversarial
attacks. For some models, the adversarial attack success rate exceeds 99.7%. To
address this threat, we introduce adversarial training as a proactive defense
mechanism, significantly enhancing the models' ability to withstand adversarial
FDIAs without compromising fault detection accuracy. Our results highlight the
significant threat posed by adversarial attacks to DLS-based FDIA detection,
underscore the necessity for robust cybersecurity measures in smart grids, and
demonstrate the effectiveness of adversarial training in enhancing model
robustness against adversarial FDIAs.

Abstract: Road traffic crashes are a significant global cause of fatalities,

alcohol inference mismatch (AIM) by employing database narrative alignment to
identify AIM in crash data. A framework was developed to improve data quality

the BERT model, the analysis of 371,062 crash records from Iowa (2016-2022)
revealed 2,767 AIM incidents, resulting in an overall AIM percentage of 24.03%.
Statistical tools, including the Probit Logit model, were used to explore the
crash characteristics affecting AIM patterns. The findings indicate that
alcohol-related fatal crashes and nighttime incidents have a lower percentage
of the mismatch, while crashes involving unknown vehicle types and older
drivers are more susceptible to mismatch. The geospatial cluster as part of
this study can identify the regions which have an increased need for education
and training. These insights highlight the necessity for targeted training
programs and data management teams to improve the accuracy of crash reporting

Conclusion: PQS是一种高效且成本效益高的电磁结构设计方法，适用于实际工程应用。

Abstract: Electromagnetic structure (EMS) design plays a critical role in developing
advanced antennas and materials, but remains challenging due to
high-dimensional design spaces and expensive evaluations. While existing
methods commonly employ high-quality predictors or generators to alleviate
evaluations, they are often data-intensive and struggle with real-world scale
and budget constraints. To address this, we propose a novel method called
Progressive Quadtree-based Search (PQS). Rather than exhaustively exploring the
high-dimensional space, PQS converts the conventional image-like layout into a
quadtree-based hierarchical representation, enabling a progressive search from
global patterns to local details. Furthermore, to lessen reliance on highly
accurate predictors, we introduce a consistency-driven sample selection
mechanism. This mechanism quantifies the reliability of predictions, balancing
exploitation and exploration when selecting candidate designs. We evaluate PQS
on two real-world engineering tasks, i.e., Dual-layer Frequency Selective
Surface and High-gain Antenna. Experimental results show that our method can
achieve satisfactory designs under limited computational budgets, outperforming
baseline methods. In particular, compared to generative approaches, it cuts
evaluation costs by 75-85%, effectively saving 20.27-38.80 days of product

expressions from data. Here, we adapt search-based symbolic regression to the

Abstract: The generation and preservation of complex quantum states against

based on continuous-variable quantum diffusion principles, synergizing them
with CV quantum neural networks (CVQNNs) to address these dual challenges. For
the task of state generation, our Continuous-Variable Quantum Diffusion
Generative model (CVQD-G) employs a physically driven forward diffusion process
using a thermal loss channel, which is then inverted by a learnable,
parameter-efficient backward denoising process based on a CVQNN with
time-embedding. This framework's capability is further extended for state
recovery by the Continuous-Variable Quantum Diffusion Restoration model
(CVQD-R), a specialized variant designed to restore quantum states,
particularly coherent states with unknown parameters, from thermal degradation.
Extensive numerical simulations validate these dual capabilities, demonstrating
the high-fidelity generation of diverse Gaussian (coherent, squeezed) and
non-Gaussian (Fock, cat) states, typically with fidelities exceeding 99%, and
confirming the model's ability to robustly restore corrupted states.
Furthermore, a comprehensive complexity analysis reveals favorable training and
inference costs, highlighting the framework's efficiency, scalability, and its

Abstract: The mean shift (MS) is a non-parametric, density-based, iterative algorithm
that has prominent usage in clustering and image segmentation. A rigorous proof
for its convergence in full generality remains unknown. Two significant steps
in this direction were taken in the paper \cite{Gh1}, which proved that for
\textit{sufficiently large bandwidth}, the MS algorithm with the Gaussian
kernel always converges in any dimension, and also by the same author in
\cite{Gh2}, proved that MS always converges in one dimension for kernels with
differentiable, strictly decreasing, convex profiles. In the more recent paper
\cite{YT}, they have proved the convergence in more generality,\textit{ without
any restriction on the bandwidth}, with the assumption that the KDE $f$ has a
continuous Lipschitz gradient on the closure of the convex hull of the
trajectory of the iterated sequence of the mode estimate, and also satisfies
the {\L}ojasiewicz property there.
  The main theoretical result of this paper is a generalization of those of
\cite{Gh1}, where we show that (1) for\textit{ sufficiently large bandwidth}
convergence is guaranteed in any dimension with \textit{any radially symmetric
and strictly positive definite kernels}. The proof uses two alternate
characterizations of radially symmetric positive definite smooth kernels by
Schoenberg and Bernstein \cite{Fass}, and borrows some steps from the proofs in
\cite{Gh1}. Although the authors acknowledge that the result in that paper is
more restrictive than that of \cite{YT} due to the lower bandwidth limit, it
uses a different set of assumptions than \cite{YT}, and the proof technique is
different.

Abstract: Stellarators are magnetic confinement devices under active development to
deliver steady-state carbon-free fusion energy. Their design involves a
high-dimensional, constrained optimization problem that requires expensive
physics simulations and significant domain expertise. Recent advances in plasma
physics and open-source tools have made stellarator optimization more
accessible. However, broader community progress is currently bottlenecked by
the lack of standardized optimization problems with strong baselines and
datasets that enable data-driven approaches, particularly for quasi-isodynamic
(QI) stellarator configurations, considered as a promising path to commercial
fusion due to their inherent resilience to current-driven disruptions. Here, we
release an open dataset of diverse QI-like stellarator plasma boundary shapes,
paired with their ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria and performance
metrics. We generated this dataset by sampling a variety of QI fields and
optimizing corresponding stellarator plasma boundaries. We introduce three
optimization benchmarks of increasing complexity: (1) a single-objective
geometric optimization problem, (2) a "simple-to-build" QI stellarator, and (3)
a multi-objective ideal-MHD stable QI stellarator that investigates trade-offs
between compactness and coil simplicity. For every benchmark, we provide
reference code, evaluation scripts, and strong baselines based on classical
optimization techniques. Finally, we show how learned models trained on our
dataset can efficiently generate novel, feasible configurations without
querying expensive physics oracles. By openly releasing the dataset along with
benchmark problems and baselines, we aim to lower the entry barrier for
optimization and machine learning researchers to engage in stellarator design
and to accelerate cross-disciplinary progress toward bringing fusion energy to
the grid.
