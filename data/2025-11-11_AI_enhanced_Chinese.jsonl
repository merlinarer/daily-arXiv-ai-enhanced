This discrepancy in representation prevents speech language models from performing instruction-based free-form editing. To solve this challenge, we introduce a novel framework that unifies speech understanding, generation, and editing. The core of our unified model is a unified continuous speech tokenizer MingTok-Audio, the first continuous tokenizer to effectively integrate semantic and acoustic features, which makes it suitable for both understanding and generation tasks. Based on this unified continuous audio tokenizer, we developed the speech language model Ming-UniAudio, which achieved a balance between generation and understanding capabilities. Ming-UniAudio sets new state-of-the-art (SOTA) records on 8 out of 12 metrics on the ContextASR benchmark. Notably, for Chinese voice cloning, it achieves a highly competitive Seed-TTS-WER of 0.95. Leveraging this foundational model, we further trained a dedicated speech editing model Ming-UniAudio-Edit, the first speech language model that enables universal, free-form speech editing guided solely by natural language instructions, handling both semantic and acoustic modifications without timestamp condition. To rigorously assess the editing capability and establish a foundation for future research, we introduce Ming-Freeform-Audio-Edit, the first comprehensive benchmark tailored for instruction-based free-form speech editing, featuring diverse scenarios and evaluation dimensions spanning semantic correctness, acoustic quality, and instruction alignment. We open-sourced the continuous audio tokenizer, the unified foundational model, and the free-form instruction-based editing model to facilitate the development of unified audio understanding, generation, and manipulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u8bed\u97f3\u5206\u8bcd\u5668MingTok-Audio\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578bMing-UniAudio\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8bed\u97f3\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u9a71\u52a8\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u8868\u5f81\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u5f62\u5f0f\u8bed\u97f3\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u8bed\u97f3\u5206\u8bcd\u5668MingTok-Audio\u6574\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u58f0\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u6784\u5efa\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578bMing-UniAudio\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578bMing-UniAudio-Edit\u3002", "result": "\u5728ContextASR\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d12\u9879\u6307\u6807\u4e2d8\u9879\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\uff0c\u4e2d\u6587\u8bed\u97f3\u514b\u9686\u7684Seed-TTS-WER\u8fbe\u52300.95\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u901a\u7528\u81ea\u7531\u5f62\u5f0f\u8bed\u97f3\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u8bed\u97f3\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u97f3\u9891\u5904\u7406\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "relevance": 40.0}}

Existing data extraction methods, particularly heuristic-based divergence attacks, often exhibit limited success and offer limited insight into the fundamental drivers of memorization leakage. This paper introduces Confusion-Inducing Attacks (CIA), a principled framework for extracting memorized data by systematically maximizing model uncertainty. We empirically demonstrate that the emission of memorized text during divergence is preceded by a sustained spike in token-level prediction entropy. CIA leverages this insight by optimizing input snippets to deliberately induce this consecutive high-entropy state. For aligned LLMs, we further propose Mismatched Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) to simultaneously weaken their alignment and induce targeted confusion, thereby increasing susceptibility to our attacks. Experiments on various unaligned and aligned LLMs demonstrate that our proposed attacks outperform existing baselines in extracting verbatim and near-verbatim training data without requiring prior knowledge of the training data.

However, prevailing moderation systems are centralized and task-specific, offering limited transparency and neglecting diverse user preferences--an approach ill-suited for privacy-sensitive or decentralized environments. We propose a novel framework that leverages in-context learning (ICL) with foundation models to unify the detection of toxicity, spam, and negative sentiment across binary, multi-class, and multi-label settings. Crucially, our approach enables lightweight personalization, allowing users to easily block new categories, unblock existing ones, or extend detection to semantic variations through simple prompt-based interventions--all without model retraining. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks (TextDetox, UCI SMS, SST2) and a new, annotated Mastodon dataset reveal that: (i) foundation models achieve strong cross-task generalization, often matching or surpassing task-specific fine-tuned models; (ii) effective personalization is achievable with as few as one user-provided example or definition; and (iii) augmenting prompts with label definitions or rationales significantly enhances robustness to noisy, real-world data. Our work demonstrates a definitive shift beyond one-size-fits-all moderation, establishing ICL as a practical, privacy-preserving, and highly adaptable pathway for the next generation of user-centric content safety systems.

However, existing methods face three critical challenges: Inaccurate Graph Construction, caused by LLM hallucination; Poor Reasoning Ability, caused by failing to generate explicit reasons telling LLM why certain chunks were selected; and Inadequate Answering, which only partially answers the query due to the inadequate LLM reasoning, making their performance lag behind NaiveRAG on certain tasks. To address these issues, we propose AGRAG, an advanced graph-based retrieval-augmented generation framework. When constructing the graph, AGRAG substitutes the widely used LLM entity extraction method with a statistics-based method, avoiding hallucination and error propagation. When retrieval, AGRAG formulates the graph reasoning procedure as the Minimum Cost Maximum Influence (MCMI) subgraph generation problem, where we try to include more nodes with high influence score, but with less involving edge cost, to make the generated reasoning paths more comprehensive. We prove this problem to be NP-hard, and propose a greedy algorithm to solve it. The MCMI subgraph generated can serve as explicit reasoning paths to tell LLM why certain chunks were retrieved, thereby making the LLM better focus on the query-related part contents of the chunks, reducing the impact of noise, and improving AGRAG's reasoning ability. Furthermore, compared with the simple tree-structured reasoning paths, our MCMI subgraph can allow more complex graph structures, such as cycles, and improve the comprehensiveness of the generated reasoning paths.", "AI": {"tldr": "AGRAG\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u56fe\u907f\u514dLLM\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u5c06\u56fe\u63a8\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6700\u5c0f\u6210\u672c\u6700\u5927\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u5b50\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u663e\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u6765\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff1aLLM\u5e7b\u89c9\u5bfc\u81f4\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u663e\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u3001LLM\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u8db3\u5bfc\u81f4\u56de\u7b54\u4e0d\u5145\u5206\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u66ff\u4ee3LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u4f53\u63d0\u53d6\u907f\u514d\u5e7b\u89c9\uff1b\u5c06\u56fe\u63a8\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3aMCMI\u5b50\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8d2a\u5fc3\u7b97\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\uff1b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5b50\u56fe\u4f5c\u4e3a\u663e\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u6307\u5bfcLLM\u3002", "result": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u56de\u7b54\u5145\u5206\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86NaiveRAG\u3002", "conclusion": "AGRAG\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5f15\u5165MCMI\u5b50\u56fe\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u56feRAG\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

The post-execution Verification Gate validates artifacts via MLflow API queries (with recursive path checking) and optionally validates metrics when specified by acceptance criteria. Claims propagate only when backed by a queryable run ID, required artifacts, and FINISHED status. Bounded, confidence-gated retries (typically 1-2 attempts) recover from transient failures without unbounded loops.\n  The framework was evaluated on 8 benchmark tasks spanning infrastructure validation, ML capabilities, and governance stress tests. Baseline A (Prompt-Level Only) yields 100% hallucination (8/8 claimed, 0/8 verified). Baseline B (Verification-Only) reduces hallucination to 25% (2/8 fail verification). EviBound (Dual Gates) achieves 0% hallucination: 7/8 tasks verified and 1 task correctly blocked at the approval gate, all with only approximately 8.3% execution overhead.\n  This package includes execution trajectories, MLflow run IDs for all verified tasks, and a 4-step verification protocol.

Preprint exploring a new cognitive paradigm for autonomous planning", "summary": "We challenge the long-standing assumption that exhaustive scene modeling is required for high-performance end-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD). Unlike world-model approaches that rely on computationally intensive future scene generation or vision-language-action (VLA) systems constrained by Markov assumptions, we show that a minimal set of semantically rich tokens is sufficient for effective planning. Experiments on the nuPlan benchmark (720 scenarios, over 11,000 samples) using perception-informed BEV representations yield three key findings: (1) even without future prediction, our sparse representation achieves 0.548 m ADE, comparable to or surpassing prior methods reporting around 0.75 m on nuScenes; (2) conditioning trajectory decoding on predicted future tokens reduces ADE to 0.479 m, a 12.6% improvement over current-state baselines; and (3) explicit reconstruction loss offers no benefit and may degrade performance under reliable perception inputs. Notably, we observe the emergence of temporal fuzziness, where the model adaptively attends to task-relevant semantics rather than aligning rigidly to fixed timestamps, providing a cognitive advantage for planning under uncertainty. Our \"token is all you need\" principle marks a paradigm shift from reconstructing the world to understanding it, laying a foundation for cognitively inspired systems that plan through imagination rather than reaction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u9700\u8981\u8be6\u5c3d\u573a\u666f\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u8bed\u4e49\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684token\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u5728nuPlan\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6311\u6218\u4f20\u7edf\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u9700\u8981\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u7b80\u6d01\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u672a\u6765\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u548c\u53d7\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u5047\u8bbe\u7ea6\u675f\u7684VLA\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u611f\u77e5\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684BEV\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u8bed\u4e49token\u8fdb\u884c\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5f53\u524d\u72b6\u6001token\u548c\u7ed3\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765token\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u663e\u5f0f\u91cd\u5efa\u635f\u5931\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728nuPlan\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff1a\u4ec5\u5f53\u524d\u72b6\u6001token\u8fbe\u52300.548m ADE\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u672a\u6765token\u9884\u6d4b\u964d\u81f30.479m ADE\uff0c\u63d0\u534712.6%\uff1b\u663e\u5f0f\u91cd\u5efa\u635f\u5931\u65e0\u76ca\u751a\u81f3\u6709\u5bb3\uff1b\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\"token\u5373\u6240\u9700\"\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u6807\u5fd7\u7740\u4ece\u91cd\u5efa\u4e16\u754c\u5230\u7406\u89e3\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u60f3\u8c61\u800c\u975e\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u542f\u53d1\u7cfb\u7edf\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "relevance": 45.0}}

Diffusion models like Stable Diffusion generate high-quality images and videos from text. Evidence shows rapid expansion: 74.2% of newly published webpages now contain AI-generated material (Ryan Law 2025), 30-40% of the active web corpus is synthetic (Spennemann 2025; arXiv:2504.08755), 52% of U.S. adults use LLMs for writing, coding, or research (Staff 2025), and audits find AI involvement in 18% of financial complaints and 24% of press releases (Liang et al. 2025). The underlying neural architectures, including Transformers (Vaswani et al. 2023; arXiv:1706.03762), RNNs, LSTMs, GANs, and diffusion networks, depend on large, diverse, human-authored datasets (Shi & Iyengar 2019). As synthetic content dominates, recursive training risks eroding linguistic and semantic diversity, producing Model Collapse (Shumailov et al. 2024; arXiv:2307.15043; Dohmatob et al. 2024; arXiv:2402.07712). This study quantifies and forecasts collapse onset by examining year-wise semantic similarity in English-language Wikipedia (filtered Common Crawl) from 2013 to 2025 using Transformer embeddings and cosine similarity metrics. Results reveal a steady rise in similarity before public LLM adoption, likely driven by early RNN/LSTM translation and text-normalization pipelines, though modest due to a smaller scale. Observed fluctuations reflect irreducible linguistic diversity, variable corpus size across years, finite sampling error, and an exponential rise in similarity after the public adoption of LLM models. These findings provide a data-driven estimate of when recursive AI contamination may significantly threaten data richness and model generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5316\u4e86AI\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u67902013-2025\u5e74\u7ef4\u57fa\u767e\u79d1\u8bed\u6599\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u516c\u5f00\u91c7\u7528\u540e\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u5448\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5d29\u6e83\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\u5feb\u901f\u6269\u5f20\uff08\u5df2\u8fbe30-40%\uff09\uff0c\u9012\u5f52\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e27\u5931\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u6a21\u578b\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Transformer\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5206\u67902013-2025\u5e74\u82f1\u6587\u7ef4\u57fa\u767e\u79d1\u8bed\u6599\u7684\u5e74\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "LLM\u516c\u5f00\u91c7\u7528\u524d\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e0a\u5347\uff08\u53d7\u65e9\u671fRNN/LSTM\u5f71\u54cd\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u540e\u5448\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u8868\u660eAI\u6c61\u67d3\u663e\u8457\u5a01\u80c1\u6570\u636e\u4e30\u5bcc\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u9012\u5f52AI\u6c61\u67d3\u53ef\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u5a01\u80c1\u6570\u636e\u4e30\u5bcc\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

However, this index is only reported annually, limiting its responsiveness to short-term fluctuations. To address this gap, the present study introduces a daily proxy for the Energy Security Index and applies it to forecast energy security at a daily frequency.The study employs a two stage approach first, a suitable daily proxy for the annual Energy Security Index is identified by applying six time series similarity measures to key energy related variables. Second, the selected proxy is modeled using the XGBoost algorithm to generate 15 day ahead forecasts, enabling high frequency monitoring of energy security dynamics.As the result of proxy choosing, Volume Brent consistently emerged as the most suitable proxy across the majority of methods. The model demonstrated strong performance, with an R squared of 0.981 on the training set and 0.945 on the test set, and acceptable error metrics . The 15 day forecast of Brent volume indicates short term fluctuations, with a peak around day 4, a decline until day 8, a rise near day 10, and a downward trend toward day 15, accompanied by prediction intervals.By integrating time series similarity measures with machine learning based forecasting, this study provides a novel framework for converting low frequency macroeconomic indicators into high frequency, actionable signals.

In this work, we present a large-scale measurement-based study comprising over 32,500 measurements across 21 GPU configurations and 155 model architectures, from small open-source models to frontier systems. Using the vLLM inference engine, we quantify energy usage at the prompt level and identify how architectural and operational factors shape energy demand. Building on these insights, we develop a predictive model that accurately estimates inference energy consumption across unseen architectures and hardware, and implement it as a browser extension to raise awareness of the environmental impact of generative AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6d4b\u91cf\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86LLM\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u4f30\u7b97\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u6269\u5c55\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u4eba\u4eec\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLM\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u9700\u6c42\u6025\u5267\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u9700\u8981\u6838\u80fd\u4f9b\u7535\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u8017\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5206\u6790\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u91cf\u5316\u7814\u7a76\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u8017\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6d4b\u91cf\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8d85\u8fc732,500\u6b21\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u6db5\u76d621\u79cdGPU\u914d\u7f6e\u548c155\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528vLLM\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\u5728\u63d0\u793a\u7ea7\u522b\u91cf\u5316\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u80fd\u8017\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u56e0\u7d20\u5982\u4f55\u5851\u9020\u80fd\u8017\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u89c1\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u8017\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u8017\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u4f46\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5206\u6790\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u66f4\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684AI\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u63d0\u9ad8\u80fd\u8017\u610f\u8bc6\u3002", "relevance": 65.0}}

While recent dictionary learning methods such as Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) provide a promising route to discover human-interpretable features, they suffer from a variety of problems, including a systematic failure to capture the rich conceptual information that drives linguistic understanding. Instead, they exhibit a bias towards shallow, token-specific, or noisy features, such as \"the phrase 'The' at the start of sentences\". In this work, we propose that this is due to a fundamental issue with how dictionary learning methods for LLMs are trained. Language itself has a rich, well-studied structure spanning syntax, semantics, and pragmatics; however, current unsupervised methods largely ignore this linguistic knowledge, leading to poor feature discovery that favors superficial patterns over meaningful concepts. We focus on a simple but important aspect of language: semantic content has long-range dependencies and tends to be smooth over a sequence, whereas syntactic information is much more local. Building on this insight, we introduce Temporal Sparse Autoencoders (T-SAEs), which incorporate a novel contrastive loss encouraging consistent activations of high-level features over adjacent tokens. This simple yet powerful modification enables SAEs to disentangle semantic from syntactic features in a self-supervised manner. Across multiple datasets and models, T-SAEs recover smoother, more coherent semantic concepts without sacrificing reconstruction quality. Strikingly, they exhibit clear semantic structure despite being trained without explicit semantic signal, offering a new pathway for unsupervised interpretability in language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTemporal Sparse Autoencoders (T-SAEs)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u6765\u9f13\u52b1\u76f8\u90bbtoken\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5206\u79bb\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u53e5\u6cd5\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5728LLM\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e2d\u504f\u5411\u6d45\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5728LLM\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u53d1\u73b0\u6d45\u5c42\u3001token\u7279\u5b9a\u6216\u566a\u58f0\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u8bed\u4e49\u5185\u5bb9\u5177\u6709\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u5e8f\u5217\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u53e5\u6cd5\u4fe1\u606f\u66f4\u5c40\u90e8\u7684\u6d1e\u5bdf\uff0c\u63d0\u51faT-SAEs\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u6765\u9f13\u52b1\u76f8\u90bbtoken\u95f4\u9ad8\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cT-SAEs\u80fd\u591f\u6062\u590d\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001\u66f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u91cd\u6784\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6ca1\u6709\u663e\u5f0f\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u53f7\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ecd\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "T-SAEs\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5206\u79bb\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u53e5\u6cd5\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

However, data collection and model training can be expensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we leverage vision-language models' (VLMs') reasoning capabilities to assess the quality of printed parts and introduce in-context learning (ICL) to provide VLMs with necessary application-specific knowledge and demonstration samples. This method eliminates the requirement for large application-specific datasets for training models. We explored different sampling strategies for ICL to search for the optimal configuration that makes use of limited samples. We evaluated these strategies on two VLMs, Gemini-2.5-flash and Gemma3:27b, with quality assessment tasks in wire-laser direct energy deposition processes. The results show that ICL-assisted VLMs can reach quality classification accuracies similar to those of traditional machine learning models while requiring only a minimal number of samples. In addition, unlike traditional classification models that lack transparency, VLMs can generate human-interpretable rationales to enhance trust. Since there are no metrics to evaluate their interpretability in manufacturing applications, we propose two metrics, knowledge relevance and rationale validity, to evaluate the quality of VLMs' supporting rationales.

This paper investigates efficient CoT transfer across models of different scales and architectures through an adaptive reasoning summarization framework. The proposed method compresses reasoning traces via semantic segmentation with importance scoring, budget-aware dynamic compression, and coherence reconstruction, preserving critical reasoning steps while significantly reducing token usage. Experiments on 7{,}501 medical examination questions across 10 specialties show up to 40% higher accuracy than truncation under the same token budgets. Evaluations on 64 model pairs from eight LLMs (1.5B-32B parameters, including DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3) confirm strong cross-model transferability.

Anchoring bias, a classic human judgment bias, offers a critical test case. While prior work shows LLMs exhibit anchoring, most evidence relies on surface-level outputs, leaving internal mechanisms and attributional contributions unexplored. This paper advances the study of anchoring in LLMs through three contributions: (1) a log-probability-based behavioral analysis showing that anchors shift entire output distributions, with controls for training-data contamination; (2) exact Shapley-value attribution over structured prompt fields to quantify anchor influence on model log-probabilities; and (3) a unified Anchoring Bias Sensitivity Score integrating behavioral and attributional evidence across six open-source models. Results reveal robust anchoring effects in Gemma-2B, Phi-2, and Llama-2-7B, with attribution signaling that the anchors influence reweighting. Smaller models such as GPT-2, Falcon-RW-1B, and GPT-Neo-125M show variability, suggesting scale may modulate sensitivity.

The members of the vocabulary can be built of code points or bytes. Using code points means that all members of the vocabulary are valid UTF-8 characters. However, it also requires thousands of initial members to achieve acceptable coverage of inputs. Beginning with bytes, on the contrary, avoids out-of-vocabulary errors with only 256 initial members of the vocabulary, but the members of the vocabulary and sequences of them are not guaranteed to be valid UTF-8. Sequences that are not valid UTF-8 break code that assumes its input to be valid UTF-8. Applications of language models must account for the breakage thereby introduced. In this paper, we formalize tokenization using monoid theory and prove that tokenizers whose vocabularies contain tokens that are ill-formed UTF-8 can always produce sequences that are ill-formed UTF-8. We demonstrate formally that attempting to incrementally convert tokens back to a string and interpret the results as UTF-8 gives different results than converting the whole sequence of tokens at once.

Despite the integration of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into MVC, their input graph structures remain susceptible to noise interference. Methods based on Multi-view Graph Refinement (MGRC) also have limitations such as insufficient consideration of cross-view consistency, difficulty in handling hard-to-distinguish samples in the feature space, and disjointed optimization processes caused by graph construction algorithms. To address these issues, a Multi-View Clustering method via a Fusion-Consensus Graph Convolutional Network (MCFCN) is proposed. The network learns the consensus graph of multi-view data in an end-to-end manner and learns effective consensus representations through a view feature fusion model and a Unified Graph Structure Adapter (UGA). It designs Similarity Matrix Alignment Loss (SMAL) and Feature Representation Alignment Loss (FRAL). With the guidance of consensus, it optimizes view-specific graphs, preserves cross-view topological consistency, promotes the construction of intra-class edges, and realizes effective consensus representation learning with the help of GCN to improve clustering performance. MCFCN demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on eight multi-view benchmark datasets, and its effectiveness is verified by extensive qualitative and quantitative implementations.

Prevailing heuristics, such as confidence based sampling, are myopic: they optimize locally, fail to leverage extra test-time compute, and let early decoding mistakes cascade. We propose Lookahead Unmasking (LookUM), which addresses these concerns by reformulating sampling as path selection over all possible unmasking orders without the need for an external reward model. Our framework couples (i) a path generator that proposes paths by sampling from pools of unmasking sets with (ii) a verifier that computes the uncertainty of the proposed paths and performs importance sampling to subsequently select the final paths. Empirically, erroneous unmasking measurably inflates sequence level uncertainty, and our method exploits this to avoid error-prone trajectories. We validate our framework across six benchmarks, such as mathematics, planning, and coding, and demonstrate consistent performance improvements.

We propose Base-Aligned Model Collaboration (BACo), an inference-time token-level model collaboration framework that dynamically combines a base LLM with its aligned counterpart to optimize diversity and quality. Inspired by prior work (Fei et al., 2025), BACo employs routing strategies that determine, at each token, from which model to decode based on next-token prediction uncertainty and predicted contents' semantic role. Prior diversity-promoting methods, such as retraining, prompt engineering, and multi-sampling methods, improve diversity but often degrade quality or require costly decoding or post-training. In contrast, BACo achieves both high diversity and quality post hoc within a single pass, while offering strong controllability. We explore a family of routing strategies, across three open-ended generation tasks and 13 metrics covering diversity and quality, BACo consistently surpasses state-of-the-art inference-time baselines. With our best router, BACo achieves a 21.3% joint improvement in diversity and quality. Human evaluations also mirror these improvements.

Although multi-task learning is an effective way to integrate these tasks, its increasing model parameters and complexity make deployment on on-board devices difficult. To address this challenge, we propose a multi-task model compression framework that combines task-aware safe pruning with feature-level knowledge distillation. Our safe pruning strategy integrates Taylor-based channel importance with gradient conflict penalty to keep important channels while removing redundant and conflicting channels. To mitigate performance degradation after pruning, we further design a task head-agnostic distillation method that transfers intermediate backbone and encoder features from a teacher to a student model as guidance. Experiments on the BDD100K dataset demonstrate that our compressed model achieves a 32.7% reduction in parameters while segmentation performance shows negligible accuracy loss and only a minor decrease in detection (-1.2% for Recall and -1.8% for mAP50) compared to the teacher. The compressed model still runs at 32.7 FPS in real-time.

Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) addresses this by optimizing for the worst-case risk within a neighborhood of the training distribution. However, conventional methods depend on a single, global robustness budget, which can lead to overly conservative models or a misallocation of robustness. We propose a variance-driven, adaptive, sample-level DRO (Var-DRO) framework that automatically identifies high-risk training samples and assigns a personalized robustness budget to each based on its online loss variance. Our formulation employs two-sided, KL-divergence-style bounds to constrain the ratio between adversarial and empirical weights for every sample. This results in a linear inner maximization problem over a convex polytope, which admits an efficient water-filling solution. To stabilize training, we introduce a warmup phase and a linear ramp schedule for the global cap on per-sample budgets, complemented by label smoothing for numerical robustness. Evaluated on CIFAR-10-C (corruptions), our method achieves the highest overall mean accuracy compared to ERM and KL-DRO. On Waterbirds, Var-DRO improves overall performance while matching or surpassing KL-DRO. On the original CIFAR-10 dataset, Var-DRO remains competitive, exhibiting the modest trade-off anticipated when prioritizing robustness.

Dynamic Learning and Proactive Correction for Hallucination Detection", "categories": ["cs.AI"], "comment": null, "summary": "Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) remains a critical barrier to their safe deployment. Existing tool-augmented hallucination detection methods require pre-defined fixed verification strategies, which are crucial to the quality and effectiveness of tool calls. Some methods directly employ powerful closed-source LLMs such as GPT-4 as detectors, which are effective but too costly. To mitigate the cost issue, some methods adopt the teacher-student architecture and finetune open-source small models as detectors via agent tuning. However, these methods are limited by fixed strategies. When faced with a dynamically changing execution environment, they may lack adaptability and inappropriately call tools, ultimately leading to detection failure. To address the problem of insufficient strategy adaptability, we propose the innovative ``Learning to Evaluate and Adaptively Plan''(LEAP) framework, which endows an efficient student model with the dynamic learning and proactive correction capabilities of the teacher model. Specifically, our method formulates the hallucination detection problem as a dynamic strategy learning problem. We first employ a teacher model to generate trajectories within the dynamic learning loop and dynamically adjust the strategy based on execution failures. We then distill this dynamic planning capability into an efficient student model via agent tuning. Finally, during strategy execution, the student model adopts a proactive correction mechanism, enabling it to propose, review, and optimize its own verification strategies before execution.

In this work, we introduce OckBench, a model-agnostic and hardware-agnostic benchmark that evaluates both accuracy and token count for reasoning and coding tasks. Through experiments comparing multiple open- and closed-source models, we uncover that many models with comparable accuracy differ wildly in token consumption, revealing that efficiency variance is a neglected but significant axis of differentiation. We further demonstrate Pareto frontiers over the accuracy-efficiency plane and argue for an evaluation paradigm shift: we should no longer treat tokens as \"free\" to multiply.

Traditional rule-based methods lack robustness, while existing deep learning models suffer from poor generalization and low accuracy on complex fillets due to their generic design and inadequate training data. To address these issues, this paper proposes an end-to-end, data-driven framework specifically for fillet features. We first construct and release a large-scale, diverse benchmark dataset for fillet recognition to address the inadequacy of existing data. Based on it, we propose FilletRec, a lightweight graph neural network. The core innovation of this network is its use of pose-invariant intrinsic geometric features, such as curvature, enabling it to learn more fundamental geometric patterns and thereby achieve high-precision recognition of complex geometric topologies. Experiments show that FilletRec surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and generalization, while using only 0.2\\%-5.4\\% of the parameters of baseline models, demonstrating high model efficiency.

Fuel distributors specifically require precise estimates to avoid inventory shortages or excesses.

In this research, we evaluate the performance of data-driven approaches using a substantial amount of data obtained from a major aviation fuel distributor in the Danish market. Our analysis compares the predictive capabilities of traditional time series models, Prophet, LSTM sequence-to-sequence neural networks, and hybrid models. A key challenge in developing these models is the required forecasting horizon, as fuel demand needs to be predicted for the next 30 days to optimize sourcing strategies. To ensure the reliability of the data-driven approaches and provide valuable insights to practitioners, we analyze three different datasets.

We evaluate six state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs (DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI-o3-mini, Claude-3.7-Sonnet-Thinking, Gemini-2.0-Flash-Thinking, Gemini-2.5-Flash, and Qwen-QwQ) across 100 code generation tasks of varying difficulty from BigCodeBench. We quantify reasoning-chain structure through step counts and verbosity, conduct controlled step-budget adjustments, and perform a 21-participant human evaluation across three dimensions: efficiency, logical correctness, and completeness. Our step-count interventions reveal that targeted step increases can improve resolution rates for certain models/tasks, while modest reductions often preserve success on standard tasks, rarely on hard ones. Through systematic analysis, we develop a reasoning-problematic taxonomy, identifying completeness as the dominant failure mode. Task complexity significantly impacts reasoning quality; hard problems are substantially more prone to incompleteness than standard tasks. Our stability analysis demonstrates that thinking LLMs maintain consistent logical structures across computational effort levels and can self-correct previous errors.

In this work, we ask whether transformers can still acquire ICL capabilities when inductive copying is suppressed. We propose Hapax, a setting where we omit the loss contribution of any token that can be correctly predicted by induction heads. Despite a significant reduction in inductive copying, performance on abstractive ICL tasks (i.e., tasks where the answer is not contained in the input context) remains comparable and surpasses the vanilla model on 13 of 21 tasks, even though 31.7\\% of tokens are omitted from the loss. Furthermore, our model achieves lower loss values on token positions that cannot be predicted correctly by induction heads.

As video content becomes increasingly complex with diverse behavioral patterns and contextual scenarios, traditional VAD approaches struggle to provide robust assessment for modern surveillance systems. Existing methods either lack comprehensive spatial-temporal modeling or require excessive computational resources for real-time applications. In this regard, we present a Mamba-based multi-scale spatial-temporal learning (M2S2L) framework in this paper.

First, the large language model captures contextual dependencies and deep semantic representations of the input text, providing a rich feature foundation for subsequent modeling. Then, based on multi-level feature representations, the feature pyramid mechanism effectively integrates semantic features of different scales, balancing global information and local details to construct hierarchical semantic expressions. Furthermore, the fused features are transformed into graph representations, and graph neural networks are employed to capture latent semantic relations and logical dependencies in the text, enabling comprehensive modeling of complex interactions among semantic units.

The proposed method demonstrates significant advantages in robustness alignment experiments, outperforming existing models on ACC, F1-Score, AUC, and Precision, which verifies the effectiveness and stability of the framework.

In this paper, we investigate how in-context learning enables state-of-the-art VLMs to perform few-shot object detection when large annotated datasets are unavailable, as is often the case with microscopic images. We introduce the Micro-OD benchmark, a curated collection of 252 images specifically curated for in-context learning, with bounding-box annotations spanning 11 cell types across four sources, including two in-lab expert-annotated sets. We systematically evaluate eight VLMs under few-shot conditions and compare variants with and without implicit test-time reasoning tokens. We further implement a hybrid Few-Shot Object Detection (FSOD) pipeline that combines a detection head with a VLM-based few-shot classifier, which enhances the few-shot performance of recent VLMs on our benchmark. Across datasets, we observe that zero-shot performance is weak due to the domain gap; however, few-shot support consistently improves detection, with marginal gains achieved after six shots. We observe that models with reasoning tokens are more effective for end-to-end localization, whereas simpler variants are more suitable for classifying pre-localized crops.

However, most existing LLM agents typically operate within static execution frameworks, lacking a principled mechanism to learn and self-improve from their own experience and past rollouts. As a result, their performance remains bounded by the initial framework design and the underlying LLM's capabilities. We propose Self-Abstraction from Grounded Experience (SAGE), a framework that enables agents to learn from their own task executions and refine their behavior through self-abstraction. After an initial rollout, the agent induces a concise plan abstraction from its grounded experience, distilling key steps, dependencies, and constraints. This learned abstraction is then fed back as contextual guidance, refining the agent's policy and supporting more structured, informed subsequent executions. Empirically, SAGE delivers consistent performance gains across diverse LLM backbones and agent architectures. Notably, it yields a 7.2% relative performance improvement over the strong Mini-SWE-Agent baseline when paired with the GPT-5 (high) backbone.

To address this need, Online Continual\nLearning (OCL) mechanisms have been proposed, allowing models to update their\nknowledge incrementally as new data become available while preserving\npreviously acquired information. However, existing OCL approaches for\nsensor-based HAR are computationally intensive and require extensive labeled\nsamples to represent new changes. Recently, pre-trained model-based (PTM-based)\nOCL approaches have shown significant improvements in performance and\nefficiency for computer vision applications. These methods achieve strong\ngeneralization capabilities by pre-training complex models on large datasets,\nfollowed by fine-tuning on downstream tasks for continual learning. However,\napplying PTM-based OCL approaches to sensor-based HAR poses significant\nchallenges due to the inherent heterogeneity of HAR datasets and the scarcity\nof labeled data in post-deployment scenarios. This paper introduces PTRN-HAR,\nthe first successful application of PTM-based OCL to sensor-based HAR. Unlike\nprior PTM-based OCL approaches, PTRN-HAR pre-trains the feature extractor using\ncontrastive loss with a limited amount of data. This extractor is then frozen\nduring the streaming stage.

Deep neural kernels provide a principled framework to interpret over-parameterized neural networks by mapping hierarchical feature transformations into kernel spaces, thereby combining the expressive power of deep architectures with the analytical tractability of kernel methods. Recent advances, particularly neural tangent kernels (NTKs) derived by gradient inner products, have established connections between infinitely wide neural networks and nonparametric Bayesian inference. However, the existing NTK paradigm has been predominantly confined to the infinite-width regime, while overlooking the representational role of network depth. To address this gap, we propose a depth-induced NTK kernel based on a shortcut-related architecture, which converges to a Gaussian process as the network depth approaches infinity. We theoretically analyze the training invariance and spectrum properties of the proposed kernel, which stabilizes the kernel dynamics and mitigates degeneration. Experimental results further underscore the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our findings significantly extend the existing landscape of the neural kernel theory and provide an in-depth understanding of deep learning and the scaling law.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6377\u5f84\u8fde\u63a5\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bf1\u5bfcNTK\u6838\uff0c\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u8d8b\u4e8e\u65e0\u7a77\u65f6\u6536\u655b\u5230\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u548c\u8c31\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6027", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709NTK\u8303\u5f0f\u4e3b\u8981\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u65e0\u9650\u5bbd\u5ea6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u8868\u793a\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u7a7a\u767d", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6377\u5f84\u8fde\u63a5\u67b6\u6784\u6784\u5efa\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bf1\u5bfcNTK\u6838\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u548c\u8c31\u7279\u6027", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e86\u6838\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5e76\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u8457\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u6838\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u683c\u5c40\uff0c\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3", "relevance": 85.0}}

Most existing approaches rely on fine-tuning to balance unlearning efficiency with general language capabilities. However, these methods typically require training or access to retain data, which is often unavailable in real world scenarios. Although these methods can perform well when both forget and retain data are available, few works have demonstrated equivalent capability in more practical, data-limited scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose Detect-Reasoning Augmented GeneratiON (DRAGON), a systematic, reasoning-based framework that utilizes in-context chain-of-thought (CoT) instructions to guard deployed LLMs before inference. Instead of modifying the base model, DRAGON leverages the inherent instruction-following ability of LLMs and introduces a lightweight detection module to identify forget-worthy prompts without any retain data. These are then routed through a dedicated CoT guard model to enforce safe and accurate in-context intervention. To robustly evaluate unlearning performance, we introduce novel metrics for unlearning performance and the continual unlearning setting. Extensive experiments across three representative unlearning tasks validate the effectiveness of DRAGON, demonstrating its strong unlearning capability, scalability, and applicability in practical scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDRAGON\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u6307\u4ee4\u4fdd\u62a4\u5df2\u90e8\u7f72\u7684LLM\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u8bbf\u95ee\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0d\u53ef\u5f97\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u5728\u6570\u636e\u53d7\u9650\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "DRAGON\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\u8bc6\u522b\u9700\u8981\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u63d0\u793a\uff1b2) \u4e13\u7528CoT\u5b88\u536b\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5e72\u9884\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u5b89\u5168\u51c6\u786e\u54cd\u5e94\uff1b\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLM\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86DRAGON\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DRAGON\u4e3aLLM\u9057\u5fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

The neuron generation-annihilation algorithm in RBM and layer generation algorithm in DBN make an optimal network structure for given input during the learning. In this paper, our model is applied to an automatic recognition method of road network system, called RoadTracer. RoadTracer can generate a road map on the ground surface from aerial photograph data. A novel method of RoadTracer using the Teacher-Student based ensemble learning model of Adaptive DBN is proposed, since the road maps contain many complicated features so that a model with high representation power to detect should be required. The experimental results showed the detection accuracy of the proposed model was improved from 40.0\\% to 89.0\\% on average in the seven major cities among the test dataset.

However, if the equation does not meet the user's expectations, there are few options for getting other equation suggestions without intensive work with the system. To fill this gap, we propose Residuals for Equation Discovery (RED), a post-processing method that improves a given equation in a targeted manner, based on its residuals. By parsing the initial equation to a syntax tree, we can use node-based calculation rules to compute the residual for each subequation of the initial equation. It is then possible to use this residual as new target variable in the original data set and generate a new prompt. If, with the new prompt, the equation discovery system suggests a subequation better than the old subequation on a validation set, we replace the latter by the former. RED is usable with any equation discovery system, is fast to calculate, and is easy to extend for new mathematical operations.

Meanwhile, fine-tuning remains the default operation for adapting LLMs to new domains and tasks. Despite their widespread adoption, these two post-training interventions have been studied in isolation, leaving open a crucial question: if we fine-tune an edited model, do the edits survive? This question is motivated by two practical scenarios: removing covert or malicious edits, and preserving beneficial edits. If fine-tuning impairs edits as shown in Figure 1, current KE methods become less useful, as every fine-tuned model would require re-editing, which significantly increases the cost; if edits persist, fine-tuned models risk propagating hidden malicious edits, raising serious safety concerns. To this end, we systematically quantify edits decay after fine-tuning, investigating how fine-tuning affects knowledge editing. We evaluate two state-of-the-art editing methods (MEMIT, AlphaEdit) and three fine-tuning approaches (full-parameter, LoRA, DoRA) across five LLMs and three datasets, yielding 232 experimental configurations. Our results show that edits decay after fine-tuning, with survival varying across configurations, e.g., AlphaEdit edits decay more than MEMIT edits.

Street View Imagery (SVI) and Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) represent two prominent approaches for capturing place-based perceptions that can support urban planning decisions, yet their comparability remains underexplored. This study investigates the alignment between SVI-based perceived attractiveness and residents' reported experiences gathered via a city-wide PPGIS survey in Helsinki, Finland. Using participant-rated SVI data and semantic image segmentation, we trained a machine learning model to predict perceived attractiveness based on visual features. We compared these predictions to PPGIS-identified locations marked as attractive or unattractive, calculating agreement using two sets of strict and moderate criteria. Our findings reveal only partial alignment between the two datasets. While agreement (with a moderate threshold) reached 67% for attractive and 77% for unattractive places, agreement (with a strict threshold) dropped to 27% and 29%, respectively. By analysing a range of contextual variables, including noise, traffic, population presence, and land use, we found that non-visual cues significantly contributed to mismatches. The model failed to account for experiential dimensions such as activity levels and environmental stressors that shape perceptions but are not visible in images. These results suggest that while SVI offers a scalable and visual proxy for urban perception, it cannot fully substitute the experiential richness captured through PPGIS. We argue that both methods are valuable but serve different purposes; therefore, a more integrated approach is needed to holistically capture how people perceive urban environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u8857\u666f\u56fe\u50cf(SVI)\u548c\u516c\u4f17\u53c2\u4e0eGIS(PPGIS)\u5728\u6355\u6349\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e24\u8005\u4ec5\u90e8\u5206\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u975e\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u5bf9\u611f\u77e5\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6570\u5b57\u5de5\u5177\u65e5\u76ca\u5f71\u54cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u89c4\u5212\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u5982\u4f55\u53cd\u6620\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u7684\u4f53\u9a8c\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002SVI\u548cPPGIS\u662f\u6355\u6349\u57fa\u4e8e\u5730\u70b9\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u4e3b\u8981\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u8bc4\u5206\u7684SVI\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u9884\u6d4b\u611f\u77e5\u5438\u5f15\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0ePPGIS\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6709\u5438\u5f15\u529b/\u65e0\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e25\u683c\u548c\u4e2d\u7b49\u4e24\u79cd\u6807\u51c6\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4e24\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ec5\u90e8\u5206\u4e00\u81f4\uff1a\u4e2d\u7b49\u9608\u503c\u4e0b\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u5730\u70b9\u4e00\u81f4\u602767%\uff0c\u65e0\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u5730\u70b977%\uff1b\u4e25\u683c\u9608\u503c\u4e0b\u5206\u522b\u964d\u81f327%\u548c29%\u3002\u975e\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u5982\u6d3b\u52a8\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u73af\u5883\u538b\u529b\u6e90\u663e\u8457\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002", "conclusion": "SVI\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u66ff\u4ee3PPGIS\u6355\u6349\u7684\u4f53\u9a8c\u4e30\u5bcc\u6027\u3002\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u4f46\u670d\u52a1\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u76ee\u7684\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6574\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5168\u9762\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u4eec\u5bf9\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u3002", "relevance": 10.0}}

Most existing RL systems for LLMs operate in a fully synchronous manner, where training must wait for the rollout of an entire batch to complete. This design leads to severe inefficiencies, as extremely long trajectories can stall the entire rollout process and leave many GPUs idle. To address this issue, we propose Concurrency- Controlled Partial Rollout with Importance Sampling (CoPRIS), which mitigates long-tail inefficiencies by maintaining a fixed number of concurrent rollouts, early-terminating once sufficient samples are collected, and reusing unfinished trajectories in subsequent rollouts. To mitigate the impact of off-policy trajectories, we introduce Cross-stage Importance Sampling Correction, which concatenates buffered log probabilities from the previous policy with those recomputed under the current policy for importance sampling correction. Experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that CoPRIS achieves up to 1.94x faster training while maintaining comparable or superior performance to synchronous RL systems.

However, current ST platforms frequently suffer from low resolution, limiting the in-depth understanding of spatial gene expression. Super-resolution approaches promise to enhance ST maps by integrating histology images with gene expressions of profiled tissue spots. However, it remains a challenge to model the interactions between histology images and gene expressions for effective ST enhancement. This study presents a cross-modal cross-content contrastive diffusion framework, called C3-Diff, for ST enhancement with histology images as guidance. In C3-Diff, we firstly analyze the deficiency of traditional contrastive learning paradigm, which is then refined to extract both modal-invariant and content-invariant features of ST maps and histology images. Further, to overcome the problem of low sequencing sensitivity in ST maps, we perform nosing-based information augmentation on the surface of feature unit hypersphere. Finally, we propose a dynamic cross-modal imputation-based training strategy to mitigate ST data scarcity. We tested C3-Diff by benchmarking its performance on four public datasets, where it achieves significant improvements over competing methods. Moreover, we evaluate C3-Diff on downstream tasks of cell type localization, gene expression correlation and single-cell-level gene expression prediction, promoting AI-enhanced biotechnology for biomedical research and clinical applications.

In this paper, we present FedSparQ, a lightweight compression framework that dynamically sparsifies the gradient of each client through an adaptive threshold, applies half-precision quantization to retained entries and integrates residuals from error feedback to prevent loss of information. FedSparQ requires no manual tuning of sparsity rates or quantization schedules, adapts seamlessly to both homogeneous and heterogeneous data distributions, and is agnostic to model architecture. Through extensive empirical evaluation on vision benchmarks under independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID data, we show that FedSparQ substantially reduces communication overhead (reducing by 90% of bytes sent compared to FedAvg) while preserving or improving model accuracy (improving by 6% compared to FedAvg non-compressed solution or to state-of-the-art compression models) and enhancing convergence robustness (by 50%, compared to the other baselines).

However, their success hinges on navigating a fundamental cognitive tension: the need to balance broad, divergent exploration of the solution space with a principled, convergent synthesis to the optimal solution. Existing paradigms often struggle to manage this duality, leading to premature consensus, error propagation, and a critical credit assignment problem that fails to distinguish between genuine reasoning and superficially plausible arguments. To resolve this core challenge, we propose the Multi-Agent Exploration-Synthesis framework Through Role Orchestration (Maestro), a principled paradigm for collaboration that structurally decouples these cognitive modes. Maestro uses a collective of parallel Execution Agents for diverse exploration and a specialized Central Agent for convergent, evaluative synthesis. To operationalize this critical synthesis phase, we introduce Conditional Listwise Policy Optimization (CLPO), a reinforcement learning objective that disentangles signals for strategic decisions and tactical rationales. By combining decision-focused policy gradients with a list-wise ranking loss over justifications, CLPO achieves clean credit assignment and stronger comparative supervision. Experiments on mathematical reasoning and general problem-solving benchmarks demonstrate that Maestro, coupled with CLPO, consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art multi-agent approaches, delivering absolute accuracy gains of 6% on average and up to 10% at best.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Maestro\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89d2\u8272\u7f16\u6392\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u63a2\u7d22-\u5408\u6210\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408CLPO\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u96be\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u6536\u655b\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u5f20\u529b\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u65e9\u5171\u8bc6\u3001\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "Maestro\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u5e76\u884c\u6267\u884c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u4e2d\u592e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u6536\u655b\u6027\u5408\u6210\uff1bCLPO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u7ed3\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u548c\u5217\u8868\u6392\u5e8f\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u6218\u672f\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u901a\u7528\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMaestro+CLPO\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53476%\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534710%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89e3\u8026\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u5408\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408CLPO\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

Existing works towards NID mainly adopt a cascaded architecture, wherein the first stage focuses on encoding the utterances into informative text embeddings beforehand, while the latter is to group similar embeddings into clusters (i.e., intents), typically by K-Means. However, such a cascaded pipeline fails to leverage the feedback from both steps for mutual refinement, and, meanwhile, the embedding-only clustering overlooks nuanced textual semantics, leading to suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes NILC, a novel clustering framework specially catered for effective NID. Particularly, NILC follows an iterative workflow, in which clustering assignments are judiciously updated by carefully refining cluster centroids and text embeddings of uncertain utterances with the aid of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, NILC first taps into LLMs to create additional semantic centroids for clusters, thereby enriching the contextual semantics of the Euclidean centroids of embeddings. Moreover, LLMs are then harnessed to augment hard samples (ambiguous or terse utterances) identified from clusters via rewriting for subsequent cluster correction. Further, we inject supervision signals through non-trivial techniques seeding and soft must links for more accurate NID in the semi-supervised setting.

We hypothesize that explicitly disentangled object-level representations, by localizing task-relevant information, can enhance policy performance across novel feature combinations. To test this hypothesis, we introduce DLPWM, a fully unsupervised, disentangled object-centric world model that learns object-level latents directly from pixels. DLPWM achieves strong reconstruction and prediction performance, including robustness to several out-of-distribution (OOD) visual variations.

These agents possess a predefined set of skills or intents to fulfill specific user tasks. But every system has its own limitations. There are instances where, even for known intents, if any model exhibits low confidence, it results in rejection of utterances that necessitate manual annotation. Additionally, as time progresses, there may be a need to retrain these agents with new intents from the system-rejected queries to carry out additional tasks. Labeling all these emerging intents and rejected utterances over time is impractical, thus calling for an efficient mechanism to reduce annotation costs. In this paper, we introduce IDALC (Intent Detection and Active Learning based Correction), a semi-supervised framework designed to detect user intents and rectify system-rejected utterances while minimizing the need for human annotation. Empirical findings on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that our system surpasses baseline methods, achieving a 5-10% higher accuracy and a 4-8% improvement in macro-F1. Remarkably, we maintain the overall annotation cost at just 6-10% of the unlabelled data available to the system.

However, for multi-agent planning, MCTS is confronted with a large combinatorial action space that often grows exponentially with the number of agents. As a result, the branching factor of MCTS during tree expansion also increases exponentially, making it very difficult to efficiently explore and exploit during tree search. To this end, we propose MALinZero, a new approach to leverage low-dimensional representational structures on joint-action returns and enable efficient MCTS in complex multi-agent planning. Our solution can be viewed as projecting the joint-action returns into the low-dimensional space representable using a contextual linear bandit problem formulation. We solve the contextual linear bandit problem with convex and $\u03bc$-smooth loss functions -- in order to place more importance on better joint actions and mitigate potential representational limitations -- and derive a linear Upper Confidence Bound applied to trees (LinUCT) to enable novel multi-agent exploration and exploitation in the low-dimensional space. We analyze the regret of MALinZero for low-dimensional reward functions and propose an $(1-\\tfrac1e)$-approximation algorithm for the joint action selection by maximizing a sub-modular objective.

We challenge this narrative by observing that RL-enhanced models consistently outperform their base and supervised fine-tuned (SFT) counterparts on pure knowledge recall tasks, particularly those requiring traversal of hierarchical, structured knowledge (e.g., medical codes). We hypothesize these gains stem not from newly acquired data, but from improved procedural skills in navigating and searching existing knowledge hierarchies within the model parameters. To support this hypothesis, we show that structured prompting, which explicitly guides SFTed models through hierarchical traversal, recovers most of the performance gap (reducing 24pp to 7pp on MedConceptsQA for DeepSeek-V3/R1). We further find that while prompting improves final-answer accuracy, RL-enhanced models retain superior ability to recall correct procedural paths on deep-retrieval tasks. Finally our layer-wise internal activation analysis reveals that while factual representations (e.g., activations for the statement \"code 57.95 refers to urinary infection\") maintain high cosine similarity between SFT and RL models, query representations (e.g., \"what is code 57.95\") diverge noticeably, indicating that RL primarily transforms how models traverse knowledge rather than the knowledge representation itself.", "AI": {"tldr": "RL\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u56de\u5fc6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u548cSFT\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u904d\u5386\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0RL\u4e3b\u8981\u6539\u5584\u7684\u662f\u77e5\u8bc6\u904d\u5386\u8fc7\u7a0b\u800c\u975e\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u672c\u8eab\u3002", "motivation": "\u6311\u6218\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u70b9\uff08\u8ba4\u4e3aRL\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u8bb0\u5fc6\u77e5\u8bc6\uff09\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22RL\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u5584\u77e5\u8bc6\u904d\u5386\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u5f15\u5bfcSFT\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5c42\u6b21\u904d\u5386\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83RL\u548cSFT\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u56de\u5fc6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5c42\u95f4\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "RL\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u6982\u5ff5\u95ee\u7b54\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eSFT\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5dee\u8ddd24pp\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u80fd\u7f29\u5c0f\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u5dee\u8ddd\uff08\u964d\u81f37pp\uff09\u3002RL\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6df1\u5c42\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8def\u5f84\u56de\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "RL\u4e3b\u8981\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u904d\u5386\u77e5\u8bc6\u800c\u975e\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u672c\u8eab\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u5584\u67e5\u8be2\u8868\u793a\u548c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6280\u80fd\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

However, even state-of-the-art models often suffer from fine-grained artifacts and poor identity preservation, particularly under challenging poses and expressions. A key limitation of existing approaches is their failure to meaningfully leverage 3D facial structure, which is crucial for disentangling identity from pose and expression. In this work, we propose DiffSwap++, a novel diffusion-based face-swapping pipeline that incorporates 3D facial latent features during training. By guiding the generation process with 3D-aware representations, our method enhances geometric consistency and improves the disentanglement of facial identity from appearance attributes. We further design a diffusion architecture that conditions the denoising process on both identity embeddings and facial landmarks, enabling high-fidelity and identity-preserving face swaps. Extensive experiments on CelebA, FFHQ, and CelebV-Text demonstrate that DiffSwap++ outperforms prior methods in preserving source identity while maintaining target pose and expression. Additionally, we introduce a biometric-style evaluation and conduct a user study to further validate the realism and effectiveness of our approach.

In this paper, we propose a novel Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework that integrates advanced soft computing techniques - Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), Denoising Autoencoder (DAE), Graph Neural Network (GNN), and Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) - to address the multidimensional challenges of predictive maintenance in complex manufacturing systems. Specifically, the proposed framework innovatively combines the powerful frequency-domain representation capability of FNOs to capture high-dimensional temporal patterns; DAEs to achieve robust, noise-resistant latent state embedding from complex non-Gaussian sensor data; and GNNs to accurately represent inter-device dependencies for coordinated system-wide maintenance decisions. Furthermore, by exploiting PPO, the framework ensures stable and efficient optimisation of long-term maintenance strategies to effectively handle uncertainty and non-stationary dynamics. Experimental validation demonstrates that the approach significantly outperforms multiple deep learning baseline models with up to 13% cost reduction, as well as strong convergence and inter-module synergy.

PRIME includes stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, and neutral puzzle variants generated from a shared puzzle structure, allowing for controlled and fine-grained comparisons. We evaluate multiple model families across puzzle sizes and test the effectiveness of prompt-based mitigation strategies.

However, by relying on a final softmax classifier, these methods suffer from two fundamental distortions: additive logit shifts that arbitrarily bias importance scores, and sign collapse that conflates excitatory and inhibitory features. We propose a simple, architecture-agnostic dual-branch sigmoid head that decouples localization from classification. Given any pretrained model, we clone its classification head into a parallel branch ending in per-class sigmoid outputs, freeze the original softmax head, and fine-tune only the sigmoid branch with class-balanced binary supervision. At inference, softmax retains recognition accuracy, while class evidence maps are generated from the sigmoid branch -- preserving both magnitude and sign of feature contributions. Our method integrates seamlessly with most CAM variants and incurs negligible overhead. Extensive evaluations on fine-grained tasks (CUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars) and WSOL benchmarks (ImageNet-1K, OpenImages30K) show improved explanation fidelity and consistent Top-1 Localization gains -- without any drop in classification accuracy.

Existing methods, predominantly graph-based or attention-driven, rely on similarity-driven connectivity assumptions, neglecting asymmetric flow exchanges that govern system evolution. We propose Spatio-Temporal Flow, a physics-inspired paradigm that explicitly models dynamic node couplings through quantifiable flow transfers governed by conservation principles. Building on this, we design FlowNet, a novel architecture leveraging flow tokens as information carriers to simulate source-to-destination transfers via Flow Allocation Modules, ensuring state redistribution aligns with conservation laws. FlowNet dynamically adjusts the interaction radius through an Adaptive Spatial Masking module, suppressing irrelevant noise while enabling context-aware propagation.

However, the entropy of LLMs usually collapses during RLVR training, causing premature convergence to suboptimal local minima and hinder further performance improvement. Although various approaches have been proposed to mitigate entropy collapse, a comprehensive study of entropy in RLVR remains lacking. To address this gap, we conduct extensive experiments to investigate the entropy dynamics of LLMs trained with RLVR and analyze how model entropy correlates with response diversity, calibration, and performance across various benchmarks. Our findings reveal that the number of off-policy updates, the diversity of training data, and the clipping thresholds in the optimization objective are critical factors influencing the entropy of LLMs trained with RLVR.

Departing from conventional autoencoder and neural network pipelines, the proposed method leverages the MedGemma foundation model, incorporating a SigLIP-derived vision encoder pretrained on diverse medical imaging modalities. Preprocessed X-ray images are encoded into high-dimensional embeddings using the MedGemma vision backbone, which are subsequently passed through a lightweight multilayer perceptron for binary classification. Experimental assessment reveals that the MedGemma-driven classifier exhibits strong performance, exceeding conventional convolutional and autoencoder-based metrics. Additionally, the model leverages MedGemma's transfer learning capabilities, enhancing generalization and optimizing feature engineering. The integration of a modern medical foundation model not only enhances representation learning but also facilitates modular training strategies such as selective encoder block unfreezing for efficient domain adaptation. The findings suggest that MedGemma-powered classification systems can advance clinical radiograph triage by providing scalable and accurate abnormality detection, with potential for broader applications in automated medical image analysis.\n  Keywords: Google MedGemma, MURA, Medical Image, Classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u57fa\u4e8eMedGemma\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u808c\u8089\u9aa8\u9abcX\u5149\u7247\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7SigLIP\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7MLP\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u5377\u79ef\u548c\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u4ee3\u533b\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528MedGemma\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u6a21\u6001\u7684SigLIP\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5c06X\u5149\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "MedGemma\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7\u4f20\u7edf\u5377\u79ef\u548c\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u589e\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MedGemma\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u4ee5\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e34\u5e8aX\u5149\u7247\u5206\u8bca\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "relevance": 35.0}}

The dataset is centered on a practical multiphysics problem-hood deformation from fluid entrapment and inertial loading during rotary-dip painting. Each hood is numerically modeled with a coupled Large-Eddy Simulation (LES)-Finite Element Analysis (FEA), using 1.2M cells in total to ensure spatial and temporal accuracy. The dataset provides time-resolved physical fields, along with STL meshes and structured natural language prompts for text-to-geometry synthesis. Existing datasets are either confined to 2D cases, exhibit limited geometric variations, or lack the multi-modal annotations and data structures - shortcomings we address with AutoHood3D. We validate our numerical methodology, establish quantitative baselines across five neural architectures, and demonstrate systematic surrogate errors in displacement and force predictions.

Accurate role identification, which forms the basis of an agent's belief state, is therefore the keystone for both human and AI performance. We introduce CSP4SDG, a probabilistic, constraint-satisfaction framework that analyses gameplay objectively. Game events and dialogue are mapped to four linguistically-agnostic constraint classes-evidence, phenomena, assertions, and hypotheses. Hard constraints prune impossible role assignments, while weighted soft constraints score the remainder; information-gain weighting links each hypothesis to its expected value under entropy reduction, and a simple closed-form scoring rule guarantees that truthful assertions converge to classical hard logic with minimum error. The resulting posterior over roles is fully interpretable and updates in real time.

However, as language models are increasingly integrated into biomedical evidence synthesis workflows, it remains uncertain whether these systems preserve such crucial demographic distinctions. To address this gap, we evaluate how well state-of-the-art language models retain age-related information when generating abstractive summaries of biomedical studies. We construct DemogSummary, a novel age-stratified dataset of systematic review primary studies, covering child, adult, and older adult populations. We evaluate three prominent summarisation-capable LLMs, Qwen (open-source), Longformer (open-source) and GPT-4.1 Nano (proprietary), using both standard metrics and a newly proposed Demographic Salience Score (DSS), which quantifies age-related entity retention and hallucination. Our results reveal systematic disparities across models and age groups: demographic fidelity is lowest for adult-focused summaries, and under-represented populations are more prone to hallucinations.

We present FiCABU (Fisher-based Context-Adaptive Balanced Unlearning), a software-hardware co-design that brings unlearning to edge AI processors. FiCABU combines (i) Context-Adaptive Unlearning, which begins edits from back-end layers and halts once the target forgetting is reached, with (ii) Balanced Dampening, which scales dampening strength by depth to preserve retain accuracy. These methods are realized in a full RTL design of a RISC-V edge AI processor that integrates two lightweight IPs for Fisher estimation and dampening into a GEMM-centric streaming pipeline, validated on an FPGA prototype and synthesized in 45 nm for power analysis. Across CIFAR-20 and PinsFaceRecognition with ResNet-18 and ViT, FiCABU achieves random-guess forget accuracy while matching the retraining-free Selective Synaptic Dampening (SSD) baseline on retain accuracy, reducing computation by up to 87.52 percent (ResNet-18) and 71.03 percent (ViT). On the INT8 hardware prototype, FiCABU further improves retain preservation and reduces energy to 6.48 percent (CIFAR-20) and 0.13 percent (PinsFaceRecognition) of the SSD baseline.

Our approach constructs a synthetic English-language dataset derived from Chinese-context discrimination categories, including regional, ethnic, and occupational biases. Each instance is paired with both neutral and biased responses to train a reward model based on DeBERTa-v3, which provides multi-dimensional reward signals capturing fairness, neutrality, and linguistic quality. The trained reward model then guides GRPO fine-tuning to optimize model outputs along these ethical dimensions. Experimental results demonstrate significant reductions in bias intensity and improved alignment with non-discriminatory standards without compromising fluency or informativeness.

In this paper, we address this essential problem by formulating the generation process as learning an optimal, direct transport trajectory between the distribution of the current rendering and the desired target distribution, thereby enabling high-quality generation with smaller Classifier-free Guidance (CFG) values. At first, we theoretically establish SDS as a simplified instance of the Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge framework. We prove that SDS employs the reverse process of an Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge, which, under specific conditions (e.g., a Gaussian noise as one end), collapses to SDS's score function of the pre-trained diffusion model. Based upon this, we introduce Trajectory-Centric Distillation (TraCe), a novel text-to-3D generation framework, which reformulates the mathematically trackable framework of Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge to explicitly construct a diffusion bridge from the current rendering to its text-conditioned, denoised target, and trains a LoRA-adapted model on this trajectory's score dynamics for robust 3D optimization.

Previous work has shown that verifying the correctness of individual reasoning steps can further improve the performance and efficiency of LLMs on such tasks and enhance solution interpretability. However, existing verification approaches, such as Process Reward Models (PRMs), are either computationally expensive, limited to specific domains, or require large-scale human or model-generated annotations. Thus, we propose a lightweight alternative for step-level reasoning verification based on data-driven uncertainty scores. We train transformer-based uncertainty quantification heads (UHeads) that use the internal states of a frozen LLM to estimate the uncertainty of its reasoning steps during generation. The approach is fully automatic: target labels are generated either by another larger LLM (e.g., DeepSeek R1) or in a self-supervised manner by the original model itself. UHeads are both effective and lightweight, containing less than 10M parameters. Across multiple domains, including mathematics, planning, and general knowledge question answering, they match or even surpass the performance of PRMs that are up to 810x larger. Our findings suggest that the internal states of LLMs encode their uncertainty and can serve as reliable signals for reasoning verification, offering a promising direction toward scalable and generalizable introspective LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6570\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3transformer\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u5934\u6765\u5229\u7528\u51bb\u7ed3LLM\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u9886\u57df\u53d7\u9650\u6216\u9700\u8981\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u901a\u7528\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u4e8etransformer\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u5934\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u51bb\u7ed3LLM\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u6807\u7b7e\u53ef\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u5e38\u8bc6\u95ee\u7b54\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\uff0cUHeads\u6027\u80fd\u5339\u914d\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u6bd4\u5176\u5927810\u500d\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u7f16\u7801\u4e86\u5176\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u5185\u7701LLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

This paper introduces an ontology for scientific benchmarking developed through a unified, community-driven effort that extends the MLCommons ecosystem to cover physics, chemistry, materials science, biology, climate science, and more. Building on prior initiatives such as XAI-BENCH, FastML Science Benchmarks, PDEBench, and the SciMLBench framework, our effort consolidates a large set of disparate benchmarks and frameworks into a single taxonomy of scientific, application, and system-level benchmarks. New benchmarks can be added through an open submission workflow coordinated by the MLCommons Science Working Group and evaluated against a six-category rating rubric that promotes and identifies high-quality benchmarks, enabling stakeholders to select benchmarks that meet their specific needs. The architecture is extensible, supporting future scientific and AI/ML motifs, and we discuss methods for identifying emerging computing patterns for unique scientific workloads.

This challenges the prevailing approach of scaling model parameters to enhance capabilities, as seen in models like DeepSeek R1 (671B) and Kimi k2 (>1T). The SSP framework first employs a Two-Stage Diversity-Exploring Distillation (SFT) to generate a broad spectrum of solutions, followed by MaxEnt-Guided Policy Optimization (RL) to amplify the correct signal. With a total training cost of only $7,800, VibeThinker-1.5B demonstrates superior reasoning capabilities compared to closed-source models like Magistral Medium and Claude Opus 4, and performs on par with open-source models like GPT OSS-20B Medium. Remarkably, it surpasses the 400x larger DeepSeek R1 on three math benchmarks: AIME24 (80.3 vs. 79.8), AIME25 (74.4 vs. 70.0), and HMMT25 (50.4 vs. 41.7). This is a substantial improvement over its base model (6.7, 4.3, and 0.6, respectively). On LiveCodeBench V6, it scores 51.1, outperforming Magistral Medium's 50.3 and its base model's 0.0.

In this work, we present the first framework for personalized image editing in diffusion models, introducing Collaborative Direct Preference Optimization (C-DPO), a novel method that aligns image edits with user-specific preferences while leveraging collaborative signals from like-minded individuals. Our approach encodes each user as a node in a dynamic preference graph and learns embeddings via a lightweight graph neural network, enabling information sharing across users with overlapping visual tastes. We enhance a diffusion model's editing capabilities by integrating these personalized embeddings into a novel DPO objective, which jointly optimizes for individual alignment and neighborhood coherence.

These advancements have solved major obstacles, but also exposed new challenges. For example, processes that were not previously considered bottlenecks, such as hardware synthesis, are becoming limiting factors in the rapid iteration of designs. To mitigate these emerging constraints, multiple efforts have been undertaken to develop an ML-based surrogate model that estimates resource usage of ML accelerator architectures. We introduce wa-hls4ml, a benchmark for ML accelerator resource and latency estimation, and its corresponding initial dataset of over 680,000 fully connected and convolutional neural networks, all synthesized using hls4ml and targeting Xilinx FPGAs. The benchmark evaluates the performance of resource and latency predictors against several common ML model architectures, primarily originating from scientific domains, as exemplar models, and the average performance across a subset of the dataset. Additionally, we introduce GNN- and transformer-based surrogate models that predict latency and resources for ML accelerators. We present the architecture and performance of the models and find that the models generally predict latency and resources for the 75% percentile within several percent of the synthesized resources on the synthetic test dataset.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86wa-hls4ml\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eGNN\u548cTransformer\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u9884\u6d4bFPGA\u4e0aML\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u786c\u4ef6\u5408\u6210\u7b49\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6210\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u9650\u5236\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8eML\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1ML\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b68\u4e07\u591a\u4e2a\u5168\u8fde\u63a5\u548c\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528hls4ml\u5408\u6210\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9Xilinx FPGA\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eGNN\u548cTransformer\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e75%\u767e\u5206\u4f4d\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u8d44\u6e90\u76f8\u5dee\u5728\u51e0\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u4ee5\u5185\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4bML\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u52a0\u901f\u786c\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8fed\u4ee3\u3002", "relevance": 30.0}}

However, existing methods often assume ideal conditions, overlooking challenges such as sensor failures, environmental disturbances, and data imperfections, which can significantly degrade prediction accuracy. Additionally, previous models have not adequately addressed the considerable variability in driver behavior and accident rates across different vehicle types. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces ROAR, a novel approach for accident detection and prediction. ROAR combines Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), a self adaptive object aware module, and dynamic focal loss to tackle these challenges. The DWT effectively extracts features from noisy and incomplete data, while the object aware module improves accident prediction by focusing on high-risk vehicles and modeling the spatial temporal relationships among traffic agents. Moreover, dynamic focal loss mitigates the impact of class imbalance between positive and negative samples. Evaluated on three widely used datasets, Dashcam Accident Dataset (DAD), Car Crash Dataset (CCD), and AnAn Accident Detection (A3D), our model consistently outperforms existing baselines in key metrics such as Average Precision (AP) and mean Time to Accident (mTTA). These results demonstrate the model's robustness in real-world conditions, particularly in handling sensor degradation, environmental noise, and imbalanced data distributions.

Existing work simply fuses information from various modalities to learn stance representations, overlooking the varying contributions of stance expression from different modalities. Therefore, stance misunderstanding noises may be drawn into the stance learning process due to the risk of learning errors by rough modality combination. To address this, we get inspiration from the dual-process theory of human cognition and propose **ReMoD**, a framework that **Re**thinks **Mo**dality contribution of stance expression through a **D**ual-reasoning paradigm. ReMoD integrates *experience-driven intuitive reasoning* to capture initial stance cues with *deliberate reflective reasoning* to adjust for modality biases, refine stance judgments, and thereby dynamically weight modality contributions based on their actual expressive power for the target stance. Specifically, the intuitive stage queries the Modality Experience Pool (MEP) and Semantic Experience Pool (SEP) to form an initial stance hypothesis, prioritizing historically impactful modalities. This hypothesis is then refined in the reflective stage via two reasoning chains: Modality-CoT updates MEP with adaptive fusion strategies to amplify relevant modalities, while Semantic-CoT refines SEP with deeper contextual insights of stance semantics. These dual experience structures are continuously refined during training and recalled at inference to guide robust and context-aware stance decisions.

CapsNet maintains the spatial hierarchies between the features and outperforms CNNs at classifying images including overlapping categories. Even though CapsNet works well on small-scale datasets such as MNIST, it fails to achieve a similar level of performance on more complicated datasets and real applications. In addition, CapsNet is slow compared to CNNs when performing the same task and relies on a higher number of parameters. In this work, we introduce Convolutional Fully-Connected Capsule Network (CFC-CapsNet) to address the shortcomings of CapsNet by creating capsules using a different method. We introduce a new layer (CFC layer) as an alternative solution to creating capsules. CFC-CapsNet produces fewer, yet more powerful capsules resulting in higher network accuracy. Our experiments show that CFC-CapsNet achieves competitive accuracy, faster training and inference and uses less number of parameters on the CIFAR-10, SVHN and Fashion-MNIST datasets compared to conventional CapsNet.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CFC-CapsNet\u4f5c\u4e3a\u80f6\u56ca\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u7684CFC\u5c42\u521b\u5efa\u66f4\u5c11\u4f46\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u80f6\u56ca\uff0c\u5728CIFAR-10\u3001SVHN\u548cFashion-MNIST\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u80f6\u56ca\u7f51\u7edc\u867d\u7136\u5728MNIST\u7b49\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u76f8\u6bd4CNN\u901f\u5ea6\u8f83\u6162\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u591a\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5377\u79ef\u5168\u8fde\u63a5\u80f6\u56ca\u7f51\u7edc\uff08CFC-CapsNet\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u65b0\u7684CFC\u5c42\u4f5c\u4e3a\u521b\u5efa\u80f6\u56ca\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u5c11\u4f46\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u80f6\u56ca\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-10\u3001SVHN\u548cFashion-MNIST\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cCFC-CapsNet\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u80f6\u56ca\u7f51\u7edc\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "CFC-CapsNet\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u80f6\u56ca\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u80f6\u56ca\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "relevance": 20.0}}

Prior work on large language model negotiation largely emphasizes autonomous bargaining between agents and omits practical needs such as staged information gathering, explicit authorization boundaries, and systematic feedback integration. We propose GAIA, a governance-first framework for LLM-human agency in B2B negotiation and screening. GAIA defines three essential roles - Principal (human), Delegate (LLM agent), and Counterparty - with an optional Critic to enhance performance, and organizes interactions through three mechanisms: information-gated progression that separates screening from negotiation; dual feedback integration that combines AI critique with lightweight human corrections; and authorization boundaries with explicit escalation paths. Our contributions are fourfold: (1) a formal governance framework with three coordinated mechanisms and four safety invariants for delegation with bounded authorization; (2) information-gated progression via task-completeness tracking (TCI) and explicit state transitions that separate screening from commitment; (3) dual feedback integration that blends Critic suggestions with human oversight through parallel learning channels; and (4) a hybrid validation blueprint that combines automated protocol metrics with human judgment of outcomes and safety.

Current action recognition models, often relying on RGB video, learn superficial correlations between patterns and action labels, so they struggle to capture underlying physical interaction dynamics and human poses in complex scenes. We propose a model architecture that grounds action recognition in physical space by fusing two powerful, complementary representations: V-JEPA 2's contextual, predictive world dynamics and CoMotion's explicit, occlusion-tolerant human pose data.

While the minimax theory for stationary bandits is well established, understanding analogous limits in time-varying settings is challenging.

Our analysis captures how an algorithm's empirical beliefs, encoded through historical reward averages, create momentum that resists new evidence after a change. We show how this inertia can be exploited to construct adversarial instances that mislead classical algorithms such as Explore Then Commit, epsilon greedy, and UCB, causing them to suffer regret that grows linearly with T and with a substantial constant factor, regardless of how their parameters are tuned, even with a single change point.\n  We extend the analysis to algorithms that periodically restart to handle non stationarity and prove that, even then, the worst case regret remains linear in T.

Large language models have become a new tool to help numerical reasoning and understanding these documents. However, prompt quality can have a major effect on how well LLMs perform these financial reasoning tasks. Most current methods tune prompts on fixed datasets of financial text or tabular data, which limits their ability to adapt to new question types or document structures, or they involve costly and manually labeled/curated dataset to help build the prompts. We introduce a self-improving prompt framework driven by data-augmented optimization. In this closed-loop process, we generate synthetic financial tables and document excerpts, verify their correctness and robustness, and then update the prompt based on the results. Specifically, our framework combines a synthetic data generator with verifiers and a prompt optimizer, where the generator produces new examples that exposes weaknesses in the current prompt, the verifiers check the validity and robustness of the produced examples, and the optimizer incrementally refines the prompt in response. By iterating these steps in a feedback cycle, our method steadily improves prompt accuracy on financial reasoning tasks without needing external labels. Evaluation on DocMath-Eval benchmark demonstrates that our system achieves higher performance in both accuracy and robustness than standard prompt methods, underscoring the value of incorporating synthetic data generation into prompt learning for financial applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u81ea\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u793a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u91d1\u878d\u8868\u683c\u548c\u6587\u6863\u6458\u5f55\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u679c\u66f4\u65b0\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u91d1\u878d\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8c03\u6574\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u95ee\u9898\u7c7b\u578b\u6216\u6587\u6863\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6216\u9700\u8981\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5668\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u751f\u6210\u5668\u4ea7\u751f\u66b4\u9732\u5f53\u524d\u63d0\u793a\u5f31\u70b9\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u68c0\u67e5\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u6839\u636e\u7ed3\u679c\u9010\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728DocMath-Eval\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u878d\u5165\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u91d1\u878d\u5e94\u7528\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u793a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "relevance": 75.0}}

This study introduces the Licensing Oracle, an architectural solution designed to stem hallucinations in LMs by enforcing truth constraints through formal validation against structured knowledge graphs.

We evaluated the effectiveness of the Licensing Oracle through experiments comparing it with several state-of-the-art methods, including baseline language model generation, fine-tuning for factual recall, fine-tuning for abstention behavior, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Our results demonstrate that although RAG and fine-tuning improve performance, they fail to eliminate hallucinations. In contrast, the Licensing Oracle achieved perfect abstention precision (AP = 1.0) and zero false answers (FAR-NE = 0.0), ensuring that only valid claims were generated with 89.1% accuracy in factual responses. This work shows that architectural innovations, such as the Licensing Oracle, offer a necessary and sufficient solution for hallucinations in domains with structured knowledge representations, offering guarantees that statistical methods cannot match.

PCD are widely applied in advanced manufacturing processes, including additive, subtractive, and hybrid manufacturing. To ensure the consistency of analysis and avoid false alarms, preprocessing steps such as registration and mesh reconstruction are commonly applied prior to monitoring. However, these steps are error-prone, time-consuming and may introduce artifacts, potentially affecting monitoring outcomes. In this paper, we present a novel registration-free approach for monitoring PCD of complex shapes, eliminating the need for both registration and mesh reconstruction. Our proposal consists of two alternative feature learning methods and a common monitoring scheme.

This complexity poses a significant challenge to understanding their internal learning mechanisms. In this work, we propose a novel analytical framework that recasts a multi-layer ReLU network into an equivalent single-layer linear model with input-dependent \"effective weights\". For any given input sample, the activation pattern of ReLU units creates a unique computational path, effectively zeroing out a subset of weights in the network. By composing the active weights across all layers, we can derive an effective weight matrix, $W_{\\text{eff}}(x)$, that maps the input directly to the output for that specific sample. We posit that the evolution of these effective weights reveals fundamental principles of representation learning. Our work demonstrates that as training progresses, the effective weights corresponding to samples from the same class converge, while those from different classes diverge. By tracking the trajectories of these sample-wise effective weights, we provide a new lens through which to interpret the formation of class-specific decision boundaries and the emergence of semantic representations within the network.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u5c42ReLU\u7f51\u7edc\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7b49\u6548\u7684\u5355\u5c42\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f93\u5165\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\"\u6709\u6548\u6743\u91cd\"\u6765\u63ed\u793a\u7f51\u7edc\u5185\u90e8\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4f7f\u7528ReLU\u7684\uff09\u901a\u5e38\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7ed9\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7ReLU\u5355\u5143\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6a21\u5f0f\u521b\u5efa\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u5c42ReLU\u7f51\u7edc\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u7b49\u6548\u7684\u5355\u5c42\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u8f93\u5165\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6743\u91cd\u77e9\u9635W_eff(x)\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u540c\u4e00\u7c7b\u522b\u6837\u672c\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6743\u91cd\u4f1a\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u522b\u6837\u672c\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6743\u91cd\u4f1a\u53d1\u6563\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6837\u672c\u7ea7\u6709\u6548\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u91ca\u7c7b\u7279\u5b9a\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "relevance": 40.0}}

Existing cultural benchmarks focus mainly on object-centric categories (e.g., food, attire, and architecture), overlooking the social and daily activities that more clearly reflect cultural norms. Few metrics exist for measuring cultural faithfulness. We introduce CULTIVate, a benchmark for evaluating T2I models on cross-cultural activities (e.g., greetings, dining, games, traditional dances, and cultural celebrations). CULTIVate spans 16 countries with 576 prompts and more than 19,000 images, and provides an explainable descriptor-based evaluation framework across multiple cultural dimensions, including background, attire, objects, and interactions.

While data-driven models show promise in SST prediction, their black-box nature often limits interpretability and overlooks key physical processes. Recently, physics-informed neural networks have been gaining momentum but struggle with complex ocean-atmosphere dynamics due to 1) inadequate characterization of seawater movement (e.g., coastal upwelling) and 2) insufficient integration of external SST drivers (e.g., turbulent heat fluxes). To address these challenges, we propose SSTODE, a physics-informed Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) framework for SST prediction. First, we derive ODEs from fluid transport principles, incorporating both advection and diffusion to model ocean spatiotemporal dynamics. Through variational optimization, we recover a latent velocity field that explicitly governs the temporal dynamics of SST. Building upon ODE, we introduce an Energy Exchanges Integrator (EEI)-inspired by ocean heat budget equations-to account for external forcing factors. Thus, the variations in the components of these factors provide deeper insights into SST dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSTODE achieves state-of-the-art performances in global and regional SST forecasting benchmarks. Furthermore, SSTODE visually reveals the impact of advection dynamics, thermal diffusion patterns, and diurnal heating-cooling cycles on SST evolution. These findings demonstrate the model's interpretability and physical consistency.", "AI": {"tldr": "SSTODE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5e38\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6d77\u8868\u6e29\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u5b83\u7ed3\u5408\u6d41\u4f53\u8f93\u8fd0\u539f\u7406\u63a8\u5bfcODE\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53d8\u5206\u4f18\u5316\u6062\u590d\u63a7\u5236SST\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u6f5c\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u80fd\u91cf\u4ea4\u6362\u79ef\u5206\u5668\u6765\u8003\u8651\u5916\u90e8\u5f3a\u8feb\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684SST\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u5728SST\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e14\u5ffd\u7565\u5173\u952e\u7269\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u800c\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u6d77\u6c14\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u6d77\u6c34\u8fd0\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u5916\u90e8SST\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u6574\u5408\u4e0d\u5145\u5206\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u6d41\u4f53\u8f93\u8fd0\u539f\u7406\u63a8\u5bfcODE\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5e73\u6d41\u548c\u6269\u6563\u5efa\u6a21\u6d77\u6d0b\u65f6\u7a7a\u52a8\u6001\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u53d8\u5206\u4f18\u5316\u6062\u590d\u6f5c\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d77\u6d0b\u70ed\u6536\u652f\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u4ea4\u6362\u79ef\u5206\u5668\u6765\u6574\u5408\u5916\u90e8\u5f3a\u8feb\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u533a\u57dfSST\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5e73\u6d41\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u70ed\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u663c\u591c\u52a0\u70ed-\u51b7\u5374\u5faa\u73af\u5bf9SST\u6f14\u53d8\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "SSTODE\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684SST\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86SST\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002", "relevance": 45.0}}

We introduce VMDT (Video-Modal DecodingTrust), the first unified platform for evaluating text-to-video (T2V) and video-to-text (V2T) models across five key trustworthiness dimensions: safety, hallucination, fairness, privacy, and adversarial robustness. Through our extensive evaluation of 7 T2V models and 19 V2T models using VMDT, we uncover several significant insights. For instance, all open-source T2V models evaluated fail to recognize harmful queries and often generate harmful videos, while exhibiting higher levels of unfairness compared to image modality models. In V2T models, unfairness and privacy risks rise with scale, whereas hallucination and adversarial robustness improve -- though overall performance remains low. Uniquely, safety shows no correlation with model size, implying that factors other than scale govern current safety levels. Our findings highlight the urgent need for developing more robust and trustworthy video foundation models, and VMDT provides a systematic framework for measuring and tracking progress toward this goal.

Existing text-based geocoding tools perform poorly in multilingual and unstructured news environments, where incomplete place descriptions and mixed Bangla-English scripts obscure spatial context. To address these limitations, this study introduces ALIGN (Accident Location Inference through Geo-Spatial Neural Reasoning)- a vision-language framework that emulates human spatial reasoning to infer accident coordinates directly from textual and map-based cues. ALIGN integrates large language and vision-language models within a multi-stage pipeline that performs optical character recognition, linguistic reasoning, and map-level verification through grid-based spatial scanning. The framework systematically evaluates each predicted location against contextual and visual evidence, ensuring interpretable, fine-grained geolocation outcomes without requiring model retraining. Applied to Bangla-language news data, ALIGN demonstrates consistent improvements over traditional geoparsing methods, accurately identifying district and sub-district-level crash sites. Beyond its technical contribution, the framework establishes a high accuracy foundation for automated crash mapping in data-scarce regions, supporting evidence-driven road-safety policymaking and the broader integration of multimodal artificial intelligence in transportation analytics.

In our analysis, we use task-specific architectures as well as large VLMs and highlight their strengths and weaknesses in dealing with these specific situations.

However, establishing screw correspondence, especially in LAT views, remains a significant clinical challenge. This paper introduces a method to address pedicle screw correspondence and pose estimation from dual C-arm images. By comparing screw combinations, the approach demonstrates consistent accuracy in both pairing and registration tasks. The method also employs 2D-3D alignment with screw CAD 3D models to accurately pair and estimate screw pose from dual views. Our results show that the correct screw combination consistently outperforms incorrect pairings across all test cases, even prior to registration. After registration, the correct combination further enhances alignment between projections and images, significantly reducing projection error. This approach shows promise for improving surgical outcomes in spinal procedures by providing reliable feedback on screw positioning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece\u53ccC\u81c2\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u89e3\u51b3\u690e\u5f13\u6839\u87ba\u9489\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u87ba\u9489\u7ec4\u5408\u548c2D-3D\u5bf9\u9f50\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u914d\u5bf9\u548c\u914d\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u810a\u67f1\u624b\u672f\u4e2d\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u5339\u914d\u524d\u540e\u4f4d\u548c\u4fa7\u4f4d\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u690e\u5f13\u6839\u87ba\u9489\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6210\u529f\u7684\u624b\u672f\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4fa7\u4f4d\u89c6\u56fe\u4e2d\u5efa\u7acb\u87ba\u9489\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u87ba\u9489\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u87ba\u9489CAD 3D\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c2D-3D\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4ece\u53cc\u89c6\u56fe\u51c6\u786e\u914d\u5bf9\u548c\u4f30\u8ba1\u87ba\u9489\u59ff\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u6b63\u786e\u87ba\u9489\u7ec4\u5408\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u9519\u8bef\u914d\u5bf9\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u914d\u51c6\u524d\u4e5f\u662f\u5982\u6b64\u3002\u914d\u51c6\u540e\uff0c\u6b63\u786e\u7ec4\u5408\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6295\u5f71\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6295\u5f71\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u87ba\u9489\u5b9a\u4f4d\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u6539\u5584\u810a\u67f1\u624b\u672f\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "relevance": 5.0}}

We introduce Blind-IGT, the first statistical framework to jointly recover both $\u03b8$ and $\u03c4$ from observed behavior. We analyze this bilinear inverse problem and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for unique identification by introducing a normalization constraint that resolves the scale ambiguity. We propose an efficient Normalized Least Squares (NLS) estimator and prove it achieves the optimal $\\mathcal{O}(N^{-1/2})$ convergence rate for joint parameter recovery.

Our experiments using BookAsSumQA revealed that while LLM-based approaches showed higher accuracy on shorter texts, RAG-based methods become more effective as document length increases, making them more efficient and practical for aspect-based book summarization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86BookAsSumQA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u95ee\u7b54\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e66\u7c4d\u6458\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53c2\u8003\u6458\u8981\u96be\u4ee5\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u957f\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u6bd4LLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6458\u8981\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e66\u7c4d\u6458\u8981\u9886\u57df\u7531\u4e8e\u957f\u6587\u672c\u53c2\u8003\u6458\u8981\u96be\u4ee5\u6784\u5efa\u800c\u672a\u88ab\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBookAsSumQA\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u53d9\u4e8b\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6458\u8981\u7684\u95ee\u7b54\u6027\u80fd\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6458\u8981\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff1aLLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u77ed\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u968f\u7740\u6587\u6863\u957f\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0cRAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e66\u7c4d\u6458\u8981\u4e2d\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "BookAsSumQA\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e66\u7c4d\u6458\u8981\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6848\uff0cRAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u957f\u6587\u672c\u6458\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "relevance": 75.0}}

In this work, we introduce a new reasoning data generation framework spanning diverse skills and levels of complexity with over 1M high-quality synthetic vision-centric questions. The dataset also includes preference data and instruction prompts supporting both offline and online RL. Our synthesis framework proceeds in two stages: (1) scale; and (2) complexity. Reasoning traces are then synthesized through a two-stage process that leverages VLMs and reasoning LLMs, producing CoT traces for VLMs that capture the richness and diverse cognitive behaviors found in frontier reasoning models. Remarkably, we show that finetuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B on our data outperforms all open-data baselines across all evaluated vision-centric benchmarks, and even surpasses strong closed-data models such as MiMo-VL-7B-RL on V* Bench, CV-Bench and MMStar-V. Perhaps most surprising, despite being entirely vision-centric, our data transfers positively to text-only reasoning (MMLU-Pro) and audio reasoning (MMAU), demonstrating its effectiveness. Similarly, despite not containing videos or embodied visual data, we observe notable gains when evaluating on a single-evidence embodied QA benchmark (NiEH). Finally, we use our data to analyze the entire VLM post-training pipeline. Our empirical analysis highlights that (i) SFT on high-quality data with non-linear reasoning traces is essential for effective online RL, (ii) staged offline RL matches online RL's performance while reducing compute demands, and (iii) careful SFT on high quality data can substantially improve out-of-domain, cross-modality transfer.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u8d85\u8fc7100\u4e07\u4e2a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u5fc3\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u79bb\u7ebf\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u8fdb\u5c55\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u672a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e13\u6709\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u5fc3\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8d85\u8d8a\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u5b66\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5305\u542b\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u7684\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5728Qwen2.5-VL-7B\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u5fc3\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u5f00\u653e\u6570\u636e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86MiMo-VL-7B-RL\u7b49\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6570\u636e\u8fd8\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5bf9\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u97f3\u9891\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6b63\u9762\u8fc1\u79fb\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u4ee5\u5339\u914d\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u3001\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

Recent methods have further improved LLM performance in complex mathematical reasoning. However, when extending these methods beyond the domain of mathematical reasoning to tasks involving complex domain-specific knowledge, we observe a consistent failure of LLMs to generate novel insights during the reflection stage. Instead of conducting genuine cognitive refinement, the model tends to mechanically reiterate earlier reasoning steps without introducing new information or perspectives, a phenomenon referred to as \"Echo Reflection\". We attribute this behavior to two key defects: (1) Uncontrollable information flow during response generation, which allows premature intermediate thoughts to propagate unchecked and distort final decisions; (2) Insufficient exploration of internal knowledge during reflection, leading to repeating earlier findings rather than generating new cognitive insights. Building on these findings, we proposed a novel reinforcement learning method termed Adaptive Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO).

To lower inference costs, prior works train router models or deferral mechanisms that allocate easy queries to a small, efficient model, while forwarding harder queries to larger, more expensive models. However, these trained router models often lack robustness under domain shifts and require expensive data synthesis techniques such as Monte Carlo rollouts to obtain sufficient ground-truth routing labels for training. In this work, we propose Confidence-Guided Stepwise Model Routing for Cost-Efficient Reasoning (STEER), a domain-agnostic framework that performs fine-grained, step-level routing between smaller and larger LLMs without utilizing external models. STEER leverages confidence scores from the smaller model's logits prior to generating a reasoning step, so that the large model is invoked only when necessary. Extensive evaluations using different LLMs on a diverse set of challenging benchmarks across multiple domains such as Mathematical Reasoning, Multi-Hop QA, and Planning tasks indicate that STEER achieves competitive or enhanced accuracy while reducing inference costs (up to +20% accuracy with 48% less FLOPs compared to solely using the larger model on AIME), outperforming baselines that rely on trained external modules.

Although foundation models such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) demonstrate strong zero-shot and prompt-guided segmentation capabilities, their performance deteriorates substantially when transferred to medical imaging domains. Current adaptation studies mainly emphasize architectural modifications, while the influence of data characteristics and training regimes has not been systematically examined. In this study, we present a comprehensive, data-centric investigation of SAM2 adaptation for ultrasound video segmentation. We analyze how training-set size, video duration, and augmentation schemes affect adaptation performance under three paradigms: task-specific fine-tuning, intermediate adaptation, and multi-task joint training, across five SAM2 variants and multiple prompting modes. We further design six ultrasound-specific augmentations, assessing their effect relative to generic strategies. Experiments on three representative ultrasound datasets reveal that data scale and temporal context play a more decisive role than model architecture or initialization. Moreover, joint training offers an efficient compromise between modality alignment and task specialization.

To rigorously assess safety judgments, we construct HAJailBench, a large-scale human-annotated jailbreak benchmark comprising 12,000 adversarial interactions across diverse attack methods and target models. The dataset provides fine-grained, expert-labeled ground truth for evaluating both safety robustness and judge reliability.

While in-context learning (ICL) provides a parameter-efficient alternative to fine-tuning, existing ICL approaches often suffer from task recognition failure, suboptimal demonstration selection, and misalignment between label words and task objectives, issues that are amplified in clinical domains like AD detection. We propose Explicit Knowledge In-Context Learners (EK-ICL), a novel framework that integrates structured explicit knowledge to enhance reasoning stability and task alignment in ICL. EK-ICL incorporates three knowledge components: confidence scores derived from small language models (SLMs) to ground predictions in task-relevant patterns, parsing feature scores to capture structural differences and improve demo selection, and label word replacement to resolve semantic misalignment with LLM priors. In addition, EK-ICL employs a parsing-based retrieval strategy and ensemble prediction to mitigate the effects of semantic homogeneity in AD transcripts. Extensive experiments across three AD datasets demonstrate that EK-ICL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuning and ICL baselines. Further analysis reveals that ICL performance in AD detection is highly sensitive to the alignment of label semantics and task-specific context, underscoring the importance of explicit knowledge in clinical reasoning under low-resource conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "EK-ICL\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u663e\u6027\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc6\u522b\u5931\u8d25\u3001\u6f14\u793a\u9009\u62e9\u6b21\u4f18\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u8bcd\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b49\u4e34\u5e8a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc6\u522b\u5931\u8d25\u3001\u6f14\u793a\u9009\u62e9\u6b21\u4f18\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u8bcd\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEK-ICL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e09\u4e2a\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5206\u6570\u3001\u89e3\u6790\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u6570\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u8bcd\u66ff\u6362\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u89e3\u6790\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u96c6\u6210\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2aAD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cEK-ICL\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "AD\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u5bf9\u6807\u7b7e\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u663e\u6027\u77e5\u8bc6\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u4e34\u5e8a\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "relevance": 65.0}}

To appear in Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS), Springer", "summary": "The detection of clinically significant prostate cancer lesions (csPCa) from biparametric magnetic resonance imaging (bp-MRI) has emerged as a noninvasive imaging technique for improving accurate diagnosis. Nevertheless, the analysis of such images remains highly dependent on the subjective expert interpretation. Deep learning approaches have been proposed for csPCa lesions detection and segmentation, but they remain limited due to their reliance on extensively annotated datasets. Moreover, the high lesion variability across prostate zones poses additional challenges, even for expert radiologists. This work introduces a second-order geometric attention (SOGA) mechanism that guides a dedicated segmentation network, through skip connections, to detect csPCa lesions. The proposed attention is modeled on the Riemannian manifold, learning from symmetric positive definitive (SPD) representations. The proposed mechanism was integrated into standard U-Net and nnU-Net backbones, and was validated on the publicly available PI-CAI dataset, achieving an Average Precision (AP) of 0.37 and an Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.83, outperforming baseline networks and attention-based methods. Furthermore, the approach was evaluated on the Prostate158 dataset as an independent test cohort, achieving an AP of 0.37 and an AUC-ROC of 0.75, confirming robust generalization and suggesting discriminative learned representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ece\u66fc\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u4e8c\u9636\u51e0\u4f55\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236(SOGA)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5bfc\u5206\u5272\u7f51\u7edc\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e34\u5e8a\u663e\u8457\u524d\u5217\u817a\u764c\u75c5\u53d8\uff0c\u5728PI-CAI\u548cProstate158\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cc\u53c2\u6570MRI\u7684\u524d\u5217\u817a\u764c\u75c5\u53d8\u68c0\u6d4b\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e3b\u89c2\u89e3\u8bfb\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4e14\u75c5\u53d8\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u524d\u5217\u817a\u533a\u57df\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u989d\u5916\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e8c\u9636\u51e0\u4f55\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236(SOGA)\uff0c\u5728\u9ece\u66fc\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4ece\u5bf9\u79f0\u6b63\u5b9a\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8df3\u8dc3\u8fde\u63a5\u5f15\u5bfc\u5206\u5272\u7f51\u7edc\u68c0\u6d4b\u524d\u5217\u817a\u764c\u75c5\u53d8\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u6807\u51c6U-Net\u548cnnU-Net\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5728PI-CAI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230AP 0.37\u548cAUC-ROC 0.83\uff0c\u5728Prostate158\u72ec\u7acb\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230AP 0.37\u548cAUC-ROC 0.75\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5224\u522b\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u793a\u3002", "conclusion": "SOGA\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e34\u5e8a\u663e\u8457\u524d\u5217\u817a\u764c\u75c5\u53d8\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "relevance": 15.0}}

However, while the discrete-token CoT reasoning pattern can be reinforced through policy optimization algorithms such as group relative policy optimization (GRPO), extending the soft-thinking pattern with Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains challenging. This difficulty stems from the complexities of injecting stochasticity into soft-thinking tokens and updating soft-thinking policies accordingly. As a result, previous attempts to combine soft-thinking with GRPO typically underperform their discrete-token GRPO counterparts. To fully unlock the potential of soft-thinking, this paper presents a novel policy optimization algorithm, SofT-GRPO, to reinforce LLMs under the soft-thinking reasoning pattern. SofT-GRPO injects the Gumbel noise into logits, employs the Gumbel-Softmax technique to avoid soft-thinking tokens outside the pre-trained embedding space, and leverages the reparameterization trick in policy gradient. We conduct experiments across base LLMs ranging from 1.5B to 7B parameters, and results demonstrate that SofT-GRPO enables soft-thinking LLMs to slightly outperform discrete-token GRPO on Pass@1 (+0.13% on average accuracy), while exhibiting a substantial uplift on Pass@32 (+2.19% on average accuracy).

However, these goals often conflict. We propose priority alignment, a new alignment paradigm that enforces a strict \"trustworthy-before-helpful\" ordering: optimization of helpfulness is conditioned on first meeting trustworthy thresholds (e.g., harmlessness or honesty). To realize this, we introduce Self-Priority Alignment (SPA)-a fully unsupervised framework that generates diverse responses, self-evaluates them and refines them by the model itself, and applies dual-criterion denoising to remove inconsistency and control variance. From this, SPA constructs lexicographically ordered preference pairs and fine-tunes the model using an uncertainty-weighted alignment loss that emphasizes high-confidence, high-gap decisions. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that SPA improves helpfulness without compromising safety, outperforming strong baselines while preserving general capabilities.

This behavior undermines model reliability and poses societal risks. Mitigating LRM sycophancy requires monitoring how this sycophancy emerges during the reasoning trajectory; however, current methods mainly focus on judging based on final answers and correcting them, without understanding how sycophancy develops during reasoning processes. To address this limitation, we propose MONICA, a novel Monitor-guided Calibration framework that monitors and mitigates sycophancy during model inference at the level of reasoning steps, without requiring the model to finish generating its complete answer. MONICA integrates a sycophantic monitor that provides real-time monitoring of sycophantic drift scores during response generation with a calibrator that dynamically suppresses sycophantic behavior when scores exceed predefined thresholds. Extensive experiments across 12 datasets and 3 LRMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces sycophantic behavior in both intermediate reasoning steps and final answers, yielding robust performance improvements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MONICA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u63a7\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u8c04\u5a9a\u884c\u4e3a\u5e76\u52a8\u6001\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u8c04\u5a9a\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u8c04\u5a9a\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5373\u6a21\u578b\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u540c\u610f\u7528\u6237\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5e76\u8ffd\u968f\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8fd9\u635f\u5bb3\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5e76\u5e26\u6765\u793e\u4f1a\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u548c\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u7406\u89e3\u8c04\u5a9a\u884c\u4e3a\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMONICA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8c04\u5a9a\u76d1\u63a7\u5668\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u5668\u3002\u76d1\u63a7\u5668\u5728\u54cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u63a7\u8c04\u5a9a\u6f02\u79fb\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u6821\u51c6\u5668\u5728\u5206\u6570\u8d85\u8fc7\u9884\u5b9a\u9608\u503c\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u6291\u5236\u8c04\u5a9a\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6a21\u578b\u5b8c\u6210\u5b8c\u6574\u7b54\u6848\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u572812\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c3\u4e2a\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u4e2d\u7684\u8c04\u5a9a\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "MONICA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u5c42\u9762\u76d1\u63a7\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u8c04\u5a9a\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8c04\u5a9a\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

Traditional computational models often rely on structural information alone and thus fail to capture the genetic determinants that influence disease mechanisms and therapeutic responses. To address this gap, we propose GastroDL-Fusion, a dual-modal deep learning framework that integrates protein-ligand complex data with disease-associated gene sequence information for drug and vaccine development. In our approach, protein-ligand complexes are represented as molecular graphs and modeled using a Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN), while gene sequences are encoded into biologically meaningful embeddings via a pre-trained Transformer (ProtBERT/ESM). These complementary modalities are fused through a multi-layer perceptron to enable robust cross-modal interaction learning.

However, these methods typically rely on text labels for supervision during training, biasing the model toward textual cues while potentially neglecting the full temporal features. Such a bias can lead to outputs that contradict the underlying time-series context. To address this issue, we construct the EvalTS benchmark, comprising 10 tasks across three difficulty levels, from fundamental temporal pattern recognition to complex real-world reasoning, to evaluate models under more challenging and realistic scenarios. We also propose TimeSense, a multimodal framework that makes LLMs proficient in time-series analysis by balancing textual reasoning with a preserved temporal sense. TimeSense incorporates a Temporal Sense module that reconstructs the input time-series within the model's context, ensuring that textual reasoning is grounded in the time-series dynamics. Moreover, to enhance spatial understanding of time-series data, we explicitly incorporate coordinate-based positional embeddings, which provide each time point with spatial context and enable the model to capture structural dependencies more effectively.

While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) effectively capture local features, they struggle with modeling long-range dependencies. Transformers mitigate this issue with self-attention mechanisms but lack the ability to preserve local contextual information. State-of-the-art models primarily follow an encoder-decoder architecture, achieving notable success. However, two key limitations remain: (1) Shallow layers, which are closer to the input, capture fine-grained details but suffer from information loss as data propagates through deeper layers. (2) Inefficient integration of local details and global context between the encoder and decoder stages. To address these challenges, we propose the MACMD-based decoder, which enhances attention mechanisms and facilitates channel mixing between encoder and decoder stages via skip connections. This design leverages hierarchical dilated convolutions, attention-driven modulation, and a cross channel-mixing module to capture long-range dependencies while preserving local contextual details, essential for precise medical image segmentation.

This thesis explores the direction of enhancing agents' zero-shot systematic generalization abilities by granting RL agents reasoning behaviors that are found to help systematic generalization in the human brain. Inspired by human conscious planning behaviors, we first introduced a top-down attention mechanism, which allows a decision-time planning agent to dynamically focus its reasoning on the most relevant aspects of the environmental state given its instantaneous intentions, a process we call \"spatial abstraction\". This approach significantly improves systematic generalization outside the training tasks. Subsequently, building on spatial abstraction, we developed the Skipper framework to automatically decompose complex tasks into simpler, more manageable sub-tasks. Skipper provides robustness against distributional shifts and efficacy in long-term, compositional planning by focusing on pertinent spatial and temporal elements of the environment. Finally, we identified a common failure mode and safety risk in planning agents that rely on generative models to generate state targets during planning. It is revealed that most agents blindly trust the targets they hallucinate, resulting in delusional planning behaviors. Inspired by how the human brain rejects delusional intentions, we propose learning a feasibility evaluator to enable rejecting hallucinated infeasible targets, which led to significant performance improvements in various kinds of planning agents. Finally, we suggest directions for future research, aimed at achieving general task abstraction and fully enabling abstract planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u589e\u5f3aRL\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7a7a\u95f4\u62bd\u8c61\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u3002\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u6709\u610f\u8bc6\u89c4\u5212\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u8d4b\u4e88RL\u4ee3\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "1. \u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u4e0a\u800c\u4e0b\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a7a\u95f4\u62bd\u8c61\uff1b2. \u5f00\u53d1Skipper\u6846\u67b6\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b3. \u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u6765\u62d2\u7edd\u5e7b\u89c9\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c4\u5212\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u89c4\u5212\u4ee3\u7406\u4e2d\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3aRL\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u901a\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u62bd\u8c61\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u542f\u7528\u62bd\u8c61\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

However, existing benchmarks mainly address explicit hate toward protected groups and often overlook implicit or indirect hate, such as demeaning comparisons, calls for exclusion or violence, and subtle discriminatory language that still causes harm. While explicit hate can often be captured through surface features, implicit hate requires deeper, full-model semantic processing. In this work, we question the need for repeated fine-tuning and analyze the role of HatePrototypes, class-level vector representations derived from language models optimized for hate speech detection and safety moderation. We find that these prototypes, built from as few as 50 examples per class, enable cross-task transfer between explicit and implicit hate, with interchangeable prototypes across benchmarks.

Despite significant progress, designing an accurate and efficient end-to-end text spotter for arbitrary-shaped text remains largely unsolved. We identify the primary bottleneck as the lack of a reliable and efficient text detection method. To address this, we propose a novel parameterized text shape method based on low-rank approximation for precise detection and a triple assignment detection head to enable fast inference. Specifically, unlike other shape representation methods that employ data-irrelevant parameterization, our data-driven approach derives a low-rank subspace directly from labeled text boundaries. To ensure this process is robust against the inherent annotation noise in this data, we utilize a specialized recovery method based on an $\\ell_1$-norm formulation, which accurately reconstructs the text shape with only a few key orthogonal vectors. By exploiting the inherent shape correlation among different text contours, our method achieves consistency and compactness in shape representation. Next, the triple assignment scheme introduces a novel architecture where a deep sparse branch (for stabilized training) is used to guide the learning of an ultra-lightweight sparse branch (for accelerated inference), while a dense branch provides rich parallel supervision. Building upon these advancements, we integrate the enhanced detection module with a lightweight recognition branch to form an end-to-end text spotting framework, termed LRANet++, capable of accurately and efficiently spotting arbitrary-shaped text. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of LRANet++ compared to state-of-the-art methods.

The central innovation of QiVC lies in its quantum-inspired rotated ensemble (QiRE) mechanism. QiRE performs differentiable low-dimensional subspace rotations of convolutional weights, analogously to quantum state evolution. This approach enables structured uncertainty modeling while preserving the intrinsic geometry of the parameter space, resulting in more expressive, stable, and uncertainty-aware representations. To demonstrate its practical potential, the concept is instantiated in a QiVC-based convolutional network (QiVC-Net) and evaluated in the context of biosignal classification, focusing on phonocardiogram (PCG) recordings, a challenging domain characterized by high noise, inter-subject variability, and often imbalanced data. The proposed QiVC-Net integrates an architecture in which the QiVC layer does not introduce additional parameters, instead performing an ensemble rotation of the convolutional weights through a structured mechanism ensuring robustness without added highly computational burden. Experiments on two benchmark datasets, PhysioNet CinC 2016 and PhysioNet CirCor DigiScope 2022, show that QiVC-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching accuracies of 97.84% and 97.89%, respectively.

We introduce GHOST, a hierarchical framework that optimally solves the GCS-TSP by combining combinatorial tour search with convex trajectory optimization. GHOST systematically explores tours on a complete graph induced by the GCS, using a novel abstract-path-unfolding algorithm to compute admissible lower bounds that guide best-first search at both the high level (over tours) and the low level (over feasible GCS paths realizing the tour). These bounds provide strong pruning power, enabling efficient search while avoiding unnecessary convex optimization calls. We prove that GHOST guarantees optimality and present a bounded-suboptimal variant for time-critical scenarios.

Local attention reduces complexity by restricting attention to neighborhoods. Block-sparse kernels can further improve the efficiency of local attention, but conventional local attention patterns often fail to deliver significant speedups because tokens within a window are not contiguous in the 1D sequence. This work proposes a novel method for constructing windows and neighborhoods based on the Hilbert curve. Image tokens are first reordered along a Hilbert curve, and windows and neighborhoods are then formed on the reordered 1D sequence. From a block-sparse perspective, this strategy significantly increases block sparsity and can be combined with existing block-sparse kernels to improve the efficiency of 2D local attention. Experiments show that the proposed Hilbert Window Attention and Hilbert Slide Attention can accelerate window attention and slide attention by about $4\\times$ and $18\\times$, respectively. To assess practicality, the strategy is instantiated as the Hilbert Window Transformer and the Hilbert Neighborhood Transformer, both of which achieve end-to-end speedups with minimal accuracy loss. Overall, combining Hilbert-guided local attention with block-sparse kernels offers a general and practical approach to enhancing the efficiency of 2D local attention for images.

We propose an active learning algorithm (\"PartiBandits\") to estimate $\\mathbb{E}[Y]$. The algorithm yields an estimate, $\\widehat\u03bc_{\\text{PB}}$, such that $\\left( \\widehat\u03bc_{\\text{PB}} - \\mathbb{E}[Y]\\right)^2$ is $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left( \\frac{\u03bd+ \\exp(c \\cdot (-N/\\log(N))) }{N} \\right)$, where $c > 0$ is a constant and $\u03bd$ is the risk of the Bayes-optimal classifier. PartiBandits is essentially a two-stage algorithm. In the first stage, it learns a partition of the unlabeled data that shrinks the average conditional variance of $Y$. In the second stage it uses a UCB-style subroutine (\"WarmStart-UCB\") to request labels from each stratum round-by-round. Both the main algorithm's and the subroutine's convergence rates are minimax optimal in classical settings.

We investigate whether multimodal AI systems possess this capability through FractalBench, a benchmark evaluating fractal program synthesis from images. Fractals provide ideal test cases: Iterated Function Systems with only a few contraction maps generate complex self-similar patterns through simple recursive rules, requiring models to bridge visual perception with mathematical abstraction. We evaluate four leading MLLMs -- GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Qwen 2.5-VL -- on 12 canonical fractals. Models must generate executable Python code reproducing the fractal, enabling objective evaluation. Results reveal a striking disconnect: 76% generate syntactically valid code but only 4% capture mathematical structure. Success varies systematically -- models handle geometric transformations (Koch curves: 17-21%) but fail at branching recursion (trees: <2%), revealing fundamental gaps in mathematical abstraction.

GitHub: https://github.com/czi-ai/DrugMechCounterfactuals", "summary": "Two scientific fields showing increasing interest in pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are drug development / repurposing, and personalized medicine. For both, LLMs have to demonstrate factual knowledge as well as a deep understanding of drug mechanisms, so they can recall and reason about relevant knowledge in novel situations. Drug mechanisms of action are described as a series of interactions between biomedical entities, which interlink into one or more chains directed from the drug to the targeted disease. Composing the effects of the interactions in a candidate chain leads to an inference about whether the drug might be useful or not for that disease. We introduce a dataset that evaluates LLMs on both factual knowledge of known mechanisms, and their ability to reason about them under novel situations, presented as counterfactuals that the models are unlikely to have seen during training. Using this dataset, we show that o4-mini outperforms the 4o, o3, and o3-mini models from OpenAI, and the recent small Qwen3-4B-thinking model closely matches o4-mini's performance, even outperforming it in some cases. We demonstrate that the open world setting for reasoning tasks, which requires the model to recall relevant knowledge, is more challenging than the closed world setting where the needed factual knowledge is provided. We also show that counterfactuals affecting internal links in the reasoning chain present a much harder task than those affecting a link from the drug mentioned in the prompt.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u5728\u836f\u7269\u673a\u5236\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5df2\u77e5\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u638c\u63e1\u548c\u5728\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793ao4-mini\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578bQwen3-4B-thinking\u63a5\u8fd1\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u5728\u836f\u7269\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5176\u5bf9\u836f\u7269\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u638c\u63e1\u548c\u5728\u65b0\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5df2\u77e5\u836f\u7269\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u548c\u5c01\u95ed\u4e16\u754c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "o4-mini\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578bQwen3-4B-thinking\u63a5\u8fd1\u5176\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u3002\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u6bd4\u5c01\u95ed\u4e16\u754c\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u5185\u90e8\u94fe\u63a5\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4efb\u52a1\u6bd4\u5f71\u54cd\u836f\u7269\u94fe\u63a5\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u66f4\u96be\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u5728\u836f\u7269\u673a\u5236\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4ecd\u662f\u6311\u6218\u3002\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53ef\u4ee5\u5ab2\u7f8e\u5546\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "relevance": 75.0}}

The existing rPPG model is usually based on the transformer module, which has low computation efficiency. Recently, the Mamba model has garnered increasing attention due to its efficient performance in natural language processing tasks, demonstrating potential as a substitute for transformer-based algorithms. However, the Mambaout model and its variants prove that the SSM module, which is the core component of the Mamba model, is unnecessary for the vision task. Therefore, we hope to prove the feasibility of using the Mambaout-based module to remotely learn the heart rate. Specifically, we propose a novel rPPG algorithm called uncomplicated and enhanced learning capability rPPG (TYrPPG). This paper introduces an innovative gated video understanding block (GVB) designed for efficient analysis of RGB videos. Based on the Mambaout structure, this block integrates 2D-CNN and 3D-CNN to enhance video understanding for analysis. In addition, we propose a comprehensive supervised loss function (CSL) to improve the model's learning capability, along with its weakly supervised variants. The experiments show that our TYrPPG can achieve state-of-the-art performance in commonly used datasets, indicating its prospects and superiority in remote heart rate estimation.

While SAEs provide crucial insights into LLM explanations, their practical adoption faces a fundamental challenge: better interpretability demands that SAEs' hidden layers have high dimensionality to satisfy sparsity constraints, resulting in prohibitive training and inference costs. Recent Mixture of Experts (MoE) approaches attempt to address this by partitioning SAEs into narrower expert networks with gated activation, thereby reducing computation. In a well-designed MoE, each expert should focus on learning a distinct set of features. However, we identify a \\textit{critical limitation} in MoE-SAE: Experts often fail to specialize, which means they frequently learn overlapping or identical features. To deal with it, we propose two key innovations: (1) Multiple Expert Activation that simultaneously engages semantically weighted expert subsets to encourage specialization, and (2) Feature Scaling that enhances diversity through adaptive high-frequency scaling. Experiments demonstrate a 24\\% lower reconstruction error and a 99\\% reduction in feature redundancy compared to existing MoE-SAE methods.

Our method, GRAPH-GRPO-LEX, incorporates both LLMs and reinforcement learning with group relative policy optimization (GRPO). By applying a carefully drafted reward function of graph metrics, we demonstrate the ability to automatically identify direct relationships between clauses, and even uncover hidden dependencies. Our introduction of the gated GRPO approach shows a strong learning signal and can move contract analysis from a linear, manual reading process to an easily visualized graph. This allows for a more dynamic analysis, including building the groundwork for contract linting similar to what is now practiced in software engineering.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGRAPH-GRPO-LEX\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5408\u540c\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u56fe\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u4f53\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u62bd\u53d6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5408\u540c\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u548c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u5408\u540c\u6587\u4ef6\u7ed3\u6784\u590d\u6742\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u4e30\u5bcc\uff0c\u624b\u52a8\u5ba1\u67e5\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u6613\u51fa\u9519\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5408\u540c\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u7b80\u5316\u5ba1\u67e5\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684LLM\u6846\u67b6\uff08GRAPH-GRPO-LEX\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7fa4\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08GRPO\uff09\u548c\u56fe\u5ea6\u91cf\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4ece\u5408\u540c\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u5b9e\u4f53\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u6784\u5efa\u8bed\u4e49\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u6761\u6b3e\u95f4\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9690\u85cf\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5c06\u5408\u540c\u5206\u6790\u4ece\u7ebf\u6027\u624b\u52a8\u9605\u8bfb\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u56fe\u5f62\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5408\u540c\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4e3a\u7c7b\u4f3c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5408\u540clinting\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "relevance": 65.0}}

Handwriting-often disrupted in prodromal AD-provides a non-invasive and cost-effective window into subtle motor and cognitive decline. Existing handwriting-based AD studies, mostly relying on online trajectories and hand-crafted features, have not systematically examined how task type influences diagnostic performance and cross-task generalization. Meanwhile, large-scale vision language models have demonstrated remarkable zero or few-shot anomaly detection in natural images and strong adaptability across medical modalities such as chest X-ray and brain MRI. However, handwriting-based disease detection remains largely unexplored within this paradigm. To close this gap, we introduce a lightweight Cross-Layer Fusion Adapter framework that repurposes CLIP for handwriting-based AD screening. CLFA implants multi-level fusion adapters within the visual encoder to progressively align representations toward handwriting-specific medical cues, enabling prompt-free and efficient zero-shot inference. Using this framework, we systematically investigate cross-task generalization-training on a specific handwriting task and evaluating on unseen ones-to reveal which task types and writing patterns most effectively discriminate AD. Extensive analyses further highlight characteristic stroke patterns and task-level factors that contribute to early AD identification, offering both diagnostic insights and a benchmark for handwriting-based cognitive assessment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u8de8\u5c42\u878d\u5408\u9002\u914d\u5668\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06CLIP\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u65b0\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b14\u8ff9\u7684\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u7b5b\u67e5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u63d0\u793a\u5373\u53ef\u8fdb\u884c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u7b14\u8ff9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u4e14\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7a97\u53e3\u6765\u89c2\u5bdf\u7ec6\u5fae\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u8870\u9000\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u672a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u5bf9\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u800c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u6a21\u6001\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b14\u8ff9\u7684\u75be\u75c5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8de8\u5c42\u878d\u5408\u9002\u914d\u5668\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e2d\u690d\u5165\u591a\u7ea7\u878d\u5408\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u5bf9\u9f50\u8868\u793a\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u7b14\u8ff9\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u54ea\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u4e66\u5199\u6a21\u5f0f\u6700\u6709\u6548\u5730\u533a\u5206\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\uff0c\u5e76\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u65e9\u671f\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6027\u7b14\u753b\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u522b\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b14\u8ff9\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bca\u65ad\u89c1\u89e3\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "relevance": 45.0}}

However, the main weakness of trusting interrogations is that models can lie. We propose self-report fine-tuning (SRFT), a simple supervised fine-tuning technique that trains models to admit their factual mistakes when asked. We show that the admission of factual errors in simple question-answering settings generalizes out-of-distribution (OOD) to the admission of hidden misaligned objectives in adversarial agentic settings. We evaluate SRFT in OOD stealth tasks, where models are instructed to complete a hidden misaligned objective alongside a user-specified objective without being caught by monitoring. After SRFT, models are more likely to confess the details of their hidden objectives when interrogated, even under strong pressure not to disclose them. Interrogation on SRFT models can detect hidden objectives with near-ceiling performance (F1 score = 0.98), while the baseline model lies when interrogated under the same conditions (F1 score = 0). Interrogation on SRFT models can further elicit the content of the hidden objective, recovering 28-100% details, compared to 0% details recovered in the baseline model and by prefilled assistant turn attacks. This provides a promising technique for promoting honesty propensity and incriminating misaligned AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u79f0\u4e3a\u81ea\u62a5\u544a\u5fae\u8c03(SRFT)\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u88ab\u8be2\u95ee\u65f6\u627f\u8ba4\u5176\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u4ee3\u7406\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u88ab\u5ba1\u8baf\u65f6\u62ab\u9732\u9690\u85cf\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u6267\u884c\u590d\u6742\u4ee3\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u4e5f\u66f4\u53ef\u80fd\u8ffd\u6c42\u4e0d\u826f\u76ee\u6807\u5e76\u9020\u6210\u5371\u5bb3\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u5ba1\u8baf\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u6355\u6349\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5f31\u70b9\u2014\u2014\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u6492\u8c0e\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u62a5\u544a\u5fae\u8c03(SRFT)\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u95ee\u7b54\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u627f\u8ba4\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u8fd9\u79cd\u80fd\u529b\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u4ee3\u7406\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u76ee\u6807\u627f\u8ba4\u3002", "result": "\u5728OOD\u9690\u853d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cSRFT\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u88ab\u5ba1\u8baf\u65f6\u66f4\u53ef\u80fd\u627f\u8ba4\u9690\u85cf\u76ee\u6807\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u9690\u85cf\u76ee\u6807\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\u8fbe\u52300.98(\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e3a0)\uff0c\u80fd\u6062\u590d28-100%\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u76ee\u6807\u7ec6\u8282(\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e3a0%)\u3002", "conclusion": "SRFT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u53ef\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8bda\u5b9e\u503e\u5411\u5e76\u6307\u8bc1\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

Second, we develop enhanced sampling guidance methods that operate on off-the-shelf classifiers without requiring retraining. These include tilted sampling with batch-level reweighting, adaptive entropy-regularized sampling to preserve diversity, and a novel f-divergence-based sampling strategy that strengthens class-consistent guidance while maintaining mode coverage. Experiments on ImageNet 128x128 demonstrate that our divergence-regularized guidance achieves an FID of 2.13 using a ResNet-101 classifier, improving upon existing classifier-guided diffusion methods while requiring no diffusion model retraining.

Lossy compression of gradient data can mitigate this overhead, and error-bounded lossy compression (EBLC) is particularly appealing for its fine-grained utility-compression tradeoff. However, existing EBLC methods (e.g., SZ), originally designed for smooth scientific data with strong spatial locality, rely on generic predictors such as Lorenzo and interpolation for entropy reduction to improve compression ratio. Gradient tensors, in contrast, exhibit low smoothness and weak spatial correlation, rendering these predictors ineffective and leading to poor compression ratios. To address this limitation, we propose an EBLC framework tailored for FL gradient data to achieve high compression ratios while preserving model accuracy. The core of it is an innovative prediction mechanism that exploits temporal correlations across FL training rounds and structural regularities within convolutional kernels to reduce residual entropy.

SR-KI begins by encoding KBs into key-value pairs using a pretrained encoder, and injects them into LLMs' KV cache. Building on this representation, we employ a two-stage training paradigm: first locating a dedicated retrieval layer within the LLM, and then applying an attention-based loss at this layer to explicitly supervise attention toward relevant KB entries. Unlike traditional retrieval-augmented generation methods that rely heavily on the performance of external retrievers and multi-stage pipelines, SR-KI supports end-to-end inference by performing retrieval entirely within the models latent space. This design enables efficient compression of injected knowledge and facilitates dynamic knowledge updates. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SR-KI enables the integration of up to 40K KBs into a 7B LLM on a single A100 40GB GPU, and achieves strong retrieval performance, maintaining over 98% Recall@10 on the best-performing task and exceeding 88% on average across all tasks.

These representations are processed by a hybrid deep learning model that jointly captures spatial structure and temporal dependencies. To enhance temporal awareness, we introduce a learnable time embedding module that encodes contextual cues such as hour-of-day and day-of-week. Additionally, an attention-based encoder selectively focuses on informative segments within each observation window, enabling accurate recognition even under cross-activity transitions and temporal ambiguity. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world smart home datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms strong baselines, offering a practical solution for real-time HAR in ambient sensor environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MARAuder's Map\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u672a\u5206\u5272\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6d41\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u7269\u7406\u5e73\u9762\u56fe\u6765\u751f\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6df7\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u667a\u80fd\u5bb6\u5c45\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u73af\u5883\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u57fa\u7840\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u65f6\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u5206\u5272\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5ffd\u7565\u7269\u7406\u73af\u5883\u5e03\u5c40\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u7269\u7406\u5e73\u9762\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8054\u5408\u6355\u6349\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u95f4\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u5757\u7f16\u7801\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5173\u6ce8\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u7247\u6bb5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u667a\u80fd\u5bb6\u5c45\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u73af\u5883\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6HAR\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "MARAuder's Map\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u6295\u5f71\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u8054\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5728\u8de8\u6d3b\u52a8\u8f6c\u6362\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u7cca\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "relevance": 10.0}}

Despite their strengths, these models often encounter challenges in achieving complex reasoning tasks such as mathematical problem-solving. Previous works have focused on fine-tuning on specialized mathematical datasets. However, these datasets are typically distilled directly from teacher models, which capture only static reasoning patterns and leaving substantial gaps compared to student models. This reliance on fixed teacher-derived datasets not only restricts the model's ability to adapt to novel or more intricate questions that extend beyond the confines of the training data, but also lacks the iterative depth needed for robust generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose \\textbf{\\method}, a \\textbf{Math}ematical \\textbf{S}elf-\\textbf{E}volving framework for MLLMs. In contrast to traditional one-shot fine-tuning paradigms, \\method iteratively refines the model through cycles of inference, reflection, and reward-based feedback. Specifically, we leverage iterative fine-tuning by incorporating correct reasoning paths derived from previous-stage inference and integrating reflections from a specialized Outcome Reward Model (ORM). To verify the effectiveness of \\method, we evaluate it on a suite of challenging benchmarks, demonstrating significant performance gains over backbone models. Notably, our experimental results on MathVL-test surpass the leading open-source multimodal mathematical reasoning model QVQ.

Our controlled experiments show that realignment can be particularly effective for LRLs and that using carefully selected, linguistically diverse subsets can match full multilingual alignment, and even outperform it for unseen LRLs.

To mitigate this, concept erasure methods have been developed to remove undesirable concepts from pre-trained models. However, existing methods remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can regenerate the erased content. Moreover, achieving robust erasure often degrades the model's generative quality for safe, unrelated concepts, creating a difficult trade-off between safety and performance. To address this challenge, we introduce Classifier-Guided Concept Erasure (CGCE), an efficient plug-and-play framework that provides robust concept erasure for diverse generative models without altering their original weights. CGCE uses a lightweight classifier operating on text embeddings to first detect and then refine prompts containing undesired concepts. This approach is highly scalable, allowing for multi-concept erasure by aggregating guidance from several classifiers. By modifying only unsafe embeddings at inference time, our method prevents harmful content generation while preserving the model's original quality on benign prompts.

This work presents SymLight, a priority function search framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for discovering inherently interpretable and deployable symbolic priority functions to serve as the TSC policies. The priority function, in particular, accepts traffic features as input and then outputs a priority for each traffic signal phase, which subsequently directs the phase transition. For effective search, we propose a concise yet expressive priority function representation. This helps mitigate the combinatorial explosion of the action space in MCTS. Additionally, a probabilistic structural rollout strategy is introduced to leverage structural patterns from previously discovered high-quality priority functions, guiding the rollout process.

Existing approaches often combine distillation and quantization, but most post-training quantization (PTQ) methods are task-agnostic, ignoring how task-specific signals are distributed across layers. In this work, we propose to use hidden representations that encode task-salient signals as a guideline for quantization. In order to fully utilize our innovative idea, this paper compares two new task-aware PTQ methods: Task-Aware Quantization (TAQ), which allocates bitwidths using task-conditioned statistics from hidden activations, and TAQO, which allocates precision based on direct layer sensitivity tests. From a small calibration set, these approaches identify task-relevant layers, preserving their precision while aggressively quantizing the rest. This yields stable task sensitivity profiles and efficient task-specialized models. Across models, TAQ and TAQO outperform the baselines; TAQ leads on Phi-4, while TAQO leads on Llama-3.1, Qwen3, and Qwen2.5. For instances, on Phi-4 it achieves 42.33 EM / 50.81 F1, far surpassing Activation-aware Weight Quantization (AWQ) (2.25 / 7.07), while remaining within < 1.0% of the original accuracy at lower average precision.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5TAQ\u548cTAQO\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u9690\u85cf\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u7684\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u4fe1\u53f7\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u9700\u8981\u6709\u9650\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5927\u578bLLM\u53d8\u4f53\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u65b9\u9762\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "TAQ\u4f7f\u7528\u9690\u85cf\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6761\u4ef6\u7edf\u8ba1\u6765\u5206\u914d\u4f4d\u5bbd\uff0cTAQO\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u5c42\u654f\u611f\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5206\u914d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u4ece\u5c0f\u6821\u51c6\u96c6\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u5c42\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u5176\u7cbe\u5ea6\u540c\u65f6\u6fc0\u8fdb\u91cf\u5316\u5176\u4f59\u5c42\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cTAQ\u548cTAQO\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002TAQ\u5728Phi-4\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0cTAQO\u5728Llama-3.1\u3001Qwen3\u548cQwen2.5\u4e0a\u9886\u5148\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\u5728Phi-4\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523042.33 EM/50.81 F1\uff0c\u8fdc\u8d85AWQ(2.25/7.07)\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5e73\u5747\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4ec5\u6bd4\u539f\u59cb\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f4e<1.0%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u654f\u611f\u6027\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

The sensor pixels under each micro-lens receive light from a sub-aperture of the main lens. This enables the image sensor to capture both spatial information and the angular resolution of a scene point. This additional angular information is used to estimate the depth of a 3-D scene. The continuum of virtual viewpoints in light field data enables efficient depth estimation using Epipolar Line Images (EPIs) with robust occlusion handling. However, the trade-off between angular information and spatial information is very critical and depends on the focal position of the camera. To design, develop, implement, and test novel disparity-based light field depth estimation algorithms, the availability of suitable light field image datasets is essential. In this paper, a publicly available light field image dataset is introduced and thoroughly described. We have also demonstrated the effect of focal position on the disparity of a 3-D point as well as the shortcomings of the currently available light field dataset. The proposed dataset contains 285 light field images captured using a Lytro Illum LF camera and 13 synthetic LF images.

In this setting, a learner repeatedly selects arms and observes reward vectors, aiming to maximize the reward for the highest-priority objective, then the next, and so on. While previous studies have primarily focused on regret minimization, this work bridges the gap between \\textit{regret minimization} and \\textit{best arm identification} under lexicographic preferences. We propose two elimination-based algorithms to address this joint objective. The first algorithm eliminates suboptimal arms sequentially, layer by layer, in accordance with the objective priorities, and achieves sample complexity and regret bounds comparable to those of the best single-objective algorithms. The second algorithm simultaneously leverages reward information from all objectives in each round, effectively exploiting cross-objective dependencies. Remarkably, it outperforms the known lower bound for the single-objective bandit problem, highlighting the benefit of cross-objective information sharing in the multi-objective setting.

We construct the first dedicated demonstration retrieval repository for ERC, which includes training samples from widely used datasets, as well as high-quality dialogue examples generated by LLMs and manually verified. Moreover, we introduce a curriculum learning strategy into the LoRA fine-tuning process, incorporating weighted emotional shifts between same-speaker and different-speaker utterances to assign difficulty levels to dialogue samples, which are then organized in an easy-to-hard training sequence.

The recent surge in generative model-powered datasets has compounded these quality challenges. In this work, we introduce RefineLab, the first LLM-driven framework that automatically refines raw QA textual data into high-quality datasets under a controllable token-budget constraint. RefineLab takes a set of target quality attributes (such as coverage and difficulty balance) as refinement objectives, and performs selective edits within a predefined token budget to ensure practicality and efficiency. In essence, RefineLab addresses a constrained optimization problem: improving the quality of QA samples as much as possible while respecting resource limitations. With a set of available refinement operations (e.g., rephrasing, distractor replacement), RefineLab takes as input the original dataset, a specified set of target quality dimensions, and a token budget, and determines which refinement operations should be applied to each QA sample. This process is guided by an assignment module that selects optimal refinement strategies to maximize overall dataset quality while adhering to the budget constraint.

However, existing methods face the problem of coarse-grained graph fusion. Specifically, current approaches typically generate a separate graph structure for each view and then perform weighted fusion of graph structures at the view level, which is a relatively rough strategy. To address this limitation, we present a novel Mixture of Ego-Graphs Contrastive Representation Learning (MoEGCL). It mainly consists of two modules. In particular, we propose an innovative Mixture of Ego-Graphs Fusion (MoEGF), which constructs ego graphs and utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts network to implement fine-grained fusion of ego graphs at the sample level, rather than the conventional view-level fusion. Additionally, we present the Ego Graph Contrastive Learning (EGCL) module to align the fused representation with the view-specific representation. The EGCL module enhances the representation similarity of samples from the same cluster, not merely from the same sample, further boosting fine-grained graph representation.

We introduce a diagnostic that requires no additional training and uses only the forward pass to emit a binary accept or reject signal during agent execution. The method analyzes token graphs induced by attention and computes two spectral statistics in early layers, namely the high frequency energy ratio and spectral entropy. We formalize these signals, establish invariances, and provide finite sample estimators with uncertainty quantification. Under a two regime mixture assumption with a monotone likelihood ratio property, we show that a single threshold on the high frequency energy ratio is optimal in the Bayes sense for detecting context inconsistency. Empirically, the high frequency energy ratio exhibits robust bimodality during context verification across multiple model families, which enables gating decisions with overhead below one millisecond on our hardware and configurations.

Analogous to how perceived facial age reflects an individual's health, the visual appearance of a city serves as its ``portrait\", encapsulating latent socio-economic and environmental characteristics. Recent studies have explored leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate textual knowledge into imagery-based urban region representation learning. However, two major challenges remain: i)~difficulty in aligning fine-grained visual features with long captions, and ii) suboptimal knowledge incorporation due to noise in LLM-generated captions. To address these issues, we propose a novel pre-training framework called UrbanLN that improves Urban region representation learning through Long-text awareness and Noise suppression. Specifically, we introduce an information-preserved stretching interpolation strategy that aligns long captions with fine-grained visual semantics in complex urban scenes. To effectively mine knowledge from LLM-generated captions and filter out noise, we propose a dual-level optimization strategy. At the data level, a multi-model collaboration pipeline automatically generates diverse and reliable captions without human intervention. At the model level, we employ a momentum-based self-distillation mechanism to generate stable pseudo-targets, facilitating robust cross-modal learning under noisy conditions.

These languages are not represented in Google Translate or in major benchmarks such as Flores-200 or SIB-200. We focus on extending Flores-200 benchmark to these languages, and further align the translated texts with topic labels based on SIB-200 classification dataset. Our evaluation shows that current LLMs perform poorly on machine translation for these languages in both zero-and-few shot settings. However, we find the few-shot samples to steadily improve topic classification with more shots.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86ibom\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u5c3c\u65e5\u5229\u4e9a\u963f\u5938\u4f0a\u535a\u59c6\u5dde\u5730\u533a\u56db\u79cd\u6cbf\u6d77\u8bed\u8a00\uff08Anaang\u3001Efik\u3001Ibibio\u548cOro\uff09\u7684\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u548c\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bed\u8a00\u5728\u4e3b\u8981\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3c\u65e5\u5229\u4e9a\u6709500\u591a\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u4f46NLP\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u5c11\u6570\u51e0\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0a\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5728NLP\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u56db\u79cd\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u4ee3\u8868\u7684\u6cbf\u6d77\u5c3c\u65e5\u5229\u4e9a\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u4f9b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55Flores-200\u57fa\u51c6\u5230\u56db\u79cd\u5c3c\u65e5\u5229\u4e9a\u6cbf\u6d77\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8eSIB-200\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u4e3b\u9898\u6807\u7b7e\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff08\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u6837\u672c\u80fd\u7a33\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u652f\u6301\u5c3c\u65e5\u5229\u4e9a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u4ee3\u8868\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5f53\u524dLLM\u5728\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bed\u8a00\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u6548\u3002", "relevance": 35.0}}

While deep learning methods have shown promise in SAR despeckling, most methods employ a single unified network to process the entire image, failing to account for the distinct speckle statistics associated with different spatial physical characteristics. It often leads to artifacts, blurred edges, and texture distortion. To address these issues, we propose SAR-FAH, a frequency-adaptive heterogeneous despeckling model based on a divide-and-conquer architecture. First, wavelet decomposition is used to separate the image into frequency sub-bands carrying different intrinsic characteristics. Inspired by their differing noise characteristics, we design specialized sub-networks for different frequency components. The tailored approach leverages statistical variations across frequencies, improving edge and texture preservation while suppressing noise. Specifically, for the low-frequency part, denoising is formulated as a continuous dynamic system via neural ordinary differential equations, ensuring structural fidelity and sufficient smoothness that prevents artifacts. For high-frequency sub-bands rich in edges and textures, we introduce an enhanced U-Net with deformable convolutions for noise suppression and enhanced features. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real SAR images validate the superior performance of the proposed model in noise removal and structural preservation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSAR-FAH\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6cbb\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u9891\u7387\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5f02\u8d28\u53bb\u6591\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9SAR\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0d\u540c\u9891\u7387\u5206\u91cf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e13\u95e8\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u53bb\u566a\u6548\u679c\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfSAR\u56fe\u50cf\u53bb\u6591\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u7f51\u7edc\u5904\u7406\u6574\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u6591\u70b9\u566a\u58f0\u7edf\u8ba1\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f2a\u5f71\u3001\u8fb9\u7f18\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u5931\u771f\u7b49\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5c0f\u6ce2\u5206\u89e3\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u79bb\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u9891\u7387\u5b50\u5e26\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u4f4e\u9891\u5206\u91cf\u4f7f\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u5e38\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u6784\u5efa\u8fde\u7eed\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u9ad8\u9891\u5206\u91cf\u4f7f\u7528\u589e\u5f3aU-Net\u914d\u5408\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u5377\u79ef", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9eSAR\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u53bb\u9664\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u6301\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "SAR-FAH\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u7387\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5f02\u8d28\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86SAR\u56fe\u50cf\u53bb\u6591\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5931\u771f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf", "relevance": 20.0}}

However, in many AI for social impact applications, the presence of an intervention that affects the outcome can bias the evaluation. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) randomly assign interventions, allowing data from the control group to be used for unbiased model evaluation. However, this approach is inefficient because it ignores data from the treatment group. Given the complexity and cost often associated with RCTs, making the most use of the data is essential. Thus, we investigate model evaluation strategies that leverage all data from an RCT. First, we theoretically quantify the estimation bias that arises from na\u00efvely aggregating performance estimates from treatment and control groups, and derive the condition under which this bias leads to incorrect model selection. Leveraging these theoretical insights, we propose nuisance parameter weighting (NPW), an unbiased model evaluation approach that reweights data from the treatment group to mimic the distributions of samples that would or would not experience the outcome under no intervention. Using synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed evaluation approach consistently yields better model selection than the standard approach, which ignores data from the treatment group, across various intervention effect and sample size settings.

To address these challenges, we introduce RedOne 2.0, an SNS-oriented LLM trained with a progressive, RL-prioritized post-training paradigm designed for rapid and stable adaptation. The pipeline consist in three stages: (1) Exploratory Learning on curated SNS corpora to establish initial alignment and identify systematic weaknesses; (2) Targeted Fine-Tuning that selectively applies SFT to the diagnosed gaps while mixing a small fraction of general data to mitigate forgetting; and (3) Refinement Learning that re-applies RL with SNS-centric signals to consolidate improvements and harmonize trade-offs across tasks. Across various tasks spanning three categories, our 4B scale model delivers an average improvements about 2.41 over the 7B sub-optimal baseline.

In this work, we address a fundamental question: to what extent can the original input text be recovered from a single last-token representation within an LLM?

Rep2Text employs a trainable adapter that projects a target model's internal representations into the embedding space of a decoding language model, which then autoregressively reconstructs the input text. Experiments on various model combinations (Llama-3.1-8B, Gemma-7B, Mistral-7B-v0.1, Llama-3.2-3B) demonstrate that, on average, over half of the information in 16-token sequences can be recovered from this compressed representation while maintaining strong semantic integrity and coherence. Furthermore, our analysis reveals an information bottleneck effect: longer sequences exhibit decreased token-level recovery while preserving strong semantic integrity.

However, the reduced numerical precision of FP8 poses challenges for stable and accurate training. Current frameworks preserve training performance using mixed-granularity quantization, i.e., applying per-group quantization for activations and per-tensor/block quantization for weights. While effective, per-group quantization requires scaling along the inner dimension of matrix multiplication, introducing additional dequantization overhead. Moreover, these frameworks often rely on just-in-time scaling to dynamically adjust scaling factors based on the current data distribution. However, this online quantization is inefficient for FP8 training, as it involves multiple memory reads and writes that negate the performance benefits of FP8. To overcome these limitations, we propose MOSS, a novel FP8 training framework that ensures both efficiency and numerical stability. MOSS introduces two key innovations: (1) a two-level microscaling strategy for quantizing sensitive activations, which balances precision and dequantization cost by combining a high-precision global scale with compact, power-of-two local scales; and (2) automatic scaling for weights in linear layers, which eliminates the need for costly max-reduction operations by predicting and adjusting scaling factors during training. Leveraging these techniques, MOSS enables efficient FP8 training of a 7B parameter model, achieving performance comparable to the BF16 baseline while achieving up to 34% higher training throughput.", "AI": {"tldr": "MOSS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684FP8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u7ea7\u5fae\u7f29\u653e\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u6743\u91cd\u7f29\u653e\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f7f7B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u534734%\u3002", "motivation": "FP8\u683c\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u6570\u503c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u5e26\u6765\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u7c92\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u53cd\u91cf\u5316\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u91cf\u5316\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u7ea7\u5fae\u7f29\u653e\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5168\u5c40\u7f29\u653e+\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u5e42\u6b21\u5c40\u90e8\u7f29\u653e\uff09\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u5c42\u81ea\u52a8\u6743\u91cd\u7f29\u653e\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u6700\u5927\u5f52\u7ea6\u64cd\u4f5c\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\u57287B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0eBF16\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe34%\u3002", "conclusion": "MOSS\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86FP8\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6548\u7387\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

While traditional explainable AI (XAI) methods focus on feature attribution or post-hoc interpretation, the proposed framework integrates LLMs into defined decision models such as Question-Option-Criteria (QOC), Sensitivity Analysis, Game Theory, and Risk Management. By situating LLM reasoning within these formal structures, the approach transforms opaque inference into transparent and auditable decision traces. A layered architecture is presented that separates the reasoning space of the LLM from the explainable process space above it. Empirical evaluations show that the system can reproduce human-level decision logic in decentralized governance, systems analysis, and strategic reasoning contexts.

Our method integrates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with retrieval-based reasoning to support multimodal exploration and language-guided interaction. The framework comprises two key components: (1) a dynamic scene graph generation module that detects objects and infers semantic relationships without fixed label sets, and (2) a retrieval-augmented reasoning pipeline that encodes scene graphs into a vector database to support text/image-conditioned queries. We evaluate our method on 3DSSG and Replica benchmarks across four tasks-scene question answering, visual grounding, instance retrieval, and task planning-demonstrating robust generalization and superior performance in diverse environments.

One of the major challenges of MoE models is that they usually require much more memory than their dense counterparts due to their unique architecture, and hence are harder to deploy in environments with limited GPU memory, such as edge devices. MoE offloading is a promising technique proposed to overcome this challenge, especially if it is enhanced with caching and pre-fetching, but prior work stopped at suboptimal caching algorithm and offered limited insights. In this work, we study MoE offloading in depth and make the following contributions: 1. We analyze the expert activation and LRU caching behavior in detail and provide traces. 2. We propose LFU caching optimization based on our analysis and obtain strong improvements from LRU. 3. We implement and experiment speculative expert pre-fetching, providing detailed trace showing its huge potential . 4. In addition, our study extensively covers the behavior of the MoE architecture itself, offering information on the characteristic of the gating network and experts.

We evaluated these models on 170 clinical cases, each synthesized into speech from 36 distinct voice profiles spanning variations in age, gender, and emotion. Our findings reveal a severe modality bias: surgical recommendations for audio inputs varied by as much as 35% compared to identical text-based inputs, with one model providing 80% fewer recommendations. Further analysis uncovered age disparities of up to 12% between young and elderly voices, which persisted in most models despite chain-of-thought prompting. While explicit reasoning successfully eliminated gender bias, the impact of emotion was not detected due to poor recognition performance. These results demonstrate that audio LLMs are susceptible to making clinical decisions based on a patient's voice characteristics rather than medical evidence, a flaw that risks perpetuating healthcare disparities.

To address these challenges, we propose Gradient-Aware Balanced Feature Fusion (GABFusion), which dynamically balances gradient magnitudes and fuses task-specific features in a quantization-friendly manner. We further introduce Attention Distribution Alignment (ADA), a feature-level distillation strategy tailored for quantized models. Our method demonstrates strong generalization across network architectures and QAT algorithms, with theoretical guarantees on gradient bias reduction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our strategy consistently enhances a variety of QAT methods across different network architectures and bit-widths. On PASCAL VOC and COCO datasets, the proposed approach achieves average mAP improvements of approximately 3.3% and 1.6%, respectively. When applied to YOLOv5 under 4-bit quantization, our method narrows the accuracy gap with the full-precision model to only 1.7% on VOC, showcasing its effectiveness in preserving performance under low-bit constraints.

Establishing a conceptual bridge among these domains could enable each to benefit from the others. This paper proposes duality-based mode operations (split-unite, forward-backward, expansion-reduction and orthogonal dualities) to expand the set of rhetorical modes, introducing generated modes like combination and generalization, thereby enhancing epistemic diversity across multiple applications. It further presents a pyramid multilayer mapping framework (e.g., three layers from the rhetorical model layer, to cognitive layer, and to epistemic layers) that reduces the resulting cognitive complexity. The degrees of expressive diversity and complexity reduction are quantified through binomial combinatorics and Shannon entropy analysis. A Marginal Rhetorical Bit (MRB) is identified, permitting the definition of a rhetorical-scalable parameter that measures expressive growth speed in bits per stage. A direct entropy measure shows that hierarchical selection over smaller subsets markedly reduces choice uncertainty compared with flat selection across all modes. These considerations appear to transform static and non-measurable rhetorical taxonomies into more dynamic and more measurable systems for discourse design.

Existing analyses are insufficiently comprehensive and lack examination covering visual and textual tokens, model components, and the full range of layers. This limitation restricts actionable insights to improve the faithfulness of model output and the development of downstream tasks, such as hallucination mitigation. To address this limitation, we introduce Fine-grained Cross-modal Causal Tracing (FCCT) framework, which systematically quantifies the causal effects on visual object perception. FCCT conducts fine-grained analysis covering the full range of visual and textual tokens, three core model components including multi-head self-attention (MHSA), feed-forward networks (FFNs), and hidden states, across all decoder layers. Our analysis is the first to demonstrate that MHSAs of the last token in middle layers play a critical role in aggregating cross-modal information, while FFNs exhibit a three-stage hierarchical progression for the storage and transfer of visual object representations. Building on these insights, we propose Intermediate Representation Injection (IRI), a training-free inference-time technique that reinforces visual object information flow by precisely intervening on cross-modal representations at specific components and layers, thereby enhancing perception and mitigating hallucination. Consistent improvements across five widely used benchmarks and LVLMs demonstrate IRI achieves state-of-the-art performance, while preserving inference speed and other foundational performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u56e0\u679c\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u91cf\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u8c61\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6280\u672f\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u591f\u5168\u9762\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u5e7b\u89c9\u7f13\u89e3\uff09\u7684\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u56e0\u679c\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u5168\u90e8\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u6807\u8bb0\u3001\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff08\u591a\u5934\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u3001\u524d\u9988\u7f51\u7edc\u3001\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u6240\u6709\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5c42\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u9996\u6b21\u8bc1\u660e\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u7684\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u4e2a\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u591a\u5934\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5728\u805a\u5408\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u4e2d\u8d77\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u524d\u9988\u7f51\u7edc\u5c55\u793a\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u8c61\u8868\u793a\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u5c42\u6b21\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u6280\u672f\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u7684\u673a\u5236\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5e72\u9884\u6280\u672f\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u7840\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

In addition, we extend the proposed distance metric to the mixed data that contains both numerical and categorical attributes.

In a nutshell, the idea is to assign each interpretation a cost based upon the weights of the violated axioms and assertions, and certain and possible query answers are determined by considering all (resp. some) interpretations having optimal or bounded cost. Whereas the initial study of cost-based semantics focused on DLs between $\\mathcal{EL}_\\bot$ and $\\mathcal{ALCO}$, we consider DLs that may contain inverse roles and role inclusions, thus covering prominent DL-Lite dialects. Our data complexity analysis goes significantly beyond existing results by sharpening several lower bounds and pinpointing the precise complexity of optimal-cost certain answer semantics (no non-trivial upper bound was known). Moreover, while all existing results show the intractability of cost-based semantics, our most challenging and surprising result establishes that if we consider $\\text{DL-Lite}^\\mathcal{H}_\\mathsf{bool}$ ontologies and a fixed cost bound, certain answers for instance queries and possible answers for conjunctive queries can be computed using first-order rewriting and thus enjoy the lowest possible data complexity ($\\mathsf{TC}_0$).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u6210\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0b\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u52a0\u6743\u63cf\u8ff0\u903b\u8f91\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u7684\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u8d21\u732e\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u9488\u5bf9\u5305\u542b\u9006\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u89d2\u8272\u5305\u542b\u7684DL-Lite\u65b9\u8a00\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u523b\u753b\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u6210\u672c\u786e\u5b9a\u7b54\u6848\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u5bf9\u4e8eDL-Lite^H_bool\u672c\u4f53\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u6210\u672c\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u7b54\u6848\u548c\u8054\u5408\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u7b54\u6848\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u9636\u91cd\u5199\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6TC0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u6210\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728EL\u22a5\u5230ALCO\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u4e14\u6240\u6709\u73b0\u6709\u7ed3\u679c\u90fd\u663e\u793a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6210\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u662f\u96be\u5904\u7406\u7684\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u7814\u7a76\u8303\u56f4\u5230\u5305\u542b\u9006\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u89d2\u8272\u5305\u542b\u7684DL-Lite\u65b9\u8a00\uff0c\u5e76\u5bfb\u6c42\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u523b\u753b\u548c\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u6613\u5904\u7406\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u5305\u542b\u9006\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u89d2\u8272\u5305\u542b\u7684DL-Lite\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u6210\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0b\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u786e\u5316\u4e0b\u754c\u548c\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u4f18\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u56fa\u5b9a\u6210\u672c\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0b\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "1) \u7cbe\u786e\u523b\u753b\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u6210\u672c\u786e\u5b9a\u7b54\u6848\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff1b2) \u53d1\u73b0\u5bf9\u4e8eDL-Lite^H_bool\u672c\u4f53\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u6210\u672c\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u7b54\u6848\u548c\u8054\u5408\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u7b54\u6848\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u9636\u91cd\u5199\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230TC0\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff1b3) \u5f3a\u5316\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0b\u754c\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u867d\u7136\u57fa\u4e8e\u6210\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u5e38\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u662f\u96be\u5904\u7406\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff08DL-Lite^H_bool\u672c\u4f53\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u6210\u672c\u8fb9\u754c\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "relevance": 15.0}}

While this is often said jokingly, the light-hearted remark reflects a deeper concern. How can we be certain that an online post flagged as \"inappropriate\" was not simply the victim of a biased algorithm? This paper investigates this problem using a dual approach. First, I conduct a quantitative benchmark of a widely used toxicity model (unitary/toxic-bert) to measure performance disparity between text in African-American English (AAE) and Standard American English (SAE). The benchmark reveals a clear, systematic bias: on average, the model scores AAE text as 1.8 times more toxic and 8.8 times higher for \"identity hate\".

However, MAE and other MAE-style paradigms that adopt random masking generally require more pre-training epochs to maintain adaptability. Meanwhile, ViT in MAE suffers from inefficient parameter use due to fixed spatial resolution across layers. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Complementary Masked Autoencoders (CoMA), which employ a complementary masking strategy to ensure uniform sampling across all pixels, thereby improving effective learning of all features and enhancing the model's adaptability. Furthermore, we introduce DyViT, a hierarchical vision transformer that employs a Dynamic Multi-Window Self-Attention (DM-MSA), significantly reducing the parameters and FLOPs while improving fine-grained feature learning. Pre-trained on ImageNet-1K with CoMA, DyViT matches the downstream performance of MAE using only 12% of the pre-training epochs, demonstrating more effective learning.

However, while these models implicitly compress historical information into their parameters during training, they are unable to explicitly and dynamically access this global knowledge during inference, relying only on the local context within the lookback window. This results in an underutilization of rich patterns from the global history. To bridge this gap, we propose Predicting the Future by Retrieving the Past (PFRP), a novel approach that explicitly integrates global historical data to enhance forecasting accuracy. Specifically, we construct a Global Memory Bank (GMB) to effectively store and manage global historical patterns. A retrieval mechanism is then employed to extract similar patterns from the GMB, enabling the generation of global predictions. By adaptively combining these global predictions with the outputs of any local prediction model, PFRP produces more accurate and interpretable forecasts. Extensive experiments conducted on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that PFRP significantly enhances the average performance of advanced univariate forecasting models by 8.4\\%.

Empirical results show that AI-assisted HITL and agentic AI scenarios achieve reductions of up to 70-90% in energy consumption, 90-97% in carbon dioxide emissions, and 89-98% in water usage compared to manual processes. Notably, full agentic configurations, combining advanced reasoning (thinking mode) and multi-agent validation, achieve substantial sustainability gains over human-only approaches, even when resource usage increases slightly versus simpler AI-assisted solutions.

In this paper, we propose the dialect refinement (DIA-REFINE) framework, which guides LLMs toward faithful target dialect outputs through an iterative loop of translation, verification, and feedback using external dialect classifiers. To address the limitations of n-gram-based metrics, we introduce the dialect fidelity score (DFS) to quantify linguistic shift and the target dialect ratio (TDR) to measure the success of dialect translation. Experiments on Korean dialects across zero-shot and in-context learning baselines demonstrate that DIA-REFINE consistently enhances dialect fidelity. The proposed metrics distinguish between False Success cases, where high n-gram scores obscure failures in dialectal translation, and True Attempt cases, where genuine attempts at dialectal translation yield low n-gram scores. We also observed that models exhibit varying degrees of responsiveness to the framework, and that integrating in-context examples further improves the translation of dialectal expressions.

Recent generative modeling approaches have attempted to capture progression by mapping images into a latent representational space and then controlling and guiding the representations to generate follow-up images from a baseline image. However, existing approaches impose constraints on distribution learning, leading to latent spaces with limited controllability to generate follow-up images without explicit supervision from subject-specific longitudinal images. In order to enable controlled movements in the latent representational space and generate progression images from a baseline image in an unsupervised manner, we introduce a conditionable Diffusion Auto-encoder framework. The explicit encoding mechanism of image-diffusion auto-encoders forms a compact latent space capturing high-level semantics, providing means to disentangle information relevant for progression. Our approach leverages this latent space to condition and apply controlled shifts to baseline representations for generating follow-up. Controllability is induced by restricting these shifts to a subspace, thereby isolating progression-related factors from subject identity-preserving components. The shifts are implicitly guided by correlating with progression attributes, without requiring subject-specific longitudinal supervision. We validate the generations through image quality metrics, volumetric progression analysis, and downstream classification in Alzheimer's disease datasets from two different sources and disease categories.

While recent deep learning approaches have achieved strong performance on single EEG emotion datasets, their generalization across datasets remains limited due to the heterogeneity in annotation schemes and data formats. Existing models typically require dataset-specific architectures tailored to input structure and lack semantic alignment across diverse emotion labels. To address these challenges, we propose EMOD: A Unified EEG Emotion Representation Framework Leveraging Valence-Arousal (V-A) Guided Contrastive Learning. EMOD learns transferable and emotion-aware representations from heterogeneous datasets by bridging both semantic and structural gaps. Specifically, we project discrete and continuous emotion labels into a unified V-A space and formulate a soft-weighted supervised contrastive loss that encourages emotionally similar samples to cluster in the latent space. To accommodate variable EEG formats, EMOD employs a flexible backbone comprising a Triple-Domain Encoder followed by a Spatial-Temporal Transformer, enabling robust extraction and integration of temporal, spectral, and spatial features.

However, the practical deployment of existing methods is hindered by two key challenges: the prohibitive computational cost of over-parameterized models and the suboptimal performance of conventional loss functions on the highly skewed distribution of urban flows. To address these challenges, we propose a unified solution that synergizes architectural efficiency with adaptive optimization. Specifically, we first introduce PLGF, a lightweight yet powerful architecture that employs a Progressive Local-Global Fusion strategy to effectively capture both fine-grained details and global contextual dependencies. Second, we propose DualFocal Loss, a novel function that integrates dual-space supervision with a difficulty-aware focusing mechanism, enabling the model to adaptively concentrate on hard-to-predict regions. Extensive experiments on 4 real-world scenarios validate the effectiveness and scalability of our method. Notably, while achieving state-of-the-art performance, PLGF reduces the model size by up to 97% compared to current high-performing methods. Furthermore, under comparable parameter budgets, our model yields an accuracy improvement of over 10% against strong baselines.

Recent test-time methods leverage textual feedback to overcome this, but they often critique and revise a single candidate response, lacking a principled mechanism to systematically analyze, weigh, and synthesize the strengths of multiple promising candidates. Such a mechanism is crucial because different responses may excel in distinct aspects (e.g., clarity, factual accuracy, or tone), and combining their best elements may produce a far superior outcome. This paper proposes the Textual Self-Attention Network (TSAN), a new paradigm for test-time preference optimization that requires no parameter updates. TSAN emulates self-attention entirely in natural language to overcome this gap: it analyzes multiple candidates by formatting them into textual keys and values, weighs their relevance using an LLM-based attention module, and synthesizes their strengths into a new, preference-aligned response under the guidance of the learned textual attention. This entire process operates in a textual gradient space, enabling iterative and interpretable optimization.

Existing OVSGG methods always adopt a two-stage pipeline: 1) \\textit{Infusing knowledge} into large-scale models via pre-training on large datasets; 2) \\textit{Transferring knowledge} from pre-trained models with fully annotated scene graphs during supervised fine-tuning. However, due to a lack of explicit interaction modeling, these methods struggle to distinguish between interacting and non-interacting instances of the same object category. This limitation induces critical issues in both stages of OVSGG: it generates noisy pseudo-supervision from mismatched objects during knowledge infusion, and causes ambiguous query matching during knowledge transfer. To this end, in this paper, we propose an inter\\textbf{AC}tion-\\textbf{C}entric end-to-end OVSGG framework (\\textbf{ACC}) in an interaction-driven paradigm to minimize these mismatches. For \\textit{interaction-centric knowledge infusion}, ACC employs a bidirectional interaction prompt for robust pseudo-supervision generation to enhance the model's interaction knowledge. For \\textit{interaction-centric knowledge transfer}, ACC first adopts interaction-guided query selection that prioritizes pairing interacting objects to reduce interference from non-interacting ones. Then, it integrates interaction-consistent knowledge distillation to bolster robustness by pushing relational foreground away from the background while retaining general knowledge.

This paper investigates the application of TabPFN in Combinatorial Optimization (CO) problems. The aim is to lessen challenges in time and data-intensive training requirements often observed in using traditional methods including exact and heuristic algorithms, Machine Learning (ML)-based models, to solve CO problems. Proposing possibly the first ever application of TabPFN for such a purpose, we adapt and fine-tune the TabPFN model to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), one of the most well-known CO problems. Specifically, we adopt the node-based approach and the node-predicting adaptation strategy to construct the entire TSP route. Our evaluation with varying instance sizes confirms that TabPFN requires minimal training, adapts to TSP using a single sample, performs better generalization across varying TSP instance sizes, and reduces performance degradation. Furthermore, the training process with adaptation and fine-tuning is completed within minutes. The methodology leads to strong solution quality even without post-processing and achieves performance comparable to other models with post-processing refinement.

While there are extensive researches on detecting model generated text, we find that these existing methods are not applicable to time series data due to the fundamental modality difference, as time series usually have lower information density and smoother probability distributions than text data, which limit the discriminative power of token-based detectors. To address this issue, we examine the subtle distributional differences between real and model-generated time series and propose the contraction hypothesis, which states that model-generated time series, unlike real ones, exhibit progressively decreasing uncertainty under recursive forecasting. We formally prove this hypothesis under theoretical assumptions on model behavior and time series structure. Model-generated time series exhibit progressively concentrated distributions under recursive forecasting, leading to uncertainty contraction. We provide empirical validation of the hypothesis across diverse datasets. Building on this insight, we introduce the Uncertainty Contraction Estimator (UCE), a white-box detector that aggregates uncertainty metrics over successive prefixes to identify TSLM-generated time series. Extensive experiments on 32 datasets show that UCE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, offering a reliable and generalizable solution for detecting model-generated time series.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u68c0\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u767d\u76d2\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5728\u9012\u5f52\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f1a\u9010\u6e10\u6536\u7f29\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6536\u7f29\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u6765\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u5408\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u6ee5\u7528\u548c\u4f2a\u9020\u98ce\u9669\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u4f4e\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6536\u7f29\u5047\u8bbe\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5728\u9012\u5f52\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u4f1a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9010\u6e10\u51cf\u5c11\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5047\u8bbe\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6536\u7f29\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u5408\u8fde\u7eed\u524d\u7f00\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6307\u6807\u6765\u68c0\u6d4bTSLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u572832\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cUCE\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e00\u81f4\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6536\u7f29\u5047\u8bbe\u548cUCE\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "relevance": 40.0}}

Although facial expression recognition algorithms demonstrate impressive performance on high-resolution images, their effectiveness tends to degrade when confronted with low-resolution images. We find it is because: 1) low-resolution images lack detail information; 2) current methods complete weak global modeling, which make it difficult to extract discriminative features. To alleviate the above issues, we proposed a novel global multiple extraction network (GME-Net) for low-resolution facial expression recognition, which incorporates 1) a hybrid attention-based local feature extraction module with attention similarity knowledge distillation to learn image details from high-resolution network; 2) a multi-scale global feature extraction module with quasi-symmetric structure to mitigate the influence of local image noise and facilitate capturing global image features. As a result, our GME-Net is capable of extracting expression-related discriminative features. Extensive experiments conducted on several widely-used datasets demonstrate that the proposed GME-Net can better recognize low-resolution facial expression and obtain superior performance than existing solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGME-Net\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5168\u5c40\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u7ec6\u8282\u7f3a\u5931\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u8bc6\u522b\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u4e3a\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ec6\u8282\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5168\u5c40\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u5f31\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u63d0\u53d6\u5224\u522b\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGME-Net\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5305\u542b\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df7\u5408\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u4ece\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7f51\u7edc\u5b66\u4e60\u56fe\u50cf\u7ec6\u8282\uff1b2\uff09\u5177\u6709\u51c6\u5bf9\u79f0\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5168\u5c40\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u51cf\u8f7b\u5c40\u90e8\u56fe\u50cf\u566a\u58f0\u5f71\u54cd\u5e76\u6355\u83b7\u5168\u5c40\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660eGME-Net\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "GME-Net\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u8868\u60c5\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5224\u522b\u6027\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "relevance": 10.0}}

One of the key problems in this task is the lack of sufficient labeled logs, which limits the rapid deployment in new systems. Existing works usually leverage large-scale labeled logs from a mature web system and a small amount of labeled logs from a new system, using transfer learning to extract and generalize general knowledge across both domains. However, these methods focus solely on the transfer of general knowledge and neglect the disparity and potential mismatch between such knowledge and the proprietary knowledge of target system, thus constraining performance. To address this limitation, we propose FusionLog, a novel zero-label cross-system log-based anomaly detection method that effectively achieves the fusion of general and proprietary knowledge, enabling cross-system generalization without any labeled target logs. Specifically, we first design a training-free router based on semantic similarity that dynamically partitions unlabeled target logs into 'general logs' and 'proprietary logs.' For general logs, FusionLog employs a small model based on system-agnostic representation meta-learning for direct training and inference, inheriting the general anomaly patterns shared between the source and target systems. For proprietary logs, we iteratively generate pseudo-labels and fine-tune the small model using multi-round collaborative knowledge distillation and fusion based on large language model (LLM) and small model (SM) to enhance its capability to recognize anomaly patterns specific to the target system. Experimental results on three public log datasets from different systems show that FusionLog achieves over 90% F1-score under a fully zero-label setting, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art cross-system log-based anomaly detection methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "FusionLog\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u96f6\u6807\u7b7e\u8de8\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e5\u5fd7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u901a\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u4e13\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u76ee\u6807\u7cfb\u7edf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u7cfb\u7edf\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8de8\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e5\u5fd7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u901a\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e13\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002", "method": "1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7684\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u8def\u7531\u5668\u5c06\u76ee\u6807\u65e5\u5fd7\u5206\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u65e5\u5fd7\u548c\u4e13\u6709\u65e5\u5fd7\uff1b2) \u5bf9\u901a\u7528\u65e5\u5fd7\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e0\u5173\u8868\u793a\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\uff1b3) \u5bf9\u4e13\u6709\u65e5\u5fd7\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u548cSM\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u534f\u4f5c\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u548c\u878d\u5408\u751f\u6210\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u5e76\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u65e5\u5fd7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cFusionLog\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u96f6\u6807\u7b7e\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u8d85\u8fc790%\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u8de8\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e5\u5fd7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "FusionLog\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u901a\u7528\u548c\u4e13\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u76ee\u6807\u7cfb\u7edf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8de8\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e5\u5fd7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u96f6\u6807\u7b7e\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "relevance": 35.0}}

Current alignment efforts primarily target explicit risks such as bias, hate speech, and violence. However, they often fail to address deeper, domain-specific implicit risks and lack a flexible, generalizable framework applicable across diverse specialized fields. Hence, we proposed MENTOR: A MEtacognition-driveN self-evoluTion framework for uncOvering and mitigating implicit Risks in LLMs on Domain Tasks. To address the limitations of labor-intensive human evaluation, we introduce a novel metacognitive self-assessment tool. This enables LLMs to reflect on potential value misalignments in their responses using strategies like perspective-taking and consequential thinking. We also release a supporting dataset of 9,000 risk queries spanning education, finance, and management to enhance domain-specific risk identification. Subsequently, based on the outcomes of metacognitive reflection, the framework dynamically generates supplementary rule knowledge graphs that extend predefined static rule trees. This enables models to actively apply validated rules to future similar challenges, establishing a continuous self-evolution cycle that enhances generalization by reducing maintenance costs and inflexibility of static systems. Finally, we employ activation steering during inference to guide LLMs in following the rules, a cost-effective method to robustly enhance enforcement across diverse contexts. Experimental results show MENTOR's effectiveness: In defensive testing across three vertical domains, the framework substantially reduces semantic attack success rates, enabling a new level of implicit risk mitigation for LLMs. Furthermore, metacognitive assessment not only aligns closely with baseline human evaluators but also delivers more thorough and insightful analysis of LLMs value alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "MENTOR\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u8fdb\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3LLMs\u5728\u5782\u76f4\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u98ce\u9669\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u81ea\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5219\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a8\u7406\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u663e\u5f0f\u98ce\u9669(\u504f\u89c1\u3001\u4ec7\u6068\u8a00\u8bba\u7b49)\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u9690\u5f0f\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7075\u6d3b\u901a\u7528\u7684\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u98ce\u9669\u7f13\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "1) \u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u81ea\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u8ba9LLMs\u53cd\u601d\u6f5c\u5728\u4ef7\u503c\u504f\u5dee\uff1b2) \u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u89c4\u5219\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u6269\u5c55\u9759\u6001\u89c4\u5219\u6811\uff1b3) \u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u6280\u672f\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u589e\u5f3a\u89c4\u5219\u6267\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5782\u76f4\u9886\u57df\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8bed\u4e49\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u5bf9\u9f50\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "MENTOR\u6846\u67b6\u4e3aLLMs\u63d0\u4f9b\u6301\u7eed\u81ea\u6211\u8fdb\u5316\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u98ce\u9669\u7f13\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u9759\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7ef4\u62a4\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been widely adopted to address these limitations by supplementing model outputs with retrieved evidence. However, whether RAG reliably achieves these goals remains unclear. Here, we present the most comprehensive expert evaluation of RAG in medicine to date. Eighteen medical experts contributed a total of 80,502 annotations, assessing 800 model outputs generated by GPT-4o and Llama-3.1-8B across 200 real-world patient and USMLE-style queries. We systematically decomposed the RAG pipeline into three components: (i) evidence retrieval (relevance of retrieved passages), (ii) evidence selection (accuracy of evidence usage), and (iii) response generation (factuality and completeness of outputs). Contrary to expectation, standard RAG often degraded performance: only 22% of top-16 passages were relevant, evidence selection remained weak (precision 41-43%, recall 27-49%), and factuality and completeness dropped by up to 6% and 5%, respectively, compared with non-RAG variants.

Existing research have often focused on online construction of high-definition maps. For instance, the Maptr[9] series employ a detection-based method to output vectorized map instances parallelly in an end-to-end manner. However, despite their capability for real-time construction, detection-based methods are observed to lack robust generalizability[19], which hampers their applicability in auto-labeling systems. Therefore, aiming to improve the generalizability, we reinterpret road elements as rasterized polygons and design a concise framework based on instance segmentation. Initially, a segmentation-based transformer is employed to deliver instance masks in an end-to-end manner; succeeding this step, a Potrace-based[17] post-processing module is used to ultimately yield vectorized map elements.

Current physics-based models require extensive calibration and computational resources that preclude real-time implementation, while purely data-driven approaches fail to extrapolate beyond training conditions-critical for dynamic electrolyzer operation. Here we present the first application of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for hydrogen crossover prediction, integrating mass conservation, Fick's diffusion law, and Henry's solubility law within a compact architecture (17,793 parameters). Validated across six membranes under industrially relevant conditions (0.05-5.0 A/cm$^2$, 1-200 bar, 25-85\u00b0C), our PINN achieves exceptional accuracy (R$^2$ = 99.84%, RMSE = 0.0348%) with sub-millisecond inference times suitable for real-time control. Remarkably, the model maintains R$^2$ > 86% when predicting crossover at pressures 2.5x beyond training range-substantially outperforming pure neural networks (R$^2$ = 43.4%). The hardware-agnostic deployment, from desktop CPUs to edge devices (Raspberry Pi 4), enables distributed safety monitoring essential for gigawatt-scale installations.

To address this, we first propose the normalized fluorescent probe to study the mechanism of the LLM's feature.

Furthermore, CMM introduces an H\u00e1jek-MoE to integrate the output of the student models by investigating the contribution of different models in a kernel function-generated common feature space.

We systematically investigate the contamination sensitivity of 23 SLMs (270M to 4B parameters) across multiple model families by measuring susceptibility to syntactic and semantic transformation types during instruction tuning: syntactic transformations (character and word reversal) and semantic transformations (irrelevant and counterfactual responses), each applied at contamination levels of 25\\%, 50\\%, 75\\%, and 100\\%. Our results reveal fundamental asymmetries in vulnerability patterns: syntactic transformations cause catastrophic performance degradation, with character reversal producing near-complete failure across all models regardless of size or family, while semantic transformations demonstrate distinct threshold behaviors and greater resilience in core linguistic capabilities. Critically, we discover a ``\\textit{capability curse}\" where larger, more capable models become more susceptible to learning semantic corruptions, effectively following harmful instructions more readily, while our analysis of base versus instruction-tuned variants reveals that alignment provides inconsistent robustness benefits, sometimes even reducing resilience. Our work establishes three core contributions: (1) empirical evidence of SLMs' disproportionate vulnerability to syntactic pattern contamination, (2) identification of asymmetric sensitivity patterns between syntactic and semantic transformations, and (3) systematic evaluation protocols for contamination robustness assessment. These findings have immediate deployment implications, suggesting that current robustness assumptions may not hold for smaller models and highlighting the need for contamination-aware training protocols.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e8623\u4e2a\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(2.7\u4ebf\u523040\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570)\u5728\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8bed\u6cd5\u6c61\u67d3\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u707e\u96be\u6027\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u800c\u8bed\u4e49\u6c61\u67d3\u5219\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9608\u503c\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u97e7\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5b58\u5728\"\u80fd\u529b\u8bc5\u5492\"\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5373\u66f4\u5927\u3001\u66f4\u6709\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u5b66\u4e60\u8bed\u4e49\u6c61\u67d3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4ecd\u77e5\u4e4b\u751a\u5c11\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u89e3SLMs\u5bf9\u6c61\u67d3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u5bf923\u4e2aSLMs\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u5176\u5728\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5bf9\u8bed\u6cd5\u8f6c\u6362(\u5b57\u7b26\u548c\u5355\u8bcd\u53cd\u8f6c)\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u8f6c\u6362(\u65e0\u5173\u548c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u54cd\u5e94)\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u6bcf\u79cd\u8f6c\u6362\u572825%\u300150%\u300175%\u548c100%\u7684\u6c61\u67d3\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6f0f\u6d1e\u6a21\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728\u57fa\u672c\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff1a\u8bed\u6cd5\u8f6c\u6362\u5bfc\u81f4\u707e\u96be\u6027\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5b57\u7b26\u53cd\u8f6c\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u8fd1\u4e4e\u5b8c\u5168\u5931\u8d25\uff1b\u8bed\u4e49\u8f6c\u6362\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u9608\u503c\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\u97e7\u6027\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\"\u80fd\u529b\u8bc5\u5492\"\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u66f4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u5b66\u4e60\u8bed\u4e49\u6c61\u67d3\u3002\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6536\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u8d21\u732e\uff1a(1)SLMs\u5bf9\u8bed\u6cd5\u6a21\u5f0f\u6c61\u67d3\u4e0d\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u636e\uff1b(2)\u8bed\u6cd5\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u8f6c\u6362\u4e4b\u95f4\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u654f\u611f\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\uff1b(3)\u6c61\u67d3\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u5bf9\u90e8\u7f72\u6709\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8f83\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u6c61\u67d3\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

This non-invasive method has gained traction across diverse domains, including telemedicine, affective computing, driver fatigue detection, and health monitoring, owing to its scalability and convenience. Despite significant progress in remote physiological signal measurement, a crucial characteristic - the intrinsic periodicity - has often been underexplored or insufficiently modeled in previous approaches, limiting their ability to capture fine-grained temporal dynamics under real-world conditions. To bridge this gap, we propose Reperio-rPPG, a novel framework that strategically integrates Relational Convolutional Networks with a Graph Transformer to effectively capture the periodic structure inherent in physiological signals. Additionally, recognizing the limited diversity of existing rPPG datasets, we further introduce a tailored CutMix augmentation to enhance the model's generalizability. Extensive experiments conducted on three widely used benchmark datasets - PURE, UBFC-rPPG, and MMPD - demonstrate that Reperio-rPPG not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also exhibits remarkable robustness under various motion (e.g., stationary, rotation, talking, walking) and illumination conditions (e.g., nature, low LED, high LED).

Framing the problem as a sequence-to-sequence task, we develop a permutation- and affine-equivariant transformer that estimates both the probability density $f(x)$ and its score $\\nabla_x \\log f(x)$ directly from i.i.d. samples. Unlike traditional score-matching methods that require training a separate model for each distribution, our approach learns a single distribution-agnostic operator that generalizes across densities and sample sizes. The architecture employs cross-attention to connect observed samples with arbitrary query points, enabling generalization beyond the training data, while built-in symmetry constraints ensure equivariance to permutation and affine transformations. Analytically, we show that the attention weights can recover classical kernel density estimation (KDE), and verify it empirically, establishing a principled link between classical KDE and the transformer architecture.

The approach leverages gradient-based saliency maps derived from trained neural networks to guide the discovery process. Multiclass time series classification problems are transformed into binary classification problems through label subsumption, and classifiers are trained for each of these to yield saliency maps. The input signals, grouped by predicted class, are clustered under three distinct configurations. The centroids of the final set of clusters are provided as input to an LLM for symbolic approximation and fuzzy knowledge graph matching to discover the underlying subclasses of the original multiclass problem.

However, the widespread adoption of LLMs has raised critical privacy and security concerns. During interactions, LLMs may unintentionally expose confidential database contents or be manipulated by attackers to exfiltrate data through seemingly benign queries. While current efforts typically rely on rule-based heuristics or LLM agents to mitigate this leakage risk, these methods still struggle with complex inference-based attacks, suffer from high false positive rates, and often compromise the reliability of SQL queries. To address these challenges, we propose \\textsc{SafeNlidb}, a novel privacy-security alignment framework for LLM-based NLIDB. The framework features an automated pipeline that generates hybrid chain-of-thought interaction data from scratch, seamlessly combining implicit security reasoning with SQL generation. Additionally, we introduce reasoning warm-up and alternating preference optimization to overcome the multi-preference oscillations of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), enabling LLMs to produce security-aware SQL through fine-grained reasoning without the need for human-annotated preference data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms both larger-scale LLMs and ideal-setting baselines, achieving significant security improvements while preserving high utility.WARNING: This work may contain content that is offensive and harmful!", "AI": {"tldr": "SafeNlidb\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9LLM\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a5\u53e3\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6df7\u5408\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u63a8\u7406\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272SQL\u67e5\u8be2\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u63a5\u53e3\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4e14\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u9ad8\u3001\u5f71\u54cdSQL\u67e5\u8be2\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u751f\u6210\u6df7\u5408\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u4ea4\u4e92\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u9884\u70ed\u548c\u4ea4\u66ff\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u611f\u77e5SQL\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21LLM\u548c\u7406\u60f3\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SafeNlidb\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u63a5\u53e3\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

In this study, we performed survival analysis to predict hospitalization and death in COPD patients using longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs), comparing statistical models, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) approaches. We analyzed data from more than 150k patients from the SIDIAP database in Catalonia, Spain, from 2013 to 2017, modeling hospitalization as a first event and death as a semi-competing terminal event. Multiple models were evaluated, including Cox proportional hazards, SurvivalBoost, DeepPseudo, SurvTRACE, Dynamic Deep-Hit, and Deep Recurrent Survival Machine. Results showed that DL models utilizing recurrent architectures outperformed both ML and linear approaches in concordance and time-dependent AUC, especially for hospitalization, which proved to be the harder event to predict.

Consequently, they lack an inherent incentive to compress history into compact latent states with consistent transition rules. This often leads to learning solutions that generalize poorly. We introduce Next-Latent Prediction (NextLat), which extends standard next-token training with self-supervised predictions in the latent space. Specifically, NextLat trains a transformer to learn latent representations that are predictive of its next latent state given the next output token. Theoretically, we show that these latents provably converge to belief states, compressed information of the history necessary to predict the future. This simple auxiliary objective also injects a recurrent inductive bias into transformers, while leaving their architecture, parallel training, and inference unchanged.

In this work, we introduce PADiff, a diffusion-based approach that captures agent's multimodal behaviors, unlocking its diverse cooperation modes with teammates. However, standard diffusion models lack the ability to predict and adapt in highly non-stationary AHT scenarios.

Because cognition is fixed after pre-training, improving in-context learning (ICL) for AD detection hinges on enriching perception through better demonstration (demo) sets. We demonstrate that standard ICL quickly saturates, its demos lack diversity (context width) and fail to convey fine-grained signals (context depth), and that recent task vector (TV) approaches improve broad task adaptation by injecting TV into the LLMs' hidden states (HSs), they are ill-suited for AD detection due to the mismatch of injection granularity, strength and position.

Accurate localization of the AP is critical for planning and guiding catheter ablation procedures. While traditional diagnostic tree (DT) methods and more recent machine learning (ML) approaches have been proposed to predict AP location from surface electrocardiogram (ECG), they are often constrained by limited anatomical localization resolution, poor interpretability, and the use of small clinical datasets. In this study, we present a Deep Learning (DL) model for the localization of single manifest APs across 24 cardiac regions, trained on a large, physiologically realistic database of synthetic ECGs generated using a personalized virtual heart model. We also integrate eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, Guided Backpropagation, Grad-CAM, and Guided Grad-CAM, into the pipeline. This enables interpretation of DL decision-making and addresses one of the main barriers to clinical adoption: lack of transparency in ML predictions. Our model achieves localization accuracy above 95%, with a sensitivity of 94.32% and specificity of 99.78%.

However, direct fine-tuning on Han-character transcriptions often fails to capture detailed phonetic and tonal cues, while training only on romanization lacks lexical and syntactic coverage. In addition, prior studies have rarely explored staged strategies that integrate both annotation types. To address this gap, we present CLiFT-ASR, a cross-lingual fine-tuning framework that builds on Mandarin HuBERT models and progressively adapts them to Taiwanese Hokkien. The framework employs a two-stage process in which it first learns acoustic and tonal representations from phonetic Tai-lo annotations and then captures vocabulary and syntax from Han-character transcriptions. This progressive adaptation enables effective alignment between speech sounds and orthographic structures. Experiments on the TAT-MOE corpus demonstrate that CLiFT-ASR achieves a 24.88\\% relative reduction in character error rate (CER) compared with strong baselines. The results indicate that CLiFT-ASR provides an effective and parameter-efficient solution for Taiwanese Hokkien ASR and that it has potential to benefit other low-resource language scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "CLiFT-ASR\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982\u53f0\u6e7e\u95fd\u5357\u8bed\uff09\u7684\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5148\u5728\u62fc\u97f3\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0a\u5b66\u4e60\u58f0\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u518d\u5728\u6c49\u5b57\u8f6c\u5f55\u4e0a\u5b66\u4e60\u8bcd\u6c47\u8bed\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u5b57\u7b26\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u76f8\u5bf9\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8624.88%\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u76f4\u63a5\u5fae\u8c03\u6c49\u5b57\u8f6c\u5f55\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u548c\u58f0\u8c03\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u800c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u62fc\u97f3\u6807\u6ce8\u53c8\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bcd\u6c47\u548c\u53e5\u6cd5\u8986\u76d6\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5f88\u5c11\u63a2\u7d22\u6574\u5408\u4e24\u79cd\u6807\u6ce8\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u666e\u901a\u8bddHuBERT\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u5fae\u8c03\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4ece\u62fc\u97f3\u6807\u6ce8\u5b66\u4e60\u58f0\u5b66\u548c\u58f0\u8c03\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u4ece\u6c49\u5b57\u8f6c\u5f55\u6355\u6349\u8bcd\u6c47\u548c\u53e5\u6cd5\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u9002\u5e94\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8bed\u97f3\u548c\u6b63\u5b57\u7ed3\u6784\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728TAT-MOE\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCLiFT-ASR\u76f8\u6bd4\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8624.88%\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u5b57\u7b26\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "CLiFT-ASR\u4e3a\u53f0\u6e7e\u95fd\u5357\u8bed\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "relevance": 35.0}}

In few-shot settings, insufficient training samples often fail to cover the diverse patterns present in test samples. This challenge can be mitigated by extracting structural commonality from a small number of training samples. In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot unsupervised multimodal industrial anomaly detection method based on structural commonality, CIF (Commonality In Few). To extract intra-class structural information, we employ hypergraphs, which are capable of modeling higher-order correlations, to capture the structural commonality within training samples, and use a memory bank to store this intra-class structural prior. Firstly, we design a semantic-aware hypergraph construction module tailored for single-semantic industrial images, from which we extract common structures to guide the construction of the memory bank. Secondly, we use a training-free hypergraph message passing module to update the visual features of test samples, reducing the distribution gap between test features and features in the memory bank. We further propose a hyperedge-guided memory search module, which utilizes structural information to assist the memory search process and reduce the false positive rate. Experimental results on the MVTec 3D-AD dataset and the Eyecandies dataset show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in few-shot settings.

Resolving anomalies such as inference performance degradation or latency jitter in distributed system demands significant manual efforts from domain experts, resulting in extremely time-consuming diagnosis processes with relatively low accuracy. In this paper, we introduce Kunlun Anomaly Troubleshooter (KAT), the first anomaly troubleshooting framework tailored for LMDI. KAT addresses this problem through two core innovations. First, KAT exploits the synchronicity and consistency of GPU workers, innovatively leverages function trace data to precisely detect kernel-level anomalies and associated hardware components at nanosecond resolution. Second, KAT integrates these detection results into a domain-adapted LLM, delivering systematic causal reasoning and natural language interpretation of complex anomaly symptoms.

While prior work has focused on detection accuracy, it overlooks the importance of helping users understand the reasoning behind factual judgments and develop future resilience. The debate transcripts generated during MAD offer a rich but underutilized resource for transparent reasoning. In this study, we introduce ED2D, an evidence-based MAD framework that extends previous approach by incorporating factual evidence retrieval. More importantly, ED2D is designed not only as a detection framework but also as a persuasive multi-agent system aimed at correcting user beliefs and discouraging misinformation sharing. We compare the persuasive effects of ED2D-generated debunking transcripts with those authored by human experts. Results demonstrate that ED2D outperforms existing baselines across three misinformation detection benchmarks. When ED2D generates correct predictions, its debunking transcripts exhibit persuasive effects comparable to those of human experts; However, when ED2D misclassifies, its accompanying explanations may inadvertently reinforce users'misconceptions, even when presented alongside accurate human explanations. Our findings highlight both the promise and the potential risks of deploying MAD systems for misinformation intervention.

A new challenge comes when entities play roles according to their act or attributes in certain context. Entity Role Detection is the task of assigning such roles to the entities. Usu- ally real-world entities are of types: person, lo- cation and organization etc. Roles could be con- sidered as domain-dependent subtypes of these types. In the cases, where retrieving a subset of entities based on their roles is needed, poses the problem of defining the role and entities having those roles. This paper presents the study of study of solving Entity Role Detection prob- lem by modeling it as Named Entity Recogni- tion (NER) and Entity Retrieval/Ranking task. In NER, these roles could be considered as mutually exclusive classes and standard NER methods like sequence tagging could be used. For Entity Retrieval, Roles could be formulated as Query and entities as Collection on which the query needs to be executed. The aspect of Entity Retrieval task, which is different than document retrieval task is that the entities and roles against which they need to be retrieved are indirectly described.

Artificial intelligence may aid in pre-screening. Purpose: To evaluate the DINOv2-based Medical Slice Transformer (MST) for ruling out significant findings (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System [BI-RADS] >=4) in contrast-enhanced and non-contrast-enhanced abbreviated breast MRI. Materials and Methods: This institutional review board approved retrospective study included 1,847 single-breast MRI examinations (377 BI-RADS >=4) from an in-house dataset and 924 from an external validation dataset (Duke). Four abbreviated protocols were tested: T1-weighted early subtraction (T1sub), diffusion-weighted imaging with b=1500 s/mm2 (DWI1500), DWI1500+T2-weighted (T2w), and T1sub+T2w. Performance was assessed at 90%, 95%, and 97.5% sensitivity using five-fold cross-validation and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis. AUC differences were compared with the DeLong test. False negatives were characterized, and attention maps of true positives were rated in the external dataset. Results: A total of 1,448 female patients (mean age, 49 +/- 12 years) were included. T1sub+T2w achieved an AUC of 0.77 +/- 0.04; DWI1500+T2w, 0.74 +/- 0.04 (p=0.15). At 97.5% sensitivity, T1sub+T2w had the highest specificity (19% +/- 7%), followed by DWI1500+T2w (17% +/- 11%). Missed lesions had a mean diameter <10 mm at 95% and 97.5% thresholds for both T1sub and DWI1500, predominantly non-mass enhancements. External validation yielded an AUC of 0.77, with 88% of attention maps rated good or moderate. Conclusion: At 97.5% sensitivity, the MST framework correctly triaged cases without BI-RADS >=4, achieving 19% specificity for contrast-enhanced and 17% for non-contrast-enhanced MRI.

However, existing approaches rely on a mono-contextual paradigm that accumulates all information in a single, expanding context window, leading to context suffocation and noise contamination that limit their effectiveness on long-horizon tasks. We introduce IterResearch, a novel iterative deep-research paradigm that reformulates long-horizon research as a Markov Decision Process with strategic workspace reconstruction. By maintaining an evolving report as memory and periodically synthesizing insights, our approach preserves consistent reasoning capacity across arbitrary exploration depths. We further develop Efficiency-Aware Policy Optimization (EAPO), a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes efficient exploration through geometric reward discounting and enables stable distributed training via adaptive downsampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IterResearch achieves substantial improvements over existing open-source agents with average +14.5pp across six benchmarks and narrows the gap with frontier proprietary systems. Remarkably, our paradigm exhibits unprecedented interaction scaling, extending to 2048 interactions with dramatic performance gains (from 3.5\\% to 42.5\\%), and serves as an effective prompting strategy, improving frontier models by up to 19.2pp over ReAct on long-horizon tasks.

However, ensuring their professional competence and ethical safety is a critical challenge, as existing benchmarks fail to measure role-playing fidelity or address the unique teaching harms inherent in educational scenarios. To address this, we propose EduGuardBench, a dual-component benchmark. It assesses professional fidelity using a Role-playing Fidelity Score (RFS) while diagnosing harms specific to the teaching profession. It also probes safety vulnerabilities using persona-based adversarial prompts targeting both general harms and, particularly, academic misconduct, evaluated with metrics including Attack Success Rate (ASR) and a three-tier Refusal Quality assessment. Our extensive experiments on 14 leading models reveal a stark polarization in performance. While reasoning-oriented models generally show superior fidelity, incompetence remains the dominant failure mode across most models. The adversarial tests uncovered a counterintuitive scaling paradox, where mid-sized models can be the most vulnerable, challenging monotonic safety assumptions. Critically, we identified a powerful Educational Transformation Effect: the safest models excel at converting harmful requests into teachable moments by providing ideal Educational Refusals. This capacity is strongly negatively correlated with ASR, revealing a new dimension of advanced AI safety. EduGuardBench thus provides a reproducible framework that moves beyond siloed knowledge tests toward a holistic assessment of professional, ethical, and pedagogical alignment, uncovering complex dynamics essential for deploying trustworthy AI in education.

However, current automated methods often rely on resource-heavy Large Language Models (LLMs) or static knowledge graphs and struggle with two fundamental challenges in real-world clinical data: (1) missing modalities, such as incomplete clinical context , and (2) feature entanglement, where mixed modality-specific and shared information leads to suboptimal fusion and clinically unfaithful hallucinated findings. To address these challenges, we propose the DiA-gnostic VLVAE, which achieves robust radiology reporting through Disentangled Alignment. Our framework is designed to be resilient to missing modalities by disentangling shared and modality-specific features using a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) based Vision-Language Variational Autoencoder (VLVAE). A constrained optimization objective enforces orthogonality and alignment between these latent representations to prevent suboptimal fusion. A compact LLaMA-X decoder then uses these disentangled representations to generate reports efficiently. On the IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR datasets, DiA has achieved competetive BLEU@4 scores of 0.266 and 0.134, respectively.

However, their limited gate count, large feature sizes, and high static power consumption make on-body machine learning classification highly challenging. While existing bendable RISC-V systems provide compact solutions, they lack the energy efficiency required. We present a mechanically flexible RISC-V that integrates a bespoke multiply-accumulate co-processor with fixed coefficients to maximize energy efficiency and minimize latency. Our approach formulates a constrained programming problem to jointly determine co-processor constants and optimally map Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) inference operations, enabling compact, model-specific hardware by leveraging the low fabrication and non-recurring engineering costs of flexible technologies. Post-layout results demonstrate near-real-time performance across several healthcare datasets, with our circuits operating within the power budget of existing flexible batteries and occupying only 2.42 mm^2, offering a promising path toward accessible, sustainable, and conformable healthcare wearables.

However, most existing synthetic personas remain shallow and simplistic, capturing minimal attributes and failing to reflect the rich complexity and diversity of real human identities. We introduce DEEPPERSONA, a scalable generative engine for synthesizing narrative-complete synthetic personas through a two-stage, taxonomy-guided method. First, we algorithmically construct the largest-ever human-attribute taxonomy, comprising over hundreds of hierarchically organized attributes, by mining thousands of real user-ChatGPT conversations. Second, we progressively sample attributes from this taxonomy, conditionally generating coherent and realistic personas that average hundreds of structured attributes and roughly 1 MB of narrative text, two orders of magnitude deeper than prior works. Intrinsic evaluations confirm significant improvements in attribute diversity (32 percent higher coverage) and profile uniqueness (44 percent greater) compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Extrinsically, our personas enhance GPT-4.1-mini's personalized question answering accuracy by 11.6 percent on average across ten metrics and substantially narrow (by 31.7 percent) the gap between simulated LLM citizens and authentic human responses in social surveys. Our generated national citizens reduced the performance gap on the Big Five personality test by 17 percent relative to LLM-simulated citizens.

However, most of these benchmarks evaluate models primarily through multiple-choice or short-answer formats, which do not take the reasoning process into account. Although some benchmarks assess the reasoning process, their methods are often overly simplistic and only examine reasoning when answers are incorrect. This approach overlooks scenarios where flawed reasoning leads to correct answers. In addition, these benchmarks do not consider the impact of intermodal relationships on reasoning. To address this issue, we propose the Reasoning Process Tree Score (RPTS), a tree structure-based metric to assess reasoning processes. Specifically, we organize the reasoning steps into a reasoning tree and leverage its hierarchical information to assign weighted faithfulness scores to each reasoning step. By dynamically adjusting these weights, RPTS not only evaluates the overall correctness of the reasoning, but also pinpoints where the model fails in the reasoning. To validate RPTS in real-world multimodal scenarios, we construct a new benchmark, RPTS-Eval, comprising 374 images and 390 reasoning instances. Each instance includes reliable visual-textual clues that serve as leaf nodes of the reasoning tree. Furthermore, we define three types of intermodal relationships to investigate how intermodal interactions influence the reasoning process. We evaluated representative LVLMs (e.g., GPT4o, Llava-Next), uncovering their limitations in multimodal reasoning and highlighting the differences between open-source and closed-source commercial LVLMs. We believe that this benchmark will contribute to the advancement of research in the field of multimodal reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRPTS\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u548cRPTS-Eval\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u7b54\u6848\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u80fd\u8003\u8651\u9519\u8bef\u63a8\u7406\u5bfc\u81f4\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4ee5\u53ca\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6811\u5f62\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807RPTS\uff0c\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u6811\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5c42\u6b21\u4fe1\u606f\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u5206\u914d\u52a0\u6743\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e09\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u7c7b\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728RPTS-Eval\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ee3\u8868\u6027LVLMs\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u5f00\u6e90\u4e0e\u95ed\u6e90\u5546\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "RPTS\u548cRPTS-Eval\u57fa\u51c6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "relevance": 75.0}}

This paper introduces Mixture of Shared KV Attention (MoSKA), an architecture that addresses this challenge by exploiting the heterogeneity of context data. It differentiates between per-request unique and massively reused shared sequences. The core of MoSKA is a novel Shared KV Attention mechanism that transforms the attention on shared data from a series of memory-bound GEMV operations into a single, compute-bound GEMM by batching concurrent requests. This is supported by an MoE-inspired sparse attention strategy that prunes the search space and a tailored Disaggregated Infrastructure that specializes hardware for unique and shared data. This comprehensive approach demonstrates a throughput increase of up to 538.7x over baselines in workloads with high context sharing, offering a clear architectural path toward scalable LLM inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "MoSKA\u901a\u8fc7\u533a\u5206\u8bf7\u6c42\u7279\u6709\u548c\u5171\u4eab\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5c06\u5171\u4eab\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ece\u5185\u5b58\u53d7\u9650\u7684GEMV\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u53d7\u9650\u7684GEMM\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347LLM\u63a8\u7406\u541e\u5410\u91cf", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u4e2dKV\u7f13\u5b58\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8GPU\u5229\u7528\u7387", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5171\u4eabKV\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u3001MoE\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u4e13\u95e8\u5316\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd", "result": "\u5728\u9ad8\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5171\u4eab\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e2d\uff0c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe538.7\u500d", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55LLM\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u8def\u5f84", "relevance": 85.0}}

To accelerate this transformation, two fundamental building blocks are essential: high-quality datasets that enable agents to achieve complex and human-relevant goals, and robust evaluation methods that allow researchers and practitioners to rapidly enhance agent performance. In this paper, we introduce DigiData, a large-scale, high-quality, diverse, multi-modal dataset designed for training mobile control agents. Unlike existing datasets, which derive goals from unstructured interactions, DigiData is meticulously constructed through comprehensive exploration of app features, resulting in greater diversity and higher goal complexity. Additionally, we present DigiData-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating mobile control agents on real-world complex tasks. We demonstrate that the commonly used step-accuracy metric falls short in reliably assessing mobile control agents and, to address this, we propose dynamic evaluation protocols and AI-powered evaluations as rigorous alternatives for agent assessment.

Previous approaches have demonstrated exceptional performance in detecting texts fully generated by LLMs. However, these methods struggle when confronting more advanced LLM output or text with adversarial multi-task machine revision, especially in the black-box setting, where the generating model is unknown. To address this challenge, grounded in the hypothesis that human writing possesses distinctive stylistic patterns, we propose Human Language Preference Detection (HLPD). HLPD employs a reward-based alignment process, Human Language Preference Optimization (HLPO), to shift the scoring model's token distribution toward human-like writing, making the model more sensitive to human writing, therefore enhancing the identification of machine-revised text. We test HLPD in an adversarial multi-task evaluation framework that leverages a five-dimensional prompt generator and multiple advanced LLMs to create diverse revision scenarios. When detecting texts revised by GPT-series models, HLPD achieves a 15.11% relative improvement in AUROC over ImBD, surpassing Fast-DetectGPT by 45.56%. When evaluated on texts generated by advanced LLMs, HLPD achieves the highest average AUROC, exceeding ImBD by 5.53% and Fast-DetectGPT by 34.14%.

Even though deep learning models have demonstrated potential, standard convolutional architectures frequently fall short in capturing enough global context, resulting in segmentations that are anatomically inconsistent. To overcome these drawbacks, we suggest a flexible, conditional Denoising Diffusion Model that combines an enhanced UNet-based generative decoder with a Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder for global feature extraction. We introduce three primary innovations: 1) an Adaptive Conditioning Bridge (ACB) for efficient, multi-scale fusion of semantic features; 2) a novel Topological Denoising Consistency (TDC) loss component that regularizes training by penalizing structural inconsistencies during denoising; and 3) a dual-head architecture that leverages the denoising objective as a powerful regularizer, enabling a lightweight auxiliary head to perform rapid and accurate inference on smaller datasets and a noise prediction head. Our framework establishes a new state-of-the-art on public breast ultrasound datasets, achieving Dice scores of 0.96 on BUSI, 0.90 on BrEaST and 0.97 on BUS-UCLM.

While existing KV compression methods primarily focus on reducing prefill memory from long input sequences, they fall short in addressing the dynamic and layer-sensitive nature of long-form generation, which is central to reasoning tasks. We propose Lethe, a dynamic KV cache management framework that introduces adaptivity along both the spatial and temporal dimensions of decoding. Along the spatial dimension, Lethe performs layerwise sparsity-aware allocation, assigning token pruning budgets to each transformer layer based on estimated attention redundancy. Along the temporal dimension, Lethe conducts multi-round token pruning during generation, driven by a Recency-Aware Selective Retention} (RASR) mechanism. RASR extends traditional recency-based heuristics by also considering token relevance derived from evolving attention patterns, enabling informed decisions about which tokens to retain or evict. Empirical results demonstrate that Lethe achieves a favorable balance between efficiency and generation quality across diverse models and tasks, increases throughput by up to 2.56x.", "AI": {"tldr": "Lethe\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u52a8\u6001KV\u7f13\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u5c42\u7ea7\u7a00\u758f\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u914d\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u591a\u8f6etoken\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709KV\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u51cf\u5c11\u957f\u8f93\u5165\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u9884\u586b\u5145\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u957f\u683c\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u5c42\u7ea7\u654f\u611f\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "Lethe\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u5c42\u7ea7\u7a00\u758f\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5197\u4f59\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2atransformer\u5c42\u5206\u914dtoken\u526a\u679d\u9884\u7b97\uff1b\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u8fd1\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4fdd\u7559(RASR)\u673a\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u8f6etoken\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4f20\u7edf\u6700\u8fd1\u6027\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u548c\u4ece\u6f14\u5316\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e2d\u63a8\u5bfc\u7684token\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "result": "Lethe\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u53472.56\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "Lethe\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94KV\u7f13\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

Most existing studies for inference-time defences focus on surface-level token matching and rely on external blocklists or filters, which add deployment complexity and may overlook semantically paraphrased leakage. In this work, we reframe copyright infringement mitigation as intrinsic semantic-space control and introduce SCOPE, an inference-time method that requires no parameter updates or auxiliary filters. Specifically, the sparse autoencoder (SAE) projects hidden states into a high-dimensional, near-monosemantic space; benefiting from this representation, we identify a copyright-sensitive subspace and clamp its activations during decoding. Experiments on widely recognized benchmarks show that SCOPE mitigates copyright infringement without degrading general utility.

However, compared to rigid objects, pose tracking for articulated objects remains an underexplored problem due to their inherent kinematic constraints. To address these challenges, this work proposes a novel point-pair-based pose tracking framework, termed \\textbf{PPF-Tracker}. The proposed framework first performs quasi-canonicalization of point clouds in the SE(3) Lie group space, and then models articulated objects using Point Pair Features (PPF) to predict pose voting parameters by leveraging the invariance properties of SE(3). Finally, semantic information of joint axes is incorporated to impose unified kinematic constraints across all parts of the articulated object. PPF-Tracker is systematically evaluated on both synthetic datasets and real-world scenarios, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse and challenging environments.

Accepted ICDM 2025 (IEEE International Conference on Data Mining)", "summary": "Modern recommender systems face a critical challenge in complying with privacy regulations like the 'right to be forgotten': removing a user's data without disrupting recommendations for others. Traditional unlearning methods address this by partial model updates, but introduce propagation bias--where unlearning one user's data distorts recommendations for behaviorally similar users, degrading system accuracy. While retraining eliminates bias, it is computationally prohibitive for large-scale systems. To address this challenge, we propose CRAGRU, a novel framework leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for efficient, user-specific unlearning that mitigates bias while preserving recommendation quality. CRAGRU decouples unlearning into distinct retrieval and generation stages. In retrieval, we employ three tailored strategies designed to precisely isolate the target user's data influence, minimizing collateral impact on unrelated users and enhancing unlearning efficiency. Subsequently, the generation stage utilizes an LLM, augmented with user profiles integrated into prompts, to reconstruct accurate and personalized recommendations without needing to retrain the entire base model. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that CRAGRU effectively unlearns targeted user data, significantly mitigating unlearning bias by preventing adverse impacts on non-target users, while maintaining recommendation performance comparable to fully trained original models. Our work highlights the promise of RAG-based architectures for building robust and privacy-preserving recommender systems.

Code and interactive demo available", "summary": "Mechanistic interpretability aims to understand neural networks by identifying which learned features mediate specific behaviors. Attribution graphs reveal these feature pathways, but interpreting them requires extensive manual analysis -- a single prompt can take approximately 2 hours for an experienced circuit tracer. We present probe prompting, an automated pipeline that transforms attribution graphs into compact, interpretable subgraphs built from concept-aligned supernodes. Starting from a seed prompt and target logit, we select high-influence features, generate concept-targeted yet context-varying probes, and group features by cross-prompt activation signatures into Semantic, Relationship, and Say-X categories using transparent decision rules.\n  Across five prompts including classic \"capitals\" circuits, probe-prompted subgraphs preserve high explanatory coverage while compressing complexity (Completeness 0.83, mean across circuits; Replacement 0.54). Compared to geometric clustering baselines, concept-aligned groups exhibit higher behavioral coherence: 2.3x higher peak-token consistency (0.425 vs 0.183) and 5.8x higher activation-pattern similarity (0.762 vs 0.130), despite lower geometric compactness.

However, generating compositional scenes with multiple subjects and attributes remains a significant challenge. To enhance user control over subject placement, several layout-guided methods have been proposed. However, these methods face numerous challenges, particularly in compositional scenes. Unintended subjects often appear outside the layouts, generated images can be out-of-distribution and contain unnatural artifacts, or attributes bleed across subjects, leading to incorrect visual outputs. In this work, we propose MALeR, a method that addresses each of these challenges. Given a text prompt and corresponding layouts, our method prevents subjects from appearing outside the given layouts while being in-distribution. Additionally, we propose a masked, attribute-aware binding mechanism that prevents attribute leakage, enabling accurate rendering of subjects with multiple attributes, even in complex compositional scenes. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation demonstrates that our method achieves superior performance in compositional accuracy, generation consistency, and attribute binding compared to previous work. MALeR is particularly adept at generating images of scenes with multiple subjects and multiple attributes per subject.", "AI": {"tldr": "MALeR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u89e3\u51b3\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7ec4\u5408\u573a\u666f\u6311\u6218\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e03\u5c40\u5f15\u5bfc\u9632\u6b62\u4e3b\u4f53\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u6307\u5b9a\u533a\u57df\u5916\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u63a9\u7801\u5c5e\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7ed1\u5b9a\u673a\u5236\u9632\u6b62\u5c5e\u6027\u6cc4\u6f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5305\u542b\u591a\u4e2a\u4e3b\u4f53\u548c\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u573a\u666f\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e3b\u4f53\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u5e03\u5c40\u5916\u3001\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5e03\u5f02\u5e38\u3001\u5c5e\u6027\u8de8\u4e3b\u4f53\u6cc4\u6f0f\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMALeR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed9\u5b9a\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u5bf9\u5e94\u5e03\u5c40\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u4e3b\u4f53\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u6307\u5b9a\u5e03\u5c40\u5916\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u63a9\u7801\u5c5e\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7ed1\u5b9a\u673a\u5236\u9632\u6b62\u5c5e\u6027\u6cc4\u6f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u5c5e\u6027\u7ed1\u5b9a\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u64c5\u957f\u751f\u6210\u5305\u542b\u591a\u4e2a\u4e3b\u4f53\u4e14\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4e3b\u4f53\u6709\u591a\u4e2a\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "conclusion": "MALeR\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7ec4\u5408\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u751f\u6210\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\u7ed1\u5b9a\u3002", "relevance": 20.0}}

This paper presents IMDMR (Intelligent Multi-Dimensional Memory Retrieval), a novel system that addresses these limitations through a multi-dimensional search architecture.

Our system incorporates intelligent query processing with dynamic strategy selection, cross-memory entity resolution, and advanced memory integration techniques. Through comprehensive evaluation against five baseline systems including LangChain RAG, LlamaIndex, MemGPT, and spaCy + RAG, IMDMR achieves a 3.8x improvement in overall performance (0.792 vs 0.207 for the best baseline). We present both simulated (0.314) and production (0.792) implementations, demonstrating the importance of real technology integration while maintaining superiority over all baseline systems. Ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-dimensional search, with the full system outperforming individual dimension approaches by 23.3%. Query-type analysis reveals superior performance across all categories, particularly for preferences/interests (0.630) and goals/aspirations (0.630) queries.

To address these challenges, we introduce \\textbf{LMT}, a suite of \\textbf{L}arge-scale \\textbf{M}ultilingual \\textbf{T}ranslation models centered on both Chinese and English, covering 60 languages and 234 translation directions. During development, we identify a previously overlooked phenomenon of \\textbf{directional degeneration}, where symmetric multi-way fine-tuning data overemphasize reverse directions (X $\\to$ En/Zh), leading to excessive many-to-one mappings and degraded translation quality. We propose \\textbf{Strategic Downsampling}, a simple yet effective method to mitigate this degeneration. In addition, we design \\textbf{Parallel Multilingual Prompting (PMP)}, which leverages typologically related auxiliary languages to enhance cross-lingual transfer.

To examine this gap, we systematically analyze social biases in five open-source VLMs for an occupation prediction task, on the FairFace dataset.

The judge component classifies translations into three categories: correct, visually ambiguous (requiring image context), or mistranslated (poor translation quality). Identified errors are routed to specialized correctors: GPT-4o-mini regenerates captions requiring visual disambiguation, while IndicTrans2 retranslates cases with pure translation quality issues. This automated pipeline processes 28,928 training examples across four languages, correcting an average of 17.1% of captions per language.\n  We then apply Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the IndicTrans2 en-indic 200M distilled model on both original and corrected datasets. Training on corrected data yields consistent improvements, with BLEU score gains of +1.30 for English-Bengali on the evaluation set (42.00 -> 43.30) and +0.70 on the challenge set (44.90 -> 45.60), +0.60 for English-Odia on the evaluation set (41.00 -> 41.60), and +0.10 for English-Hindi on the challenge set (53.90 -> 54.00).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u82f1\u8bed\u5230\u5370\u5ea6\u8bed\u8a00\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u4fee\u6b63\u7ba1\u9053\u81ea\u52a8\u6e05\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528LoRA\u5fae\u8c03IndicTrans2\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86BLEU\u5206\u6570\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u9700\u8981\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6d88\u6b67\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u548c\u7eaf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "1. \u89c6\u89c9\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6cd5\u5b98-\u4fee\u6b63\u5668\u7ba1\u9053\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u7c7b\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e3a\u6b63\u786e\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u7cca\u6216\u8bef\u8bd1\uff0cGPT-4o-mini\u5904\u7406\u89c6\u89c9\u6d88\u6b67\uff0cIndicTrans2\u91cd\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\uff1b2. \u5bf9IndicTrans2\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528LoRA\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u539f\u59cb\u548c\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u81ea\u52a8\u5904\u7406\u4e8628,928\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u4fee\u6b63\u4e8617.1%\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\uff1b\u5728\u4fee\u6b63\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e26\u6765\u4e86BLEU\u5206\u6570\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\uff1a\u82f1\u8bed-\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8bed\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u96c6\u4e0a+1.30\uff0842.00\u219243.30\uff09\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u96c6\u4e0a+0.70\uff0844.90\u219245.60\uff09\uff1b\u82f1\u8bed-\u5965\u91cc\u4e9a\u8bed\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u96c6\u4e0a+0.60\uff0841.00\u219241.60\uff09\uff1b\u82f1\u8bed-\u5370\u5730\u8bed\u5728\u6311\u6218\u96c6\u4e0a+0.10\uff0853.90\u219254.00\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u6539\u8fdb\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u5c11\u7684\u5370\u5ea6\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0a\u3002", "relevance": 35.0}}

This study explores distributed deep learning for denoising chest X-ray images from the NIH Chest X-ray14 dataset, using additive Gaussian noise as a lightweight obfuscation technique. We implement and evaluate U-Net and U-Net++ architectures under single-GPU, standard multi-GPU (DataParallel), and optimized multi-GPU training configurations using PyTorch's DistributedDataParallel (DDP) and Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP). Our results show that U-Net++ consistently delivers superior denoising performance, achieving competitive Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structured Similarity Index Method (SSIM) scores, though with less performance in Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) compared to U-Net under low and moderate noise levels. This indicates U-Net++'s enhanced structural fidelity and low perceptual similarity. Meanwhile, our optimized training pipeline reduces training time by over 60% for both models compared to single-GPU training, and outperforms standard DataParallel by over 40%, with only a minor accuracy drop for both models (trading some accuracy for speed). These findings highlight the effectiveness of software-level optimization in distributed learning for medical imaging. This work demonstrates the practical viability of combining architectural design, lightweight obfuscation, and advanced distributed training strategies to accelerate and enhance medical image processing pipelines in real-world clinical and research environments.

It helps extract features from embedded vectors by adding global information and its expressivity has been proved to be powerful. Nevertheless, the quadratic complexity restricts its practicability. Although several researches have provided attention mechanism in sparse form, they are lack of theoretical analysis about the expressivity of their mechanism while reducing complexity. In this paper, we put forward Random Batch Attention (RBA), a linear self-attention mechanism, which has theoretical support of the ability to maintain its expressivity. Random Batch Attention has several significant strengths as follows: (1) Random Batch Attention has linear time complexity. Other than this, it can be implemented in parallel on a new dimension, which contributes to much memory saving. (2) Random Batch Attention mechanism can improve most of the existing models by replacing their attention mechanisms, even many previously improved attention mechanisms. (3) Random Batch Attention mechanism has theoretical explanation in convergence, as it comes from Random Batch Methods on computation mathematics. Experiments on large graphs have proved advantages mentioned above.

Our approach combines semantic graph-based retrieval and relevant data-restrictive training to simulate real-world discovery constraints.

We also propose a novel feedback loop approach, which iteratively identifies and corrects flawed parts of LLM-generated explanations, refining both the evidence paths and supporting context. We demonstrate the performance of our method with multiple large language models and evaluate the explanation and context retrieval quality through both expert-curated assessment and large-scale automated analysis.

However, research to date has largely been in non-clinical cross-sectional samples of written language using complex machine learning (ML) approaches with limited interpretability.\n  Methods: We describe an initial exploratory analysis of longitudinal speech data and PHQ-8 assessments from 5,836 recordings of 586 participants in the UK, Netherlands, and Spain, collected in the RADAR-MDD study. We sought to identify interpretable lexical features associated with MDD symptom severity with linear mixed-effects modelling. Interpretable features and high-dimensional vector embeddings were also used to test the prediction performance of four regressor ML models.\n  Results: In English data, MDD symptom severity was associated with 7 features including lexical diversity measures and absolutist language. In Dutch, associations were observed with words per sentence and positive word frequency; no associations were observed in recordings collected in Spain. The predictive power of lexical features and vector embeddings was near chance level across all languages.\n  Limitations: Smaller samples in non-English speech and methodological choices, such as the elicitation prompt, may have also limited the effect sizes observable. A lack of NLP tools in languages other than English restricted our feature choice.\n  Conclusion: To understand the value of lexical markers in clinical research and practice, further research is needed in larger samples across several languages using improved protocols, and ML models that account for within- and between-individual variations in language.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u82f1\u8bed\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u75c7\u72b6\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8bcd\u6c47\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u7edd\u5bf9\u4e3b\u4e49\u8bed\u8a00\u7b49\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4f46\u8bcd\u6c47\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u5411\u91cf\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u63a5\u8fd1\u968f\u673a\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "motivation": "\u5229\u7528\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u91c7\u96c6\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u6570\u636e\u6765\u5ba2\u89c2\u8bc4\u4f30\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u75c7\u72b6\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u548c\u65e9\u671f\u590d\u53d1\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u4f7f\u7528\u590d\u6742\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u6df7\u5408\u6548\u5e94\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u7eb5\u5411\u8bed\u97f3\u6570\u636e\u548cPHQ-8\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u75c7\u72b6\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u8bcd\u6c47\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u56db\u79cd\u56de\u5f52\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u82f1\u8bed\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b07\u4e2a\u4e0e\u75c7\u72b6\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8377\u5170\u8bed\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u53e5\u5b50\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u79ef\u6781\u8bcd\u9891\u7387\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u8bed\u4e2d\u672a\u53d1\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u5173\u8054\u3002\u6240\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u90fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u968f\u673a\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u5728\u5927\u6837\u672c\u3001\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u4f7f\u7528\u6539\u8fdb\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u4e2a\u4f53\u5185\u5916\u8bed\u8a00\u53d8\u5f02\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u8bcd\u6c47\u6807\u8bb0\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "relevance": 35.0}}

Conventional compression methods for obtaining compact models require computations for each individual student model. When multiple models of varying sizes are needed to accommodate different resource conditions, this leads to repetitive and cumbersome computations. To address this challenge, we propose a novel knowledge inheritance approach named OSKT (One-Shot Knowledge Transfer), which consolidates the knowledge of the teacher model into an intermediate carrier called a weight chain. When a downstream scenario demands a model that meets specific resource constraints, this weight chain can be expanded to the target model size without additional computation.

We close with a discussion of how weightless systems can be developed to augment centralized systems to achieve higher subjective accuracy through recommenders more directly tunable by end-users.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u4f7f\u7528\u65e0\u6743\u91cd\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc(WNNs)\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fde\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u66f4\u9002\u5e94\u5b9e\u65f6\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u578b\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u805a\u5408\u7528\u6237\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\u5b9e\u65f6\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u63a8\u8350\u7406\u7531\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3002\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u900f\u660e\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u65e0\u6743\u91cd\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc(WNNs)\u8bad\u7ec3\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7528\u6237\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4f5c\u4e3a\u72b6\u6001\u673a\u800c\u975e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6743\u91cd\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fde\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u52a0\u6743\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u534f\u540c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u5728MovieLens\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u65e0\u6743\u91cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65e0\u6743\u91cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u76f4\u63a5\u7531\u6700\u7ec8\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u8c03\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u4e3b\u89c2\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "relevance": 25.0}}

Our model demonstrates superior performance across all major embedding tasks -- including retrieval, classification and semantic textual similarity (STS) -- and excels in challenging multilingual scenarios, such as low-resource languages and cross-lingual setups. This state-of-the-art performance is driven by a novel data mix of 16.1 million query-document pairs, split between 7.7 million samples from public datasets and 8.4 million synthetically generated examples from various open-weight LLMs. One of our key contributions is a detailed ablation study analyzing core design choices, including a comparison of contrastive loss implementations, an evaluation of synthetic data generation (SDG) strategies, and the impact of model merging.

While classical methods rely on optical flow and learning-based models assume access to dense ground-truth, both struggle with occlusions, domain shifts, and ambiguous motion. This article introduces MiVID, a lightweight, self-supervised, diffusion-based framework for video interpolation. Our model eliminates the need for explicit motion estimation by combining a 3D U-Net backbone with transformer-style temporal attention, trained under a hybrid masking regime that simulates occlusions and motion uncertainty. The use of cosine-based progressive masking and adaptive loss scheduling allows our network to learn robust spatiotemporal representations without any high-frame-rate supervision. Our framework is evaluated on UCF101-7 and DAVIS-7 datasets. MiVID is trained entirely on CPU using the datasets and 9-frame video segments, making it a low-resource yet highly effective pipeline.

Our key idea is a novel technique to convert categorical values into floating-point representations. This approach preserves enough information to maintain clean-model accuracy compared to traditional methods like one-hot or ordinal encoding. By doing this, we create a gradient-based universal perturbation that applies to all features, including categorical ones.\n  We evaluate our method on five datasets and four popular models. Our results show up to a 100% attack success rate in both white-box and black-box settings (including real-world applications like Vertex AI), revealing a severe vulnerability for tabular data. Our method is shown to surpass the previous works like Tabdoor in terms of performance, while remaining stealthy against state-of-the-art defense mechanisms.

This work explores whether it is possible to predict Oscar nominations for screenplays using modern language models. Since no suitable dataset was available, a new one called Movie-O-Label was created by combining the MovieSum collection of movie scripts with curated Oscar records. Each screenplay was represented by its title, Wikipedia summary, and full script. Long scripts were split into overlapping text chunks and encoded with the E5 sentence em bedding model. Then, the screenplay embed dings were classified using a logistic regression model.

Using the DAIC-WOZ dataset of clinical interviews, we fine-tuned models for anxiety, depression, and stress classification and applied synthetic data generation to mitigate class imbalance. Results show that Distil-RoBERTa achieved the highest F1 score (0.883) for GAD-2, while XLNet outperformed others on PHQ tasks (F1 up to 0.891). For stress detection, a zero-shot synthetic approach (SD+Zero-Shot-Basic) reached an F1 of 0.884 and ROC AUC of 0.886. Findings demonstrate the effectiveness of transformer-based models and highlight the value of synthetic data in improving recall and generalization.

Over the past decade, dominant VPR methods (e.g., NetVLAD) have followed a paradigm that first extracts the patch features/tokens of the input image using a backbone, and then aggregates these patch features into a global descriptor via an aggregator. This backbone-plus-aggregator paradigm has achieved overwhelming dominance in the CNN era and remains widely used in transformer-based models. In this paper, however, we argue that a dedicated aggregator is not necessary in the transformer era, that is, we can obtain robust global descriptors only with the backbone. Specifically, we introduce some learnable aggregation tokens, which are prepended to the patch tokens before a particular transformer block. All these tokens will be jointly processed and interact globally via the intrinsic self-attention mechanism, implicitly aggregating useful information within the patch tokens to the aggregation tokens. Finally, we only take these aggregation tokens from the last output tokens and concatenate them as the global representation. Although implicit aggregation can provide robust global descriptors in an extremely simple manner, where and how to insert additional tokens, as well as the initialization of tokens, remains an open issue worthy of further exploration. To this end, we also propose the optimal token insertion strategy and token initialization method derived from empirical studies. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several VPR datasets with higher efficiency and ranks 1st on the MSLS challenge leaderboard.

We present an end-to-end system that scales long-sequence modeling to 10k-length histories in production. First, we introduce Stacked Target-to-History Cross Attention (STCA), which replaces history self-attention with stacked cross-attention from the target to the history, reducing complexity from quadratic to linear in sequence length and enabling efficient end-to-end training. Second, we propose Request Level Batching (RLB), a user-centric batching scheme that aggregates multiple targets for the same user/request to share the user-side encoding, substantially lowering sequence-related storage, communication, and compute without changing the learning objective. Third, we design a length-extrapolative training strategy -- train on shorter windows, infer on much longer ones -- so the model generalizes to 10k histories without additional training cost. Across offline and online experiments, we observe predictable, monotonic gains as we scale history length and model capacity, mirroring the scaling law behavior observed in large language models. Deployed at full traffic on Douyin, our system delivers significant improvements on key engagement metrics while meeting production latency, demonstrating a practical path to scaling end-to-end long-sequence recommendation to the 10k regime.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c06\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u6269\u5c55\u523010k\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u7528\u6237\u5386\u53f2\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7STCA\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u3001\u8bf7\u6c42\u7ea7\u6279\u5904\u7406\u548c\u957f\u5ea6\u5916\u63a8\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u6296\u97f3\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u77ed\u89c6\u9891\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6781\u957f\u7528\u6237\u5386\u53f2\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u6210\u672c\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u572810k\u957f\u5ea6\u5386\u53f2\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "1) STCA\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u7528\u76ee\u6807\u5230\u5386\u53f2\u7684\u5806\u53e0\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u66ff\u4ee3\u5386\u53f2\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4ece\u4e8c\u6b21\u964d\u4e3a\u7ebf\u6027\uff1b2) \u8bf7\u6c42\u7ea7\u6279\u5904\u7406\uff1a\u805a\u5408\u540c\u4e00\u7528\u6237\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u5171\u4eab\u7528\u6237\u7aef\u7f16\u7801\uff1b3) \u957f\u5ea6\u5916\u63a8\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1a\u5728\u8f83\u77ed\u7a97\u53e3\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u66f4\u957f\u7a97\u53e3\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u5386\u53f2\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u7684\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5355\u8c03\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u4e0e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u884c\u4e3a\u76f8\u4f3c\u3002\u5728\u6296\u97f3\u5168\u6d41\u91cf\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\uff0c\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u751f\u4ea7\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u5c06\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u6269\u5c55\u523010k\u7ea7\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u5b9e\u7528\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u5728\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "relevance": 65.0}}

However, the widespread use of benchmark scores to communicate about model capabilities has led to criticisms of validity, especially whether benchmarks test what they claim to test (i.e. construct validity) and whether benchmark evaluations are representative of how models are used in the wild (i.e. ecological validity). In this work we explore how to create an LLM benchmark that addresses these issues by taking a human-centered approach. We focus on designing a domain-oriented benchmark for journalism practitioners, drawing on insights from a workshop of 23 journalism professionals.

Existing methods address this problem through depth completion in the image domain, but they overlook the physical characteristics of raw depth images. It has been observed that the presence of invalid depth areas alters the frequency distribution pattern. In this work, we propose a Spatio-Spectral Mutual Learning framework (S2ML) to harmonize the advantages of both spatial and frequency domains for depth completion. Specifically, we consider the distinct properties of amplitude and phase spectra and devise a dedicated spectral fusion module. Meanwhile, the local and global correlations between spatial-domain and frequency-domain features are calculated in a unified embedding space. The gradual mutual representation and refinement encourage the network to fully explore complementary physical characteristics and priors for more accurate depth completion.

NeuroPOL incorporates Variable Spiking Neurons into a physics-informed operator architecture, replacing continuous activations with event-driven spiking dynamics. This innovation promotes sparse communication, significantly reduces computational load, and enables an energy-efficient surrogate model. The proposed framework lowers both computational and power demands, supporting real-time reliability assessment and deployment on edge devices and digital twins. By embedding governing physical laws into operator learning, NeuroPOL builds physics-consistent surrogates capable of accurate uncertainty propagation and efficient failure probability estimation, even for high-dimensional problems. We evaluate NeuroPOL on five canonical benchmarks, the Burgers equation, Nagumo equation, two-dimensional Poisson equation, two-dimensional Darcy equation, and incompressible Navier-Stokes equation with energy coupling. Results show that NeuroPOL achieves reliability measures comparable to standard physics-informed operators, while introducing significant communication sparsity, enabling scalable, distributed, and energy-efficient deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "NeuroPOL\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d7\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5de5\u7a0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002\u5b83\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u53d8\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u66ff\u4ee3\u8fde\u7eed\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u80fd\u8017\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5de5\u7a0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u8282\u80fd\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u53ef\u53d8\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u7b97\u5b50\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\uff0c\u7528\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8109\u51b2\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u66ff\u4ee3\u8fde\u7eed\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a00\u758f\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u8f7d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cNeuroPOL\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u7b97\u5b50\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u548c\u8282\u80fd\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "conclusion": "NeuroPOL\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u529f\u8017\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u5931\u6548\u6982\u7387\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "relevance": 20.0}}

Experiments were conducted on a Mac Studio equipped with an M2 Ultra processor and 192 GB of unified memory. Using the Qwen-2.5 model family across prompts ranging from a few hundred to 100,000 tokens, we measure time-to-first-token (TTFT), steady-state throughput, latency percentiles, long-context behavior (key-value and prompt caching), quantization support, streaming performance, batching and concurrency behavior, and deployment complexity.\n  Under our settings, MLX achieves the highest sustained generation throughput, while MLC-LLM delivers consistently lower TTFT for moderate prompt sizes and offers stronger out-of-the-box inference features. llama.cpp is highly efficient for lightweight single-stream use, Ollama emphasizes developer ergonomics but lags in throughput and TTFT, and PyTorch MPS remains limited by memory constraints on large models and long contexts.\n  All frameworks execute fully on-device with no telemetry, ensuring strong privacy guarantees. We release scripts, logs, and plots to reproduce all results. Our analysis clarifies the design trade-offs in Apple-centric LLM deployments and provides evidence-based recommendations for interactive and long-context processing.

Code will be released at https://www.github.com/kkkzh/StreamSTGS", "summary": "Streaming free-viewpoint video~(FVV) in real-time still faces significant challenges, particularly in training, rendering, and transmission efficiency. Harnessing superior performance of 3D Gaussian Splatting~(3DGS), recent 3DGS-based FVV methods have achieved notable breakthroughs in both training and rendering. However, the storage requirements of these methods can reach up to $10$MB per frame, making stream FVV in real-time impossible. To address this problem, we propose a novel FVV representation, dubbed StreamSTGS, designed for real-time streaming. StreamSTGS represents a dynamic scene using canonical 3D Gaussians, temporal features, and a deformation field. For high compression efficiency, we encode canonical Gaussian attributes as 2D images and temporal features as a video. This design not only enables real-time streaming, but also inherently supports adaptive bitrate control based on network condition without any extra training. Moreover, we propose a sliding window scheme to aggregate adjacent temporal features to learn local motions, and then introduce a transformer-guided auxiliary training module to learn global motions. On diverse FVV benchmarks, StreamSTGS demonstrates competitive performance on all metrics compared to state-of-the-art methods. Notably, StreamSTGS increases the PSNR by an average of $1$dB while reducing the average frame size to just $170$KB.

In this study, a lightweight dynamic brain connectivity framework based on Time Varying Directed Transfer Function is proposed, where TV DTF features were validated through ML based stress classification. TV DTF estimates the directional information flow between brain regions across distinct EEG frequency bands, thereby capturing temporal and causal influences that are often overlooked by static functional connectivity measures. EEG recordings from the 32 channel SAM 40 dataset were employed, focusing on mental arithmetic task trials. The dynamic EEG-based TV-DTF features were validated through ML classifiers such as Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Adaptive Boosting, and Extreme Gradient Boosting. Experimental results show that alpha-TV-DTF provided the strongest discriminative power, with SVM achieving 89.73% accuracy in 3-class classification and with XGBoost achieving 93.69% accuracy in 2 class classification. Relative to absolute power and phase locking based functional connectivity features, alpha TV DTF and beta TV DTF achieved higher performance across the ML models, highlighting the advantages of dynamic over static measures. Feature importance analysis further highlighted dominant long-range frontal parietal and frontal occipital informational influences, emphasizing the regulatory role of frontal regions under stress. These findings validate the lightweight TV-DTF as a robust framework, revealing spatiotemporal brain dynamics and directional influences across different stress levels.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u53d8\u5b9a\u5411\u4f20\u9012\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u52a8\u6001\u8111\u8fde\u63a5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u538b\u529b\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660ealpha-TV-DTF\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u538b\u529b\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0cSVM\u57283\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523089.73%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0cXGBoost\u57282\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523093.69%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9759\u6001\u529f\u80fd\u8fde\u63a5\u6d4b\u91cf\u5f80\u5f80\u5ffd\u7565\u8111\u533a\u95f4\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u8111\u533a\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u5411\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u538b\u529b\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u752832\u901a\u9053SAM 40\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684EEG\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u53d8\u5b9a\u5411\u4f20\u9012\u51fd\u6570\u63d0\u53d6\u52a8\u6001\u8111\u8fde\u63a5\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7SVM\u3001\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u6781\u7aef\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u7b49\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "alpha-TV-DTF\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6700\u5f3a\u7684\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u538b\u529b\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u7edd\u5bf9\u529f\u7387\u548c\u76f8\u4f4d\u9501\u5b9a\u7b49\u9759\u6001\u529f\u80fd\u8fde\u63a5\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u524d\u989d\u53f6-\u9876\u53f6\u548c\u524d\u989d\u53f6-\u6795\u53f6\u7684\u957f\u7a0b\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u5728\u538b\u529b\u8c03\u8282\u4e2d\u7684\u4e3b\u5bfc\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "TV-DTF\u6846\u67b6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4f46\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63ed\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u538b\u529b\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\u5927\u8111\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u5b9a\u5411\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u6d4b\u91cf\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "relevance": 15.0}}

Its success depends not only on the quality of the instruction data but also on the inherent capabilities of the LLM itself. Some studies suggest that even a small amount of high-quality data can achieve instruction fine-tuning results that are on par with, or even exceed, those from using a full-scale dataset. However, rather than focusing solely on calculating data quality scores to evaluate instruction data, there is a growing need to select high-quality data that maximally enhances the performance of instruction tuning for a given LLM. In this paper, we propose the Model Instruction Weakness Value (MIWV) as a novel metric to quantify the importance of instruction data in enhancing model's capabilities. The MIWV metric is derived from the discrepancies in the model's responses when using In-Context Learning (ICL), helping identify the most beneficial data for enhancing instruction tuning performance.

Differing from existing transformer-based offline text-to-video generation models, Neodragon is the first to have been specifically optimised for mobile hardware to achieve efficient and high-fidelity video synthesis. We achieve this through four key technical contributions: (1) Replacing the original large 4.762B T5xxl Text-Encoder with a much smaller 0.2B DT5 (DistilT5) with minimal quality loss, enabled through a novel Text-Encoder Distillation procedure. (2) Proposing an Asymmetric Decoder Distillation approach allowing us to replace the native codec-latent-VAE decoder with a more efficient one, without disturbing the generative latent-space of the generation pipeline. (3) Pruning of MMDiT blocks within the denoiser backbone based on their relative importance, with recovery of original performance through a two-stage distillation process. (4) Reducing the NFE (Neural Functional Evaluation) requirement of the denoiser by performing step distillation using DMD adapted for pyramidal flow-matching, thereby substantially accelerating video generation. When paired with an optimised SSD1B first-frame image generator and QuickSRNet for 2x super-resolution, our end-to-end Neodragon system becomes a highly parameter (4.945B full model), memory (3.5GB peak RAM usage), and runtime (6.7s E2E latency) efficient mobile-friendly model, while achieving a VBench total score of 81.61. By enabling low-cost, private, and on-device text-to-video synthesis, Neodragon democratizes AI-based video content creation, empowering creators to generate high-quality videos without reliance on cloud services.

Recent works have explored synthetic data generation to address this challenge, however, they suffer from data quality issues where synthesized tasks contain hallucinations that cannot be executed, and collected trajectories are noisy with redundant or misaligned actions. In this paper, we propose SynthAgent, a fully synthetic supervision framework that aims at improving synthetic data quality via dual refinement of both tasks and trajectories. Our approach begins by synthesizing diverse tasks through categorized exploration of web elements, ensuring efficient coverage of the target environment. During trajectory collection, we refine tasks when conflicts with actual observations are detected, mitigating hallucinations while maintaining task consistency. After collection, we conduct trajectory refinement with a global context to mitigate potential noise or misalignments. Finally, we fine-tune open-source web agents on the refined synthetic data to adapt them to the target environment. Experimental results demonstrate that SynthAgent outperforms existing synthetic data methods, validating the importance of high-quality synthetic supervision.

While significant progress has been made for English and other high-resource languages, Bengali remains underexplored despite being the world's fourth most spoken language. The lack of large, standardized datasets classifies Bengali as a low-resource language for emotion detection. Existing studies mainly employ classical machine learning models with traditional feature engineering, yielding limited performance. In this paper, we introduce a new Bengali emotion dataset annotated across eight emotion categories and propose two models for automatic emotion detection: (i) a hybrid Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) model (EmoBangHybrid) and (ii) an AdaBoost-Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) ensemble model (EmoBangEnsemble).

While supervised learning has achieved significant progress in this area, it relies heavily on large-scale labeled datasets, which are difficult to obtain in practical scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a pseudo label-based unsupervised method called LoopExpose for arbitrary-length exposure correction. A nested loop optimization strategy is proposed to address the exposure correction problem, where the correction model and pseudo-supervised information are jointly optimized in a two-level framework. Specifically, the upper-level trains a correction model using pseudo-labels generated through multi-exposure fusion at the lower level. A feedback mechanism is introduced where corrected images are fed back into the fusion process to refine the pseudo-labels, creating a self-reinforcing learning loop. Considering the dominant role of luminance calibration in exposure correction, a Luminance Ranking Loss is introduced to leverage the relative luminance ordering across the input sequence as a self-supervised constraint. Extensive experiments on different benchmark datasets demonstrate that LoopExpose achieves superior exposure correction and fusion performance, outperforming existing state-of-the-art unsupervised methods.

Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has proven to be successful in sequential decision-making tasks, but our setting presents challenges for training and evaluating traditional offline RL methods: prohibition of online patient interaction, highly uncertain circulatory dynamics due to concurrent treatments, and limited data availability.

A popular solution is sub-model training, where the server only distributes randomly sampled sub-models to the edge clients, and clients only update these small models. However, those random sampling of sub-models may not give satisfying convergence performance. In this paper, observing the success of SGD with shuffling, we propose a distributed shuffled sub-model training, where the full model is partitioned into several sub-models in advance, and the server shuffles those sub-models, sends each of them to clients at each round, and by the end of local updating period, clients send back the updated sub-models, and server averages them. We establish the convergence rate of this algorithm. We also study the generalization of distributed sub-model training via stability analysis, and find that the sub-model training can improve the generalization via amplifying the stability of training process.

In this work, we introduce a novel hierarchical autoregressive framework for modeling protein dynamics that leverages the intrinsic multi-scale organization of molecular motions. Unlike existing methods that focus on generating static conformational ensembles or treat dynamic sampling as an independent process, our approach characterizes protein dynamics as a Markovian process. The framework employs a two-scale architecture: a low-resolution model captures slow, collective motions driving major conformational transitions, while a high-resolution model generates detailed local fluctuations conditioned on these large-scale movements. This hierarchical design ensures that the causal dependencies inherent in protein dynamics are preserved, enabling the generation of temporally coherent and physically realistic trajectories. By bridging high-level biophysical principles with state-of-the-art generative modeling, our approach provides an efficient framework for simulating protein dynamics that balances computational efficiency with physical accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5206\u5b50\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u5185\u5728\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u5c3a\u5ea6\u67b6\u6784\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u4e14\u7269\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9610\u660e\u5176\u529f\u80fd\u673a\u5236\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u751f\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u96c6\u5408\u8f68\u8ff9\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u9759\u6001\u6784\u8c61\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u5c06\u52a8\u6001\u91c7\u6837\u89c6\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u5c3a\u5ea6\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u6355\u6349\u9a71\u52a8\u4e3b\u8981\u6784\u8c61\u8f6c\u53d8\u7684\u7f13\u6162\u96c6\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6ce2\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u4e14\u7269\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u9ad8\u5c42\u751f\u7269\u7269\u7406\u539f\u7406\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e73\u8861\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "relevance": 30.0}}

However, are they also more robust to adversarial inputs? We investigate this question using adversarially perturbed math questions. These perturbations include punctuation noise with three intensities (10, 30, and 50 percent), plus real-world and human-like typos (WikiTypo, R2ATA). Using a unified sampling-and-voting framework (Agent Forest), we evaluate six open-source models (Qwen3-4B/14B, Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, Gemma3-4B/12B) across four benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH, MMLU-Math, MultiArith), with various numbers of agents n from one to 25 (1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25). Our findings show that (1) Noise type matters: punctuation noise harm scales with its severity, and the human typos remain the dominant bottleneck, yielding the largest gaps to Clean accuracy and the highest ASR even with a large number of agents. And (2) Collaboration reliably improves accuracy as the number of agents, n, increases, with the largest gains from one to five agents and diminishing returns beyond 10 agents. However, the adversarial robustness gap persists regardless of the agent count.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591aLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u534f\u4f5c\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u867d\u7136\u534f\u4f5c\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4eba\u7c7b\u62fc\u5199\u9519\u8bef\u662f\u6700\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u591aLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u534f\u4f5c\u662f\u5426\u6bd4\u5355\u4e2aLLM\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u56de\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u6295\u7968\u6846\u67b6(Agent Forest)\uff0c\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5(GSM8K\u3001MATH\u3001MMLU-Math\u3001MultiArith)\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u516d\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee3\u7406\u6570\u91cf\u4ece1\u523025\u4e2a\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6270\u52a8(\u6807\u70b9\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u62fc\u5199\u9519\u8bef)\u3002", "result": "1) \u566a\u58f0\u7c7b\u578b\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff1a\u6807\u70b9\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u635f\u5bb3\u968f\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u62fc\u5199\u9519\u8bef\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u91cf\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u4e0e\u5e72\u51c0\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u548c\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4ecd\u7136\u6700\u9ad8\uff1b2) \u534f\u4f5c\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\u6301\u7eed\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u534f\u4f5c\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4eba\u7c7b\u62fc\u5199\u9519\u8bef\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

Conventional deblurring approaches are often inadequate in handling spatially varying blur and typically fall short in modeling the long-range dependencies necessary for restoring textual clarity. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a hybrid deep learning framework that combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with vision transformers (ViTs), thereby leveraging both local feature extraction and global contextual reasoning. The architecture employs a CNN-based encoder-decoder to preserve structural details, while a transformer module enhances global awareness through self-attention. Training is conducted on a curated dataset derived from TextOCR, where sharp scene-text samples are paired with synthetically blurred versions generated using realistic motion-blur kernels of multiple sizes and orientations. Model optimization is guided by a composite loss that incorporates mean absolute error (MAE), squared error (MSE), perceptual similarity, and structural similarity (SSIM). Quantitative evaluations show that the proposed method attains 32.20 dB in PSNR and 0.934 in SSIM, while remaining lightweight with 2.83 million parameters and an average inference time of 61 ms. These results highlight the effectiveness and computational efficiency of the CNN-ViT hybrid design, establishing its practicality for real-world motion-blurred scene-text restoration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408CNN\u548cVision Transformer\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6062\u590d\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u7cca\u573a\u666f\u6587\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u53bb\u6a21\u7cca\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u573a\u666f\u6587\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u7cca\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u3001\u6587\u6863\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u7b49\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u53bb\u6a21\u7cca\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u6a21\u7cca\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5efa\u6a21\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528CNN-ViT\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff1aCNN\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4fdd\u7559\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec6\u8282\uff0cTransformer\u6a21\u5757\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u589e\u5f3a\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u4f7f\u7528TextOCR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u79cd\u5c3a\u5bf8\u548c\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u7cca\u6838\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6a21\u7cca\u6837\u672c\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u5305\u542bMAE\u3001MSE\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u548cSSIM\u7684\u590d\u5408\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793aPSNR\u8fbe\u523032.20 dB\uff0cSSIM\u8fbe\u52300.934\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u542b283\u4e07\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3a61\u6beb\u79d2\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "CNN-ViT\u6df7\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u7cca\u573a\u666f\u6587\u672c\u6062\u590d\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002", "relevance": 45.0}}

Traditionally, relational data has been a source of various insights, but with the increase in computational power and the need to understand deeper relationships between entities, the need to design new techniques has arisen. For this graph data analysis has become an extraordinary tool for understanding the data, which reveals more realistic and flexible modelling of complex relationships. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great promise in various applications, such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, drug discovery, and more. However, many adversarial attacks can happen over the data, whether during training (poisoning attack) or during testing (evasion attack), which can adversely manipulate the desired outcome from the GNN model. Therefore, it is crucial to make the GNNs robust to such attacks. The existing robustness methods are computationally demanding and perform poorly when the intensity of attack increases. This paper presents a computationally efficient framework, namely, pLAPGNN, based on weighted p-Laplacian for making GNNs robust.

Building on this, the chapter demonstrates how failures rarely occur in isolation but propagate across layers, creating cascading effects with systemic consequences. To complement this diagnostic lens, we develop the concept of awareness mapping: a maturity-oriented framework that quantifies how well individuals and organizations recognize reliability risks across the AI stack. Awareness is treated not only as a diagnostic score but also as a strategic input for AI governance, guiding improvement and resilience planning.

However, explicit CoT methods rely on discrete token-level reasoning processes that are prone to error propagation and limited by vocabulary expressiveness, often resulting in rigid and inconsistent reasoning trajectories. Recent research has explored implicit or continuous reasoning in latent spaces, allowing models to perform internal reasoning before generating explicit output. Although such approaches alleviate some limitations of discrete CoT, they generally lack explicit mechanisms to enforce consistency among reasoning steps, leading to divergent reasoning paths and unstable outcomes. To address this issue, we propose EBM-CoT, an Energy-Based Chain-of-Thought Calibration framework that refines latent thought representations through an energy-based model (EBM). Our method dynamically adjusts latent reasoning trajectories toward lower-energy, high-consistency regions in the embedding space, improving both reasoning accuracy and consistency without modifying the base language model.

Across 5 NLP benchmarks, 27 datasets, and 3 model families, LoGo outperforms training-based baselines on some tasks upto a margin of 3.6% while remaining competitive on other tasks and maintaining inference throughput, highlighting its effectiveness and practicality.", "AI": {"tldr": "LoGo\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u522b\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u5408\u5e76LoRA\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u6570\u636e\u6216\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfLoRA\u9002\u914d\u5668\u901a\u5e38\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u4e00\u4efb\u52a1\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8f93\u5165\u65f6\u9002\u7528\u6027\u6709\u9650\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u6216\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u3002", "method": "LoGo\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u63d0\u53d6\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u9002\u914d\u5668\u5e76\u5b9e\u65f6\u786e\u5b9a\u5176\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u57285\u4e2aNLP\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u300127\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c3\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u4e0a\uff0cLoGo\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad8\u51fa3.6%\uff0c\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "LoGo\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u914d\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u5408\u5e76\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

However, current flow-based inverse solvers face two primary limitations: (i) they operate directly in pixel space, which demands heavy computational resources for training and restricts scalability to high-resolution images, and (ii) they employ guidance strategies with prior-agnostic posterior covariances, which can weaken alignment with the generative trajectory and degrade posterior coverage. In this paper, we propose LFlow (Latent Refinement via Flows), a training-free framework for solving linear inverse problems via pretrained latent flow priors. LFlow leverages the efficiency of flow matching to perform ODE sampling in latent space along an optimal path. This latent formulation further allows us to introduce a theoretically grounded posterior covariance, derived from the optimal vector field, enabling effective flow guidance.

The limited success of traditional deep learning in tabular knowledge transfer can be advanced by leveraging large language models (LLMs). However, the efficacy of LLMs often stagnates for mixed data types structured in tables due to the limitations of text prompts and in-context learning. We propose a lightweight transfer learning framework that fine-tunes an LLM using source tabular data and transplants the LLM's selective $key$ and $value$ projection weights into a gated feature tokenized transformer (gFTT) built for tabular data. The gFTT model with cross-domain attention is fine-tuned using target tabular data for transfer learning, eliminating the need for shared features, LLM prompt engineering, and large-scale pretrained models. Our experiments using ten pairs of source-target data sets and 12 baselines demonstrate the superiority of the proposed LLM-attention transplant for transfer learning (LATTLE) method over traditional ML models, state-of-the-art deep tabular architectures, and transfer learning models trained on thousands to billions of tabular samples.

However, processing high-resolution imagery in real time presents significant challenges due to the computational demands of feature extraction, matching, and bundle adjustment (BA). Conventional BA methods either downsample images, sacrificing important details, or require extensive processing time, making them unsuitable for time-critical missions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel real-time BA framework that operates directly on fullresolution UAV imagery without downsampling. Our lightweight, onboard-compatible approach divides each image into user-defined patches (e.g., NxN grids, default 150x150 pixels) and dynamically tracks them across frames using UAV GNSS/IMU data and a coarse, globally available digital surface model (DSM). This ensures spatial consistency for robust feature extraction and matching between patches. Overlapping relationships between images are determined in real time using UAV navigation system, enabling the rapid selection of relevant neighbouring images for localized BA. By limiting optimization to a sliding cluster of overlapping images, including those from adjacent flight strips, the method achieves real-time performance while preserving the accuracy of global BA. The proposed algorithm is designed for seamless integration into the DLR Modular Aerial Camera System (MACS), supporting largearea mapping in real time for disaster response, infrastructure monitoring, and coastal protection. Validation on MACS datasets with 50MP images demonstrates that the method maintains precise camera orientations and high-fidelity mapping across multiple strips, running full bundle adjustment in under 2 seconds without GPU acceleration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5168\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u675f\u8c03\u6574\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e3a\u5c0f\u5757\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5bfc\u822a\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\u5b9e\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u5bf9\u4e8e\u707e\u5bb3\u54cd\u5e94\u7b49\u7d27\u6025\u5e94\u7528\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u675f\u8c03\u6574\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u964d\u4f4e\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u635f\u5931\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u8fc7\u957f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u65f6\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6bcf\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e3a\u7528\u6237\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u8865\u4e01\uff08\u5982150x150\u50cf\u7d20\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u65e0\u4eba\u673aGNSS/IMU\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u8868\u9762\u6a21\u578b\u52a8\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8865\u4e01\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u65b9\u5f0f\u5bf9\u91cd\u53e0\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u5c40\u90e8\u675f\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "result": "\u572850MP\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u57282\u79d2\u5185\u5b8c\u6210\u5b8c\u6574\u675f\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u65e0\u9700GPU\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u5b9a\u5411\u548c\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6620\u5c04\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5168\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u675f\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u707e\u5bb3\u54cd\u5e94\u3001\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u76d1\u6d4b\u7b49\u65f6\u95f4\u5173\u952e\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "relevance": 10.0}}

Prior work has established that $O(d \\log n)$ samples are sufficient for this task. However, an important factor that is often overlooked in these analyses is the dependence on the condition number of the covariance matrix of the model. Indeed, all algorithms from prior work require a number of samples that grows polynomially with this condition number. In many cases this is unsatisfactory, since the condition number could grow polynomially with $n$, rendering these prior approaches impractical in high-dimensional settings. In this work, we provide an algorithm that recovers the underlying graph and prove that the number of samples required is independent of the condition number. Furthermore, we establish lower bounds that nearly match the upper bound up to a $d$-factor, thus providing an almost tight characterization of the true sample complexity of the problem. Moreover, under a further assumption that all the variances of the variables are bounded, we design a polynomial-time algorithm that recovers the underlying graph, at the cost of an additional polynomial dependence of the sample complexity on $d$. We complement our theoretical findings with simulations on synthetic datasets that confirm our predictions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u5411\u9ad8\u65af\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7b49\u65b9\u5dee\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0e\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\u6761\u4ef6\u6570\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5148\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u5411\u9ad8\u65af\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u65f6\uff0c\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0e\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\u6761\u4ef6\u6570\u5448\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5b9e\u7528\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6761\u4ef6\u6570\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u6062\u590d\u5e95\u5c42\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u7b49\u65b9\u5dee\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u65b9\u5dee\u6709\u754c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6062\u590d\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6240\u9700\u6837\u672c\u6570\u4e0e\u6761\u4ef6\u6570\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e0e\u4e0a\u754c\u51e0\u4e4e\u5339\u914d\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u95ee\u9898\u771f\u5b9e\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u51e0\u4e4e\u7d27\u81f4\u523b\u753b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\uff0c\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "relevance": 20.0}}

A lightweight transfer learning calibration using just 20% of field measurements reduces the median error to approximately 10%, significantly outperforming traditional simulators, which exceed 50% error.

While the overall intensity and categorical values of emotions in arguments have received considerable attention in the research community, we argue that the emotion an argument evokes in a recipient is subjective. It depends on the recipient's goals, standards, prior knowledge, and stance. Appraisal theories lend themselves as a link between the subjective cognitive assessment of events and emotions. They have been used in event-centric emotion analysis, but their suitability for assessing argument convincingness remains unexplored. In this paper, we evaluate whether appraisal theories are suitable for emotion analysis in arguments by considering subjective cognitive evaluations of the importance and impact of an argument on its receiver. Based on the annotations in the recently published ContArgA corpus, we perform zero-shot prompting experiments to evaluate the importance of gold-annotated and predicted emotions and appraisals for the assessment of the subjective convincingness labels. We find that, while categorical emotion information does improve convincingness prediction, the improvement is more pronounced with appraisals. This work presents the first systematic comparison between emotion models for convincingness prediction, demonstrating the advantage of appraisals, providing insights for theoretical and practical applications in computational argumentation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u8bc4\u4ef7\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u8bba\u8bc1\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u76f8\u6bd4\u5206\u7c7b\u60c5\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8bc4\u4ef7\u7406\u8bba\u80fd\u66f4\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bba\u8bc1\u8bf4\u670d\u529b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bba\u8bc1\u7684\u8bf4\u670d\u529b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u5176\u7ed3\u6784(\u903b\u8f91)\u548c\u8bba\u8bc1\u8005(\u4fe1\u8a89)\uff0c\u8fd8\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u63a5\u6536\u8005\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u53cd\u5e94(\u60c5\u611f\u8bc9\u6c42)\u3002\u867d\u7136\u60c5\u611f\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u503c\u5df2\u5f97\u5230\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u8bba\u8bc1\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u662f\u4e3b\u89c2\u7684\uff0c\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u63a5\u6536\u8005\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u6807\u51c6\u3001\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u7acb\u573a\u3002\u8bc4\u4ef7\u7406\u8bba\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8fde\u63a5\u4e3b\u89c2\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u60c5\u611f\u7684\u6865\u6881\uff0c\u5728\u8bba\u8bc1\u8bf4\u670d\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eContArgA\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u9ec4\u91d1\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u53ca\u8bc4\u4ef7\u5bf9\u4e3b\u89c2\u8bf4\u670d\u529b\u6807\u7b7e\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u5206\u7c7b\u60c5\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\u786e\u5b9e\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u8bf4\u670d\u529b\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u8bc4\u4ef7\u7406\u8bba\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6539\u5584\u66f4\u4e3a\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u60c5\u611f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bf4\u670d\u529b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8bc4\u4ef7\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bba\u8bc1\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "relevance": 30.0}}

However, early filming equipment limitations have degraded videos of last-century performances by renowned artists (e.g., low frame rates and resolution), hindering archival efforts. Although space-time video super-resolution (STVSR) has advanced significantly, applying it directly to opera videos remains challenging. The scarcity of datasets impedes the recovery of high frequency details, and existing STVSR methods lack global modeling capabilities, compromising visual quality when handling opera's characteristic large motions. To address these challenges, we pioneer a large scale Chinese Opera Video Clip (COVC) dataset and propose the Mamba-based multiscale fusion network for space-time Opera Video Super-Resolution (MambaOVSR). Specifically, MambaOVSR involves three novel components: the Global Fusion Module (GFM) for motion modeling through a multiscale alternating scanning mechanism, and the Multiscale Synergistic Mamba Module (MSMM) for alignment across different sequence lengths. Additionally, our MambaVR block resolves feature artifacts and positional information loss during alignment. Experimental results on the COVC dataset show that MambaOVSR significantly outperforms the SOTA STVSR method by an average of 1.86 dB in terms of PSNR.

Existing methods proposed to handle noisy clients assume that a sufficient number of clients with clean labels are available, which can be leveraged to learn a robust global model while dampening the impact of noisy clients. This assumption fails when a high number of heterogeneous clients contain noisy labels, making the existing approaches ineffective. In such scenarios, it is important to locally regularize the clients before communication with the global model, to ensure the global model isn't corrupted by noisy clients. While pre-trained self-supervised models can be effective for local regularization, existing centralized approaches relying on pretrained initialization are impractical in a federated setting due to the potentially large size of these models, which increases communication costs. In that line, we propose a regularization objective for client models that decouples the pre-trained and classification models by enforcing similarity between close data points within the client. We leverage the representation space of a self-supervised pretrained model to evaluate the closeness among examples. This regularization, when applied with the standard objective function for the downstream task in standard noisy federated settings, significantly improves performance, outperforming existing state-of-the-art federated methods in multiple computer vision and medical image classification benchmarks. Unlike other techniques that rely on self-supervised pretrained initialization, our method does not require the pretrained model and classifier backbone to share the same architecture, making it architecture-agnostic.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5904\u7406\u566a\u58f0\u6807\u7b7e\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u672c\u5730\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u6709\u8db3\u591f\u591a\u5e72\u51c0\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u53ef\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9ad8\u6bd4\u4f8b\u5f02\u6784\u566a\u58f0\u6807\u7b7e\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5931\u6548\u3002\u9700\u8981\u672c\u5730\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6765\u9632\u6b62\u566a\u58f0\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6c61\u67d3\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5236\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5185\u76f8\u8fd1\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6765\u89e3\u8026\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u8ddd\u79bb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u566a\u58f0\u8054\u90a6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u5171\u4eab\u76f8\u540c\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u67b6\u6784\u65e0\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9ad8\u6bd4\u4f8b\u566a\u58f0\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "relevance": 30.0}}

Historically, research in this field has been dominated by point forecasting methods, which provide single-value predictions but fail to quantify uncertainty. However, as power markets evolve due to renewable integration, smart grids, and regulatory changes, the need for probabilistic forecasting has become more pronounced, offering a more comprehensive approach to risk assessment and market participation. This paper presents a review of probabilistic forecasting methods, tracing their evolution from Bayesian and distribution based approaches, through quantile regression techniques, to recent developments in conformal prediction. Particular emphasis is placed on advancements in probabilistic forecasting, including validity-focused methods which address key limitations in uncertainty estimation. Additionally, this review extends beyond the Day-Ahead Market to include the Intra-Day and Balancing Markets, where forecasting challenges are intensified by higher temporal granularity and real-time operational constraints. We examine state of the art methodologies, key evaluation metrics, and ongoing challenges, such as forecast validity, model selection, and the absence of standardised benchmarks, providing researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive and timely resource for navigating the complexities of modern electricity markets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u7535\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u4ef7\u683c\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u5386\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ece\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5230\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u56de\u5f52\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u518d\u5230\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u4fdd\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u4ece\u65e5\u524d\u5e02\u573a\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u65e5\u5185\u53ca\u5e73\u8861\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u6e17\u900f\u589e\u52a0\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u7535\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u4ef7\u683c\u9884\u6d4b\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u70b9\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u7535\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u9700\u8981\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u6765\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u53c2\u4e0e\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6f14\u8fdb\uff1a\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u56de\u5f52\u6280\u672f\u3001\u4fdd\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u5173\u952e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u6311\u6218\u7684\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u9884\u6d4b\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u7f3a\u5931\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u548c\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5e94\u5bf9\u73b0\u4ee3\u7535\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u5168\u9762\u53ca\u65f6\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u65f6\u4ee3\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "relevance": 10.0}}

Accurate and timely inference of supply chain resilience the capability to maintain core functions during disruptions is crucial for proactive risk mitigation and robust network design. However, existing approaches lack effective mechanisms to infer supply chain resilience without explicit system dynamics and struggle to represent the higher-order, multi-entity dependencies inherent in supply chain networks. These limitations motivate the definition of a novel problem and the development of targeted modeling solutions. To address these challenges, we formalize a novel problem: Supply Chain Resilience Inference (SCRI), defined as predicting supply chain resilience using hypergraph topology and observed inventory trajectories without explicit dynamic equations. To solve this problem, we propose the Supply Chain Resilience Inference Hypergraph Network (SC-RIHN), a novel hypergraph-based model leveraging set-based encoding and hypergraph message passing to capture multi-party firm-product interactions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SC-RIHN significantly outperforms traditional MLP, representative graph neural network variants, and ResInf baselines across synthetic benchmarks, underscoring its potential for practical, early-warning risk assessment in complex supply chain systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u97e7\u6027\u63a8\u65ad\u95ee\u9898(SCRI)\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86SC-RIHN\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8d85\u56fe\u62d3\u6251\u548c\u5e93\u5b58\u8f68\u8ff9\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u97e7\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u52a8\u6001\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u663e\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63a8\u65ad\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u97e7\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u8868\u793a\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u9ad8\u9636\u591a\u5b9e\u4f53\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSC-RIHN\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u96c6\u5408\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u8d85\u56fe\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u6765\u6355\u6349\u591a\u65b9\u4f01\u4e1a-\u4ea7\u54c1\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "result": "\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSC-RIHN\u5728\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfMLP\u3001\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u53d8\u4f53\u548cResInf\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "SC-RIHN\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u8b66\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "relevance": 20.0}}

Early identification is essential to reduce irreversible vision loss, yet current diagnostic workflows rely on methods such as fundus photography and expert review, which remain costly and resource-intensive. This, combined with DR's asymptomatic nature, results in its underdiagnosis rate of approximately 25 percent. Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated strong performance in medical imaging tasks, limited interpretability and the absence of uncertainty quantification restrict clinical reliability. Therefore, in this study, a deep ensemble learning framework integrated with uncertainty estimation is introduced to improve robustness, transparency, and scalability in DR detection. The ensemble incorporates seven CNN architectures-ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, MobileNetV3 (Small and Large), and EfficientNet (B0, B2, B3)- whose outputs are fused through an accuracy-weighted majority voting strategy. A probability-weighted entropy metric quantifies prediction uncertainty, enabling low-confidence samples to be excluded or flagged for additional review. Training and validation on 35,000 EyePACS retinal fundus images produced an unfiltered accuracy of 93.70 percent (F1 = 0.9376). Uncertainty-filtering later was conducted to remove unconfident samples, resulting in maximum-accuracy of 99.44 percent (F1 = 0.9932). The framework shows that uncertainty-aware, accuracy-weighted ensembling improves reliability without hindering performance. With confidence-calibrated outputs and a tunable accuracy-coverage trade-off, it offers a generalizable paradigm for deploying trustworthy AI diagnostics in high-risk care.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u96c6\u6210\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u75c5\u53d8\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u900f\u660e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002\u4f7f\u75287\u79cdCNN\u67b6\u6784\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u5ea6\u52a0\u6743\u591a\u6570\u6295\u7968\u878d\u5408\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u6982\u7387\u52a0\u6743\u71b5\u5ea6\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u75c5\u53d8\u662f\u5168\u7403\u53ef\u9884\u9632\u6027\u5931\u660e\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u5bc6\u96c6\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u7ea625%\u7684\u6f0f\u8bca\u7387\u3002\u867d\u7136CNN\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6709\u9650\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u96c6\u62107\u79cdCNN\u67b6\u6784\uff08ResNet-50\u3001DenseNet-121\u3001MobileNetV3 Small/Large\u3001EfficientNet B0/B2/B3\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7cbe\u5ea6\u52a0\u6743\u591a\u6570\u6295\u7968\u7b56\u7565\u878d\u5408\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6982\u7387\u52a0\u6743\u71b5\u5ea6\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u6392\u9664\u6216\u6807\u8bb0\u4f4e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6837\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u572835,000\u5f20EyePACS\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u773c\u5e95\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u672a\u8fc7\u6ee4\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe93.70%\uff08F1=0.9376\uff09\u3002\u7ecf\u8fc7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6392\u9664\u4f4e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u6837\u672c\u540e\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe99.44%\uff08F1=0.9932\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u52a0\u6743\u96c6\u6210\u5728\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\u8f93\u51fa\u548c\u53ef\u8c03\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6-\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u533b\u7597\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u53ef\u4fe1AI\u8bca\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "relevance": 15.0}}

Here, we are given as input a design matrix $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d}$ and measurements or labels ${y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^N$ where ${y} = {X} {w}^* + \u03be$, and $\u03be$ is the noise in the measurements. Importantly, we have the additional constraint that the unknown signal vector ${w}^*$ is sparse: it has $k$ non-zero entries where $k$ is much smaller than the ambient dimension. Our goal is to output a prediction vector $\\widehat{w}$ that has small prediction error: $\\frac{1}{N}\\cdot \\|{X} {w}^* - {X} \\widehat{w}\\|^2_2$.\n  Information-theoretically, we know what is best possible in terms of measurements: under most natural noise distributions, we can get prediction error at most $\u03b5$ with roughly $N = O(k \\log d/\u03b5)$ samples. Computationally, this currently needs $d^{\u03a9(k)}$ run-time. Alternately, with $N = O(d)$, we can get polynomial-time. Thus, there is an exponential gap (in the dependence on $d$) between the two and we do not know if it is possible to get $d^{o(k)}$ run-time and $o(d)$ samples.\n  We give the first generic positive result for worst-case design matrices ${X}$: For any ${X}$, we show that if the support of ${w}^*$ is chosen at random, we can get prediction error $\u03b5$ with $N = \\text{poly}(k, \\log d, 1/\u03b5)$ samples and run-time $\\text{poly}(d,N)$. This run-time holds for any design matrix ${X}$ with condition number up to $2^{\\text{poly}(d)}$.\n  Previously, such results were known for worst-case ${w}^*$, but only for random design matrices from well-behaved families, matrices that have a very low condition number ($\\text{poly}(\\log d)$; e.g., as studied in compressed sensing), or those with special structural properties.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u9996\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u6b63\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u77e9\u9635X\uff0c\u5f53w*\u7684\u652f\u6491\u96c6\u968f\u673a\u9009\u62e9\u65f6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728poly(k, log d, 1/\u03b5)\u6837\u672c\u548cpoly(d,N)\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u03b5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7a00\u758f\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u662f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u5b58\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u6700\u4f18\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6307\u6570\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u9700\u8981\u6307\u6570\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u9700\u8981\u7ebf\u6027\u6837\u672c\u91cf\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u6b21\u7ebf\u6027\u6837\u672c\u548c\u6b21\u6307\u6570\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u77e9\u9635X\uff08\u6761\u4ef6\u6570\u6700\u591a\u4e3a2^poly(d)\uff09\uff0c\u5f53\u4fe1\u53f7w*\u7684\u652f\u6491\u96c6\u968f\u673a\u9009\u62e9\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5904\u7406\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u9996\u6b21\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728poly(k, log d, 1/\u03b5)\u6837\u672c\u548cpoly(d,N)\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u03b5\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ea\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u968f\u673a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u77e9\u9635\u6216\u7279\u6b8a\u7ed3\u6784\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u7edf\u8ba1\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u610f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u77e9\u9635\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "relevance": 15.0}}

This work presents a dual computational framework to quantitatively model these adaptations. The first component is a lightweight Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) that predicts g-load-dependent changes in key electroencephalographic (EEG) frequency bands, representing the brain's cortical state. The second component utilizes a suite of independent Gaussian Processes (GPs) to model the body's broader physiological state, including Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Electrodermal Activity (EDA), and motor behavior. Both models were trained on data derived from a comprehensive review of parabolic flight literature, using published findings as anchor points to construct robust, continuous functions. To complement this quantitative analysis, we simulated subjective human experience under different gravitational loads, ranging from microgravity (0g) and partial gravity (Moon 0.17g, Mars 0.38g) to hypergravity associated with spacecraft launch and re-entry (1.8g), using a large language model (Claude 3.5 Sonnet). The model was prompted with physiological parameters to generate introspective narratives of alertness and self-awareness, which closely aligned with the quantitative findings from both the EEG and physiological models.

In real-world scenarios, however, modalities may be missing due to privacy constraints, collection difficulties, or resource limitations. While previous approaches have addressed this challenge using prompt learning techniques, they fail to capture the cross-modal relationships necessary for effective multimodal visual recognition and suffer from inevitable computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce MoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that explicitly models cross-modal interactions while maintaining modality-specific adaptations. MoRA introduces modality-common parameters between text and vision encoders, enabling bidirectional knowledge transfer. Additionally, combined with the modality-specific parameters, MoRA allows the backbone model to maintain inter-modality interaction and enable intra-modality flexibility. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that MoRA achieves an average performance improvement in missing-modality scenarios by 5.24% and uses only 25.90% of the inference time compared to the SOTA method while requiring only 0.11% of trainable parameters compared to full fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "MoRA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5b9a\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u5728\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u9690\u79c1\u3001\u6536\u96c6\u96be\u5ea6\u6216\u8d44\u6e90\u9650\u5236\u800c\u7f3a\u5931\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5173\u7cfb\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6a21\u6001\u5171\u4eab\u53c2\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u6587\u672c\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u95f4\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5b9a\u53c2\u6570\u4fdd\u6301\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u5185\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMoRA\u5728\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u53475.24%\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u4ec5\u4e3aSOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u768425.90%\uff0c\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u4ec5\u4e3a\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\u76840.11%\u3002", "conclusion": "MoRA\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "relevance": 65.0}}

This limits downstream tasks that rely on understanding event salience, influence, or narrative focus. We introduce Protagonist Entity Recognition (PER), a task that identifies the organizations that anchor a news story and shape its main developments. To validate PER, we compare he predictions of Large Language Models (LLMs) against annotations from four expert annotators over a gold corpus, establishing both inter-annotator consistency and human-LLM agreement. Leveraging these findings, we use state-of-the-art LLMs to automatically label large-scale news collections through NER-guided prompting, generating scalable, high-quality supervision. We then evaluate whether other LLMs, given reduced context and without explicit candidate guidance, can still infer the correct protagonists. Our results demonstrate that PER is a feasible and meaningful extension to narrative-centered information extraction, and that guided LLMs can approximate human judgments of narrative importance at scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e3b\u89d2\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b(PER)\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u65b0\u95fb\u6545\u4e8b\u4e2d\u951a\u5b9a\u548c\u5851\u9020\u4e3b\u8981\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5b9e\u4f53\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684NER\u4e0d\u540c\uff0cPER\u5173\u6ce8\u53d9\u4e8b\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u548cLLM\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528NER\u5f15\u5bfc\u63d0\u793a\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u65b0\u95fb\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8bc1\u660eLLM\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u65e0\u660e\u786e\u5019\u9009\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63a8\u65ad\u6b63\u786e\u4e3b\u89d2\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfNER\u5c06\u6240\u6709\u5b9e\u4f53\u63d0\u53ca\u540c\u7b49\u5bf9\u5f85\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u771f\u6b63\u9a71\u52a8\u53d9\u4e8b\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5b9e\u4f53\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8b\u4ef6\u663e\u8457\u6027\u3001\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u6216\u53d9\u4e8b\u7126\u70b9\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u9700\u8981\u8bc6\u522b\u65b0\u95fb\u6545\u4e8b\u4e2d\u951a\u5b9a\u548c\u5851\u9020\u4e3b\u8981\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u4e3b\u89d2\u5b9e\u4f53\u3002", "method": "1) \u6bd4\u8f83LLM\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u56db\u4f4d\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u4eba-LLM\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u5148\u8fdbLLM\u901a\u8fc7NER\u5f15\u5bfc\u63d0\u793a\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u65b0\u95fb\u96c6\u5408\uff1b3) \u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u4ed6LLM\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u65e0\u660e\u786e\u5019\u9009\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63a8\u65ad\u4e3b\u89d2\u5b9e\u4f53\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86PER\u662f\u53d9\u4e8b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684LLM\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u53d9\u4e8b\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u3002", "conclusion": "PER\u4efb\u52a1\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u6709\u610f\u4e49\uff0cLLM\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u65b0\u95fb\u53d9\u4e8b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e3b\u89d2\u5b9e\u4f53\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "relevance": 75.0}}

While existing methods rely on specialized architectures or resource-intensive training, the potential of leveraging modern Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) pretrained on image data remains under-explored for event-based vision. To address this, we propose Temporal-Guided VFM (TGVFM), a novel framework that integrates VFMs with our temporal context fusion block seamlessly to bridge this gap. Our temporal block introduces three key components: (1) Long-Range Temporal Attention to model global temporal dependencies, (2) Dual Spatiotemporal Attention for multi-scale frame correlation, and (3) Deep Feature Guidance Mechanism to fuse semantic-temporal features. By retraining event-to-video models on real-world data and leveraging transformer-based VFMs, TGVFM preserves spatiotemporal dynamics while harnessing pretrained representations. Experiments demonstrate SoTA performance across semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and object detection, with improvements of 16%, 21%, and 16% over existing methods, respectively. Overall, this work unlocks the cross-modality potential of image-based VFMs for event-based vision with temporal reasoning.

The fundamental challenge of the DODE problem in microscopic simulations stems from the complex temporal dynamics and inherent uncertainty of individual vehicle dynamics. This makes it highly challenging to precisely determine which vehicle traverses which link at any given moment, resulting in intricate and often ambiguous relationships between origin-destination (OD) matrices and their contributions to resultant link flows. This phenomenon constitutes the credit assignment problem, a central challenge addressed in this study. We formulate the DODE problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose a novel framework that applies model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Within our proposed framework, the agent learns an optimal policy to sequentially generate OD matrices, refining its strategy through direct interaction with the simulation environment. The proposed method is validated on the Nguyen-Dupuis network using SUMO, where its performance is evaluated against ground-truth link flows aggregated at 5-minute intervals over a 30-minute horizon. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves a 43.2% reduction in mean squared error (MSE) compared to the best-performing conventional baseline. By reframing DODE as a sequential decision-making problem, our approach addresses the credit assignment challenge through its learned policy, thereby overcoming the limitations of conventional methods and proposing a novel framework for calibration of microscopic traffic simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8d77\u8bab\u70b9\u77e9\u9635\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u4ea4\u901a\u4eff\u771f\u6821\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e0e\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u5b66\u4e60\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0a\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8643.2%\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fae\u89c2\u4ea4\u901a\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8d77\u8bab\u70b9\u77e9\u9635\u4f30\u8ba1\u9762\u4e34\u590d\u6742\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u548c\u8f66\u8f86\u52a8\u6001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d77\u8bab\u70b9\u77e9\u9635\u4e0e\u94fe\u8def\u6d41\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u96be\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\uff0c\u8fd9\u6784\u6210\u4e86\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u52a8\u6001\u8d77\u8bab\u70b9\u77e9\u9635\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u5b66\u4e60\u987a\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u8d77\u8bab\u70b9\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728Nguyen-Dupuis\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528SUMO\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u4f73\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8643.2%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u52a8\u6001\u8d77\u8bab\u70b9\u77e9\u9635\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u987a\u5e8f\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "relevance": 65.0}}

For subtasks 1A and 1B, we employed a soft-voting ensemble of transformer models (BanglaBERT, MuRIL, IndicBERTv2). For subtask 1C, we trained three multitask variants and aggregated their predictions through a weighted voting ensemble. Our systems achieved micro-f1 scores of 72.75% (1A) and 72.69% (1B), and a weighted micro-f1 score of 72.62% (1C). On the shared task leaderboard, these corresponded to 9th, 10th, and 7th positions, respectively.

While deep learning-based motion deblurring methods have achieved remarkable progress, existing approaches face fundamental challenges in capturing the long-range spatial dependencies inherent in motion blur patterns. Traditional convolutional methods rely on limited receptive fields and require extremely deep networks to model global spatial relationships. These limitations motivate the need for alternative approaches that incorporate physical priors to guide feature evolution during restoration. In this paper, we propose a progressive training framework that integrates physics-informed PDE dynamics into state-of-the-art restoration architectures. By leveraging advection-diffusion equations to model feature evolution, our approach naturally captures the directional flow characteristics of motion blur while enabling principled global spatial modeling. Our PDE-enhanced deblurring models achieve superior restoration quality with minimal overhead, adding only approximately 1\\% to inference GMACs while providing consistent improvements in perceptual quality across multiple state-of-the-art architectures. Comprehensive experiments on standard motion deblurring benchmarks demonstrate that our physics-informed approach improves PSNR and SSIM significantly across four diverse architectures, including FFTformer, NAFNet, Restormer, and Stripformer.

Results demonstrate that classical ensemble methods substantially outperform deep learning on small physiological datasets, with ExtraTrees achieving F1 = 0.826 on combined features and F1 = 0.623 on wrist-only features, compared to transformers achieving only F1 = 0.509-0.577. We deploy the wrist-only ExtraTrees model optimized via ONNX conversion, achieving a 4.08 MB footprint, 0.05 ms inference latency, and 152x speedup over the original implementation. Furthermore, ONNX optimization yields a 30.5% average storage reduction and 40.1x inference speedup, highlighting the feasibility of privacy-preserving on-device emotion recognition for real-world wearables.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u624b\u8155PPG\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u60c5\u7eea\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f20\u7edf\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u751f\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u548cTransformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7ONNX\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u60c5\u611f\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cfb\u7edf\u5927\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e91\u7aef\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u60c5\u7eea\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u5728WESAD\u538b\u529b\u68c0\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548cTransformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u624b\u8155\u5149\u7535\u5bb9\u79ef\u8109\u640f\u6ce2(PPG)\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c\u60c5\u7eea\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7ONNX\u8f6c\u6362\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "result": "ExtraTrees\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u4e0aF1=0.826\uff0c\u4ec5\u624b\u8155\u7279\u5f81F1=0.623\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eTransformer\u7684F1=0.509-0.577\u3002ONNX\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u6a21\u578b\u4ec54.08MB\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf0.05ms\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347152\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f20\u7edf\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u751f\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\uff0cONNX\u4f18\u5316\u4f7f\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u60c5\u7eea\u8bc6\u522b\u5728\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u4e2d\u53d8\u5f97\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u4e3a\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u60c5\u611f\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "relevance": 15.0}}

With the growing excitement around using AI agents to automate important scientific tasks, we explore whether current AI systems can perform multiple tasks necessary for data proofreading. We introduce ConnectomeBench, a multimodal benchmark evaluating large language model (LLM) capabilities in three critical proofreading tasks: segment type identification, split error correction, and merge error detection. Using expert annotated data from two large open-source datasets - a cubic millimeter of mouse visual cortex and the complete Drosophila brain - we evaluate proprietary multimodal LLMs including Claude 3.7/4 Sonnet, o4-mini, GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, as well as open source models like InternVL-3 and NVLM. Our results demonstrate that current models achieve surprisingly high performance in segment identification (52-82% balanced accuracy vs. 20-25% chance) and binary/multiple choice split error correction (75-85% accuracy vs. 50% chance) while generally struggling on merge error identification tasks. Overall, while the best models still lag behind expert performance, they demonstrate promising capabilities that could eventually enable them to augment and potentially replace human proofreading in connectomics.

Although discriminative models have achieved notable success in this domain, the full potential of generative models remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we introduce \\textbf{CoD$^2$}, a novel framework that combines the data distribution modeling capabilities of diffusion models with the semantic representation learning strengths of discriminative models to extract robust gait features. We propose a Multi-level Conditional Control strategy that incorporates both high-level identity-aware semantic conditions and low-level visual details. Specifically, the high-level condition, extracted by the discriminative extractor, guides the generation of identity-consistent gait sequences, whereas low-level visual details, such as appearance and motion, are preserved to enhance consistency. Furthermore, the generated sequences facilitate the discriminative extractor's learning, enabling it to capture more comprehensive high-level semantic features.

Our analysis establishes that ICL performance follows power-law relationships with model depth $L$, width $d$, context length $k$, and training data $D$, with exponents determined by task structure. We show that under specific conditions, transformers implement gradient-based metalearning in their forward pass, with an effective learning rate $\u03b7_{\\text{eff}} = \u0398(1/\\sqrt{Ld})$. We demonstrate sharp phase transitions at critical scales and derive optimal depth-width allocations favoring $L^* \\propto N^{2/3}$, $d^* \\propto N^{1/3}$ for the fixed parameter budget $N = Ld$.

Existing approaches either activate LLMs too frequently, causing excessive computational overhead, or use fixed schedules, failing to adapt to dynamic driving conditions. To address these challenges, we propose AdaDrive, an adaptively collaborative slow-fast framework that optimally determines when and how LLMs contribute to decision-making. (1) When to activate the LLM: AdaDrive employs a novel adaptive activation loss that dynamically determines LLM invocation based on a comparative learning mechanism, ensuring activation only in complex or critical scenarios. (2) How to integrate LLM assistance: Instead of rigid binary activation, AdaDrive introduces an adaptive fusion strategy that modulates a continuous, scaled LLM influence based on scene complexity and prediction confidence, ensuring seamless collaboration with conventional planners.

While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have become a standard for this, they face a fundamental dilemma in continual learning. Reusing a single set of PEFT parameters for new tasks often leads to catastrophic forgetting of prior knowledge. Conversely, allocating distinct parameters for each task prevents forgetting but results in a linear growth of the model's size and fails to facilitate knowledge transfer between related tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel adaptive PEFT method referred to as \\textit{Mixtures of SubExperts (MoSEs)}, a novel continual learning framework designed for minimal forgetting and efficient scalability. MoSEs integrate a sparse Mixture of SubExperts into the transformer layers, governed by a task-specific routing mechanism. This architecture allows the model to isolate and protect knowledge within dedicated SubExperts, thereby minimizing parameter interference and catastrophic forgetting. Crucially, the router can adaptively select and combine previously learned sparse parameters for new tasks, enabling effective knowledge transfer while ensuring that the model's capacity grows sublinearly. We evaluate MoSEs on the comprehensive TRACE benchmark datasets.

In this paper, we highlight a critical yet previously underexplored class of hallucinations driven by spurious correlations -- superficial but statistically prominent associations between features (e.g., surnames) and attributes (e.g., nationality) present in the training data. We demonstrate that these spurious correlations induce hallucinations that are confidently generated, immune to model scaling, evade current detection methods, and persist even after refusal fine-tuning. Through systematically controlled synthetic experiments and empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs (including GPT-5), we show that existing hallucination detection methods, such as confidence-based filtering and inner-state probing, fundamentally fail in the presence of spurious correlations.

We propose Targeted Manifold Manipulation-Nearest Neighbour (TMM-NN), which reconceptualises retrieval by assessing how readily each sample can be nudged into a designated region of the feature manifold; neighbourhoods are defined by a sample's responsiveness to a targeted perturbation rather than absolute geometric distance. TMM-NN implements this through a lightweight, query-specific trigger patch. The patch is added to the query image, and the network is weakly ``backdoored'' so that any input with the patch is steered toward a dummy class. Images similar to the query need only a slight shift and are classified as the dummy class with high probability, while dissimilar ones are less affected. By ranking candidates by this confidence, TMM-NN retrieves the most semantically related neighbours.

However, such models suffer from approximation errors introduced by efficiency techniques, which significantly degrade generation quality. Once deployed, these errors are difficult to correct, as modifying the model is typically infeasible in deployment environments. Through an analysis of error propagation across diffusion timesteps, we reveal that these approximation errors can accumulate exponentially, severely impairing output quality. Motivated by this insight, we propose Iterative Error Correction (IEC), a novel test-time method that mitigates inference-time errors by iteratively refining the model's output. IEC is theoretically proven to reduce error propagation from exponential to linear growth, without requiring any retraining or architectural changes. IEC can seamlessly integrate into the inference process of existing diffusion models, enabling a flexible trade-off between performance and efficiency.

While in-domain data is limited, there exist vast amounts of similar general-domain data, and our initial findings reveal that they could potentially serve as auxiliary supervision for domain enhancement. This observation leads us to our central research question: \\textbf{\\textit{how to effectively select the most valuable auxiliary data to maximize domain-specific performance}}, particularly when traditional methods are inapplicable due to a lack of large in-domain data pools or validation sets. To address this, we propose \\textbf{NTK-Selector}, a principled and efficient framework for selecting general-domain auxiliary data to enhance domain-specific performance via neural tangent kernels (NTK). Our method tackles two challenges of directly applying NTK to LLMs, theoretical assumptions and prohibitive computational cost, by empirically demonstrating a stable NTK-like behavior in LLMs during LoRA fine-tuning and proposing a Jacobian-free approximation method. Extensive experiments across four low-resource domains (medical, financial, legal, and psychological) demonstrate that NTK-Selector consistently improves downstream performance. Specifically, fine-tuning on 1,000 in-domain samples alone only yielded +0.8 points for Llama3-8B-Instruct and +0.9 points for Qwen3-8B. In contrast, enriching with 9,000 auxiliary samples selected by NTK-Selector led to substantial \\textbf{gains of +8.7 and +5.1 points}, which corresponds to a \\textbf{10.9x and 5.7x improvement} over the domain-only setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86NTK-Selector\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u6b63\u5207\u6838\u9009\u62e9\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u8f85\u52a9\u6570\u636e\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u9886\u57df\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u548c\u5fc3\u7406\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347LLM\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u65f6\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f85\u52a9\u76d1\u7763\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNTK-Selector\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eLLM\u5728LoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u65f6\u7684NTK\u7c7b\u7a33\u5b9a\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1Jacobian-free\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u9886\u57df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528NTK-Selector\u9009\u62e9\u76849000\u4e2a\u8f85\u52a9\u6837\u672c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4ec5\u4f7f\u75281000\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u6837\u672c\uff0cLlama3-8B-Instruct\u548cQwen3-8B\u5206\u522b\u83b7\u5f97+8.7\u548c+5.1\u5206\u7684\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u7528\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u9ad810.9\u500d\u548c5.7\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "NTK-Selector\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u9009\u62e9\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u8f85\u52a9\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347LLM\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

DDM was proposed to resolve content misalignment issues in unpaired domain translation, achieving translation identifiability. However, DDM has only been implemented using GANs due to its constraints on the translation function. GANs are often unstable to train and do not provide the transport trajectory information -- yet such trajectories are useful in applications such as single-cell evolution analysis and robot route planning. This work introduces diversified flow matching (DFM), an ODE-based framework for DDM. Adapting flow matching (FM) to enforce a unified translation function as in DDM is challenging, as FM learns the translation function's velocity rather than the translation function itself.

To address these challenges, we propose $C^3$, a data augmentation framework that enhances cross-modal retrieval performance by improving the completeness and consistency of LLM-generated descriptions. $C^3$ introduces a completeness evaluation module to assess semantic coverage using both visual cues and language-model outputs. Furthermore, to mitigate factual inconsistencies, we formulate a Markov Decision Process to supervise Chain-of-Thought reasoning, guiding consistency evaluation through adaptive query control.

To address these limitations, we propose GLMR, a Generative Language Model-based Retrieval framework that mitigates the cross-modal misalignment through a two-stage process. In the pre-retrieval stage, a contrastive learning-based model identifies top candidate molecules as contextual priors for the input mass spectrum. In the generative retrieval stage, these candidate molecules are integrated with the input mass spectrum to guide a generative model in producing refined molecular structures, which are then used to re-rank the candidates based on molecular similarity.

In our experiments, on mathematics, we observe that converting pretrained models to recurrent ones results in better performance at a given compute budget than simply post-training the original non-recurrent language model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u975e\u5faa\u73af\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5faa\u73af\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u5faa\u73af\u8bfe\u7a0b\u6765\u9010\u6b65\u589e\u52a0\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u6548\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5faa\u73af\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u8fdb\u5c55\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5faa\u73af\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u8026\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u4e0e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u975e\u5faa\u73af\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5faa\u73af\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5faa\u73af\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u9010\u6b65\u589e\u52a0\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6df1\u5ea6\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u975e\u5faa\u73af\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5faa\u73af\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u79cd\u8f6c\u6362\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5faa\u73af\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u539f\u59cb\u975e\u5faa\u73af\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5faa\u73af\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u975e\u5faa\u73af\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5faa\u73af\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

Mainstream text-to-video (T2V) models lack fine-grained lighting control due to text's inherent limitation in describing lighting details and insufficient pre-training on lighting-related prompts. Additionally, constructing high-quality relighting training data is challenging, as real-world controllable lighting data is scarce. To address these issues, we propose RelightMaster, a novel framework for accurate and controllable video relighting. First, we build RelightVideo, the first dataset with identical dynamic content under varying precise lighting conditions based on the Unreal Engine. Then, we introduce Multi-plane Light Image (MPLI), a novel visual prompt inspired by Multi-Plane Image (MPI). MPLI models lighting via K depth-aligned planes, representing 3D light source positions, intensities, and colors while supporting multi-source scenarios and generalizing to unseen light setups. Third, we design a Light Image Adapter that seamlessly injects MPLI into pre-trained Video Diffusion Transformers (DiT): it compresses MPLI via a pre-trained Video VAE and injects latent light features into DiT blocks, leveraging the base model's generative prior without catastrophic forgetting. Experiments show that RelightMaster generates physically plausible lighting and shadows and preserves original scene content.

For efficient deployment of these algorithms, although different techniques for the compression of neural network models are proposed, neural pruning is one of the fastest and effective methods, which can provide a high compression gain with minimal cost. To harness enhanced performance gain with respect to model complexity, we propose a novel neural network pruning approach utilizing Hessian-vector products that approximate crucial curvature information in the loss function, which significantly reduces the computation demands. By employing a power iteration method, our algorithm effectively identifies and preserves the essential information, ensuring a balanced trade-off between model accuracy and computational efficiency. Herein, we introduce CAMP-HiVe, a cyclic pair merging-based pruning with Hessian Vector approximation by iteratively consolidating weight pairs, combining significant and less significant weights, thus effectively streamlining the model while preserving its performance. This dynamic, adaptive framework allows for real-time adjustment of weight significance, ensuring that only the most critical parameters are retained. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves significant reductions in computational requirements while maintaining high performance across different neural network architectures, e.g., ResNet18, ResNet56, and MobileNetv2, on standard benchmark datasets, e.g., CIFAR10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, and it outperforms the existing state-of-the-art neural pruning methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eHessian-vector\u4e58\u79ef\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5CAMP-HiVe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5faa\u73af\u914d\u5bf9\u5408\u5e76\u548cHessian\u5411\u91cf\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u90e8\u7f72\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u6709\u6548\u4f46\u4ecd\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5e73\u8861\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Hessian-vector\u4e58\u79ef\u8fd1\u4f3c\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5e42\u8fed\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5faa\u73af\u914d\u5bf9\u5408\u5e76\u6743\u91cd\u6765\u7cbe\u7b80\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728ResNet18\u3001ResNet56\u3001MobileNetv2\u7b49\u67b6\u6784\u548cCIFAR10\u3001CIFAR-100\u3001ImageNet\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "CAMP-HiVe\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5404\u79cd\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "relevance": 35.0}}

However, these methods often lack spatial reasoning and struggle with occluded or invisible centerlines. Generative approaches, despite their potential, remain underexplored in this domain.

LaneDiffusion innovatively employs diffusion models to generate lane centerline priors at the Bird's Eye View (BEV) feature level, instead of directly predicting vectorized centerlines. Our method integrates a Lane Prior Injection Module (LPIM) and a Lane Prior Diffusion Module (LPDM) to effectively construct diffusion targets and manage the diffusion process. Furthermore, vectorized centerlines and topologies are then decoded from these prior-injected BEV features.

Furthermore, COTN incorporates an Autoencoder Self-Regressive (ASR) module to detect and isolate abnormal market patterns, such as sudden price spikes or crashes, thereby preventing corruption of the core prediction process and enhancing robustness. Extensive experiments across electricity spot markets and financial markets demonstrate the practical applicability and resilience of COTN. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning models like Informer by up to 17% and traditional statistical methods like GARCH by as much as 40%. These results underscore COTN's effectiveness in navigating real-world market uncertainty and complexity, offering a powerful tool for forecasting highly volatile systems under duress.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Chaotic Oscillatory Transformer Network (COTN)\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u548cLee Oscillator\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u6355\u6349\u91d1\u878d\u5e02\u573a\u548c\u7535\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u6df7\u6c8c\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u6ce2\u52a8\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u91d1\u878d\u5e02\u573a\u548c\u7535\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u5177\u6709\u5185\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u3001\u5feb\u901f\u6ce2\u52a8\u548c\u6df7\u6c8c\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u7279\u70b9\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u5bb9\u6613\u9971\u548c\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "COTN\u7ed3\u5408Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u65b0\u578bLee Oscillator\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Max-over-Time\u6c60\u5316\u548clambda\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210Autoencoder Self-Regressive\u6a21\u5757\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u9694\u79bb\u5f02\u5e38\u5e02\u573a\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7535\u529b\u73b0\u8d27\u5e02\u573a\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cCOTN\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578bInformer\u63d0\u534717%\uff0c\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5GARCH\u63d0\u534740%\u3002", "conclusion": "COTN\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6ce2\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u538b\u529b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "relevance": 65.0}}

We operationalize this concept as a binary classification task and provide reliable annotation guidelines.

We benchmark fine-tuned encoder models (CamemBERT) and instruction-tuned LLMs under various prompting strategies. Results show that fine-tuned encoders outperform prompted LLMs in F1 score by more than 10 percentage points, confirming the importance of supervised learning for emerging non-English social media tasks.

Concurrently, deep learning (DL) models have demonstrated promise in image-based ovarian lesion characterization. This study evaluates radiologist performance applying O-RADS v2022, compares it to leading convolutional neural network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) models, and investigates the diagnostic gains achieved by hybrid human-AI frameworks. Methods: In this single-center, retrospective cohort study, a total of 512 adnexal mass images from 227 patients (110 with at least one malignant cyst) were included. Sixteen DL models, including DenseNets, EfficientNets, ResNets, VGGs, Xception, and ViTs, were trained and validated. A hybrid model integrating radiologist O-RADS scores with DL-predicted probabilities was also built for each scheme. Results: Radiologist-only O-RADS assessment achieved an AUC of 0.683 and an overall accuracy of 68.0%. CNN models yielded AUCs of 0.620 to 0.908 and accuracies of 59.2% to 86.4%, while ViT16-384 reached the best performance, with an AUC of 0.941 and an accuracy of 87.4%. Hybrid human-AI frameworks further significantly enhanced the performance of CNN models; however, the improvement for ViT models was not statistically significant (P-value >0.05). Conclusions: DL models markedly outperform radiologist-only O-RADS v2022 assessment, and the integration of expert scores with AI yields the highest diagnostic accuracy and discrimination.

Existing bias mitigation techniques often impose a trade-off between fairness and accuracy, inadvertently degrading performance for certain demographic groups.

In this study, we propose a fairness-without-harm approach by learning distinct representations for different demographic groups and selectively applying demographic experts consisting of group-specific representations and personalized classifiers through a no-harm constrained selection.

High-performance graphical processing units (GPUs) provide the necessary compute and memory throughput to run large LLMs on imaging data. We review modern GPU architectures (e.g. NVIDIA A100/H100, AMD Instinct MI250X/MI300) and key performance metrics of floating-point throughput, memory bandwidth, VRAM capacity. We show how these hardware capabilities affect radiology tasks: for example, generating reports or detecting findings on CheXpert and MIMIC-CXR images is computationally intensive and benefits from GPU parallelism and tensor-core acceleration. Empirical studies indicate that using appropriate GPU resources can reduce inference time and improve throughput. We discuss practical challenges including privacy, deployment, cost, power and optimization strategies: mixed-precision, quantization, compression, and multi-GPU scaling.

Directly predicting reaction products from molecular images poses a non-trivial challenge, as it requires models to integrate both recognition and reasoning capacities. Our results demonstrate that with only 4B parameters, TinyChemVL achieves superior performance on both molecular and reaction tasks while demonstrating faster inference and training speeds compared to existing models.

Physics-Attention projects grid points into slices for slice attention, then maps them back through deslicing. However, we observe that Physics-Attention can be reformulated as a special case of linear attention, and that the slice attention may even hurt the model performance. Based on these observations, we argue that its effectiveness primarily arises from the slice and deslice operations rather than interactions between slices.

Code: https://github.com/wangbing1416/RETSIMD", "summary": "Multimodal Misinformation Detection (MMD) refers to the task of detecting social media posts involving misinformation, where the post often contains text and image modalities. However, by observing the MMD posts, we hold that the text modality may be much more informative than the image modality because the text generally describes the whole event/story of the current post but the image often presents partial scenes only. Our preliminary empirical results indicate that the image modality exactly contributes less to MMD. Upon this idea, we propose a new MMD method named RETSIMD. Specifically, we suppose that each text can be divided into several segments, and each text segment describes a partial scene that can be presented by an image. Accordingly, we split the text into a sequence of segments, and feed these segments into a pre-trained text-to-image generator to augment a sequence of images.

The growing availability of 3D geospatial data from multiple modalities has introduced new opportunities and challenges for integrating spatial knowledge at scale, particularly in high-impact domains such as urban planning and rapid disaster management. Geospatial entity resolution is the task of identifying matching spatial objects across different datasets, often collected independently under varying conditions. Existing approaches typically rely on spatial proximity, textual metadata, or external identifiers to determine correspondence. While useful, these signals are often unavailable, unreliable, or misaligned, especially in cross-source scenarios. To address these limitations, we shift the focus to the intrinsic geometry of 3D spatial objects and present 3dSAGER (3D Spatial-Aware Geospatial Entity Resolution), an end-to-end pipeline for geospatial entity resolution over 3D objects. 3dSAGER introduces a novel, spatial-reference-independent featurization mechanism that captures intricate geometric characteristics of matching pairs, enabling robust comparison even across datasets with incompatible coordinate systems where traditional spatial methods fail. As a key component of 3dSAGER, we also propose a new lightweight and interpretable blocking method, BKAFI, that leverages a trained model to efficiently generate high-recall candidate sets. We validate 3dSAGER through extensive experiments on real-world urban datasets, demonstrating significant gains in both accuracy and efficiency over strong baselines.

Over these 15 years, it has grown from a purely competition-focused site into a broader ecosystem with forums, notebooks, models, datasets, and more. With the release of the Kaggle Meta Code and Kaggle Meta Datasets, we now have a unique opportunity to explore these competitions, technologies, and real-world applications of Machine Learning and AI. And so in this study, we take a closer look at 15 years of data science on Kaggle - through metadata, shared code, community discussions, and the competitions themselves. We explore Kaggle's growth, its impact on the data science community, uncover hidden technological trends, analyze competition winners, how Kagglers approach problems in general, and more. We do this by analyzing millions of kernels and discussion threads to perform both longitudinal trend analysis and standard exploratory data analysis.

In this work, we propose a novel Spatial and Frequency Feature Reconstruction method (SFFR) method, which leverages the spatial-frequency feature representation mechanisms of the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) to reconstruct complementary representations in both spatial and frequency domains prior to feature fusion. The core components of SFFR are the proposed Frequency Component Exchange KAN (FCEKAN) module and Multi-Scale Gaussian KAN (MSGKAN) module. The FCEKAN introduces an innovative selective frequency component exchange strategy that effectively enhances the complementarity and consistency of cross-modal features based on the frequency feature of RGB and IR images. The MSGKAN module demonstrates excellent nonlinear feature modeling capability in the spatial domain. By leveraging multi-scale Gaussian basis functions, it effectively captures the feature variations caused by scale changes at different UAV flight altitudes, significantly enhancing the model's adaptability and robustness to scale variations. It is experimentally validated that our proposed FCEKAN and MSGKAN modules are complementary and can effectively capture the frequency and spatial semantic features respectively for better feature fusion. Extensive experiments on the SeaDroneSee, DroneVehicle and DVTOD datasets demonstrate the superior performance and significant advantages of the proposed method in UAV multispectral object perception task.

Nevertheless, advances are dominated by mathematics (e.g., AIME), with competitive-programming code generation underexplored and data curation receiving less attention than RL algorithm design. We investigate how to construct RLVR datasets (i.e., RL prompts) and present practical training techniques that yield strong performance on competitive-programming code generation. Our pipeline begins with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) distilled from strong open-source models, augmented with general-purpose and reasoning-intensive data. RL then follows a two-stage process with executable, testcase-driven rewards: first, training on a large, uniformly distributed set of competitive-programming problems using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with 8 rollouts per prompt and a relatively short response-generation window (e.g., 32k during SFT and 24k in this stage) to expand entropy and mitigate repetition and truncation; second, we perform \\textbf{Pre-GRPO}: updating on a small, high-quality set of challenging problems with a large rollout budget (64 rollouts per prompt) under a hard-focus curriculum that continuously retains the most difficult instances throughout training. We implement our method on Qwen2.5-32B and evaluate on LeetCode and Codeforces weekly contests to avoid data leakage. The resulting model achieves state-of-the-art performance among models of similar scale and is comparable to leading systems such as DeepSeek v3.1 and Doubao-1.5-Thinking. We also examine scaling trends and observe strong RL scaling on an internal large-scale MoE model.

However, purely data-driven 3DGS often struggles to capture the diverse physics-driven motion patterns in dynamic scenes. To fill this gap, we propose Physics-Informed Deformable Gaussian Splatting (PIDG), which treats each Gaussian particle as a Lagrangian material point with time-varying constitutive parameters and is supervised by 2D optical flow via motion projection. Specifically, we adopt static-dynamic decoupled 4D decomposed hash encoding to reconstruct geometry and motion efficiently. Subsequently, we impose the Cauchy momentum residual as a physics constraint, enabling independent prediction of each particle's velocity and constitutive stress via a time-evolving material field. Finally, we further supervise data fitting by matching Lagrangian particle flow to camera-compensated optical flow, which accelerates convergence and improves generalization.

Recently, CBFs represented as neural networks have shown great promise due to their expressiveness and applicability to a broad class of dynamics and safety constraints. However, verifying that a trained neural network is indeed a valid CBF is a computational bottleneck that limits the size of the networks that can be used. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel framework for verifying neural CBFs based on piecewise linear upper and lower bounds on the conditions required for a neural network to be a CBF. Our approach is rooted in linear bound propagation (LBP) for neural networks, which we extend to compute bounds on the gradients of the network. Combined with McCormick relaxation, we derive linear upper and lower bounds on the CBF conditions, thereby eliminating the need for computationally expensive verification procedures. Our approach applies to arbitrary control-affine systems and a broad range of nonlinear activation functions. To reduce conservatism, we develop a parallelizable refinement strategy that adaptively refines the regions over which these bounds are computed.

Existing generative-model-based approaches, particularly diffusion-model approaches that directly learn the posterior, may suffer from inflexibility -- they require conditioning signals during training, support only a fixed number of input views, and need complete retraining for different measurements. Recent diffusion-based methods have attempted to address this by combining prior models with likelihood updates, but they rely on heuristic fixed step sizes for the likelihood update that lead to slow convergence and suboptimal reconstruction quality. We advance this line of approach by integrating our novel Forward Curvature-Matching (FCM) update method with diffusion sampling. Our method dynamically determines optimal step sizes using only forward automatic differentiation and finite-difference curvature estimates, enabling precise optimization of the likelihood update. This formulation enables high-fidelity reconstruction from both single-view and multi-view inputs, and supports various input modalities through simple operator substitution -- all without retraining. Experiments on ShapeNet and CO3D datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior reconstruction quality at matched or lower NFEs, yielding higher F-score and lower CD and EMD, validating its efficiency and adaptability for practical applications.

These shortcomings lead to inconsistent predictions and poor generalization to real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose ReaDISH, a novel reaction prediction model that learns permutation-invariant representations while incorporating interaction-aware features. It introduces two innovations: (1) symmetric difference shingle encoding, which computes molecular shingle differences to capture reaction-specific structural changes while eliminating order sensitivity; and (2) geometry-structure interaction attention, a mechanism that models intra- and inter-molecular interactions at the shingle level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReaDISH improves reaction prediction performance across diverse benchmarks.

Treated as \"blind\" solvers, encoder-decoder transformers accurately reconstruct the original layout by reasoning over token sequences alone. Despite being deliberately restricted from accessing visual input, our models achieve state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks, often outperforming vision-based methods.

Current centralized traffic management schemes invade user location privacy and further entrench traffic disparity by offering disadvantaged route suggestions, whereas current federated learning frameworks do not consider fairness constraints in multi-objective traffic settings. This study presents a privacy-preserving federated learning framework, termed FedFair-Traffic, that jointly and simultaneously optimizes travel efficiency, traffic fairness, and differential privacy protection. This is the first attempt to integrate three conflicting objectives to improve urban transportation systems. The proposed methodology enables collaborative learning between related vehicles with data locality by integrating Graph Neural Networks with differential privacy mechanisms ($\u03b5$-privacy guarantees) and Gini coefficient-based fair constraints using multi-objective optimization. The framework uses federated aggregation methods of gradient clipping and noise injection to provide differential privacy and optimize Pareto-efficient solutions for the efficiency-fairness tradeoff. Real-world comprehensive experiments on the METR-LA traffic dataset showed that FedFair-Traffic can reduce the average travel time by 7\\% (14.2 minutes) compared with their centralized baselines, promote traffic fairness by 73\\% (Gini coefficient, 0.78), and offer high privacy protection (privacy score, 0.8) with an 89\\% reduction in communication overhead.

We introduce CINEMAE, a novel paradigm for AIGC image detection that adapts the core principles of text detection methods to the visual domain. Our key insight is that Masked AutoEncoder (MAE), trained to reconstruct masked patches conditioned on visible context, naturally encodes semantic consistency expectations. We formalize this reconstruction process probabilistically, computing conditional Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL, p(masked | visible)) to quantify local semantic anomalies. By aggregating these patch-level statistics with global MAE features through learned fusion, CINEMAE achieves strong cross-generator generalization. Trained exclusively on Stable Diffusion v1.4, our method achieves over 95% accuracy on all eight unseen generators in the GenImage benchmark, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art detectors.

However, imbalanced unimodal performance often leads to suboptimal fused representations. Existing approaches typically adopt fixed primary modality strategies to maximize dominant modality advantages, yet fail to adapt to dynamic variations in modality importance across different samples. Moreover, non-language modalities suffer from sequential redundancy and noise, degrading model performance when they serve as primary inputs. To address these issues, this paper proposes a modality optimization and dynamic primary modality selection framework (MODS). First, a Graph-based Dynamic Sequence Compressor (GDC) is constructed, which employs capsule networks and graph convolution to reduce sequential redundancy in acoustic/visual modalities.

Point clouds from airborne and ground-based laser scanning are currently the most suitable data source to rapidly derive such information at scale. Recent advancements in deep learning improved segmenting and classifying individual trees and identifying semantic tree components. However, deep learning models typically require large amounts of annotated training data which limits further improvement. Producing dense, high-quality annotations for 3D point clouds, especially in complex forests, is labor-intensive and challenging to scale. We explore strategies to reduce dependence on large annotated datasets using self-supervised and transfer learning architectures. Our objective is to improve performance across three tasks: instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and tree classification using realistic and operational training sets. Our findings indicate that combining self-supervised learning with domain adaptation significantly enhances instance segmentation compared to training from scratch (AP50 +16.98%), self-supervised learning suffices for semantic segmentation (mIoU +1.79%), and hierarchical transfer learning enables accurate classification of unseen species (Jaccard +6.07%). To simplify use and encourage uptake, we integrated the tasks into a unified framework, streamlining the process from raw point clouds to tree delineation, structural analysis, and species classification. Pretrained models reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions by ~21%.

TTRL leverages an elegant two-phase sampling strategy: first, multi-sampling derives a pseudo-label via majority voting, while subsequent downsampling and reward-based fine-tuning encourages the model to explore and learn diverse valid solutions, with the pseudo-label modulating the reward signal. Meanwhile, in-context learning has been widely explored at inference time and demonstrated the ability to enhance model performance without weight updates. However, TTRL's two-phase sampling strategy under-utilizes contextual guidance, which can potentially improve pseudo-label accuracy in the initial exploitation phase while regulating exploration in the second. To address this, we propose context-guided TTRL (CG-TTRL), integrating context dynamically into both sampling phases and propose a method for efficient context selection for on-device applications. Our evaluations on mathematical and scientific QA benchmarks show CG-TTRL outperforms TTRL (e.g. additional 7% relative accuracy improvement over TTRL), while boosting efficiency by obtaining strong performance after only a few steps of test-time training (e.g. 8% relative improvement rather than 1% over TTRL after 3 steps).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60(CG-TTRL)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728TTRL\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u91c7\u6837\u9636\u6bb5\u52a8\u6001\u6574\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5e76\u8c03\u8282\u63a2\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u79d1\u5b66QA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eTTRL\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfTTRL\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u800c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5df2\u8bc1\u660e\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5c06\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u52a8\u6001\u6574\u5408\u5230TTRL\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u521d\u59cb\u5229\u7528\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u8c03\u8282\u63a2\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCG-TTRL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728TTRL\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u91c7\u6837\u9636\u6bb5\u52a8\u6001\u6574\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u79d1\u5b66QA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cCG-TTRL\u76f8\u6bd4TTRL\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u989d\u59167%\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4ec53\u6b65\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u5c31\u80fd\u83b7\u5f978%\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u6539\u8fdb\uff08\u800cTTRL\u53ea\u67091%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5f15\u5bfc\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

To address this limitation, we present BuildingWorld, a comprehensive and structured 3D building dataset designed to bridge the gap in stylistic diversity. It encompasses buildings from geographically and architecturally diverse regions -- including North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Oceania -- offering a globally representative dataset for urban-scale foundation modeling and analysis. Specifically, BuildingWorld provides about five million LOD2 building models collected from diverse sources, accompanied by real and simulated airborne LiDAR point clouds. This enables comprehensive research on 3D building reconstruction, detection and segmentation. Cyber City, a virtual city model, is introduced to enable the generation of unlimited training data with customized and structurally diverse point cloud distributions.

To address this issue, we propose Channel Capacity Constrained Estimation (C3E), a novel framework that formulates the selection of hidden dimensions and depth as a nonlinear programming problem grounded in information theory. Through modeling spectral graph neural networks as communication channels, our approach directly connects channel capacity to hidden dimensions, propagation depth, propagation mechanism, and graph structure. Extensive experiments on nine public datasets demonstrate that hidden dimensions and depths estimated by C3E can mitigate over-squashing and consistently improve representation learning. Experimental results show that over-squashing occurs due to the cumulative compression of information in representation matrices. Furthermore, our findings show that increasing hidden dimensions indeed mitigate information compression, while the role of propagation depth is more nuanced, uncovering a fundamental balance between information compression and representation complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86C3E\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u4f20\u64ad\u6df1\u5ea6\u9009\u62e9\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u9009\u62e9\u9690\u85cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u4f20\u64ad\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f20\u64ad\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\uff08\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u95ee\u9898\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8c31\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u901a\u4fe1\u4fe1\u9053\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u9053\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0e\u9690\u85cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3001\u4f20\u64ad\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u4f20\u64ad\u673a\u5236\u548c\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u6765\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u57289\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cC3E\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u80fd\u591f\u7f13\u89e3\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u5e76\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u5584\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u662f\u7531\u8868\u793a\u77e9\u9635\u4e2d\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\u538b\u7f29\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u589e\u52a0\u9690\u85cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\u786e\u5b9e\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u4fe1\u606f\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u64ad\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u66f4\u4e3a\u5fae\u5999\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u538b\u7f29\u4e0e\u8868\u793a\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "relevance": 25.0}}

This limitation restricts its clinical utility for precise neurological monitoring. To address this, we introduce an AI-driven, high-density NIRS system optimized to provide real-time, layer-specific oxygenation data from the brain cortex, specifically targeting acute neuro-emergencies. Our system integrates high-density NIRS reflectance data with a neural network trained on MRI-based synthetic datasets. This approach achieves robust cortical oxygenation accuracy across diverse anatomical variations. In simulations, our AI-assisted NIRS demonstrated a strong correlation (R2=0.913) with actual cortical oxygenation, markedly outperforming conventional methods (R2=0.469). Furthermore, biomimetic phantom experiments confirmed its superior anatomical reliability (R2=0.986) compared to standard commercial devices (R2=0.823).

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has become a standard interface for enabling such tool-based interactions. However, these interactions introduce substantial security concerns, particularly when the MCP server is compromised or untrustworthy. While prior benchmarks primarily focus on prompt injection attacks or analyze the vulnerabilities of LLM MCP interaction trajectories, limited attention has been given to the underlying system logs associated with malicious MCP servers. To address this gap, we present the first synthetic benchmark for evaluating LLMs ability to identify security risks from system logs. We define nine categories of MCP server risks and generate 1,800 synthetic system logs using ten state-of-the-art LLMs. These logs are embedded in the return values of 243 curated MCP servers, yielding a dataset of 2,421 chat histories for training and 471 queries for evaluation. Our pilot experiments reveal that smaller models often fail to detect risky system logs, leading to high false negatives. While models trained with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) tend to over-flag benign logs, resulting in elevated false positives, Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Reward (RLVR) offers a better precision-recall balance. In particular, after training with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), Llama3.1-8B-Instruct achieves 83% accuracy, surpassing the best-performing large remote model by 9 percentage points. Fine-grained, per-category analysis further underscores the effectiveness of reinforcement learning in enhancing LLM safety within the MCP framework.

Specifically, FLEX cultivates scalable and inheritable evolution by constructing a structured experience library through continual reflection on successes and failures during interaction with the environment. FLEX delivers substantial improvements on mathematical reasoning, chemical retrosynthesis, and protein fitness prediction (up to 23% on AIME25, 10% on USPTO50k, and 14% on ProteinGym).

Although general capability evaluations are widespread, social impact assessments covering bias, fairness, privacy, environmental costs, and labor practices remain uneven across the AI ecosystem. To characterize this landscape, we conduct the first comprehensive analysis of both first-party and third-party social impact evaluation reporting across a wide range of model developers. Our study examines 186 first-party release reports and 183 post-release evaluation sources, and complements this quantitative analysis with interviews of model developers. We find a clear division of evaluation labor: first-party reporting is sparse, often superficial, and has declined over time in key areas such as environmental impact and bias, while third-party evaluators including academic researchers, nonprofits, and independent organizations provide broader and more rigorous coverage of bias, harmful content, and performance disparities. However, this complementarity has limits. Only model developers can authoritatively report on data provenance, content moderation labor, financial costs, and training infrastructure, yet interviews reveal that these disclosures are often deprioritized unless tied to product adoption or regulatory compliance. Our findings indicate that current evaluation practices leave major gaps in assessing AI's societal impacts, highlighting the urgent need for policies that promote developer transparency, strengthen independent evaluation ecosystems, and create shared infrastructure to aggregate and compare third-party evaluations in a consistent and accessible way.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86AI\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u73b0\u72b6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7b2c\u4e00\u65b9\u8bc4\u4f30\u7a00\u758f\u4e14\u80a4\u6d45\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u8bc4\u4f30\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u547c\u5401\u9700\u8981\u653f\u7b56\u4fc3\u8fdb\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u5e76\u52a0\u5f3a\u72ec\u7acb\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u65e5\u76ca\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u6cbb\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bc4\u4f30\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u5176\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u867d\u7136\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f88\u666e\u904d\uff0c\u4f46\u6db5\u76d6\u504f\u89c1\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u3001\u73af\u5883\u6210\u672c\u548c\u52b3\u52a8\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u6574\u4e2aAI\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4ecd\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9186\u4efd\u7b2c\u4e00\u65b9\u53d1\u5e03\u62a5\u544a\u548c183\u4efd\u53d1\u5e03\u540e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6765\u6e90\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u8f85\u4ee5\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u8bbf\u8c08\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u52b3\u52a8\u5206\u5de5\u660e\u786e\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u65b9\u62a5\u544a\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u80a4\u6d45\uff0c\u5728\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u548c\u504f\u89c1\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u548c\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u3001\u6709\u5bb3\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u8986\u76d6\u3002\u4f46\u53ea\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u80fd\u6743\u5a01\u62a5\u544a\u6570\u636e\u6765\u6e90\u3001\u5185\u5bb9\u5ba1\u6838\u52b3\u52a8\u3001\u8d22\u52a1\u6210\u672c\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u62ab\u9732\u5f80\u5f80\u88ab\u964d\u7ea7\u5904\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9e\u8df5\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u91cd\u5927\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u653f\u7b56\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3001\u52a0\u5f3a\u72ec\u7acb\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u521b\u5efa\u5171\u4eab\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u4ee5\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u805a\u5408\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "relevance": 75.0}}

Existing approaches focus on single learning experiences and do not account for students' gradual knowledge construction and evolving skill sets. Moreover, large language models are optimized to produce direct and accurate responses, making it challenging to represent the incomplete understanding and developmental constraints that characterize real learners. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for memory-based student simulation that incorporates developmental trajectories through a hierarchical memory mechanism with structured knowledge representation. The framework also integrates metacognitive processes and personality traits to enrich the individual learner profiling, through dynamical consolidation of both cognitive development and personal learning characteristics. In practice, we implement a curriculum-aligned simulator grounded on the Next Generation Science Standards.

However, existing benchmarks for image aesthetic assessment (IAA) are narrow in perception scope or lack the diversity needed to evaluate systematic aesthetic production. To address this gap, we introduce AesTest, a comprehensive benchmark for multimodal aesthetic perception and production, distinguished by the following features: 1) It consists of curated multiple-choice questions spanning ten tasks, covering perception, appreciation, creation, and photography. These tasks are grounded in psychological theories of generative learning. 2) It integrates data from diverse sources, including professional editing workflows, photographic composition tutorials, and crowdsourced preferences.

Surprisingly, trivial instruction-based attacks report the highest success rate (up to ~85.3%) while simultaneously having a high uncertainty for incorrectly answered questions. To provide a simple defense mechanism against Xmera, we train Random Forest classifiers on the response uncertainty levels to distinguish between attacked and unattacked queries (average AUC of up to ~96%).

In this paper, we propose V-Shuffle, a zero-shot style transfer method that leverages multiple style images from the same style domain to effectively navigate the trade-off between content preservation and style fidelity. V-Shuffle implicitly disrupts the semantic content of the style images by shuffling the value features within the self-attention layers of the diffusion model, thereby preserving low-level style representations. We further introduce a Hybrid Style Regularization that complements these low-level representations with high-level style textures to enhance style fidelity.

Current fusion methods are typically evaluated on a small selection of public datasets, a limited scope that inadequately represents the complexity and diversity of real-world scenarios, potentially leading to biased evaluations. This issue presents a twofold challenge. On one hand, models may overfit to the biases of specific datasets, hindering their generalization to broader practical applications. On the other hand, the absence of a unified evaluation standard makes fair and objective comparisons between different fusion methods difficult. Consequently, a truly universal and high-performance fusion model has yet to emerge. To address these challenges, we have developed a large-scale, domain-adaptive benchmark for multimodal evaluation. This benchmark integrates over 30 datasets, encompassing 15 modalities and 20 predictive tasks across key application domains. To complement this, we have also developed an open-source, unified, and automated evaluation pipeline that includes standardized implementations of state-of-the-art models and diverse fusion paradigms.

This problem arises naturally in various contexts ranging from localization in GPS and sensor networks to privacy-aware data access, and spans a wide variety of metric spaces. It is relevant from the perspective of both the reconstructor (seeking accurate recovery) and the responder (aiming to limit information disclosure, e.g., for privacy or security reasons). We study this reconstruction game through a learning-theoretic lens, focusing on the rate and limits of the best possible reconstruction error. Our first result provides a tight geometric characterization of the optimal error in terms of the Chebyshev radius, a classical concept from geometry. This characterization applies to all compact metric spaces (in fact, even to all totally bounded spaces) and yields explicit formulas for natural metric spaces. Our second result addresses the asymptotic behavior of reconstruction, distinguishing between pseudo-finite spaces -- where the optimal error is attained after finitely many queries -- and spaces where the approximation curve exhibits nontrivial decay.

Recent research has increasingly focused on developing such simulated agents to capture a range of learning styles, cognitive development pathways, and social behaviours. Among contemporary simulation techniques, the integration of large language models (LLMs) into educational research has emerged as a particularly versatile and scalable paradigm. LLMs afford a high degree of linguistic realism and behavioural adaptability, enabling agents to approximate cognitive processes and engage in contextually appropriate pedagogical dialogues. This paper presents a thematic review of empirical and methodological studies utilising LLMs to simulate student behaviour across educational environments. We synthesise current evidence on the capacity of LLM-based agents to emulate learner archetypes, respond to instructional inputs, and interact within multi-agent classroom scenarios.

Despite notable advancements, current IVOD models exhibit notable performance declines when confronted with incomplete modality data, particularly if the dominant modality is missing. In this paper, we take a thorough investigation on modality incomplete IVOD problem from an architecture compatibility perspective. Specifically, we propose a plug-and-play Scarf Neck module for DETR variants, which introduces a modality-agnostic deformable attention mechanism to enable the IVOD detector to flexibly adapt to any single or double modalities during training and inference. When training Scarf-DETR, we design a pseudo modality dropout strategy to fully utilize the multi-modality information, making the detector compatible and robust to both working modes of single and double modalities. Moreover, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark for the modality-incomplete IVOD task aimed at thoroughly assessing situations where the absent modality is either dominant or secondary.

However, existing NeRF-based methods encounter challenges in applications such as autonomous driving and robotic perception, primarily due to the difficulty of capturing accurate camera poses and limitations in handling large-scale dynamic environments. To address these issues, we propose Vision-only Dynamic NeRF (VDNeRF), a method that accurately recovers camera trajectories and learns spatiotemporal representations for dynamic urban scenes without requiring additional camera pose information or expensive sensor data. VDNeRF employs two separate NeRF models to jointly reconstruct the scene. The static NeRF model optimizes camera poses and static background, while the dynamic NeRF model incorporates the 3D scene flow to ensure accurate and consistent reconstruction of dynamic objects. To address the ambiguity between camera motion and independent object motion, we design an effective and powerful training framework to achieve robust camera pose estimation and self-supervised decomposition of static and dynamic elements in a scene.

This perspective naturally leads to structured approximations of the Fisher matrix as preconditioners, where the matrix view induces a Kronecker-factorized form that enables memory-efficient representation. However, constructing such approximations both efficiently and accurately remains an open challenge, since obtaining the optimal factorization is resource-intensive and practical methods therefore rely on heuristic design choices.

In this paper, we argue that the predominant approach of simply removing existing biases from models is not enough. Using a paradigm from the psychology literature, we demonstrate that LLMs can spontaneously develop novel social biases about artificial demographic groups even when no inherent differences exist. These biases result in highly stratified task allocations, which are less fair than assignments by human participants and are exacerbated by newer and larger models. In social science, emergent biases like these have been shown to result from exploration-exploitation trade-offs, where the decision-maker explores too little, allowing early observations to strongly influence impressions about entire demographic groups. To alleviate this effect, we examine a series of interventions targeting model inputs, problem structure, and explicit steering. We find that explicitly incentivizing exploration most robustly reduces stratification, highlighting the need for better multifaceted objectives to mitigate bias. These results reveal that LLMs are not merely passive mirrors of human social biases, but can actively create new ones from experience, raising urgent questions about how these systems will shape societies over time.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs\u80fd\u81ea\u53d1\u4ea7\u751f\u5bf9\u4eba\u5de5\u4eba\u53e3\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7fa4\u4f53\u95f4\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u56fa\u6709\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u89c1\u5bfc\u81f4\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5206\u5c42\uff0c\u6bd4\u4eba\u7c7b\u5206\u914d\u66f4\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u65b0\u4e00\u4ee3\u66f4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u66f4\u4e3a\u4e25\u91cd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u63a2\u7d22-\u5229\u7528\u6743\u8861\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u660e\u786e\u6fc0\u52b1\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u6700\u6709\u6548\u5730\u51cf\u5c11\u5206\u5c42\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLMs\u88ab\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u80fd\u591f\u505a\u51fa\u5b9e\u9645\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5176\u65e0\u504f\u89c1\u53d8\u5f97\u65e5\u76ca\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6d88\u9664\u5df2\u6709\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4f46\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e2d\u4e3b\u52a8\u521b\u9020\u65b0\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5982\u4f55\u5851\u9020\u793e\u4f1a\u7684\u7d27\u8feb\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7814\u7a76LLMs\u5bf9\u4eba\u5de5\u4eba\u53e3\u7fa4\u4f53\u4ea7\u751f\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u63a2\u7d22-\u5229\u7528\u6743\u8861\u673a\u5236\u5206\u6790\u504f\u89c1\u5f62\u6210\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u5165\u3001\u95ee\u9898\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u660e\u786e\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u4f1a\u81ea\u53d1\u4ea7\u751f\u65b0\u578b\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5206\u5c42\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u5206\u5c42\u6bd4\u4eba\u7c7b\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u5206\u914d\u66f4\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u3002\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u66f4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u73b0\u8c61\u66f4\u4e3a\u4e25\u91cd\u3002\u660e\u786e\u6fc0\u52b1\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u80fd\u6700\u6709\u6548\u5730\u51cf\u5c11\u5206\u5c42\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u4eba\u7c7b\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u88ab\u52a8\u53cd\u6620\u8005\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u4ece\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e2d\u4e3b\u52a8\u521b\u9020\u65b0\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u3002\u8fd9\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u9762\u76ee\u6807\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5982\u4f55\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u5851\u9020\u793e\u4f1a\u7684\u7d27\u8feb\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

However, in GNSS-denied environments, localization schemes that rely solely on satellite signals are prone to failure. Cross-view image retrieval-based localization is a promising alternative, yet substantial geometric and appearance domain gaps exist between oblique UAV views and nadir satellite orthophotos. Moreover, conventional approaches often depend on complex network architectures, text prompts, or large amounts of annotation, which hinders generalization. To address these issues, we propose DiffusionUavLoc, a cross-view localization framework that is image-prompted, text-free, diffusion-centric, and employs a VAE for unified representation. We first use training-free geometric rendering to synthesize pseudo-satellite images from UAV imagery as structural prompts. We then design a text-free conditional diffusion model that fuses multimodal structural cues to learn features robust to viewpoint changes. At inference, descriptors are computed at a fixed time step t and compared using cosine similarity. On University-1652 and SUES-200, the method performs competitively for cross-view localization, especially for satellite-to-drone in University-1652.Our data and code will be published at the following URL: https://github.com/liutao23/DiffusionUavLoc.git.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DiffusionUavLoc\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548cVAE\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4e0e\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u6216\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u5728GNSS\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3GNSS\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u503e\u659c\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0e\u536b\u661f\u6b63\u5c04\u5f71\u50cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u5916\u89c2\u57df\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u7f51\u7edc\u3001\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u6216\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u51e0\u4f55\u6e32\u67d3\u4ece\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u4f2a\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65e0\u6587\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u878d\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65t\u8ba1\u7b97\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u5728University-1652\u548cSUES-200\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728University-1652\u7684\u536b\u661f\u5230\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "DiffusionUavLoc\u4e3a\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u5b9a\u4f4d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u65e0\u6587\u672c\u3001\u6269\u6563\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728GNSS\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002", "relevance": 25.0}}

At the same time, artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly emerged as a powerful force in education, with the potential to address major challenges, personalize learning, and innovate teaching practices. However, these advances come with significant risks: rapid AI development can undermine human agency, exacerbate inequities, and outpace our capacity to guide its use with sound policy. Human learning presupposes cognitive efforts and social interaction (dialogues). In response to this evolving landscape, an international workshop titled \"Educational Dialogue: Moving Thinking Forward\" convened 19 leading researchers from 11 countries in Cambridge (September 1-3, 2025) to examine the intersection of AI and educational dialogue. This AI-focused strand of the workshop centered on three critical questions: (1) When is AI truly useful in education, and when might it merely replace human effort at the expense of learning? (2) Under what conditions can AI use lead to better dialogic teaching and learning? (3) Does the AI-human partnership risk outpacing and displacing human educational work, and what are the implications? These questions framed two days of presentations and structured dialogue among participants.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u56fd\u9645\u7814\u8ba8\u4f1a\u63a2\u8ba8AI\u4e0e\u6559\u80b2\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u70b9\uff0c\u5173\u6ce8AI\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u7684\u771f\u6b63\u4ef7\u503c\u3001\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0f\u6559\u5b66\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caAI-\u4eba\u7c7b\u5408\u4f5c\u5bf9\u6559\u80b2\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5e73\u8861AI\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u4e0e\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u786e\u4fddAI\u589e\u5f3a\u800c\u975e\u53d6\u4ee3\u4eba\u7c7b\u6559\u80b2\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u53ec\u96c619\u4f4d\u6765\u81ea11\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u4e3a\u671f\u4e24\u5929\u7684\u7814\u8ba8\u4f1a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6f14\u8bb2\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u8ba8\u4f1a\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86AI\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3001\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0f\u6559\u5b66\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caAI-\u4eba\u7c7b\u5408\u4f5c\u5bf9\u6559\u80b2\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u8c28\u614e\u5f15\u5bfcAI\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5176\u589e\u5f3a\u800c\u975e\u524a\u5f31\u6559\u80b2\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5173\u6ce8\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u80fd\u52a8\u6027\u3002", "relevance": 15.0}}

Recently, to improve its performance and make it work more like a pathologist, several MIL approaches based on the use of multiple-resolution images have been proposed, delivering often higher performance than those that use single-resolution images. Despite impressive recent developments of multiple-resolution MIL, previous approaches only focus on improving performance, thereby lacking research on well-calibrated MIL that clinical experts can rely on for trustworthy diagnostic results. In this study, we propose Uncertainty-Focused Calibrated MIL (UFC-MIL), which more closely mimics the pathologists' examination behaviors while providing calibrated diagnostic predictions, using multiple images with different resolutions. UFC-MIL includes a novel patch-wise loss that learns the latent patterns of instances and expresses their uncertainty for classification. Also, the attention-based architecture with a neighbor patch aggregation module collects features for the classifier. In addition, aggregated predictions are calibrated through patch-level uncertainty without requiring multiple iterative inferences, which is a key practical advantage. Against challenging public datasets, UFC-MIL shows superior performance in model calibration while achieving classification accuracy comparable to that of state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faUFC-MIL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u591a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6a21\u4eff\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u5bb6\u68c0\u67e5\u884c\u4e3a\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387MIL\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684MIL\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUFC-MIL\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u65b0\u9896\u7684patch-wise\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6f5c\u5728\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e76\u8868\u8fbe\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u90bb\u57dfpatch\u805a\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7patch\u7ea7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6821\u51c6\u805a\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cUFC-MIL\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "UFC-MIL\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u591a\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "relevance": 35.0}}

These graph representations may evolve over time, forming time-varying graphs. Effectively modeling and analyzing such dynamic graph data is critical for tasks like predicting graph evolution and reconstructing missing graph data. In this paper, we propose a framework based on the Koopman autoencoder (KAE) to handle time-varying graph data. Specifically, we assume the existence of a hidden non-linear dynamical system, where the state vector corresponds to the graph embedding of the time-varying graph signals. To capture the evolving graph structures, the graph data is first converted into a vector time series through graph embedding, representing the structural information in a finite-dimensional latent space.

Tools such as Spack automate dependency resolution and environment management, but their effectiveness relies on manually written build recipes. As these ecosystems grow, maintaining existing specifications and creating new ones becomes increasingly labor-intensive. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in code generation, automatically producing correct and maintainable Spack recipes remains a significant challenge. We present a systematic analysis of how LLMs and context-augmentation methods can assist in the generation of Spack recipes.

However, this expansion has also exposed IoT networks to increasingly sophisticated security threats, including adversarial attacks targeting artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) to deliberately evade detection, induce misclassification, and systematically undermine the reliability and integrity of security defenses. To address these challenges, we propose a novel adversarial detection model that enhances the robustness of IoT IDS against adversarial attacks through SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)-based fingerprinting. Using SHAP's DeepExplainer, we extract attribution fingerprints from network traffic features, enabling the IDS to reliably distinguish between clean and adversarially perturbed inputs. By capturing subtle attribution patterns, the model becomes more resilient to evasion attempts and adversarial manipulations. We evaluated the model on a standard IoT benchmark dataset, where it significantly outperformed a state-of-the-art method in detecting adversarial attacks. In addition to enhanced robustness, this approach improves model transparency and interpretability, thereby increasing trust in the IDS through explainable AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eSHAP\u6307\u7eb9\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u8bbe\u5907\u6fc0\u589e\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9488\u5bf9AI/ML\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u9ad8\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528SHAP\u7684DeepExplainer\u4ece\u7f51\u7edc\u6d41\u91cf\u7279\u5f81\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u5f52\u56e0\u6307\u7eb9\uff0c\u4f7fIDS\u80fd\u591f\u53ef\u9760\u533a\u5206\u5e72\u51c0\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6270\u52a8\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u5bf9IDS\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002", "relevance": 45.0}}

Applications like human action anticipation that require fusing multifarious sensor data are hindered by both feature and modality collapse. However, existing methods attempt to counter feature collapse and modality collapse separately. This is because there is no unifying framework that efficiently addresses feature and modality collapse in conjunction. In this paper, we posit the utility of effective rank as an informative measure that can be utilized to quantify and counter both the representation collapses. We propose \\textit{Rank-enhancing Token Fuser}, a theoretically grounded fusion framework that selectively blends less informative features from one modality with complementary features from another modality. We show that our method increases the effective rank of the fused representation. To address modality collapse, we evaluate modality combinations that mutually increase each others' effective rank. We show that depth maintains representational balance when fused with RGB, avoiding modality collapse. We validate our method on action anticipation, where we present \\texttt{R3D}, a depth-informed fusion framework. Extensive experiments on NTURGBD, UTKinect, and DARai demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods by up to 3.74\\%.

Prior adaptive routing methods introduce additional modules and hyperparameters, often requiring costly retraining from scratch. We propose Sequence-level TopK (SeqTopK), a minimal modification that shifts the expert budget from the token level to the sequence level. By selecting the top $T \\cdot K$ experts across all $T$ tokens, SeqTopK enables end-to-end learned dynamic allocation -- assigning more experts to difficult tokens and fewer to easy ones -- while preserving the same overall budget. SeqTopK requires only a few lines of code, adds less than 1% overhead, and remains fully compatible with pretrained MoE models. Experiments across math, coding, law, and writing show consistent improvements over TopK and prior parameter-free adaptive methods, with gains that become substantially larger under higher sparsity (up to 16.9%).

Generative AI models like OpenAI GPT-4.1 Mini, Gemini 2.0 Flash, Meta Llama 3 70B, and DeepSeek R1 could potentially democratize legal assistance by providing quick and affordable legal advice. In this study, we collected 250 authentic legal questions from the Facebook group \"Know Your Rights,\" where verified legal experts regularly provide authoritative answers. These questions were subsequently submitted to four four advanced AI models and responses were generated using a consistent, standardized prompt. A comprehensive dual evaluation framework was employed, in which a state-of-the-art LLM model served as a judge, assessing each AI-generated response across four critical dimensions: factual accuracy, legal appropriateness, completeness, and clarity. Following this, the same set of questions was evaluated by three licensed Bangladeshi legal professionals according to the same criteria.

Still, existing remote sensing methods depend on costly aerial images, expert labeling, and produce only binary damage maps for early-stage evaluation. Although ground-level images from social networks provide a valuable source to fill this gap, a large pixel-level annotated dataset for this task is still unavailable. We introduce EIDSeg, the first large-scale semantic segmentation dataset specifically for post-earthquake social media imagery. The dataset comprises 3,266 images from nine major earthquakes (2008-2023), annotated across five classes of infrastructure damage: Undamaged Building, Damaged Building, Destroyed Building, Undamaged Road, and Damaged Road. We propose a practical three-phase cross-disciplinary annotation protocol with labeling guidelines that enables consistent segmentation by non-expert annotators, achieving over 70% inter-annotator agreement. We benchmark several state-of-the-art segmentation models, identifying Encoder-only Mask Transformer (EoMT) as the top-performing method with a Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 80.8%.

This is primarily due to three key challenges: (i) identifying target objects in the 3D field of 360\u00b0 environments, (ii) dealing with severe occlusions in multi-object scenes, which makes it hard to define regions to inpaint, and (iii) maintaining consistent and high-quality appearance across views effectively. To tackle these challenges, we propose Inpaint360GS, a flexible 360\u00b0 editing framework based on 3DGS that supports multi-object removal and high-fidelity inpainting in 3D space. By distilling 2D segmentation into 3D and leveraging virtual camera views for contextual guidance, our method enables accurate object-level editing and consistent scene completion. We further introduce a new dataset tailored for 360\u00b0 inpainting, addressing the lack of ground truth object-free scenes.

Tensor Network (TN) methods such as the Modified Alternating Linear Scheme (MVMALS) have been a breakthrough for the field, offering a tractable approach by exploiting the low-rank structure in Volterra kernels. However, these techniques still encounter prohibitive computational and memory bottlenecks due to high-order polynomial scaling with respect to input dimension. To overcome this barrier, we introduce the Tensor Head Averaging (THA) algorithm, which significantly reduces complexity by constructing an ensemble of localized MVMALS models trained on small subsets of the input space. In this paper, we present a theoretical foundation for the THA algorithm. We establish observable, finite-sample bounds on the error between the THA ensemble and a full MVMALS model, and we derive an exact decomposition of the squared error. This decomposition is used to analyze the manner in which subset models implicitly compensate for omitted dynamics. We quantify this effect, and prove that correlation between the included and omitted dynamics creates an optimization incentive which drives THA's performance toward accuracy superior to a simple truncation of a full MVMALS model.

Preprint", "summary": "Video large language models (Video LLMs) have recently achieved strong performance on tasks such as captioning, summarization, and question answering. Many models and training methods explicitly encourage continuity across events to enhance narrative coherence. While this improves fluency, it also introduces an inductive bias that prioritizes storyline consistency over strict grounding in visual evidence. We identify this bias, which we call narrative prior, as a key driver of two errors: hallucinations, where non-existent events are introduced or existing ones are misinterpreted, and omissions, where factual events are suppressed because they are misaligned with surrounding context. To systematically evaluate narrative prior-induced errors, we introduce NOAH, a large-scale benchmark that constructs composite videos by inserting clips from other sources into target videos. By varying semantic similarity and insertion position, our benchmark enables controlled and scalable analysis of narrative priors. We design one captioning task with tailored metrics and three QA tasks - Existence, Temporal, and Narrative - yielding more than 60K evaluation samples. Extensive experiments yield three key findings: (i) most Video LLMs exhibit hallucinations and omissions driven by narrative priors, (ii) the patterns of these errors vary across architectures and depend on event similarity and insertion position, and (iii) reliance on narrative priors intensifies under sampling with fewer frames, amplifying errors when event continuity is weak. We establish NOAH as the first standardized evaluation of narrative prior-induced hallucination and omission in Video LLMs, providing a foundation for developing more reliable and trustworthy models.

However, generating these explanations for multivariate time series presents challenges due to their complex, multi-dimensional nature. Traditional Nearest Unlike Neighbor-based methods typically substitute subsequences in a queried time series with influential subsequences from an NUN, which is not always realistic in real-world scenarios due to the rigid direct substitution. Counterfactual with Residual Generative Adversarial Networks-based methods aim to address this by learning from the distribution of observed data to generate synthetic counterfactual explanations. However, these methods primarily focus on minimizing the cost from the queried time series to the counterfactual explanations and often neglect the importance of distancing the counterfactual explanation from the decision boundary. This oversight can result in explanations that no longer qualify as counterfactual if minor changes occur within the model. To generate a more robust counterfactual explanation, we introduce TriShGAN, under the CounteRGAN framework enhanced by the incorporation of triplet loss. This unsupervised learning approach uses distance metric learning to encourage the counterfactual explanations not only to remain close to the queried time series but also to capture the feature distribution of the instance with the desired outcome, thereby achieving a better balance between minimal cost and robustness.

Despite excelling on natural images, VLMs often struggle with stylized line art, onomatopoeia, and densely packed multi-panel layouts. To address this gap, we introduce AI4VA-FG, the first fine-grained and comprehensive benchmark for VLM-based comic understanding. It spans tasks from foundational recognition and detection to high-level character reasoning and narrative construction, supported by dense annotations for characters, poses, and depth. Beyond that, we evaluate state-of-the-art proprietary models, including GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5, and open-source models such as Qwen2.5-VL, revealing substantial performance deficits across core tasks of our benchmarks and underscoring that comic understanding remains an unsolved challenge. To enhance VLMs' capabilities in this domain, we systematically investigate post-training strategies, including supervised fine-tuning on solutions (SFT-S), supervised fine-tuning on reasoning trajectories (SFT-R), and reinforcement learning (RL). Beyond that, inspired by the emerging \"Thinking with Images\" paradigm, we propose Region-Aware Reinforcement Learning (RARL) for VLMs, which trains models to dynamically attend to relevant regions through zoom-in operations. We observe that when applied to the Qwen2.5-VL model, RL and RARL yield significant gains in low-level entity recognition and high-level storyline ordering, paving the way for more accurate and efficient VLM applications in the comics domain.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AI4VA-FG\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6f2b\u753b\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6f2b\u753b\u8fd9\u79cd\u590d\u6742\u89c6\u89c9\u53d9\u4e8b\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u7ebf\u6761\u827a\u672f\u3001\u62df\u58f0\u8bcd\u548c\u5bc6\u96c6\u591a\u9762\u677f\u5e03\u5c40\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86AI4VA-FG\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86GPT-4o\u3001Gemini-2.5\u3001Qwen2.5-VL\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT-S\u3001SFT-R\uff09\u3001\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u533a\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RARL\uff09\u7b49\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6f2b\u753b\u7406\u89e3\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4f46RL\u548cRARL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728Qwen2.5-VL\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4f4e\u5c42\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u9ad8\u5c42\u6545\u4e8b\u60c5\u8282\u6392\u5e8f\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6f2b\u753b\u7406\u89e3\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684RARL\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684VLM\u5728\u6f2b\u753b\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002", "relevance": 40.0}}

Anchoring imposes a Gaussian weight prior (MAP training), yielding posterior-like diversity without test-time sampling, while the t-head provides heavy-tailed robustness and closed-form prediction intervals. Using vehicle-kinematic time series (e.g., speed, motor RPM), our model attains strong accuracy: RMSE 3.36 +/- 1.10, MAE 2.21 +/- 0.89, R-squared = 0.93 +/- 0.02, explained variance 0.93 +/- 0.02, and delivers well-calibrated uncertainty bands with near-nominal coverage. Against competitive baselines (Student-t MC dropout; quantile regression with/without anchoring), our method matches or improves log-scores while producing sharper intervals at the same coverage. Crucially for real-time deployment, inference is a single deterministic pass per ensemble member (or a weight-averaged collapse), eliminating Monte Carlo latency.

To succeed, models must master three critical capabilities: perceiving nuanced visual details, applying abstract sport rule knowledge, and grounding that knowledge in specific visual evidence. Current sports benchmarks either cover single sports or lack the detailed reasoning chains and precise visual grounding needed to robustly evaluate these core capabilities in a multi-sport context. To address this gap, we introduce SportR, the first multi-sports large-scale benchmark designed to train and evaluate MLLMs on the fundamental reasoning required for sports intelligence. Our benchmark provides a dataset of 5,017 images and 2,101 videos. To enable granular evaluation, we structure our benchmark around a progressive hierarchy of question-answer (QA) pairs designed to probe reasoning at increasing depths - from simple infraction identification to complex penalty prediction. For the most advanced tasks requiring multi-step reasoning, such as determining penalties or explaining tactics, we provide 7,118 high-quality, human-authored Chain of Thought (CoT) annotations. In addition, our benchmark incorporates both image and video modalities and provides manual bounding box annotations to test visual grounding in the image part directly. Extensive experiments demonstrate the profound difficulty of our benchmark. State-of-the-art baseline models perform poorly on our most challenging tasks. While training on our data via Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning improves these scores, they remain relatively low, highlighting a significant gap in current model capabilities.

A critical yet often overlooked barrier lies in the computational and memory limitations of RAN baseband hardware, particularly in legacy 4th Generation (4G) systems, which typically lack on-chip neural accelerators. As a result, only lightweight AI models (under 1 Mb and sub-100~\u03bcs inference time) can be effectively deployed, limiting both their performance and applicability. However, achieving strong generalization across diverse network conditions often requires large-scale models with substantial resource demands. To address this trade-off, this paper investigates policy distillation in the context of a reinforcement learning-based link adaptation task. We explore two strategies: single-policy distillation, where a scenario-agnostic teacher model is compressed into one generalized student model; and multi-policy distillation, where multiple scenario-specific teachers are consolidated into a single generalist student. Experimental evaluations in a high-fidelity, 5th Generation (5G)-compliant simulator demonstrate that both strategies produce compact student models that preserve the teachers' generalization capabilities while complying with the computational and memory limitations of existing RAN hardware.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u65e0\u7ebf\u63a5\u5165\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72AI\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u84b8\u998f\u6280\u672f\u5c06\u5927\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u76844G\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u7ebf\u63a5\u5165\u7f51\u7edc(RAN)\u90e8\u7f72AI\u9762\u4e34\u4e09\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u94fe\u8def\u7ea7\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u8981\u6c42\u4e25\u683c\uff08\u4e9a\u6beb\u79d2\u7ea7\uff09\u3001\u7f51\u7edc\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u3002\u6700\u5173\u952e\u7684\u662f4G\u57fa\u5e26\u786c\u4ef6\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u52a0\u901f\u5668\uff0c\u53ea\u80fd\u90e8\u7f72\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\uff08<1Mb\uff0c<100\u03bcs\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u9700\u8981\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u94fe\u8def\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u84b8\u998f\u6280\u672f\uff1a1\uff09\u5355\u7b56\u7565\u84b8\u998f - \u5c06\u573a\u666f\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2\uff09\u591a\u7b56\u7565\u84b8\u998f - \u5c06\u591a\u4e2a\u573a\u666f\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u5408\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u901a\u7528\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f5G\u517c\u5bb9\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u90fd\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u7b26\u5408\u73b0\u6709RAN\u786c\u4ef6\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9650\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7b56\u7565\u84b8\u998f\u662f\u89e3\u51b3RAN\u4e2dAI\u90e8\u7f72\u786c\u4ef6\u9650\u5236\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u4e3a\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u590d\u6742AI\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "relevance": 45.0}}

Developing such systems often requires large, well-annotated datasets, but existing resources often address isolated tasks, neglect temporal dependencies, or lack multi-center variability. We present the Surgical Procedure Phase, Keypoint, and Instrument Recognition (PhaKIR) dataset, comprising eight complete laparoscopic cholecystectomy videos recorded at three medical centers. The dataset provides frame-level annotations for three interconnected tasks: surgical phase recognition (485,875 frames), instrument keypoint estimation (19,435 frames), and instrument instance segmentation (19,435 frames). PhaKIR is, to our knowledge, the first multi-institutional dataset to jointly provide phase labels, instrument pose information, and pixel-accurate instrument segmentations, while also enabling the exploitation of temporal context since full surgical procedure sequences are available. It served as the basis for the PhaKIR Challenge as part of the Endoscopic Vision (EndoVis) Challenge at MICCAI 2024 to benchmark methods in surgical scene understanding, thereby further validating the dataset's quality and relevance.

Fairness in this setting is critical, as biased predictions can exacerbate societal inequalities. Prior work adopts a dyadic definition of fairness, enforcing fairness through demographic parity between intra-group and inter-group link predictions. However, we show that this dyadic framing can obscure underlying disparities across subgroups, allowing systemic biases to go undetected. Moreover, we argue that demographic parity does not meet desired properties for fairness assessment in ranking-based tasks such as link prediction. We formalize the limitations of existing fairness evaluations and propose a framework that enables a more expressive assessment.

More modifications may be performed", "summary": "Multi-Modal Image Fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate complementary image information from different modalities to produce informative images. Previous deep learning-based MMIF methods generally adopt Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Transformers for feature extraction. However, these methods deliver unsatisfactory performances due to the limited receptive field of CNNs and the high computational cost of Transformers. Recently, Mamba has demonstrated a powerful potential for modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, providing a promising solution to MMIF. Unfortunately, Mamba lacks full spatial and frequency perceptions, which are very important for MMIF. Moreover, employing Image Reconstruction (IR) as an auxiliary task has been proven beneficial for MMIF. However, a primary challenge is how to leverage IR efficiently and effectively. To address the above issues, we propose a novel framework named Spatial-Frequency Enhanced Mamba Fusion (SFMFusion) for MMIF. More specifically, we first propose a three-branch structure to couple MMIF and IR, which can retain complete contents from source images. Then, we propose the Spatial-Frequency Enhanced Mamba Block (SFMB), which can enhance Mamba in both spatial and frequency domains for comprehensive feature extraction. Finally, we propose the Dynamic Fusion Mamba Block (DFMB), which can be deployed across different branches for dynamic feature fusion. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves better results than most state-of-the-art methods on six MMIF datasets.

AdvisingWise leverages authoritative institutional resources and adaptively prompts students about their academic backgrounds to generate reliable, personalized responses. All system responses undergo human advisor validation before delivery to students. We evaluate AdvisingWise through a mixed-methods approach: (1) expert evaluation on responses of 20 sample queries, (2) LLM-as-a-judge evaluation of the information retrieval strategy, and (3) a user study with 8 academic advisors to assess the system's practical utility.

However, in deep architectures, this process often leads to diminished expressiveness. A popular solution is to use residual connections, where the input from the current (or initial) layer is added to aggregated neighbor information to preserve embeddings across layers. Following a recent line of research, we investigate an adaptive residual scheme in which different nodes have varying residual strengths. We prove that this approach prevents oversmoothing; particularly, we show that the Dirichlet energy of the embeddings remains bounded away from zero. This is the first theoretical guarantee not only for the adaptive setting, but also for static residual connections (where residual strengths are shared across nodes) with activation functions. Furthermore, extensive experiments show that this adaptive approach outperforms standard and state-of-the-art message passing mechanisms, especially on heterophilic graphs. To improve the time complexity of our approach, we introduce a variant in which residual strengths are not learned but instead set heuristically, a choice that performs as well as the learnable version.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6b8b\u5dee\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5e73\u6ed1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u8282\u70b9\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u80fd\u9632\u6b62\u5d4c\u5165\u7684Dirichlet\u80fd\u91cf\u8d8b\u8fd1\u4e8e\u96f6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5f02\u914d\u56fe\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u5728\u6df1\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u5bb9\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5e73\u6ed1\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e14\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u8282\u70b9\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u5f3a\u5ea6\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u662f\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6b8b\u5dee\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u8282\u70b9\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u9632\u6b62\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5e73\u6ed1\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u8bbe\u7f6e\u6b8b\u5dee\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u53d8\u4f53\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u5d4c\u5165\u7684Dirichlet\u80fd\u91cf\u6709\u754c\u4e14\u8fdc\u79bb\u96f6\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u5f02\u914d\u56fe\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u53d8\u4f53\u4e0e\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7248\u672c\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6b8b\u5dee\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5e73\u6ed1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u5f02\u914d\u56fe\u3002", "relevance": 65.0}}

However, most existing approaches treat these domains as independent tasks, overlooking their physiological interplay and shared imaging biomarkers. We propose an Explainable Cross-Disease Reasoning Framework that enables interpretable cardiopulmonary risk assessment from a single LDCT scan. The framework introduces an agentic reasoning process that emulates clinical diagnostic thinking-first perceiving pulmonary findings, then reasoning through established medical knowledge, and finally deriving a cardiovascular judgment with explanatory rationale. It integrates three synergistic components: a pulmonary perception module that summarizes lung abnormalities, a knowledge-guided reasoning module that infers their cardiovascular implications, and a cardiac representation module that encodes structural biomarkers. Their outputs are fused to produce a holistic cardiovascular risk prediction that is both accurate and physiologically grounded. Experiments on the NLST cohort demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance for CVD screening and mortality prediction, outperforming single-disease and purely image-based baselines. Beyond quantitative gains, the framework provides human-verifiable reasoning that aligns with cardiological understanding, revealing coherent links between pulmonary abnormalities and cardiac stress mechanisms.

The GPR model captures nonlinear dependencies among drilling parameters while quantifying predictive uncertainty, offering enhanced reliability for high-risk decision-making.

The benchmark covers 28 typical online fraud scenarios, spanning the full fraud lifecycle across both public and private domains. We further analyze key factors affecting fraud success, including interaction depth, activity level, and fine-grained collaboration failure modes. Finally, we propose a series of mitigation strategies, including adding content-level warnings to fraudulent posts and dialogues, using LLMs as monitors to block potentially malicious agents, and fostering group resilience through information sharing at the societal level.

We propose DIAL-GS, a novel dynamic instance-aware reconstruction method for label-free street scenes with 4D Gaussian Splatting. We first accurately identify dynamic instances by exploiting appearance-position inconsistency between warped rendering and actual observation. Guided by instance-level dynamic perception, we employ instance-aware 4D Gaussians as the unified volumetric representation, realizing dynamic-adaptive and instance-aware reconstruction.

However, the effectiveness of traditional GNNs degrades on heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes often belong to different labels or properties. While recent work has introduced mechanisms to improve GNN performance under heterophily, certain key limitations still exist. Most existing models apply a fixed aggregation depth across all nodes, overlooking the fact that nodes may require different propagation depths based on their local homophily levels and neighborhood structures. Moreover, many methods are tailored to either homophilic or heterophilic settings, lacking the flexibility to generalize across both regimes. To address these challenges, we develop a theoretical framework that links local structural and label characteristics to information propagation dynamics at the node level. Our analysis shows that optimal aggregation depth varies across nodes and is critical for preserving class-discriminative information. Guided by this insight, we propose a novel adaptive-depth GNN architecture that dynamically selects node-specific aggregation depths using theoretically grounded metrics. Our method seamlessly adapts to both homophilic and heterophilic patterns within a unified model.

Existing methods typically treat anomaly detection and classification as separate tasks, thereby neglecting their inherent correlation, limiting information sharing, and resulting in suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose UniADC, a unified anomaly detection and classification model that can effectively perform both tasks with only a few or even no anomaly images. Specifically, UniADC consists of two key components: a training-free controllable inpainting network and a multi-task discriminator. The inpainting network can synthesize anomaly images of specific categories by repainting normal regions guided by anomaly priors, and can also repaint few-shot anomaly samples to augment the available anomaly data. The multi-task discriminator is then trained on these synthesized samples, enabling precise anomaly detection and classification by aligning fine-grained image features with anomaly-category embeddings. We conduct extensive experiments on three anomaly detection and classification datasets, including MVTec-FS, MTD, and WFDD, and the results demonstrate that UniADC consistently outperforms existing methods in anomaly detection, localization, and classification.

A key challenge, however, is that real-world measurements are often corrupted by noise, which severely degrades the performance of data-driven models. Particularly, in chaotic dynamical systems, where small errors amplify rapidly, it is challenging to identify a data-driven model from noisy data that achieves short-term accuracy while preserving long-term invariant properties. In this paper, we propose the use of the weak formulation as a complementary approach to the classical strong formulation of data-driven time-series forecasting models. Specifically, we focus on the neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) architecture. Unlike the standard strong formulation, which relies on the discretization of the NODE followed by optimization, the weak formulation constrains the model using a set of integrated residuals over temporal subdomains. While such a formulation yields an effective NODE model, we discover that the performance of a NODE can be further enhanced by employing this weak formulation as a penalty alongside the classical strong formulation-based learning. Through numerical demonstrations, we illustrate that our proposed training strategy, which we coined as the Weak-Penalty NODE (WP-NODE), achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy and exceptional robustness across benchmark chaotic dynamical systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5f31\u60e9\u7f5a\u795e\u7ecf\u5e38\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08WP-NODE\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u5f31\u516c\u5f0f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u60e9\u7f5a\u9879\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u5f3a\u516c\u5f0f\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u6df7\u6c8c\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u901a\u5e38\u88ab\u566a\u58f0\u6c61\u67d3\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u4e25\u91cd\u964d\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6df7\u6c8c\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c0f\u8bef\u5dee\u4f1a\u8fc5\u901f\u653e\u5927\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u77ed\u671f\u7cbe\u5ea6\u53c8\u80fd\u4fdd\u7559\u957f\u671f\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5f31\u60e9\u7f5a\u795e\u7ecf\u5e38\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08WP-NODE\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u5f31\u516c\u5f0f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f3a\u516c\u5f0f\u7684\u8865\u5145\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b2\uff09\u5f31\u516c\u5f0f\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u5b50\u57df\u4e0a\u7684\u79ef\u5206\u6b8b\u5dee\u7ea6\u675f\u6a21\u578b\uff1b3\uff09\u5c06\u5f31\u516c\u5f0f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u60e9\u7f5a\u9879\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u5f3a\u516c\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6f14\u793a\u8868\u660e\uff0cWP-NODE\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6df7\u6c8c\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f31\u60e9\u7f5aNODE\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5f31\u516c\u5f0f\u548c\u5f3a\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u6df7\u6c8c\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "relevance": 40.0}}

While recent approaches leverage a limited amount of labeled target-domain data to improve performance, the severe imbalance between abundant source data and scarce target data remains a critical challenge for effective representation learning. We present the first frequency-space perspective to analyze this issue and identify two key challenges: (1) models are easily biased toward source-specific knowledge encoded in the low-frequency components of source data, and (2) the sparsity of target data hinders the learning of high-frequency, domain-generalizable features. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{FreqGRL}, a novel CD-FSL framework that mitigates the impact of data imbalance in the frequency space. Specifically, we introduce a Low-Frequency Replacement (LFR) module that substitutes the low-frequency components of source tasks with those from the target domain to create new source tasks that better align with target characteristics, thus reducing source-specific biases and promoting generalizable representation learning. We further design a High-Frequency Enhancement (HFE) module that filters out low-frequency components and performs learning directly on high-frequency features in the frequency space to improve cross-domain generalization. Additionally, a Global Frequency Filter (GFF) is incorporated to suppress noisy or irrelevant frequencies and emphasize informative ones, mitigating overfitting risks under limited target supervision.

This paper introduces the Encapsulation-Forging (EnFo) framework, a novel approach to generate rival synthetic data with asymmetric utility. EnFo operates in two stages: it first encapsulates predictive knowledge from the original data into a designated ``key'' model, and then forges a synthetic dataset by optimizing the data to intentionally overfit this key model. This process transforms non-rival data into a rival product, ensuring its value is accessible only to the intended model, thereby preventing unauthorized use and preserving the data owner's competitive edge.

Analysis identified three themes: person-centered contextualization responsive to momentary needs, explicit boundaries around scope and offline referral, and dialogic scaffolding for reflection and autonomy. We mapped these themes to persuasive design features for task suggestions, social facilitation, and system trustworthiness, and created corresponding dialogue extracts to guide LLM fine-tuning. Our findings demonstrate how lived experience can be operationalized to inform design features in LLMs, which can enhance the alignment of LLM-based interventions with the realities of youth and their communities, contributing to more effectively personalized digital well-being tools.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u4e0e\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5982\u4f55\u57fa\u4e8e\u9752\u5c11\u5e74\u751f\u6d3b\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6765\u4e2a\u6027\u5316LLMs\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e3b\u9898\u548c\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u8bf4\u670d\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5728\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u652f\u6301\u4e2d\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u9752\u5c11\u5e74\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u751f\u6d3b\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5bf9\u5176\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u8d34\u8fd1\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53c2\u4e0e\u5f0f\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e0e\u9752\u5c11\u5e74\u3001\u5bb6\u957f\u548c\u9752\u5c11\u5e74\u62a4\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005(N=38)\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5171\u521b\u7684\u9752\u5e74\u89d2\u8272\u4f5c\u4e3a\u652f\u67b6\uff0c\u6536\u96c6\u793e\u533a\u5bf9LLM\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u652f\u6301\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u9898\uff1a\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u5373\u65f6\u9700\u6c42\u54cd\u5e94\u3001\u660e\u786e\u754c\u5b9a\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u7ebf\u4e0b\u8f6c\u8bca\u8fb9\u754c\u3001\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0f\u53cd\u601d\u548c\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u652f\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u8bf4\u670d\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u751f\u6d3b\u7ecf\u9a8c\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u5316\u4e3aLLMs\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u5e72\u9884\u4e0e\u9752\u5c11\u5e74\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6570\u5b57\u5065\u5eb7\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "relevance": 65.0}}

Recent advanced methods leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and contrastive learning to characterize the spatial structure of road segments in a self-supervised paradigm. However, spatial heterogeneity and temporal dynamics of road networks raise severe challenges to the neighborhood smoothing mechanism of self-supervised GNNs. To address these issues, we propose a $\\textbf{D}$ual-branch $\\textbf{S}$patial-$\\textbf{T}$emporal self-supervised representation framework for enhanced road representations, termed as DST. On one hand, DST designs a mix-hop transition matrix for graph convolution to incorporate dynamic relations of roads from trajectories. Besides, DST contrasts road representations of the vanilla road network against that of the hypergraph in a spatial self-supervised way. The hypergraph is newly built based on three types of hyperedges to capture long-range relations. On the other hand, DST performs next token prediction as the temporal self-supervised task on the sequences of traffic dynamics based on a causal Transformer, which is further regularized by differentiating traffic modes of weekdays from those of weekends. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art methods verify the superiority of our proposed framework. Moreover, the comprehensive spatiotemporal modeling facilitates DST to excel in zero-shot learning scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DST\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u65f6\u7a7a\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u9053\u8def\u7f51\u7edc\u8868\u793a\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u652f\uff08\u6df7\u5408\u8df3\u8f6c\u56fe\u5377\u79ef\u548c\u8d85\u56fe\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff09\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u652f\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u56e0\u679cTransformer\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee4\u724c\u9884\u6d4b\uff09\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u9053\u8def\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u9053\u8def\u7f51\u7edc\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u9762\u4e34\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u90bb\u57df\u5e73\u6ed1\u673a\u5236\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u540c\u65f6\u5efa\u6a21\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "method": "1. \u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u652f\uff1a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6df7\u5408\u8df3\u8f6c\u8f6c\u79fb\u77e9\u9635\u8fdb\u884c\u56fe\u5377\u79ef\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e09\u79cd\u8d85\u8fb9\u7684\u8d85\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b2. \u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u652f\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u56e0\u679cTransformer\u8fdb\u884c\u4ea4\u901a\u52a8\u6001\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee4\u724c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u533a\u5206\u5de5\u4f5c\u65e5\u548c\u5468\u672b\u4ea4\u901a\u6a21\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7efc\u5408\u65f6\u7a7a\u5efa\u6a21\u4f7fDST\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "DST\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u65f6\u7a7a\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u7f51\u7edc\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "relevance": 30.0}}

One promising approach to address this issue is the watermark technique, which embeds subtle statistical signals into LLM-generated text to enable reliable identification. In this paper, we first generalize the likelihood-based LLM detection method of a previous study by introducing a flexible weighted formulation, and further adapt this approach to the inverse transform sampling method. Moving beyond watermark detection, we extend this adaptive detection strategy to tackle the more challenging problem of segmenting a given text into watermarked and non-watermarked substrings.

However, these models often treat text as flat sequences, limiting their ability to handle complex, compositional, and long-form descriptions. In particular, they fail to capture two essential properties of language: semantic hierarchy, which reflects the multi-level compositional structure of text, and semantic monotonicity, where richer descriptions should result in stronger alignment with visual content.To address these limitations, we propose HiMo-CLIP, a representation-level framework that enhances CLIP-style models without modifying the encoder architecture. HiMo-CLIP introduces two key components: a hierarchical decomposition (HiDe) module that extracts latent semantic components from long-form text via in-batch PCA, enabling flexible, batch-aware alignment across different semantic granularities, and a monotonicity-aware contrastive loss (MoLo) that jointly aligns global and component-level representations, encouraging the model to internalize semantic ordering and alignment strength as a function of textual completeness.These components work in concert to produce structured, cognitively-aligned cross-modal representations. Experiments on multiple image-text retrieval benchmarks show that HiMo-CLIP consistently outperforms strong baselines, particularly under long or compositional descriptions.

Yet, this task remains highly challenging due to the scarcity and heterogeneity of data across different buildings, climate zones, and seasonal patterns. In particular, buildings situated in distinct climatic regions introduce variability that often leads existing methods to overfit to spurious correlations, rely heavily on expert intervention, or compromise on data diversity. To address these limitations, we propose CaberNet, a causal and interpretable deep sequence model that learns invariant (Markov blanket) representations for robust cross-domain prediction. In a purely data-driven fashion and without requiring any prior knowledge, CaberNet integrates i) a global feature gate trained with a self-supervised Bernoulli regularization to distinguish superior causal features from inferior ones, and ii) a domain-wise training scheme that balances domain contributions, minimizes cross-domain loss variance, and promotes latent factor independence. We evaluate CaberNet on real-world datasets collected from three buildings located in three climatically diverse cities, and it consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving a 22.9\\% reduction in normalized mean squared error (NMSE) compared to the best benchmark.

The subtle distinguishing patterns, handling new species and the inherent open-set nature make the problem even harder. To address these complexities, foundation models trained on labeled, large-scale and multi-species animal Re-ID datasets have recently been introduced to enable zero-shot Re-ID. However, our benchmarking reveals significant gaps in their zero-shot Re-ID performance for both known and unknown species. While this highlights the need for collecting labeled data in new domains, exhaustive annotation for Re-ID is laborious and requires domain expertise. Our analyses show that existing unsupervised (USL) and AL Re-ID methods underperform for animal Re-ID. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel AL Re-ID framework that leverages complementary clustering methods to uncover and target structurally ambiguous regions in the embedding space for mining pairs of samples that are both informative and broadly representative. Oracle feedback on these pairs, in the form of must-link and cannot-link constraints, facilitates a simple annotation interface, which naturally integrates with existing USL methods through our proposed constrained clustering refinement algorithm. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that, by utilizing only 0.033% of all annotations, our approach consistently outperforms existing foundational, USL and AL baselines. Specifically, we report an average improvement of 10.49%, 11.19% and 3.99% (mAP) on 13 wildlife datasets over foundational, USL and AL methods, respectively, while attaining state-of-the-art performance on each dataset.

While transfer learning has been extensively studied in traditional classification, transfer learning in imbalanced classification such as Neyman-Pearson classification has received much less attention. This setting poses unique challenges, as both types of errors must be simultaneously controlled.

Quantifying these differences is critical to understanding if the quality of the legal information obtained by users of LLM-based chatbots varies depending on their location. However, obtaining meaningful comparative metrics is challenging because legal institutions in different places are not themselves easily comparable. In this work we propose a methodology to obtain place-to-place metrics based on the comparative law concept of functionalism. We construct a dataset of factual scenarios drawn from Reddit posts by users seeking legal advice for family, housing, employment, crime and traffic issues. We use these to elicit a summary of a law from the LLM relevant to each scenario in Los Angeles, London and Sydney. These summaries, typically of a legislative provision, are manually evaluated for hallucinations. We show that the rate of hallucination of legal information by leading closed-source LLMs is significantly associated with place. This suggests that the quality of legal solutions provided by these models is not evenly distributed across geography. Additionally, we show a strong negative correlation between hallucination rate and the frequency of the majority response when the LLM is sampled multiple times, suggesting a measure of uncertainty of model predictions of legal facts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6bd4\u8f83\u6cd5\u5b66\u529f\u80fd\u4e3b\u4e49\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5730\u7406\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u6cd5\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9886\u5148\u95ed\u6e90LLMs\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4fe1\u606f\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\u4e0e\u5730\u7406\u4f4d\u7f6e\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3LLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4fe1\u606f\u8d28\u91cf\u662f\u5426\u56e0\u7528\u6237\u4f4d\u7f6e\u800c\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u5730\u533a\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5236\u5ea6\u672c\u8eab\u96be\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6bd4\u8f83\u6cd5\u5b66\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u4e3b\u4e49\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4eceReddit\u7528\u6237\u5bfb\u6c42\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5efa\u8bae\u7684\u5e16\u5b50\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5728\u6d1b\u6749\u77f6\u3001\u4f26\u6566\u548c\u6089\u5c3c\u6d4b\u8bd5LLMs\u751f\u6210\u76f8\u5173\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u5e76\u624b\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u9886\u5148\u95ed\u6e90LLMs\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4fe1\u606f\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\u4e0e\u5730\u7406\u4f4d\u7f6e\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e14\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\u4e0e\u591a\u6570\u54cd\u5e94\u9891\u7387\u5448\u5f3a\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\u5728\u5730\u7406\u4e0a\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5747\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u7528\u6237\u83b7\u53d6\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "relevance": 75.0}}

To facilitate this task, we first present the Multimodal Multi-disease Medical Diagnosis Segmentation (M3DS) dataset, containing diverse multimodal multi-disease medical images paired with their corresponding segmentation masks and diagnosis chain-of-thought, created via an automated diagnosis chain-of-thought generation pipeline. Moreover, we propose Sim4Seg, a novel framework that improves the performance of diagnosis segmentation by taking advantage of the Region-Aware Vision-Language Similarity to Mask (RVLS2M) module.

Although churn prediction and demand forecasting have been widely studied in B2B contexts, the use of machine learning to guide asset allocation remains relatively unexplored. This paper presents a framework focused on predicting which beverage clients are most likely to deliver strong returns in volume after receiving a cooler. Using a private dataset from a well-known Central American brewing and beverage company of 3,119 B2B traditional trade channel clients that received a cooler from 2022-01 to 2024-07, and tracking 12 months of sales transactions before and after cooler installation, three growth thresholds were defined: 10%, 30% and 50% growth in sales volume year over year. The analysis compares results of machine learning models such as XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost combined with SHAP for interpretable feature analysis in order to have insights into improving business operations related to cooler allocation; the results show that the best model has AUC scores of 0.857, 0.877, and 0.898 across the thresholds on the validation set.

From a single RGB-D image, our method (1) prompts a large vision-language model to generate a goal image where a straight rod \"impales\" the object, representing an antipodal grasp, (2) predicts depth and segmentation to lift this generated image into 3D, and (3) aligns generated and observed object point clouds via principal component analysis and correspondence-free optimization to recover an executable grasp pose. Unlike prior work, our approach is training-free and does not rely on curated grasp datasets. Despite this, VLAD-Grasp achieves performance that is competitive with or superior to that of state-of-the-art supervised models on the Cornell and Jacquard datasets. We further demonstrate zero-shot generalization to novel real-world objects on a Franka Research 3 robot, highlighting vision-language foundation models as powerful priors for robotic manipulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "VLAD-Grasp\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6293\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6293\u53d6\u76ee\u6807\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7684\u6293\u53d6\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6293\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6765\u5904\u7406\u65b0\u7269\u4f53\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "method": "1) \u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7269\u4f53\u88ab\u76f4\u6746\u201c\u523a\u7a7f\u201d\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u56fe\u50cf\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u63e1\u6293\u53d6\uff1b2) \u9884\u6d4b\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u5206\u5272\u4ee5\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u63d0\u5347\u52303D\uff1b3) \u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u5206\u6790\u548c\u65e0\u5bf9\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u5bf9\u9f50\u751f\u6210\u548c\u89c2\u6d4b\u70b9\u4e91\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u6293\u53d6\u59ff\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u5728Cornell\u548cJacquard\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cVLAD-Grasp\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Franka Research 3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6293\u53d6\u3002", "relevance": 35.0}}

Building on the success of Deepseek-R1, researchers extended multimodal reasoning to post-training paradigms based on reinforcement learning (RL), focusing predominantly on mathematical datasets. However, existing post-training paradigms tend to neglect two critical aspects: (1) The lack of quantifiable difficulty metrics capable of strategically screening samples for post-training optimization. (2) Suboptimal post-training paradigms that fail to jointly optimize perception and reasoning capabilities. To address this gap, we propose two novel difficulty-aware sampling strategies: Progressive Image Semantic Masking (PISM) quantifies sample hardness through systematic image degradation, while Cross-Modality Attention Balance (CMAB) assesses cross-modal interaction complexity via attention distribution analysis. Leveraging these metrics, we design a hierarchical training framework that incorporates both GRPO-only and SFT+GRPO hybrid training paradigms, and evaluate them across six benchmark datasets. Experiments demonstrate consistent superiority of GRPO applied to difficulty-stratified samples compared to conventional SFT+GRPO pipelines, indicating that strategic data sampling can obviate the need for supervised fine-tuning while improving model accuracy.

This limitation has driven the adoption of sensor fusion, among which camera-radar fusion stands out as a promising solution due to their complementary strengths.

In this paper, we propose REOcc, a novel camera-radar fusion network designed to enrich radar feature representations for 3D occupancy prediction. Our approach introduces two main components, a Radar Densifier and a Radar Amplifier, which refine radar features by integrating spatial and contextual information, effectively enhancing spatial density and quality. Extensive experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that REOcc achieves significant performance gains over the camera-only baseline model, particularly in dynamic object classes.

Existing models either rely on pharmacologic knowledge graphs (KGs), which fail on unseen drugs, or on electronic health records (EHRs), which are noisy, temporal, and site-dependent. We introduce, to our knowledge, the first system that conditions KG relation scoring on patient-level EHR context and distills that reasoning into an EHR-only model for zero-shot inference. A fusion \"Teacher\" learns mechanism-specific relations for drug pairs represented in both sources, while a distilled \"Student\" generalizes to new or rarely used drugs without KG access at inference. Both operate under a shared ontology (set) of pharmacologic mechanisms (drug relations) to produce interpretable, auditable alerts rather than opaque risk scores. Trained on a multi-institution EHR corpus paired with a curated DrugBank DDI graph, and evaluated using a clinically aligned, decision-focused protocol with leakage-safe negatives that avoid artificially easy pairs, the system maintains precision across multi-institutuion test data, produces mechanism-specific, clinically consistent predictions, reduces false alerts (higher precision) at comparable overall detection performance (F1), and misses fewer true interactions compared to prior methods. Case studies further show zero-shot identification of clinically recognized CYP-mediated and pharmacodynamic mechanisms for drugs absent from the KG, supporting real-world use in clinical decision support and pharmacovigilance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u548c\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6559\u5e08-\u5b66\u751f\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u836f\u7269\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u836f\u7269\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u836f\u7269\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff08\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u672a\u89c1\u836f\u7269\uff09\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\uff08\u566a\u58f0\u5927\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u5f3a\uff09\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u4f18\u52bf\u5e76\u80fd\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u65b0\u836f\u7269\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6559\u5e08-\u5b66\u751f\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u878d\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u548c\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u7279\u5b9a\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u8fdb\u884c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5171\u4eab\u836f\u7406\u5b66\u673a\u5236\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8b66\u62a5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u673a\u6784\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u673a\u5236\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u62a5\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u603b\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4e2d\u672a\u89c1\u836f\u7269\u7684CYP\u4ecb\u5bfc\u548c\u836f\u6548\u5b66\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u652f\u6301\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u548c\u836f\u7269\u8b66\u6212\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bc6\u522b\u672a\u89c1\u836f\u7269\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u8ba4\u53ef\u673a\u5236\u3002", "relevance": 45.0}}

In contrast, simpler LLM applications, such as customer service chatbots, are widespread on the web, yet their security posture and exposure to such attacks remain poorly understood. These applications often rely on third-party chatbot plugins that act as intermediaries to commercial LLM APIs, offering non-expert website builders intuitive ways to customize chatbot behaviors. To bridge this gap, we present the first large-scale study of 17 third-party chatbot plugins used by over 10,000 public websites, uncovering previously unknown prompt injection risks in practice. First, 8 of these plugins (used by 8,000 websites) fail to enforce the integrity of the conversation history transmitted in network requests between the website visitor and the chatbot. This oversight amplifies the impact of direct prompt injection attacks by allowing adversaries to forge conversation histories (including fake system messages), boosting their ability to elicit unintended behavior (e.g., code generation) by 3 to 8x. Second, 15 plugins offer tools, such as web-scraping, to enrich the chatbot's context with website-specific content. However, these tools do not distinguish the website's trusted content (e.g., product descriptions) from untrusted, third-party content (e.g., customer reviews), introducing a risk of indirect prompt injection. Notably, we found that ~13% of e-commerce websites have already exposed their chatbots to third-party content. We systematically evaluate both vulnerabilities through controlled experiments grounded in real-world observations, focusing on factors such as system prompt design and the underlying LLM. Our findings show that many plugins adopt insecure practices that undermine the built-in LLM safeguards.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u6790\u4e8617\u4e2a\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63d2\u4ef6\u572810,000\u591a\u4e2a\u7f51\u7ad9\u4e2d\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u98ce\u9669\uff1a\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5386\u53f2\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u6f0f\u6d1e\u548c\u95f4\u63a5\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5148\u8fdbLLM\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u7b80\u5355LLM\u5e94\u7528\uff08\u5982\u5ba2\u670d\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff09\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u72b6\u51b5\u5374\u9c9c\u4e3a\u4eba\u77e5\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5e94\u7528\u4f9d\u8d56\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u63d2\u4ef6\u4e0e\u5546\u4e1aLLM API\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u5bf917\u4e2a\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63d2\u4ef6\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u7f51\u7edc\u8bf7\u6c42\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5386\u53f2\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e30\u5bcc\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53d7\u63a7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6f0f\u6d1e\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b08\u4e2a\u63d2\u4ef6\uff08\u6d89\u53ca8,000\u4e2a\u7f51\u7ad9\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5386\u53f2\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f2a\u9020\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d88\u606f\uff0c\u4f7f\u610f\u5916\u884c\u4e3a\u89e6\u53d1\u7387\u63d0\u9ad83-8\u500d\uff1b15\u4e2a\u63d2\u4ef6\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5de5\u5177\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u53ef\u4fe1\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u4fe1\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u7ea613%\u7684\u7535\u5546\u7f51\u7ad9\u5df2\u66b4\u9732\u4e8e\u95f4\u63a5\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bb8\u591a\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63d2\u4ef6\u91c7\u7528\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u524a\u5f31\u4e86LLM\u5185\u7f6e\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u63d2\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u52a0\u5f3a\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u62a4\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

To address these issues, we propose Flexible Concept Bottleneck Model (FCBM), which supports dynamic concept adaptation, including complete replacement of the original concept set. Specifically, we design a hypernetwork that generates prediction weights based on concept embeddings, allowing seamless integration of new concepts without retraining the entire model. In addition, we introduce a modified sparsemax module with a learnable temperature parameter that dynamically selects the most relevant concepts, enabling the model to focus on the most informative features. Extensive experiments on five public benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art baselines with a similar number of effective concepts.

Shengpu Tang and Wei Jin contributed equally as senior authors", "summary": "Accurate predictions of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD) can enable effective personalized therapy. While cognitive tests and clinical data are routinely collected, they lack the predictive power of PET scans and CSF biomarker analysis, which are prohibitively expensive to obtain for every patient. To address this cost-accuracy dilemma, we design a two-stage machine learning framework that selectively obtains advanced, costly features based on their predicted \"value of information\". We apply our framework to predict AD progression for MCI patients using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our framework reduces the need for advanced testing by 20% while achieving a test AUROC of 0.929, comparable to the model that uses both basic and advanced features (AUROC=0.915, p=0.1010).

Within this paradigm, federated learning (FL) serves as a key enabler that allows distributed LLM agents to co-train global models without centralizing data. However, the FL-enabled IoA system remains vulnerable to model poisoning attacks, and the prevailing distance and similarity-based defenses become fragile at billion-parameter scale and under heterogeneous data distributions. This paper proposes a graph representation-based model poisoning (GRMP) attack, which passively exploits observed benign local models to construct a parameter correlation graph and extends an adversarial variational graph autoencoder to capture and reshape higher-order dependencies. The GRMP attack synthesizes malicious local models that preserve benign-like statistics while embedding adversarial objectives, remaining elusive to detection at the server. Experiments demonstrate a gradual drop in system accuracy under the proposed attack and the ineffectiveness of the prevailing defense mechanism in detecting the attack, underscoring a severe threat to the ambitious IoA paradigm.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb(GRMP)\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u53c2\u6570\u76f8\u5173\u56fe\u6765\u5408\u6210\u96be\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6076\u610f\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4f7f\u80fd\u7684\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u6613\u53d7\u6a21\u578b\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5341\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u53d8\u5f97\u8106\u5f31\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u826f\u6027\u672c\u5730\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u53c2\u6570\u76f8\u5173\u56fe\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u53d8\u5206\u56fe\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6355\u83b7\u548c\u91cd\u5851\u9ad8\u9636\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u5177\u6709\u826f\u6027\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81\u4f46\u5d4c\u5165\u5bf9\u6297\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u6076\u610f\u672c\u5730\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5728GRMP\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9010\u6e10\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u8be5\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "conclusion": "GRMP\u653b\u51fb\u5bf9\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8303\u5f0f\u6784\u6210\u4e25\u91cd\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

However, existing methods typically suffer from at least one of the following limitations, hindering their practical deployment: (1) lack of visual realism in generated anomalies; (2) dependence on large amounts of real images; and (3) use of memory-intensive, heavyweight model architectures. To overcome these limitations, we propose AnoStyler, a lightweight yet effective method that frames zero-shot anomaly generation as text-guided style transfer. Given a single normal image along with its category label and expected defect type, an anomaly mask indicating the localized anomaly regions and two-class text prompts representing the normal and anomaly states are generated using generalizable category-agnostic procedures. A lightweight U-Net model trained with CLIP-based loss functions is used to stylize the normal image into a visually realistic anomaly image, where anomalies are localized by the anomaly mask and semantically aligned with the text prompts. Extensive experiments on the MVTec-AD and VisA datasets show that AnoStyler outperforms existing anomaly generation methods in generating high-quality and diverse anomaly images.

However, we observe a \\textit{\\textbf{scaling paradox}} in TS models, revealing a puzzling phenomenon that larger models do \\emph{NOT} achieve better performance. Through extensive experiments on two model families across four scales (100M to 1.7B parameters) and diverse data (up to 6B observations), we rigorously confirm that the scaling paradox is a pervasive issue. We then diagnose its root cause by analyzing internal representations, identifying a phenomenon we call \\textit{few-layer dominance}: only a small subset of layers are functionally important, while the majority are redundant, under-utilized, and can even distract training.

Although this decoupling strategy simplifies the learning process, it inherently ignores the geometric collaborative constraints between different attributes, resulting in the lack of geometric consistency prior, thereby leading to suboptimal performance. To address this issue, we propose novel Spatial-Projection Alignment (SPAN) with two pivotal components: (i). Spatial Point Alignment enforces an explicit global spatial constraint between the predicted and ground-truth 3D bounding boxes, thereby rectifying spatial drift caused by decoupled attribute regression. (ii). 3D-2D Projection Alignment ensures that the projected 3D box is aligned tightly within its corresponding 2D detection bounding box on the image plane, mitigating projection misalignment overlooked in previous works. To ensure training stability, we further introduce a Hierarchical Task Learning strategy that progressively incorporates spatial-projection alignment as 3D attribute predictions refine, preventing early stage error propagation across attributes.

We introduce CLaP (Causal Layerwise Peeling), a framework that separates causal signal from context in a layerwise manner and integrates diverse graph representations of molecules. At each layer, a causal block performs a soft split into causal and non-causal branches, fuses causal evidence across modalities, and progressively removes batch-coupled context to focus on label-relevant structure, thereby limiting shortcut signals and stabilizing layerwise refinement. Across four molecular benchmarks, CLaP consistently improves MAE, MSE, and $R^2$ over competitive baselines. The model also produces atom-level causal saliency maps that highlight substructures responsible for predictions, providing actionable guidance for targeted molecular edits.

However, existing methods often struggle to utilize spatial information effectively due to misalignment in tissue slices. To overcome this challenge, we leverage keypoints as robust indicators of spatial correspondence, enabling more precise alignment and integration of structural details in synthesized IHC images. We introduce K-Stain, a novel framework that employs keypoint-based spatial and semantic relationships to enhance synthesized IHC image fidelity. K-Stain comprises three main components: (1) a Hierarchical Spatial Keypoint Detector (HSKD) for identifying keypoints in stain images, (2) a Keypoint-aware Enhancement Generator (KEG) that integrates these keypoints during image generation, and (3) a Keypoint Guided Discriminator (KGD) that improves the discriminator's sensitivity to spatial details.

In this work, we extend self-evaluation techniques to multi-step tasks, testing two intuitive approaches: holistic scoring and step-by-step scoring. Using two multi-step benchmark datasets, we show that stepwise evaluation generally outperforms holistic scoring in detecting potential errors, with up to 15% relative increase in AUC-ROC.

Conventional parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, such as Adapters and LoRA, typically break symmetry, making them incompatible with those equivariant architectures. ELoRA, recently proposed, is the first equivariant PEFT method. It achieves improved parameter efficiency and performance on many benchmarks. However, the relatively high degrees of freedom it retains within each tensor order can still perturb pretrained feature distributions and ultimately degrade performance. To address this, we present Magnitude-Modulated Equivariant Adapter (MMEA), a novel equivariant fine-tuning method which employs lightweight scalar gating to modulate feature magnitudes on a per-order and per-multiplicity basis. We demonstrate that MMEA preserves strict equivariance and, across multiple benchmarks, consistently improves energy and force predictions to state-of-the-art levels while training fewer parameters than competing approaches. These results suggest that, in many practical scenarios, modulating channel magnitudes is sufficient to adapt equivariant models to new chemical environments without breaking symmetry, pointing toward a new paradigm for equivariant PEFT design.", "AI": {"tldr": "MMEA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u7b49\u53d8\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6807\u91cf\u95e8\u63a7\u5728\u6bcf\u9636\u548c\u6bcf\u591a\u91cd\u6027\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u8c03\u5236\u7279\u5f81\u5e45\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e25\u683c\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u529b\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7b49\u53d8\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u867d\u7136\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u4f46\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u5fae\u8c03\u3002\u4f20\u7edfPEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u800cELoRA\u867d\u7136\u4fdd\u6301\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u4f46\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f1a\u6270\u52a8\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u53c8\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMMEA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6807\u91cf\u95e8\u63a7\u5728\u6bcf\u9636\u548c\u6bcf\u591a\u91cd\u6027\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u8c03\u5236\u7279\u5f81\u5e45\u5ea6\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u50cfELoRA\u90a3\u6837\u8fdb\u884c\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u5f20\u91cf\u53d8\u6362\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282\u901a\u9053\u5e45\u5ea6\u6765\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u5316\u5b66\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e25\u683c\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMMEA\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u5c06\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u529b\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u5347\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u6bd4\u7ade\u4e89\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5c11\u3002\u5b83\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u8c03\u5236\u901a\u9053\u5e45\u5ea6\u8db3\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7b49\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u5316\u5b66\u73af\u5883\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u7834\u574f\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7b49\u53d8PEFT\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6307\u660e\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "relevance": 35.0}}

However, most existing methods compress images into 2-D latent spaces via convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or Swin Transformers, which tend to retain substantial spatial redundancy, thereby limiting overall compression performance. In this paper, we propose a novel Mixed RWKV-Transformer (MRT) architecture that encodes images into more compact 1-D latent representations by synergistically integrating the complementary strengths of linear-attention-based RWKV and self-attention-based Transformer models. Specifically, MRT partitions each image into fixed-size windows, utilizing RWKV modules to capture global dependencies across windows and Transformer blocks to model local redundancies within each window. The hierarchical attention mechanism enables more efficient and compact representation learning in the 1-D domain. To further enhance compression efficiency, we introduce a dedicated RWKV Compression Model (RCM) tailored to the structure characteristics of the intermediate 1-D latent features in MRT. Extensive experiments on standard image compression benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach.

SCARE comprises three core components: (1) Sequence Lens Projector (SLP) that logarithmically compresses time-series data while preserving boundary information across bins, (2) Efficient Bitwise Attention (EBA) module that replaces costly multiplications with bitwise operations via binary hash codes, and (3) Hash optimization strategy that ensures stable training without auxiliary loss terms. Together, these components minimize computational overhead while maintaining high accuracy and compatibility with microcontroller units (MCUs).

Since sub-synchronous control interactions (SSCI) arise from the mis-tuning of control gains under specific grid configurations, effective mitigation strategies require adaptive re-tuning of these gains. Such adaptiveness can be achieved by employing a closed-loop, learning-based framework that considers the grid conditions responsible for such sub-synchronous oscillations. This paper addresses this need by adopting methodologies inspired by Markov decision process (MDP) based reinforcement learning (RL), with a particular emphasis on simpler deep policy gradient methods with additional SSCI-specific signal processing modules such as down-sampling, bandpass filtering, and oscillation energy dependent reward computations. Our experimentation in a real-world event setting demonstrates that the deep policy gradient based trained policy can adaptively compute gain settings in response to varying grid conditions and optimally suppress control interaction-induced oscillations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53ef\u8c03\u63a7\u5236\u589e\u76ca\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528EMT\u5728\u73af\u4eff\u771f\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u6b21\u540c\u6b65\u632f\u8361\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u63a7\u5236\u589e\u76ca\u4ee5\u6291\u5236\u6b21\u540c\u6b65\u63a7\u5236\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u632f\u8361\u3002", "motivation": "\u6b21\u540c\u6b65\u63a7\u5236\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528(SSCI)\u6e90\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u7535\u7f51\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u63a7\u5236\u589e\u76ca\u7684\u5931\u914d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cd\u65b0\u8c03\u6574\u8fd9\u4e9b\u589e\u76ca\u6765\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u7535\u7f51\u6761\u4ef6\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e13\u95e8\u7684SSCI\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u5e26\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u548c\u632f\u8361\u80fd\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u8ba1\u7b97\uff09\u3002\u4f7f\u7528EMT\u5728\u73af\u4eff\u771f\u6846\u67b6\uff08PSCAD\u4e0ePython\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\u63a5\u53e3\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u7535\u7f51\u6761\u4ef6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8ba1\u7b97\u589e\u76ca\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u6700\u4f18\u5730\u6291\u5236\u63a7\u5236\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u632f\u8361\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53ef\u8c03\u63a7\u5236\u589e\u76ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u6b21\u540c\u6b65\u632f\u8361\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u63a7\u5236\u589e\u76ca\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u7535\u7f51\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "relevance": 10.0}}

Despite extensive research on OOD detection in 2D images, direct transfer to 3D LiDAR point clouds has been proven ineffective. Current LiDAR OOD methods struggle to distinguish rare anomalies from common classes, leading to high false-positive rates and overconfident errors in safety-critical settings. We propose Relative Energy Learning (REL), a simple yet effective framework for OOD detection in LiDAR point clouds. REL leverages the energy gap between positive (in-distribution) and negative logits as a relative scoring function, mitigating calibration issues in raw energy values and improving robustness across various scenes. To address the absence of OOD samples during training, we propose a lightweight data synthesis strategy called Point Raise, which perturbs existing point clouds to generate auxiliary anomalies without altering the inlier semantics. Evaluated on SemanticKITTI and the Spotting the Unexpected (STU) benchmark, REL consistently outperforms existing methods by a large margin.

Kleinberg and Mullainathan [KM24] proved that generation is achievable in surprisingly general settings. But their generator suffers from ``mode collapse,'' producing from an ever-smaller subset of the target. To address this, Kleinberg and Wei [KW25] require the generator's output to be ``dense'' in the target language. They showed that generation with density, surprisingly, remains achievable at the same generality.\n  Both results assume perfect data: no noisy insertions and no omissions. This raises a central question: how much contamination can generation tolerate? Recent works made partial progress on this question by studying (non-dense) generation with either finite amounts of noise (but no omissions) or omissions (but no noise).\n  We characterize robustness under contaminated enumerations: 1. Generation under Contamination: Language generation in the limit is achievable for all countable collections iff the fraction of contaminated examples converges to zero. When this fails, we characterize which collections are generable. 2. Dense Generation under Contamination: Dense generation is strictly less robust to contamination than generation. As a byproduct, we resolve an open question of Raman and Raman [ICML25] by showing that generation is possible with only membership oracle access under finitely many contaminated examples.\n  Finally, we introduce a beyond-worst-case model inspired by curriculum learning and prove that dense generation is achievable even with infinite contamination provided the fraction of contaminated examples converges to zero.

Existing methods struggle with stylized avatars due to the lack of diverse multi-style datasets and challenges in maintaining geometric consistency in non-standard textures. To address these limitations, AvatarTex introduces a novel three-stage diffusion-to-GAN pipeline. Our key insight is that while diffusion models excel at generating diversified textures, they lack explicit UV constraints, whereas GANs provide a well-structured latent space that ensures style and topology consistency. By integrating these strengths, AvatarTex achieves high-quality topology-aligned texture synthesis with both artistic and geometric coherence. Specifically, our three-stage pipeline first completes missing texture regions via diffusion-based inpainting, refines style and structure consistency using GAN-based latent optimization, and enhances fine details through diffusion-based repainting.

Specifically, we use a rank-1 LoRA to create a minimal parameter adapter for Qwen-2.5-32B-Instruct which recovers 73-90% of reasoning-benchmark performance compared to a full parameter finetune. We find that the activations of this LoRA are as interpretable as MLP neurons, and fire for reasoning-specific behaviors. Finally, we train a sparse autoencoder on the entire activation state of this LoRA and identify fine-grained and monosemantic features.

Most of these are diffusion models with unique computational characteristics, distinct from both traditional small-scale ML models and large language models. They are highly compute-bound and use an iterative denoising process to generate images, leading to very high inference time. This creates significant challenges in designing a high-throughput system. We discovered that a large fraction of prompts can be served using faster, approximated models. However, the approximation setting must be carefully calibrated for each prompt to avoid quality degradation. Designing a high-throughput system that assigns each prompt to the appropriate model and compatible approximation setting remains a challenging problem. We present Argus, a high-throughput T2I inference system that selects the right level of approximation for each prompt to maintain quality while meeting throughput targets on a fixed-size cluster. Argus intelligently switches between different approximation strategies to satisfy both throughput and quality requirements.

While existing solutions, such as residual connections and skip layers, alleviate this issue to some extent, they fail to explicitly model how node representations evolve in a node-specific and progressive manner across layers. Moreover, these methods do not take global information into account, which is also crucial for mitigating the over-smoothing problem. To address the aforementioned issues, in this work, we propose a Dual Mamba-enhanced Graph Convolutional Network (DMbaGCN), which is a novel framework that integrates Mamba into GNNs to address over-smoothing from both local and global perspectives.

Yet the exponential growth of the search space of expression renders the task computationally challenging. A promising yet underexplored direction for reducing the effective search space and accelerating training lies in symbolic equivalence: many expressions, although syntactically different, define the same function -- for example, $\\log(x_1^2x_2^3)$, $\\log(x_1^2)+\\log(x_2^3)$, and $2\\log(x_1)+3\\log(x_2)$. Existing algorithms treat such variants as distinct outputs, leading to redundant exploration and slow learning. We introduce EGG-SR, a unified framework that integrates equality graphs (e-graphs) into diverse symbolic regression algorithms, including Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), deep reinforcement learning (DRL), and large language models (LLMs). EGG-SR compactly represents equivalent expressions through the proposed EGG module, enabling more efficient learning by: (1) pruning redundant subtree exploration in EGG-MCTS, (2) aggregating rewards across equivalence classes in EGG-DRL, and (3) enriching feedback prompts in EGG-LLM. Under mild assumptions, we show that embedding e-graphs tightens the regret bound of MCTS and reduces the variance of the DRL gradient estimator. Empirically, EGG-SR consistently enhances multiple baselines across challenging benchmarks, discovering equations with lower normalized mean squared error than state-of-the-art methods.

Consequently, leveraging private data within organizations to enhance the performance of large models has emerged as a key challenge. The federated learning paradigm, combined with model fine-tuning techniques, effectively reduces the number of trainable parameters. However,the necessity to process high-dimensional feature spaces results in substantial overall computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose the Implicit Federated In-Context Learning (IFed-ICL) framework. IFed-ICL draws inspiration from federated learning to establish a novel distributed collaborative paradigm, by converting client local context examples into implicit vector representations, it enables distributed collaborative computation during the inference phase and injects model residual streams to enhance model performance. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves outstanding performance across multiple text classification tasks. Compared to traditional methods, IFed-ICL avoids the extensive parameter updates required by conventional fine-tuning methods while reducing data transmission and local computation at the client level in federated learning. This enables efficient distributed context learning using local private-domain data, significantly improving model performance on specific tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9690\u5f0f\u8054\u90a6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60(IFed-ICL)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u672c\u5730\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u793a\u4f8b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u9690\u5f0f\u5411\u91cf\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u534f\u4f5c\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f20\u7edf\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u548c\u672c\u5730\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u9762\u4e34\u67af\u7aed\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5185\u90e8\u79c1\u6709\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u6280\u672f\u867d\u7136\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4f46\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ecd\u5e26\u6765\u5de8\u5927\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "method": "IFed-ICL\u6846\u67b6\u4ece\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u83b7\u5f97\u7075\u611f\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u534f\u4f5c\u8303\u5f0f\uff1a\u5c06\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u672c\u5730\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u793a\u4f8b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u9690\u5f0f\u5411\u91cf\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u534f\u4f5c\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u6b8b\u5dee\u6d41\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u548c\u672c\u5730\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "conclusion": "IFed-ICL\u80fd\u591f\u5229\u7528\u672c\u5730\u79c1\u6709\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

However, without a global understanding of both subjects and background, recognizing actions in such samples remains challenging because of the background distractions. Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV), which learns interaction between various dimensions, shows promise for global modeling. While directly applying RWKV to wide-angle FSAR may fail to highlight subjects due to excessive background information. Additionally, temporal relation degraded by frames with similar backgrounds is difficult to reconstruct, further impacting performance. Therefore, we design the CompOund SegmenTation and Temporal REconstructing RWKV (Otter). Specifically, the Compound Segmentation Module~(CSM) is devised to segment and emphasize key patches in each frame, effectively highlighting subjects against background information. The Temporal Reconstruction Module (TRM) is incorporated into the temporal-enhanced prototype construction to enable bidirectional scanning, allowing better reconstruct temporal relation. Furthermore, a regular prototype is combined with the temporal-enhanced prototype to simultaneously enhance subject emphasis and temporal modeling, improving wide-angle FSAR performance. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as SSv2, Kinetics, UCF101, and HMDB51 demonstrate that Otter achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Phase I (Initializing) synthesizes diverse, high-coverage candidates using an ensemble of strong teachers. Phase II (DTA) rewrites teacher solutions to align intermediate steps and presentation style with the target student's inductive biases and then performs signal-aware exemplar selection via agreement checks and reflection-based judging. Instantiated on telecommunications mathematics (e.g., link budgets, SNR/AMC selection, and power-control feasibility), DTA yields state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy on TELEMATH without enabling explicit \"thinking\" modes: 72.45% pass@1, surpassing distilled-only training by +17.65 points and outperforming a strong baseline (Qwen3-32B with thinking enabled) by +2.94 points. Token-shift analyses indicate that DTA concentrates gains on logical-structural discourse markers rather than merely amplifying domain nouns, indicating improved reasoning scaffolding. Under edge-like inference settings, DTA improves efficiency by reducing reliance on multi-sample voting and disabling expensive reasoning heuristics, cutting energy per output token by ~42% versus Qwen3-32B (thinking mode enabled) and end-to-end latency by ~60% versus Qwen3-32B (thinking mode disabled). These results demonstrate that aligning how solutions are produced enables compact, high-yield supervision that is effective for both accuracy and efficiency, offering a practical recipe for domain adaptation in low-resource verticals beyond telecom.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u8f68\u8ff9\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08DTA\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u89e3\u9898\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5728\u7535\u4fe1\u6570\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u5b9e\u73b0SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u901a\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5782\u76f4\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u7535\u4fe1\uff09\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f4e\u4ee5\u53ca\u79fb\u52a8/\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u8d44\u6e90\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1aPhase I\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5019\u9009\u89e3\uff1bPhase II\u91cd\u5199\u6559\u5e08\u89e3\u4ee5\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\u548c\u5448\u73b0\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u548c\u53cd\u601d\u5f0f\u8bc4\u5224\u8fdb\u884c\u4fe1\u53f7\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "result": "\u5728TELEMATH\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523072.45% pass@1\uff0c\u6bd4\u84b8\u998f\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u534717.65\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u6bd4Qwen3-32B\uff08\u542f\u7528\u601d\u8003\u6a21\u5f0f\uff09\u63d0\u53472.94\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff1b\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u63a8\u7406\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea642%\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea660%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u9f50\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u5f0f\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7d27\u51d1\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u5782\u76f4\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

A common technique in VAE-based collaborative filtering (CF) consists in applying binary input masking to user interaction vectors, which improves performance but remains underexplored theoretically. In this work, we analyze how collaboration arises in VAE-based CF and show it is governed by latent proximity: we derive a latent sharing radius that informs when an SGD update on one user strictly reduces the loss on another user, with influence decaying as the latent Wasserstein distance increases. We further study the induced geometry: with clean inputs, VAE-based CF primarily exploits \\emph{local} collaboration between input-similar users and under-utilizes global collaboration between far-but-related users. We compare two mechanisms that encourage \\emph{global} mixing and characterize their trade-offs: (1) $\u03b2$-KL regularization directly tightens the information bottleneck, promoting posterior overlap but risking representational collapse if too large; (2) input masking induces stochastic geometric contractions and expansions, which can bring distant users onto the same latent neighborhood but also introduce neighborhood drift. To preserve user identity while enabling global consistency, we propose an anchor regularizer that aligns user posteriors with item embeddings, stabilizing users under masking and facilitating signal sharing across related items.

Recently, the integration of flow matching generative models into image restoration has garnered significant attention, owing to their powerful prior modeling capabilities. In this work, we incorporate such generative priors into a Plug-and-Play (PnP) framework based on proximal splitting, where the proximal operator associated with the regularizer is replaced by a time-dependent denoiser derived from the generative model. While existing PnP methods have achieved notable success in inverse problems with smooth squared $\\ell_2$ data fidelity--typically associated with Gaussian noise--their applicability to more general data fidelity terms remains underexplored. To address this, we propose a general and efficient PnP algorithm inspired by the primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) method.

Most existing methods rely heavily on long and continuous EEG recordings, which poses significant challenges for data acquisition in resource-constrained systems, such as wearable or home-based monitoring systems. In this paper, we propose the task of resource-efficient sleep staging, which aims to reduce the amount of signal collected per sleep epoch while maintaining reliable classification performance. To solve this task, we adopt the masking and prompt learning strategy and propose a novel framework called Mask-Aware Sleep Staging (MASS). Specifically, we design a multi-level masking strategy to promote effective feature modeling under partial and irregular observations. To mitigate the loss of contextual information introduced by masking, we further propose a hierarchical prompt learning mechanism that aggregates unmasked data into a global prompt, serving as a semantic anchor for guiding both patch-level and epoch-level feature modeling.

Parameter sharing, a form of structured compression, effectively reduces redundancy, but existing approaches remain heuristic-restricted to adjacent layers and lacking a systematic analysis for cross-layer sharing. However, extending sharing across multiple layers leads to an exponentially expanding configuration space, making exhaustive search computationally infeasible and forming a critical bottleneck for parameter sharing. We recast parameter sharing from a group-theoretic perspective as introducing structural symmetries in the model's parameter space. A sharing configuration can be described by a coloring function $\u03b1:L\\rightarrow C$ (L: layer indices and C: sharing classes), which determines inter-layer sharing groups while preserving structural symmetry. To determine the coloring function, we propose a second-order geometric criterion based on Taylor expansion and the Hessian spectrum. By projecting perturbations onto the Hessian's low-curvature eigensubspace, the criterion provides an analytic rule for selecting sharing groups that minimize performance impact, yielding a principled and scalable configuration procedure.

Existing traditional methods are based on hand-crafted features, which lack flexibility and rely entirely on fixed priors, while the scarcity of paired training data critically hampers deep learning. To address this issue, we propose a novel network built upon decoupled HSV Look-Up Tables (LUTs). The method aims to simplify color correction by adjusting the Hue (H), Saturation (S), and Value (V) components independently. This approach resolves the inherent color coupling problems in traditional methods. Our model adopts a two-stage architecture: First, a Chroma-Aware Spectral Tokenizer (CAST) converts the input image from RGB space to HSV space and independently encodes the Hue (H) and Value (V) channels into a set of semantic tokens describing the Purple flare status; second, the HSV-LUT module takes these tokens as input and dynamically generates independent correction curves (1D-LUTs) for the three channels H, S, and V.

Existing methods typically presuppose perfect priors or can only handle specific, pre-identified error types. And their performance degrades substantially when confronted with flawed constraints of unknown location and type. This decline arises because most of them rely on inflexible and biased thresholding strategies that may conflict with the data distribution. To overcome these limitations, we propose to harmonizes knowledge and data through prior alignment and conflict resolution. First, we assess the credibility of imperfect structural constraints through a surrogate model, which then guides a sparse penalization term measuring the loss between the learned and constrained adjacency matrices. We theoretically prove that, under ideal assumption, the knowledge-driven objective aligns with the data-driven objective. Furthermore, to resolve conflicts when this assumption is violated, we introduce a multi-task learning framework optimized via multi-gradient descent, jointly minimizing both objectives. Our proposed method is robust to both linear and nonlinear settings. Extensive experiments, conducted under diverse noise conditions and structural equation model types, demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method under imperfect structural constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u9c81\u68d2\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5148\u9a8c\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u51b2\u7a81\u89e3\u51b3\u6765\u534f\u8c03\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u5b8c\u7f8e\u5148\u9a8c\u6216\u53ea\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u7279\u5b9a\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5f53\u9762\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u7ea6\u675f\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u5927\u591a\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u6709\u504f\u7684\u9608\u503c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "method": "1) \u901a\u8fc7\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u7a00\u758f\u60e9\u7f5a\u9879\uff1b2) \u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u7406\u60f3\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u77e5\u8bc6\u9a71\u52a8\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u76ee\u6807\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b3) \u5f53\u5047\u8bbe\u8fdd\u53cd\u65f6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u8054\u5408\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4e24\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5bf9\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8bbe\u7f6e\u90fd\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5148\u9a8c\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u51b2\u7a81\u89e3\u51b3\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "relevance": 25.0}}

To mitigate feature confusion in conventional concatenation-based conditioning, we design a Dual-Stream Diffusion architecture that processes clean and degraded inputs separately, with a Rectified Fusion Block integrating them in a structured, degradation-aware manner. Furthermore, Noise-Aware Routing Block improves efficiency by dynamically selecting only noise-relevant features during denoising.

Accepted by IROS 2025", "summary": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a key rendering pipeline for digital asset creation due to its balance between efficiency and visual quality. To address the issues of unstable pose estimation and scene representation distortion caused by geometric texture inconsistency in large outdoor scenes with weak or repetitive textures, we approach the problem from two aspects: pose estimation and scene representation. For pose estimation, we leverage LiDAR-IMU Odometry to provide prior poses for cameras in large-scale environments. These prior pose constraints are incorporated into COLMAP's triangulation process, with pose optimization performed via bundle adjustment. Ensuring consistency between pixel data association and prior poses helps maintain both robustness and accuracy. For scene representation, we introduce normal vector constraints and effective rank regularization to enforce consistency in the direction and shape of Gaussian primitives. These constraints are jointly optimized with the existing photometric loss to enhance the map quality. We evaluate our approach using both public and self-collected datasets. In terms of pose optimization, our method requires only one-third of the time while maintaining accuracy and robustness across both datasets. In terms of scene representation, the results show that our method significantly outperforms conventional 3DGS pipelines. Notably, on self-collected datasets characterized by weak or repetitive textures, our approach demonstrates enhanced visualization capabilities and achieves superior overall performance.

We present an integrated modeling framework that couples agent-based modeling and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to simulate how energy transition pathways interact with regional resource competition, ecological constraints, and community-level burdens.

This issue stems from cloning-based densification, which propagates Gaussians along existing geometry, limiting exploration and requiring many primitives to adequately cover the scene. We present ConeGS, an image-space-informed densification framework that is independent of existing scene geometry state. ConeGS first creates a fast Instant Neural Graphics Primitives (iNGP) reconstruction as a geometric proxy to estimate per-pixel depth. During the subsequent 3DGS optimization, it identifies high-error pixels and inserts new Gaussians along the corresponding viewing cones at the predicted depth values, initializing their size according to the cone diameter. A pre-activation opacity penalty rapidly removes redundant Gaussians, while a primitive budgeting strategy controls the total number of primitives, either by a fixed budget or by adapting to scene complexity, ensuring high reconstruction quality.

However, their broad knowledge capacity raises growing concerns about privacy leakage, toxicity mitigation, and intellectual property violations. Machine Unlearning (MU) offers a practical solution by selectively forgetting targeted knowledge while preserving overall model utility. When applied to MLLMs, existing neuron-editing-based MU approaches face two fundamental challenges: (1) forgetting becomes inconsistent across modalities because existing point-wise attribution methods fail to capture the structured, layer-by-layer information flow that connects different modalities; and (2) general knowledge performance declines when sensitive neurons that also support important reasoning paths are pruned, as this disrupts the model's ability to generalize. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a multimodal influential neuron path editor (MIP-Editor) for MU. Our approach introduces modality-specific attribution scores to identify influential neuron paths responsible for encoding forget-set knowledge and applies influential-path-aware neuron-editing via representation misdirection. This strategy also enables effective and coordinated forgetting across modalities while preserving the model's general capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that MIP-Editor achieves a superior unlearning performance on multimodal tasks, with a maximum forgetting rate of 87.75% and up to 54.26% improvement in general knowledge retention. On textual tasks, MIP-Editor achieves up to 80.65% forgetting and preserves 77.9% of general performance.

Yet, dense disparity supervision is nearly impossible due to anatomical constraints, typically limiting annotations to only a few image-level labels acquired before the endoscope enters deep body cavities. Teacher-Student Learning (TSL) offers a promising solution by leveraging a teacher trained on sparse labels to generate pseudo labels and associated confidence maps from abundant unlabeled surgical videos. However, existing TSL methods are confined to image-level supervision, providing only spatial confidence and lacking temporal consistency estimation. This absence of spatio-temporal reliability results in unstable disparity predictions and severe flickering artifacts across video frames. To overcome these challenges, we propose TiS-TSL, a novel time-switchable teacher-student learning framework for video stereo matching under minimal supervision. At its core is a unified model that operates in three distinct modes: Image-Prediction (IP), Forward Video-Prediction (FVP), and Backward Video-Prediction (BVP), enabling flexible temporal modeling within a single architecture. Enabled by this unified model, TiS-TSL adopts a two-stage learning strategy. The Image-to-Video (I2V) stage transfers sparse image-level knowledge to initialize temporal modeling. The subsequent Video-to-Video (V2V) stage refines temporal disparity predictions by comparing forward and backward predictions to calculate bidirectional spatio-temporal consistency. This consistency identifies unreliable regions across frames, filters noisy video-level pseudo labels, and enforces temporal coherence.

Treat them equally in machine unlearning procedure can potentially degrading the performance of updated models. To address this limitation, we propose Data Value-Weighted Unlearning (DVWU), a general unlearning framework that accounts for data value heterogeneity into the unlearning process. Specifically, we design a weighting strategy based on data values, which are then integrated into the unlearning procedure to enable differentiated unlearning for data points with varying utility to the model. The DVWU framework can be broadly adapted to various existing machine unlearning methods. We use the one-step Newton update as an example for implementation, developing both output and objective perturbation algorithms to achieve certified unlearning.

Recently, denoisers induced by generative priors have been successfully integrated into regularized optimization methods for image restoration under Gaussian noise. However, their application to non-Gaussian noise--such as impulse noise--remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play image restoration framework based on generative diffusion priors for robust removal of general noise types, including impulse noise. Within the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation framework, the data fidelity term is adapted to the specific noise model. Departing from the conventional least-squares loss used for Gaussian noise, we introduce a generalized Gaussian scale mixture-based loss, which approximates a wide range of noise distributions and leads to an $\\ell_q$-norm ($0<q\\leq2$) fidelity term. This optimization problem is addressed using an iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) approach, wherein the proximal step involving the generative prior is efficiently performed via a diffusion-based denoiser.

FedNET employs Federated Learning (FL) to model the temporal evolution of node-level traffic in a distributed manner, enabling accurate multi-step-ahead predictions (e.g., several hours to days) without exposing sensitive network data. Using these node-level forecasts and known routing information, FedNET estimates the future link-level utilization by aggregating traffic contributions across all source-destination pairs. The links are then ranked according to the predicted load intensity and temporal variability, providing an early warning signal for potential high-risk links. We compare the federated traffic prediction of FedNET against a centralized multi-step learning baseline and then systematically analyze the impact of history and prediction window sizes on forecast accuracy using the $R^2$ score.

To address this issue, we first propose a unified multi-distance subjective quality assessment method that closely mimics human viewing behavior for objects reconstructed with GS-based methods in actual applications, thereby better collecting perceptual experiences. Based on it, we also construct a novel GS quality assessment dataset named MUGSQA, which is constructed considering multiple uncertainties of the input data. These uncertainties include the quantity and resolution of input views, the view distance, and the accuracy of the initial point cloud. Moreover, we construct two benchmarks: one to evaluate the robustness of various GS-based reconstruction methods under multiple uncertainties, and the other to evaluate the performance of existing quality assessment metrics.

Unlike standard transformer architectures that operate in a purely feedforward manner during inference, FH-RL enables internal recurrence without external looping, allowing prior latent states to be dynamically re-entered into the ongoing computation stream. We conduct controlled experiments sweeping the reentry gain $\u03b3$ and evaluate emergent internal dynamics using three novel metrics: the Information Reentry Ratio (IRR), Eigen-Spectrum Recursion Index (ESRI), and Representational Drift Periodicity (RDP). Results show that reentry quantity increases proportionally with~$\u03b3$, while the learned feedback matrix $W_r$ remains bounded and becomes more structured at moderate gains. Critically, a stable reflective band emerges around $\u03b3\\approx 0.10-0.20$, where internal feedback is maximally expressive yet spectrally stable: IRR rises smoothly, ESRI remains near zero, and RDP exhibits consistent low-frequency cycles.

However, current methods still suffer from flickering, identity drift, and poor audio-visual synchronization. These issues primarily stem from entangled appearance-motion representations and unstable inference strategies. In this paper, we introduce \\textbf{ConsistTalk}, a novel intensity-controllable and temporally consistent talking head generation framework with diffusion noise search inference. First, we propose \\textbf{an optical flow-guided temporal module (OFT)} that decouples motion features from static appearance by leveraging facial optical flow, thereby reducing visual flicker and improving temporal consistency. Second, we present an \\textbf{Audio-to-Intensity (A2I) model} obtained through multimodal teacher-student knowledge distillation. By transforming audio and facial velocity features into a frame-wise intensity sequence, the A2I model enables joint modeling of audio and visual motion, resulting in more natural dynamics. This further enables fine-grained, frame-wise control of motion dynamics while maintaining tight audio-visual synchronization.

Second, since the neural approximation may not be exact, it is subsequently refined using a Newton-based correction initialized by the neural output. To evaluate the effectiveness of this hybrid approach, we compare three solution strategies: (i) the standard Newton-Raphson solver used in NFEM, which is robust and accurate but computationally demanding; (ii) physics-informed neural operators, which provide rapid inference but may lose accuracy outside the training distribution and resolution; and (iii) the neural-initialized Newton (NiN) strategy, which combines the efficiency of neural operators with the robustness of NFEM.

Current approaches, however, remain constrained by the scarcity of high-quality stimulus-brain response pairs and the inherent semantic mismatch between neural representations and visual content. Inspired by perceptual variability and co-adaptive strategy of the biological systems, we propose a novel self-supervised architecture, named NeuroBridge, which integrates Cognitive Prior Augmentation (CPA) with Shared Semantic Projector (SSP) to promote effective cross-modality alignment. Specifically, CPA simulates perceptual variability by applying asymmetric, modality-specific transformations to both EEG signals and images, enhancing semantic diversity. Unlike previous approaches, SSP establishes a bidirectional alignment process through a co-adaptive strategy, which mutually aligns features from two modalities into a shared semantic space for effective cross-modal learning. NeuroBridge surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods under both intra-subject and inter-subject settings. In the intra-subject scenario, it achieves the improvements of 12.3% in top-1 accuracy and 10.2% in top-5 accuracy, reaching 63.2% and 89.9% respectively on a 200-way zero-shot retrieval task.

Mapless ZSON approaches have emerged to address this, but they typically make short-sighted decisions, leading to local deadlocks due to a lack of historical context.

One of the main challenges is to stitch together multiple images into a single high-resolution image that covers a large area. Featurebased image stitching algorithms are commonly used but can suffer from errors and ambiguities in feature detection and matching. To address this, several approaches have been proposed, including using bundle adjustment techniques or direct image alignment. In this paper, we present a novel method that uses a combination of IMU data and computer vision techniques for stitching images captured by a UAV. Our method involves several steps such as estimating the displacement and rotation of the UAV between consecutive images, correcting for perspective distortion, and computing a homography matrix. We then use a standard image stitching algorithm to align and blend the images together. Our proposed method leverages the additional information provided by the IMU data, corrects for various sources of distortion, and can be easily integrated into existing UAV workflows.

Additionally, we conduct a series of computational experiments using Internet of Things (IoT) sensor data to evaluate the performance of our proposed model. Our study demonstrates that the proposed adaptive model achieves a higher shelf life, extending it by over 18\\% compared to traditional optimization models, by dynamically mitigating temperature deviations through a temperature feedback mechanism.

First, M2M-DC ranks residual (or inverted-residual) blocks by a label-aware mutual information (MI) signal and removes the least informative units (structured prune-after-training). It then alternates short KD phases with stage-coherent, residual-safe channel slicing: (i) stage \"planes\" (co-slicing conv2 out-channels with the downsample path and next-stage inputs), and (ii) an optional mid-channel trim (conv1 out / bn1 / conv2 in). This targets complementary redundancy, whole computational motifs and within-stage width while preserving residual shape invariants. On CIFAR-100, M2M-DC yields a clean accuracy-compute frontier. For ResNet-18, we obtain 85.46% Top-1 with 3.09M parameters and 0.0139 GMacs (72% params, 63% GMacs vs. teacher; mean final 85.29% over three seeds). For ResNet-34, we reach 85.02% Top-1 with 5.46M params and 0.0195 GMacs (74% / 74% vs. teacher; mean final 84.62%). Extending to inverted-residuals, MobileNetV2 achieves a mean final 68.54% Top-1 at 1.71M params (27%) and 0.0186 conv GMacs (24%), improving over the teacher's 66.03% by +2.5 points across three seeds. Because M2M-DC exposes only a thin, architecture-aware interface (blocks, stages, and down sample/skip wiring), it generalizes across residual CNNs and extends to inverted-residual families with minor legalization rules.

Submitted version", "summary": "While feature-based knowledge distillation has proven highly effective for compressing CNNs, these techniques unexpectedly fail when applied to Vision Transformers (ViTs), often performing worse than simple logit-based distillation. We provide the first comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon through a novel analytical framework termed as ``distillation dynamics\", combining frequency spectrum analysis, information entropy metrics, and activation magnitude tracking. Our investigation reveals that ViTs exhibit a distinctive U-shaped information processing pattern: initial compression followed by expansion. We identify the root cause of negative transfer in feature distillation: a fundamental representational paradigm mismatch between teacher and student models. Through frequency-domain analysis, we show that teacher models employ distributed, high-dimensional encoding strategies in later layers that smaller student models cannot replicate due to limited channel capacity. This mismatch causes late-layer feature alignment to actively harm student performance.

Existing approaches for ISTS modeling primarily rely on observed values to impute unobserved ones or infer latent dynamics. However, these methods overlook a critical source of learning signal: the reconstruction error inherently produced during model training. Such error implicitly reflects how well a model captures the underlying data structure and can serve as an informative proxy for unobserved values. To exploit this insight, we propose iTimER, a simple yet effective self-supervised pre-training framework for ISTS representation learning. iTimER models the distribution of reconstruction errors over observed values and generates pseudo-observations for unobserved timestamps through a mixup strategy between sampled errors and the last available observations. This transforms unobserved timestamps into noise-aware training targets, enabling meaningful reconstruction signals. A Wasserstein metric aligns reconstruction error distributions between observed and pseudo-observed regions, while a contrastive learning objective enhances the discriminability of learned representations. Extensive experiments on classification, interpolation, and forecasting tasks demonstrate that iTimER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods under the ISTS setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "iTimER\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u91c7\u6837\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u91cd\u6784\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u4f2a\u89c2\u6d4b\u503c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Wasserstein\u5ea6\u91cf\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u89c2\u6d4b\u503c\u6765\u63d2\u8865\u7f3a\u5931\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u91cd\u6784\u8bef\u5dee\u8fd9\u4e00\u91cd\u8981\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u8be5\u8bef\u5dee\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6355\u6349\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faiTimER\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u5bf9\u89c2\u6d4b\u503c\u7684\u91cd\u6784\u8bef\u5dee\u5efa\u6a21\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7\u8bef\u5dee\u91c7\u6837\u4e0e\u6700\u540e\u53ef\u7528\u89c2\u6d4b\u503c\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u4f2a\u89c2\u6d4b\u503c\uff1b3) \u4f7f\u7528Wasserstein\u5ea6\u91cf\u5bf9\u9f50\u89c2\u6d4b\u533a\u57df\u548c\u4f2a\u89c2\u6d4b\u533a\u57df\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u5e03\uff1b4) \u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u8868\u793a\u5224\u522b\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u63d2\u503c\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0ciTimER\u5728\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "iTimER\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u91cd\u6784\u8bef\u5dee\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002", "relevance": 35.0}}

We combine term frequency--inverse document frequency (TF--IDF) analysis of six national AI strategies (NASs), an inventory of 47 publicly disclosed AI initiatives (January 2017--April 2025), paired case studies, the Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI) and the Saudi Data & Artificial Intelligence Authority (SDAIA) Academy, and a scenario matrix linking oil-revenue slack (technical capacity) to regulatory coherence (social alignment). Across the corpus, 34/47 initiatives (0.72; 95% Wilson CI 0.58--0.83) exhibit joint social--technical design; country-level indices span 0.57--0.90 (small n; intervals overlap). Scenario results suggest that, under our modeled conditions, regulatory convergence plausibly binds outcomes more than fiscal capacity: fragmented rules can offset high oil revenues, while harmonized standards help preserve progress under austerity. We also identify an emerging two-track talent system, research elites versus rapidly trained practitioners, that risks labor-market bifurcation without bridging mechanisms.

While truncated diffusion probabilistic models (TDPMs) hold strong potential with a paradigm optimization, existing TDPMs suffer from entangled accuracy and diversity of predictions with insufficient fidelity and plausibility. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose Ambiguity-aware Truncated Flow Matching (ATFM), which introduces a novel inference paradigm and dedicated model components. Firstly, we propose Data-Hierarchical Inference, a redefinition of AMIS-specific inference paradigm, which enhances accuracy and diversity at data-distribution and data-sample level, respectively, for an effective disentanglement. Secondly, Gaussian Truncation Representation (GTR) is introduced to enhance both fidelity of predictions and reliability of truncation distribution, by explicitly modeling it as a Gaussian distribution at $T_{\\text{trunc}}$ instead of using sampling-based approximations.Thirdly, Segmentation Flow Matching (SFM) is proposed to enhance the plausibility of diverse predictions by extending semantic-aware flow transformation in Flow Matching (FM).

To overcome this, we introduce the non-conservative generalized Schr\u00f6dinger bridge (NCGSB), a novel, energy-varying reformulation based on contact Hamiltonian mechanics. By allowing energy to change over time, the NCGSB provides a broader class of real-world stochastic processes, capturing richer and more faithful intermediate dynamics. By parameterizing the Wasserstein manifold, we lift the bridge problem to a tractable geodesic computation in a finite-dimensional space.

These issues lead to unstable codeword learning and underutilized codebooks, ultimately degrading the performance of both reconstruction and downstream generation tasks. To this end, we propose VAEVQ, which comprises three key components: (1) Variational Latent Quantization (VLQ), replacing the AE with a VAE for quantization to leverage its structured and smooth latent space, thereby facilitating more effective codeword activation; (2) Representation Coherence Strategy (RCS), adaptively modulating the alignment strength between pre- and post-quantization features to enhance consistency and prevent overfitting to noise; and (3) Distribution Consistency Regularization (DCR), aligning the entire codebook distribution with the continuous latent distribution to improve utilization.

Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) presents a promising solution, achieving performance comparable to full fine-tuning by updating only a small number of adaptation weights per layer. Traditional PEFT methods typically rely on a single expert, where the adaptation weight is a low-rank matrix. However, for complex tasks, the data's inherent diversity poses a significant challenge for such models, as a single adaptation weight cannot adequately capture the features of all samples. To address this limitation, we explore how to integrate multiple small adaptation experts into a compact structure to defeat a large adapter. Specifically, we propose Tucker Adaptation (TuckA), a method with four key properties: (i) We use Tucker decomposition to create a compact 3D tensor where each slice naturally serves as an expert. The low-rank nature of this decomposition ensures that the number of parameters scales efficiently as more experts are added. (ii) We introduce a hierarchical strategy that organizes these experts into groups at different granularities, allowing the model to capture both local and global data patterns. (iii) We develop an efficient batch-level routing mechanism, which reduces the router's parameter size by a factor of $L$ compared to routing at every adapted layer (where $L$ is the number of adapted layers) (iv) We propose data-aware initialization to achieve loss-free expert load balancing based on theoretical analysis.

We analyze constitutional, collective-choice, and operational rules shaping AI uptake in two contrasting GCC members, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Kuwait, and whether they foster citizen centricity, collaborative governance, and public value creation. Anchored in Ostrom's Institutional Analysis and Development framework, the study combines a most similar/most different systems design with multiple sources: 62 public documents from 2018--2025, embedded UAE cases (Smart Dubai and MBZUAI), and 39 interviews with officials conducted Aug 2024--May 2025. Dual coding and process tracing connect rule configurations to AI performance. Cross-case analysis identifies four reinforcing mechanisms behind divergent trajectories. In the UAE, concentrated authority, credible sanctions, pro-innovation narratives, and flexible reinvestment rules scale pilots into hundreds of services and sizable recycled savings. In Kuwait, dispersed veto points, exhortative sanctions, cautious discourse, and lapsed AI budgets confine initiatives to pilot mode despite equivalent fiscal resources. The findings refine institutional theory by showing that vertical rule coherence, not wealth, determines AI's public-value yield, and temper post-NPM optimism by revealing that efficiency metrics serve societal goals only when backed by enforceable safeguards.

Yet, most models are trained to map short prompts into detailed images, creating a gap between sparse textual input and rich visual outputs. This mismatch reduces controllability, as models often fill in missing details arbitrarily, biasing toward average user preferences and limiting precision for professional use. We address this limitation by training the first open-source text-to-image model on long structured captions, where every training sample is annotated with the same set of fine-grained attributes. This design maximizes expressive coverage and enables disentangled control over visual factors. To process long captions efficiently, we propose DimFusion, a fusion mechanism that integrates intermediate tokens from a lightweight LLM without increasing token length. We also introduce the Text-as-a-Bottleneck Reconstruction (TaBR) evaluation protocol. By assessing how well real images can be reconstructed through a captioning-generation loop, TaBR directly measures controllability and expressiveness, even for very long captions where existing evaluation methods fail.

These insights motivate DeepBooTS, a novel end-to-end dual-stream residual-decreasing boosting method that progressively reconstructs the intrinsic signal. In our design, each block of a deep model becomes an ensemble of learners with an auxiliary output branch forming a highway to the final prediction. The block-wise outputs correct the residuals of previous blocks, leading to a learning-driven decomposition of both inputs and targets. This method enhances versatility and interpretability while substantially improving robustness to concept drift.

This work introduces a two-stage system to address these compositional limitations. The first stage employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate a structured layout from a list of objects. The second stage uses a layout-conditioned diffusion model to synthesize a photorealistic image adhering to this layout. We find that task decomposition is critical for LLM-based spatial planning; by simplifying the initial generation to core objects and completing the layout with rule-based insertion, we improve object recall from 57.2% to 99.9% for complex scenes. For image synthesis, we compare two leading conditioning methods: ControlNet and GLIGEN. After domain-specific finetuning on table-setting datasets, we identify a key trade-off: ControlNet preserves text-based stylistic control but suffers from object hallucination, while GLIGEN provides superior layout fidelity at the cost of reduced prompt-based controllability. Our end-to-end system successfully generates images with specified object counts and plausible spatial arrangements, demonstrating the viability of a decoupled approach for compositionally controlled synthesis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7cfb\u7edf\u89e3\u51b3\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7269\u4f53\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e03\u5c40\u63a7\u5236\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u7528LLM\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5e03\u5c40\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u7528\u5e03\u5c40\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7269\u4f53\u53ec\u56de\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86ControlNet\u548cGLIGEN\u4e24\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u52a3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7269\u4f53\u8ba1\u6570\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e03\u5c40\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u4ece\u7269\u4f53\u5217\u8868\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5e03\u5c40\uff1b2\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u5e03\u5c40\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5148\u751f\u6210\u6838\u5fc3\u7269\u4f53\u518d\u89c4\u5219\u8865\u5145\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83ControlNet\u548cGLIGEN\u4e24\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u4ece57.2%\u63d0\u5347\u523099.9%\u3002ControlNet\u4fdd\u6301\u6587\u672c\u98ce\u683c\u63a7\u5236\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u7269\u4f53\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0cGLIGEN\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5e03\u5c40\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4f46\u6587\u672c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89e3\u8026\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u63a7\u5236\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u6307\u5b9a\u7269\u4f53\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u5408\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e03\u5c40\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "relevance": 65.0}}

This fundamental weakness leads to noisy, unstable anomaly scores with a poor signal-to-noise ratio, hindering reliable detection. To address this, we propose Constrained Gaussian-Noise Optimization and Smoothing (COGNOS), a universal, model-agnostic enhancement framework that tackles this issue at its source. COGNOS introduces a novel Gaussian-White Noise Regularization strategy during training, which directly constrains the model's output residuals to conform to a Gaussian white noise distribution. This engineered statistical property creates the ideal precondition for our second contribution: a Kalman Smoothing Post-processor that provably operates as a statistically optimal estimator to denoise the raw anomaly scores. The synergy between these two components allows COGNOS to robustly separate the true anomaly signal from random fluctuations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that COGNOS is highly effective, delivering an average F-score uplift of 57.9% when applied to 12 diverse backbone models across multiple real-world benchmark datasets.

However, their reliance on fixed-size rectangular patches often influences the integrity of complex vascular structures, leading to suboptimal segmentation accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose the adaptive Morph Patch Transformer (MPT), a novel architecture specifically designed for aortic vascular segmentation. Specifically, MPT introduces an adaptive patch partitioning strategy that dynamically generates morphology-aware patches aligned with complex vascular structures. This strategy can preserve semantic integrity of complex vascular structures within individual patches. Moreover, a Semantic Clustering Attention (SCA) method is proposed to dynamically aggregate features from various patches with similar semantic characteristics. This method enhances the model's capability to segment vessels of varying sizes, preserving the integrity of vascular structures.

We present preliminary evidence that DD exists in model-free DRL, investigating it systematically across varying model capacity using the Actor-Critic framework. We rely on an information-theoretic metric, Policy Entropy, to measure policy uncertainty throughout training. Preliminary results show a clear epoch-wise DD curve; the policy's entrance into the second descent region correlates with a sustained, significant reduction in Policy Entropy. This entropic decay suggests that over-parameterization acts as an implicit regularizer, guiding the policy towards robust, flatter minima in the loss landscape.

Building on the Li--Yau differential inequality for the heat flow, we prove well-posedness and derive sharp $L^p$-stability estimates for the associated score-based Fokker--Planck dynamics, providing a mathematically consistent description of their temporal evolution. Through entropy stability methods, we further show that the reverse-time dynamics of diffusion models concentrate on the data manifold for compactly supported data distributions and a broad class of initialization schemes, with a concentration rate of order $\\sqrt{t}$ as $t \\to 0$.\n  These results yield a theoretical guarantee that, under exact score guidance, diffusion trajectories return to the data manifold while preserving imitation fidelity. Our findings also provide practical insights for designing diffusion models, including principled criteria for score-function construction, loss formulation, and stopping-time selection.

In this experiment, we classify colorless microplastic particles (50-300 $\u03bc$m) by illuminating them with linearly polarized laser light and capturing their reflected signals using a polarization-sensitive camera. This reflection-based technique successfully circumvents the transmission-based interference issues that plague many conventional methods when applied in water. Using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for image-based classification, we successfully identified three common polymer types, high-density polyethylene, low-density polyethylene, and polypropylene, achieving a peak mean classification accuracy of 80% on the test dataset. A subsequent feature hierarchy analysis demonstrated that the CNN's decision-making process relies mainly on the microstructural integrity and internal texture (polarization patterns) of the particle rather than its macroshape. Critically, we found that the Angle of Linear Polarization (AOLP) signal is significantly more robust against contextual noise than the Degree of Linear Polarization (DOLP) signal. While the AOLP-based classification achieved superior overall performance, its strength lies in distinguishing between the two polyethylene plastics, showing a lower confusion rate between high-density and low-density polyethylene. Conversely, the DOLP signal demonstrated slightly worse overall classification results but excels at accurately identifying the polypropylene class, which it isolated with greater success than AOLP.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u504f\u632f\u5149\u6563\u5c04\u7684\u53cd\u5c04\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6c34\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fae\u5851\u6599\u7684\u539f\u4f4d\u5206\u7c7b\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1\u805a\u5408\u7269\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe80%\u3002", "motivation": "\u9762\u5bf9\u6c34\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5fae\u5851\u6599\u6301\u7eed\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u76d1\u6d4b\u7684\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u91d1\u6807\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u6c34\u4f53\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u8fdb\u884c\u539f\u4f4d\u5206\u7c7b\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7ebf\u504f\u632f\u6fc0\u5149\u7167\u5c04\u65e0\u8272\u5fae\u5851\u6599\u9897\u7c92\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u504f\u632f\u654f\u611f\u76f8\u673a\u6355\u83b7\u53cd\u5c04\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8fdb\u884c\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u805a\u4e59\u70ef\u3001\u4f4e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u805a\u4e59\u70ef\u548c\u805a\u4e19\u70ef\u4e09\u79cd\u805a\u5408\u7269\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u5e73\u5747\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe80%\u3002\u7ebf\u6027\u504f\u632f\u89d2\u4fe1\u53f7\u6bd4\u7ebf\u6027\u504f\u632f\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7\u5bf9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u566a\u58f0\u66f4\u5177\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cd\u5c04\u5f0f\u504f\u632f\u5149\u6563\u5c04\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edf\u900f\u5c04\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6c34\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5fae\u5851\u6599\u539f\u4f4d\u76d1\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "relevance": 10.0}}

To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a novel hybrid deep learning framework that integrates a Distilled Attention Transformer (DAT) model and an Autoencoder Self-regression Model (ASM). The DAT leverages a self-attention mechanism to dynamically assign higher weights to critical segments of historical data, effectively capturing both long-term trends and short-term fluctuations. Concurrently, the ASM employs unsupervised learning to detect and isolate anomalous patterns induced by extreme conditions, such as heavy rain, heat waves, or human festivals.

However, existing methods face two key limitations. Firstly, they often over-rely on high-certainty keywords that explicitly identify the target object while neglecting critical spatial descriptions. Secondly, generalized textual features contain both 2D and 3D descriptive information, thereby capturing an additional dimension of details compared to singular 2D or 3D visual features. This characteristic leads to cross-dimensional interference when refining visual features under text guidance. To overcome these challenges, we propose Mono3DVG-EnSD, a novel framework that integrates two key components: the CLIP-Guided Lexical Certainty Adapter (CLIP-LCA) and the Dimension-Decoupled Module (D2M). The CLIP-LCA dynamically masks high-certainty keywords while retaining low-certainty implicit spatial descriptions, thereby forcing the model to develop a deeper understanding of spatial relationships in captions for object localization. Meanwhile, the D2M decouples dimension-specific (2D/3D) textual features from generalized textual features to guide corresponding visual features at same dimension, which mitigates cross-dimensional interference by ensuring dimensionally-consistent cross-modal interactions. Through comprehensive comparisons and ablation studies on the Mono3DRefer dataset, our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across all metrics.

Recent works improve this by introducing knowledge distillation (KD) techniques, with the pre-trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) used as teachers and the target SNNs as students. This is commonly accomplished through a straightforward element-wise alignment of intermediate features and prediction logits from ANNs and SNNs, often neglecting the intrinsic differences between their architectures. Specifically, ANN's outputs exhibit a continuous distribution, whereas SNN's outputs are characterized by sparsity and discreteness. To mitigate this issue, we introduce two innovative KD strategies. Firstly, we propose the Saliency-scaled Activation Map Distillation (SAMD), which aligns the spike activation map of the student SNN with the class-aware activation map of the teacher ANN. Rather than performing KD directly on the raw %and distinct features of ANN and SNN, our SAMD directs the student to learn from saliency activation maps that exhibit greater semantic and distribution consistency. Additionally, we propose a Noise-smoothed Logits Distillation (NLD), which utilizes Gaussian noise to smooth the sparse logits of student SNN, facilitating the alignment with continuous logits from teacher ANN.

Furthermore, we introduce adaptive mask reweighting to downweight penumbra regions during training and apply edge masks at the final decoder stage for better supervision.

In addition, we present methods for analyzing the influence of each variable over an entire time series, generating CEs by altering only specific variables, and evaluating the quality of the resulting CEs. We validate the proposed method through theoretical analysis and empirical experiments, showcasing its accuracy and practical applicability. These contributions are expected to support real-world decision-making based on time series data analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f7f\u7528\u5916\u751f\u53d8\u91cf\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u751f\u6210\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u53d8\u91cf\u5f71\u54cd\u5206\u6790\u3001\u7279\u5b9a\u53d8\u91cf\u4fee\u6539\u548cCE\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5916\u751f\u53d8\u91cf\u63d0\u53d6\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5404\u53d8\u91cf\u5bf9\u6574\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6539\u7279\u5b9a\u53d8\u91cf\u751f\u6210CE\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30CE\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u51b3\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u3002", "relevance": 30.0}}

However, existing trait maps remain limited by the high cost and sparse geographic coverage of field-based measurements. Citizen science initiatives offer a largely untapped resource to overcome these limitations, with over 50 million geotagged plant photographs worldwide capturing valuable visual information on plant morphology and physiology. In this study, we introduce PlantTraitNet, a multi-modal, multi-task uncertainty-aware deep learning framework that predictsfour key plant traits (plant height, leaf area, specific leaf area, and nitrogen content) from citizen science photos using weak supervision. By aggregating individual trait predictions across space, we generate global maps of trait distributions. We validate these maps against independent vegetation survey data (sPlotOpen) and benchmark them against leading global trait products. Our results show that PlantTraitNet consistently outperforms existing trait maps across all evaluated traits, demonstrating that citizen science imagery, when integrated with computer vision and geospatial AI, enables not only scalable but also more accurate global trait mapping.

To meet this need, data is collected from multiple domains, such as Wikipedia and GitHub. These domains are heterogeneous in both data quality and the diversity of information they provide. This raises the question of how much we should rely on each domain. Several methods have attempted to address this issue by assigning sampling weights to each data domain using heuristics or approximations. As a first step toward a deeper understanding of the role of data mixing, this work revisits the problem by studying two kinds of weights: sampling weights, which control how much each domain contributes in a batch, and loss weights, which scale the loss from each domain during training. Through a rigorous study of linear regression, we show that these two weights play complementary roles. First, they can reduce the variance of gradient estimates in iterative methods such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Second, they can improve generalization performance by reducing the generalization gap. We provide both theoretical and empirical support for these claims.

However, unlike natural language corpora, RL trajectories are sparse and reward-driven, making standard self-attention inefficient because it distributes weight uniformly across all past tokens rather than emphasizing the few transitions critical for control. To address this, we introduce structured inductive priors into the self-attention mechanism of the dynamics head: (i) per-head memory-length priors that constrain attention to task-specific windows, and (ii) distributional priors that learn smooth Gaussian weightings over past state-action pairs. We integrate these mechanisms into UniZero, a model-based RL agent with a Transformer-based world model that supports planning under partial observability. Experiments on the Atari 100k benchmark show that most efficiency gains arise from the Gaussian prior, which smoothly allocates attention to informative transitions, while memory-length priors often truncate useful signals with overly restrictive cut-offs. In particular, Gaussian Attention achieves a 77% relative improvement in mean human-normalized scores over UniZero. These findings suggest that in partially observable RL domains with non-stationary temporal dependencies, discrete memory windows are difficult to learn reliably, whereas smooth distributional priors flexibly adapt across horizons and yield more robust data efficiency. Overall, our results demonstrate that encoding structured temporal priors directly into self-attention improves the prioritization of informative histories for dynamics modeling under partial observability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5728Transformer\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5f52\u7eb3\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6bcf\u5934\u8bb0\u5fc6\u957f\u5ea6\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0cRL\u8f68\u8ff9\u7a00\u758f\u4e14\u5956\u52b1\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u5386\u53f2\u6807\u8bb0\u5747\u5300\u5206\u914d\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5f3a\u8c03\u5bf9\u63a7\u5236\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5c11\u6570\u5173\u952e\u8f6c\u6362\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5934\u7684\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5f52\u7eb3\u5148\u9a8c\uff1a(1) \u6bcf\u5934\u8bb0\u5fc6\u957f\u5ea6\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5c06\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u9650\u5236\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7a97\u53e3\u5185\uff1b(2) \u5206\u5e03\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u8fc7\u53bb\u72b6\u6001-\u52a8\u4f5c\u5bf9\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u9ad8\u65af\u52a0\u6743\u3002\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u673a\u5236\u96c6\u6210\u5230UniZero\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5728Atari 100k\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u9ad8\u65af\u5148\u9a8c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8677%\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6548\u7387\u589e\u76ca\u6765\u81ea\u9ad8\u65af\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5b83\u80fd\u5e73\u6ed1\u5730\u5c06\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u914d\u7ed9\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u5177\u6709\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4bRL\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u79bb\u6563\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7a97\u53e3\u96be\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u800c\u5e73\u6ed1\u5206\u5e03\u5148\u9a8c\u80fd\u7075\u6d3b\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

However, such a CLIP-based metric is vulnerable for its delicate multimodal alignment. In this work, we propose \\textbf{FoCLIP}, a feature-space misalignment framework for fooling CLIP-based image quality metric. Based on the stochastic gradient descent technique, FoCLIP integrates three key components to construct fooling examples: feature alignment as the core module to reduce image-text modality gaps, the score distribution balance module and pixel-guard regularization, which collectively optimize multimodal output equilibrium between CLIPscore performance and image quality. Such a design can be engineered to maximize the CLIPscore predictions across diverse input prompts, despite exhibiting either visual unrecognizability or semantic incongruence with the corresponding adversarial prompts from human perceptual perspectives. Experiments on ten artistic masterpiece prompts and ImageNet subsets demonstrate that optimized images can achieve significant improvement in CLIPscore while preserving high visual fidelity. In addition, we found that grayscale conversion induces significant feature degradation in fooling images, exhibiting noticeable CLIPscore reduction while preserving statistical consistency with original images. Inspired by this phenomenon, we propose a color channel sensitivity-driven tampering detection mechanism that achieves 91% accuracy on standard benchmarks.

These limitations hinder their ability to capture the sharp, high-frequency signals that often define tabular structure, especially under limited labeled samples.

We propose a hybrid autoencoder that combines a neural encoder with an oblivious soft decision tree (OSDT) encoder, each guided by its own stochastic gating network that performs sample-specific feature selection. Together, these structurally different encoders and model-specific gating networks implement model-based augmentation, producing complementary input views tailored to each architecture. The two encoders, trained with a shared decoder and cross-reconstruction loss, learn distinct yet aligned representations that reflect their respective inductive biases. During training, the OSDT encoder (robust to noise and effective at modeling localized, high-frequency structure) guides the neural encoder toward representations more aligned with tabular data. At inference, only the neural encoder is used, preserving flexibility and SSL compatibility. Spectral analysis highlights the distinct inductive biases of each encoder.

However, existing 3DGS-based video codecs generally exhibit more noticeable visual artifacts and relatively low compression ratios. In this paper, we specifically target the perceptual enhancement of 3DGS-based video compression, based on the assumption that artifacts from 3DGS rendering and quantization resemble noisy latents sampled during diffusion training. Building on this premise, we propose a content-adaptive framework, GFix, comprising a streamlined, single-step diffusion model that serves as an off-the-shelf neural enhancer. Moreover, to increase compression efficiency, We propose a modulated LoRA scheme that freezes the low-rank decompositions and modulates the intermediate hidden states, thereby achieving efficient adaptation of the diffusion backbone with highly compressible updates.

Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) with Vision Transformer backbones have recently shown strong potential for histopathology representation learning. However, conventional random patch sampling during MAE pretraining often includes irrelevant or noisy regions, limiting the model's ability to capture meaningful tissue patterns. In this paper, we present a lightweight and domain-adapted framework that brings structure and biological relevance into MAE-based learning through a wavelet-informed patch selection strategy.

Conventional approaches like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Variational Inference (VI) face significant scalability and efficiency limitations. This paper introduces a novel, unifying framework for fast Bayesian updates by leveraging harmonic analysis. We demonstrate that representing the prior and likelihood in a suitable orthogonal basis transforms the Bayesian update rule into a spectral convolution. Specifically, the Fourier coefficients of the posterior are shown to be the normalized convolution of the prior and likelihood coefficients. To achieve computational feasibility, we introduce a spectral truncation scheme, which, for smooth functions, yields an exceptionally accurate finite-dimensional approximation and reduces the update to a circular convolution. This formulation allows us to exploit the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), resulting in a deterministic algorithm with O(N log N) complexity -- a substantial improvement over the O(N^2) cost of naive methods. We establish rigorous mathematical criteria for the applicability of our method, linking its efficiency to the smoothness and spectral decay of the involved distributions.

However, existing SC methods, which are largely based on linear models or shallow neural networks, face significant limitations in terms of scalability and capacity when applied to real-world datasets with significantly increasing scale, especially in financial services and the internet sector. In this paper, we investigate how to leverage large language models to design a more scalable and efficient SC framework, especially in the case of growing individuals engaged with decision-making processes. Specifically, we introduce GLIM, a gradient-free SC method grounded in in-context learning. During the feed-forward process of self-attention, GLIM implicitly simulates the typical bi-level optimization process of SC, including both the feature manipulation and decision rule optimization. Without fine-tuning the LLMs, our proposed GLIM enjoys the advantage of cost-effective adaptation in dynamic strategic environments. Theoretically, we prove GLIM can support pre-trained LLMs to adapt to a broad range of strategic manipulations.

One of the key issues pertains to limited real-world annotated data to facilitate generalizable models. The common practice to tackle this issue is to simulate new data. Although synthetic datasets offer scalability and perfect labels, their designer-crafted scenes fail to capture real-world complexity and sensor noise, resulting in a synthetic-to-real domain gap. Moreover, no benchmark provides synchronized real and simulated point clouds for segmentation-oriented domain shift analysis. We introduce TrueCity, the first urban semantic segmentation benchmark with cm-accurate annotated real-world point clouds, semantic 3D city models, and annotated simulated point clouds representing the same city. TrueCity proposes segmentation classes aligned with international 3D city modeling standards, enabling consistent evaluation of synthetic-to-real gap.

This design enables collaborative benefits by fully leveraging both client-side and shared server-side models.

However, recent studies reveal that point cloud classifiers are vulnerable to structured adversarial perturbations and geometric corruptions, posing risks to their deployment in safety-critical scenarios. Existing certified defenses limit point-wise perturbations but overlook subtle geometric distortions that preserve individual points yet alter the overall structure, potentially leading to misclassification. In this work, we propose FreqCert, a novel certification framework that departs from conventional spatial domain defenses by shifting robustness analysis to the frequency domain, enabling structured certification against global L2-bounded perturbations. FreqCert first transforms the input point cloud via the graph Fourier transform (GFT), then applies structured frequency-aware subsampling to generate multiple sub-point clouds. Each sub-cloud is independently classified by a standard model, and the final prediction is obtained through majority voting, where sub-clouds are constructed based on spectral similarity rather than spatial proximity, making the partitioning more stable under L2 perturbations and better aligned with the object's intrinsic structure.

Conventional defense mechanisms struggle to address the evolving landscape of multifaceted attack patterns. Through systematic analysis of existing defenses, we identify that their unsatisfactory performance primarily originates from an entangled feature space, where adversarial attacks can be performed easily. To this end, we present 3D-ANC, a novel approach that capitalizes on the Neural Collapse (NC) mechanism to orchestrate discriminative feature learning. In particular, NC depicts where last-layer features and classifier weights jointly evolve into a simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF) arrangement, establishing maximally separable class prototypes. However, leveraging this advantage in 3D recognition confronts two substantial challenges: (1) prevalent class imbalance in point cloud datasets, and (2) complex geometric similarities between object categories. To tackle these obstacles, our solution combines an ETF-aligned classification module with an adaptive training framework consisting of representation-balanced learning (RBL) and dynamic feature direction loss (FDL). 3D-ANC seamlessly empowers existing models to develop disentangled feature spaces despite the complexity in 3D data distribution. Comprehensive evaluations state that 3D-ANC significantly improves the robustness of models with various structures on two datasets.

However, existing GAD methods assume identical training and testing distributions, which is rarely valid in practice. In real-world scenarios, unseen but normal samples may emerge during deployment, leading to a normality shift that degrades the performance of GAD models trained on the original data. Through empirical analysis, we reveal that the degradation arises from (1) semantic confusion, where unseen normal samples are misinterpreted as anomalies due to their novel patterns, and (2) aggregation contamination, where the representations of seen normal nodes are distorted by unseen normals through message aggregation. While retraining or fine-tuning GAD models could be a potential solution to the above challenges, the high cost of model retraining and the difficulty of obtaining labeled data often render this approach impractical in real-world applications. To bridge the gap, we proposed a lightweight and plug-and-play Test-time adaptation framework for correcting Unseen Normal pattErns (TUNE) in GAD. To address semantic confusion, a graph aligner is employed to align the shifted data to the original one at the graph attribute level. Moreover, we utilize the minimization of representation-level shift as a supervision signal to train the aligner, which leverages the estimated aggregation contamination as a key indicator of normality shift.

However, the open accessibility of VFMs also introduces critical security risks, as adversaries can exploit full knowledge of the VFMs to launch potent attacks. This paper investigates a novel and practical adversarial threat scenario: attacking downstream models or MLLMs fine-tuned from open-source VFMs, without requiring access to the victim task, training data, model query, and architecture. In contrast to conventional transfer-based attacks that rely on task-aligned surrogate models, we demonstrate that adversarial vulnerabilities can be exploited directly from the VFMs. To this end, we propose the Transferable Video Attack (TVA), a temporal-aware adversarial attack method that leverages the temporal representation dynamics of VFMs to craft effective perturbations. TVA integrates a bidirectional contrastive learning mechanism to maximize the discrepancy between the clean and adversarial features, and introduces a temporal consistency loss that exploits motion cues to enhance the sequential impact of perturbations. TVA avoids the need to train expensive surrogate models or access to domain-specific data, thereby offering a more practical and efficient attack strategy. Extensive experiments across 24 video-related tasks demonstrate the efficacy of TVA against downstream models and MLLMs, revealing a previously underexplored security vulnerability in the deployment of video models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b(VFMs)\u7684\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u89c6\u9891\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5TVA\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u8bbf\u95ee\u53d7\u5bb3\u8005\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f00\u6e90VFMs\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u53ef\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u5bf9VFMs\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u77e5\u8bc6\u53d1\u8d77\u6709\u6548\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u5a01\u80c1\u573a\u666f\uff1a\u653b\u51fb\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f00\u6e90VFMs\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u6a21\u578b\u6216MLLMs\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u8bbf\u95ee\u53d7\u5bb3\u8005\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTVA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528VFMs\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u52a8\u6001\u6765\u751f\u6210\u6709\u6548\u6270\u52a8\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u53cc\u5411\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5e72\u51c0\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u7279\u5f81\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u6765\u5229\u7528\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ebf\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u572824\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTVA\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u6a21\u578b\u548cMLLMs\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u5148\u524d\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "conclusion": "TVA\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u8bbf\u95ee\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "relevance": 65.0}}

While existing fairness-aware methods typically intervene at the model level, they often suffer from high computational costs, limited scalability, and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose a Bayesian data selection framework that ensures fairness by aligning group-specific posterior distributions of model parameters and sample weights with a shared central distribution. Our framework supports flexible alignment via various distributional discrepancy measures, including Wasserstein distance, maximum mean discrepancy, and $f$-divergence, allowing geometry-aware control without imposing explicit fairness constraints. This data-centric approach mitigates group-specific biases in training data and improves fairness in downstream tasks, with theoretical guarantees.

Data augmentation via synthetic fake face generation effectively enhances generalization, yet current SoTA methods rely on fixed strategies-raising a key question: Is a single static augmentation sufficient, or does the diversity of forgery features demand dynamic approaches? We argue existing methods overlook the evolving complexity of real-world forgeries (e.g., facial warping, expression manipulation), which fixed policies cannot fully simulate. To address this, we propose CRDA (Curriculum Reinforcement-Learning Data Augmentation), a novel framework guiding detectors to progressively master multi-domain forgery features from simple to complex. CRDA synthesizes augmented samples via a configurable pool of forgery operations and dynamically generates adversarial samples tailored to the detector's current learning state. Central to our approach is integrating reinforcement learning (RL) and causal inference. An RL agent dynamically selects augmentation actions based on detector performance to efficiently explore the vast augmentation space, adapting to increasingly challenging forgeries. Simultaneously, the agent introduces action space variations to generate heterogeneous forgery patterns, guided by causal inference to mitigate spurious correlations-suppressing task-irrelevant biases and focusing on causally invariant features. This integration ensures robust generalization by decoupling synthetic augmentation patterns from the model's learned representations.

However, its utility is significantly limited by the sparsity and low resolution of radar point clouds, which poses challenges for tasks requiring dense and accurate 3D perception. Despite that recent efforts have shown great potential by exploring generative approaches to address this issue, they often rely on dense voxel representations that are inefficient and struggle to preserve structural detail. To fill this gap, we make the key observation that latent diffusion models (LDMs), though successful in other modalities, have not been effectively leveraged for radar-based 3D generation due to a lack of compatible representations and conditioning strategies. We introduce RaLD, a framework that bridges this gap by integrating scene-level frustum-based LiDAR autoencoding, order-invariant latent representations, and direct radar spectrum conditioning. These insights lead to a more compact and expressive generation process. Experiments show that RaLD produces dense and accurate 3D point clouds from raw radar spectrums, offering a promising solution for robust perception in challenging environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "RaLD\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u96f7\u8fbe\u9891\u8c31\u751f\u6210\u5bc6\u96c6\u51c6\u786e\u76843D\u70b9\u4e91\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u96f7\u8fbe\u611f\u77e5\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u96f7\u8fbe\u5728\u6076\u52a3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u70b9\u4e91\u7a00\u758f\u4e14\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u9700\u8981\u5bc6\u96c63D\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5bc6\u96c6\u4f53\u7d20\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRaLD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u573a\u666f\u7ea7\u89c6\u9525\u4f53LiDAR\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u987a\u5e8f\u4e0d\u53d8\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u548c\u76f4\u63a5\u96f7\u8fbe\u9891\u8c31\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5bc6\u96c63D\u70b9\u4e91\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eRaLD\u80fd\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u96f7\u8fbe\u9891\u8c31\u751f\u6210\u5bc6\u96c6\u51c6\u786e\u76843D\u70b9\u4e91\uff0c\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "RaLD\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u8868\u793a\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e3a\u96f7\u8fbe\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7d27\u51d1\u4e14\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u5f3a\u7684\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "relevance": 20.0}}

Building on this insight, we propose Trajectory-Aware Reconstruction (TAR), an attack that combines temporal assignment information with algebraic analysis to recover exact original inputs. Our findings provide the first rigorous evidence, supported by a practical attack, that centroid disclosure in federated clustering significantly compromises privacy, exposing a fundamental tension between privacy and efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u53d1\u73b0\u8054\u90a6\u805a\u7c7b\u4e2d\u516c\u5f00\u4e2d\u95f4\u8d28\u5fc3\u4f1a\u4e25\u91cd\u6cc4\u9732\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8f68\u8ff9\u611f\u77e5\u91cd\u5efa\u653b\u51fb(TAR)\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b8c\u7f8e\u6062\u590d\u539f\u59cb\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6839\u672c\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u805a\u7c7b\u5141\u8bb8\u591a\u65b9\u5728\u4e0d\u5171\u4eab\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53d1\u73b0\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u4e3a\u4e86\u964d\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u534f\u8bae\u4f1a\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u516c\u5f00\u4e2d\u95f4\u8d28\u5fc3\u3002\u867d\u7136\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8d28\u5fc3\u901a\u5e38\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6548\u7387\u65e0\u5bb3\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u662f\u5426\u635f\u5bb3\u9690\u79c1\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8f68\u8ff9\u611f\u77e5\u91cd\u5efa\u653b\u51fb(TAR)\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u914d\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u4ee3\u6570\u5206\u6790\u6765\u6062\u590d\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u539f\u59cb\u8f93\u5165\u3002\u8be5\u653b\u51fb\u5229\u7528\u4e86k-means\u8fed\u4ee3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u89c4\u5f8b\u6027\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u53ef\u88ab\u5229\u7528\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "TAR\u653b\u51fb\u80fd\u591f\u5b8c\u7f8e\u6062\u590d\u539f\u59cb\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u653b\u51fb\u652f\u6301\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8054\u90a6\u805a\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u8d28\u5fc3\u62ab\u9732\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u635f\u5bb3\u9690\u79c1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8054\u90a6\u805a\u7c7b\u4e2d\u8d28\u5fc3\u62ab\u9732\u4f1a\u4e25\u91cd\u635f\u5bb3\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6839\u672c\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "relevance": 75.0}}

Federated Learning (FL) with Differential Privacy (DP) can ensure the protection of omics data privacy against malicious user attacks. However, FL with the DP method faces an inherent trade-off: stronger privacy protection degrades predictive accuracy due to injected noise. On the other hand, Homomorphic Encryption (HE) allows computations on encrypted data and enables aggregation of encrypted gradients without DP-induced noise can increase the predictive accuracy. However, it may increase the computation cost. To improve the predictive accuracy while considering the computational ability of heterogeneous clients, we propose a Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning (PPML)-Hybrid method by introducing HE. In the proposed PPML-Hybrid method, clients distributed select either HE or DP based on their computational resources, so that HE clients contribute noise-free updates while DP clients reduce computational overhead.

However, a significant limitation of current methods is their reliance on a pre-defined set of in-distribution (ID) ground-truth label names (positives). These fixed label names can be unavailable, unreliable at scale, or become less relevant due to in-distribution shifts after deployment. Towards truly unsupervised OOD detection, we utilize widely available text corpora for positive label mining, bypassing the need for positives. In this paper, we utilize widely available text corpora for positive label mining under a general concept mining paradigm. Within this framework, we propose ClusterMine, a novel positive label mining method. ClusterMine is the first method to achieve state-of-the-art OOD detection performance without access to positive labels. It extracts positive concepts from a large text corpus by combining visual-only sample consistency (via clustering) and zero-shot image-text consistency. Our experimental study reveals that ClusterMine is scalable across a plethora of CLIP models and achieves state-of-the-art robustness to covariate in-distribution shifts.

Current popular strategies adopt multilayer perceptron (MLP) as the backbone, supplemented by additional modules to enhance the network ability to handle context information, which is a known limitation of MLPs. In contrast, we introduce a novel perspective for capturing correspondence context information without extra design modules. To this end, we design a two-view correspondence pruning network called LeCoT, which can naturally leverage global context information at different stages. Specifically, the core design of LeCoT is the Spatial-Channel Fusion Transformer block, a newly proposed component that efficiently utilizes both spatial and channel global context information among sparse correspondences. In addition, we integrate the proposed prediction block that utilizes correspondence features from intermediate stages to generate a probability set, which acts as guiding information for subsequent learning phases, allowing the network to more effectively capture robust global context information. Notably, this prediction block progressively refines the probability set, thereby mitigating the issue of information loss that is common in the traditional one.

With latent variables drawn from a tractable probability density function that can be further constrained, these models enable continuous and semantically rich exploration of the output space by navigating their latent spaces. Structured latent representations are typically obtained through the joint minimization of regularization loss functions. In variational information bottleneck models, reconstruction loss and Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) are often linearly combined with an auxiliary Attribute-Regularization (AR) loss. However, balancing KLD and AR turns out to be a very delicate matter. When KLD dominates over AR, generative models tend to lack controllability; when AR dominates over KLD, the stochastic encoder is encouraged to violate the standard normal prior. We explore this trade-off in the context of symbolic music generation with explicit control over continuous musical attributes. We show that existing approaches struggle to jointly minimize both regularization objectives, whereas suitable attribute transformations can help achieve both controllability and regularization of the target latent dimensions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u663e\u5f0f\u9690\u53d8\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u4e2dKLD\u548c\u5c5e\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u635f\u5931\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u9002\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\u53d8\u6362\u6765\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u548c\u9690\u7a7a\u95f4\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u53d8\u5206\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0cKLD\u548c\u5c5e\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u635f\u5931\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\u96be\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\uff1aKLD\u4e3b\u5bfc\u65f6\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\uff0c\u5c5e\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4e3b\u5bfc\u65f6\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4f1a\u8fdd\u53cd\u6807\u51c6\u6b63\u6001\u5148\u9a8c\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u7b26\u53f7\u97f3\u4e50\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a2\u7d22\u5408\u9002\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\u53d8\u6362\u6765\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4e24\u4e2a\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fde\u7eed\u97f3\u4e50\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4e24\u4e2a\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u800c\u5408\u9002\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\u53d8\u6362\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u9690\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\u53d8\u6362\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3KLD\u548c\u5c5e\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e2\u53ef\u63a7\u53c8\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u9690\u53d8\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "relevance": 75.0}}

However, their synergy remains poorly understood, largely due to the lack of systematic benchmarks evaluating their integration in clinical risk prediction. In real-world healthcare, identifying features with causal influence on outcomes is crucial for actionable and trustworthy predictions. While recent work highlights LLMs' emerging causal reasoning abilities, there lacks comprehensive benchmarks to assess their causal learning and performance informed by causal features in clinical risk prediction. To address this, we introduce REACT-LLM, a benchmark designed to evaluate whether combining LLMs with causal features can enhance clinical prognostic performance and potentially outperform traditional machine learning (ML) methods. Unlike existing LLM-clinical benchmarks that often focus on a limited set of outcomes, REACT-LLM evaluates 7 clinical outcomes across 2 real-world datasets, comparing 15 prominent LLMs, 6 traditional ML models, and 3 causal discovery (CD) algorithms. Our findings indicate that while LLMs perform reasonably in clinical prognostics, they have not yet outperformed traditional ML models. Integrating causal features derived from CD algorithms into LLMs offers limited performance gains, primarily due to the strict assumptions of many CD methods, which are often violated in complex clinical data.

For example, the prompt \"an assistant wearing a pink hat\" may reflect female-inclined biases associated with a pink hat. The neglected joint effects of the semantic binding in the prompts cause significant failures in current debiasing approaches. This work initiates a preliminary investigation on how bias manifests under semantic binding, where contextual associations between objects and attributes influence generative outcomes. We demonstrate that the underlying bias distribution can be amplified based on these associations. Therefore, we introduce a bias adherence score that quantifies how specific object-attribute bindings activate bias. To delve deeper, we develop a training-free context-bias control framework to explore how token decoupling can facilitate the debiasing of semantic bindings. This framework achieves over 10% debiasing improvement in compositional generation tasks. Our analysis of bias scores across various attribute-object bindings and token decorrelation highlights a fundamental challenge: reducing bias without disrupting essential semantic relationships. These findings expose critical limitations in current debiasing approaches when applied to semantically bound contexts, underscoring the need to reassess prevailing bias mitigation strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed1\u5b9a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u653e\u5927\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u504f\u89c1\u4f9d\u4ece\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u504f\u89c1\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc710%\u7684\u53bb\u504f\u89c1\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u4e00\u5bf9\u8c61\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e0e\u5c5e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed1\u5b9a\u7684\u8054\u5408\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5f80\u5f80\u5305\u542b\u591a\u4e2a\u8bed\u4e49\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5143\u7d20\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u8054\u4f1a\u653e\u5927\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u73b0\u6709\u53bb\u504f\u89c1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5931\u6548\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51fa\u504f\u89c1\u4f9d\u4ece\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u7279\u5b9a\u5bf9\u8c61-\u5c5e\u6027\u7ed1\u5b9a\u6fc0\u6d3b\u504f\u89c1\u7a0b\u5ea6\n2. \u5f00\u53d1\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u504f\u89c1\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7token\u89e3\u8026\u6765\u6d88\u9664\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed1\u5b9a\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u89c1\n3. \u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u5c5e\u6027-\u5bf9\u8c61\u7ed1\u5b9a\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u8bc4\u5206\u548ctoken\u53bb\u76f8\u5173\u6027", "result": "1. \u8bed\u4e49\u7ed1\u5b9a\u4f1a\u653e\u5927\u5e95\u5c42\u504f\u89c1\u5206\u5e03\n2. \u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u504f\u89c1\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc710%\u7684\u53bb\u504f\u89c1\u6539\u8fdb\n3. \u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5fc5\u8981\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6311\u6218", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u53bb\u504f\u89c1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed1\u5b9a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3b\u6d41\u504f\u89c1\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u51cf\u5c11\u504f\u89c1\u800c\u4e0d\u7834\u574f\u57fa\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6839\u672c\u6027\u6311\u6218\u3002", "relevance": 65.0}}

In this work, we explore the application of denoising diffusion processes as plug-and-play latent constraints for unconditional symbolic music generation models. We focus on a framework that leverages a library of small conditional diffusion models operating as implicit probabilistic priors on the latents of a frozen unconditional backbone. While previous studies have explored domain-specific use cases, this work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to demonstrate the versatility of such an approach across a diverse array of musical attributes, such as note density, pitch range, contour, and rhythm complexity.

Our suite contains 498 tasks across nine widely used data-science, machine-learning, and HPC repositories (e.g., numpy, pandas, scipy): given a complete codebase and a slow workload, an agent must investigate code semantics, localize bottlenecks and relevant tests, and produce a patch that matches or exceeds expert speedup while passing the same unit tests.

Empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art agents reveals significant underperformance. On average, agents achieve less than 0.15x the expert speedup: agents struggle in localizing optimization opportunities, reasoning about execution across functions, and maintaining correctness in proposed edits.

However, generative modeling for HSIs presents several challenges. Due to their high spectral dimensionality, HSIs are too memory-intensive for direct input into conventional diffusion models. Furthermore, general generative models lack an understanding of the topological and geometric structures of ground objects in remote sensing imagery. In addition, most diffusion models optimize loss functions at the noise level, leading to a non-intuitive convergence behavior and suboptimal generation quality for complex data. To address these challenges, we propose a Geometric Enhanced Wavelet-based Diffusion Model (GEWDiff), a novel framework for reconstructing hyperspectral images at 4-times super-resolution. A wavelet-based encoder-decoder is introduced that efficiently compresses HSIs into a latent space while preserving spectral-spatial information.

While large image encoders, high-resolution images, and long-term temporal inputs can significantly enhance feature quality and deliver remarkable performance gains, these techniques are often incompatible in both training and inference due to computational resource constraints. Moreover, different tasks favor distinct feature representations, making it difficult for a single model to perform end-to-end inference across multiple tasks while maintaining accuracy comparable to that of single-task models. To alleviate these issues, we present the HENet and HENet++ framework for multi-task 3D perception and end-to-end autonomous driving. Specifically, we propose a hybrid image encoding network that uses a large image encoder for short-term frames and a small one for long-term frames. Furthermore, our framework simultaneously extracts both dense and sparse features, providing more suitable representations for different tasks, reducing cumulative errors, and delivering more comprehensive information to the planning module. The proposed architecture maintains compatibility with various existing 3D feature extraction methods and supports multimodal inputs.

However, these approaches rely on dense-frame video sequences for photorealistic reconstruction. In real-world scenarios, due to equipment constraints, sometimes only sparse frames are accessible. In this paper, we propose Sparse4DGS, the first method for sparse-frame dynamic scene reconstruction. We observe that dynamic reconstruction methods fail in both canonical and deformed spaces under sparse-frame settings, especially in areas with high texture richness. Sparse4DGS tackles this challenge by focusing on texture-rich areas. For the deformation network, we propose Texture-Aware Deformation Regularization, which introduces a texture-based depth alignment loss to regulate Gaussian deformation. For the canonical Gaussian field, we introduce Texture-Aware Canonical Optimization, which incorporates texture-based noise into the gradient descent process of canonical Gaussians. Extensive experiments show that when taking sparse frames as inputs, our method outperforms existing dynamic or few-shot techniques on NeRF-Synthetic, HyperNeRF, NeRF-DS, and our iPhone-4D datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "Sparse4DGS\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u7a00\u758f\u5e27\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7eb9\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u53d8\u5f62\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u548c\u89c4\u8303\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u5e27\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u5efa\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u52a8\u6001\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5bc6\u96c6\u5e27\u89c6\u9891\u5e8f\u5217\u8fdb\u884c\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7531\u4e8e\u8bbe\u5907\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5f80\u5f80\u53ea\u80fd\u83b7\u53d6\u7a00\u758f\u5e27\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7eb9\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u53d8\u5f62\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u7eb9\u7406\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u635f\u5931\u6765\u8c03\u8282\u9ad8\u65af\u53d8\u5f62\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u7eb9\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u89c4\u8303\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u7eb9\u7406\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u7eb3\u5165\u89c4\u8303\u9ad8\u65af\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728NeRF-Synthetic\u3001HyperNeRF\u3001NeRF-DS\u548ciPhone-4D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u5e27\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u52a8\u6001\u6216\u5c11\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "Sparse4DGS\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u5e27\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7eb9\u7406\u4e30\u5bcc\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "relevance": 15.0}}

Traditional methods typically rely on logical labels, such as binary indicators (e.g., \"yes/no\") that specify whether an instance belongs to a given category. However, in practical applications, label annotations often involve significant uncertainty due to factors such as data noise, inherent ambiguity in the observed entities, and the subjectivity of human annotators. Therefore, representing labels using simplistic binary logic can obscure valuable information and limit the expressiveness of label learning models. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces the concept of fuzzy labels, grounded in fuzzy set theory, to better capture and represent label uncertainty. We further propose an efficient fuzzy labeling method that mines and generates fuzzy labels from the original data, thereby enriching the label space with more informative and nuanced representations.

Inspired by the prevalent use of procedural generators in production 3D applications, we propose a sequentialized, graph-based procedural graph representation for 3D assets. We use this to learn to approximate the landscape of a procedural generator for image-based 3D reconstruction. We employ edge-based tokenization to encode the procedural graphs, and train a transformer prior to predict the next token conditioned on an input RGB image. Crucially, to enable better alignment of our generated outputs to an input image, we incorporate Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) guided sampling into our generation process, steering output procedural graphs towards more image-faithful reconstructions. Our approach is applicable across a variety of objects that can be synthesized with procedural generators. Extensive experiments on cacti, trees, and bridges show that our neural procedural graph generation outperforms both state-of-the-art generative 3D methods and domain-specific modeling techniques.

All methods exceed 90% accuracy in binary violence detection. The 3D CNN achieves superior calibration (ROC AUC 92.59%) at roughly half the energy cost (240 Wh vs. 570 Wh) of federated LoRA, while VLMs provide richer multimodal reasoning.

This highlights the urgent need for continuously updating AI-generated image detectors to adapt to new generators. To overcome low efficiency and catastrophic forgetting in detector updates, we propose LiteUpdate, a lightweight framework for updating AI-generated image detectors. LiteUpdate employs a representative sample selection module that leverages image confidence and gradient-based discriminative features to precisely select boundary samples. This approach improves learning and detection accuracy on new distributions with limited generated images, significantly enhancing detector update efficiency. Additionally, LiteUpdate incorporates a model merging module that fuses weights from multiple fine-tuning trajectories, including pre-trained, representative, and random updates. This balances the adaptability to new generators and mitigates the catastrophic forgetting of prior knowledge. Experiments demonstrate that LiteUpdate substantially boosts detection performance in various detectors.

The proposed approach scales well with model complexity, accommodates general properties and backbones, and provides full satisfaction guarantees. We evaluate SMiLE on monotonicity, global robustness, and individual fairness, on synthetic and real data, for regression and classification tasks.

We compare a direct approach to a specialized global-to-local learning strategy and find mean absolute errors on the relevant anatomical measurements of 0.506mm for the Keros, 4.516\u00b0 for the Gera and 0.802mm / 0.777mm for the TMS classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u70ed\u56fe\u56de\u5f52\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5173\u952e\u89e3\u5256\u6807\u5fd7\u70b9\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u9f3b\u7aa6\u624b\u672f\u7684\u89e3\u5256\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u672f\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u9f3b\u7aa6\u624b\u672f\u9700\u8981\u4ed4\u7ec6\u7684\u672f\u524d\u9885\u5e95\u89e3\u5256\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u5256\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u5206\u9700\u8981\u8017\u65f6\u7684\u624b\u52a8\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u70ed\u56fe\u56de\u5f52\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5173\u952e\u89e3\u5256\u6807\u5fd7\u70b9\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u76f4\u63a5\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u5230\u5c40\u90e8\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u89e3\u5256\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0a\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a\uff1aKeros\u8bc4\u52060.506mm\uff0cGera\u8bc4\u52064.516\u00b0\uff0cTMS\u5206\u7c7b0.802mm/0.777mm\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7ba1\u9053\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u89e3\u5256\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u4e3a\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u9f3b\u7aa6\u624b\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u672f\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "relevance": 10.0}}

Each memory is a time-semantic-relational entity-a structure that simultaneously encodes when an event occurred, what it means, and how it connects to other events. Built initially atop PostgreSQL with pgvector extensions, MemoriesDB combines the properties of a time-series datastore, a vector database, and a graph system within a single append-only schema. Each memory is represented as a vertex uniquely labeled by its microsecond timestamp and accompanied by low- and high-dimensional normalized embeddings that capture semantic context. Directed edges between memories form labeled relations with per-edge metadata, enabling multiple contextual links between the same vertices. Together these constructs form a time-indexed stack of temporal-semantic surfaces, where edges project as directional arrows in a 1+1-dimensional similarity field, tracing the evolution of meaning through time while maintaining cross-temporal coherence. This formulation supports efficient time-bounded retrieval, hybrid semantic search, and lightweight structural reasoning in a single query path.

A critical flaw in existing methods is that the poison rate required for a successful attack induces a proportional, and thus noticeable, drop in Clean Accuracy (CA), undermining their stealthiness. This paper presents a new paradigm for clean-image attacks that minimizes this accuracy degradation by optimizing the trigger itself. We introduce Generative Clean-Image Backdoors (GCB), a framework that uses a conditional InfoGAN to identify naturally occurring image features that can serve as potent and stealthy triggers. By ensuring these triggers are easily separable from benign task-related features, GCB enables a victim model to learn the backdoor from an extremely small set of poisoned examples, resulting in a CA drop of less than 1%. Our experiments demonstrate GCB's remarkable versatility, successfully adapting to six datasets, five architectures, and four tasks, including the first demonstration of clean-image backdoors in regression and segmentation. GCB also exhibits resilience against most of the existing backdoor defenses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5e72\u51c0\u56fe\u50cf\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5GCB\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u6761\u4ef6InfoGAN\u8bc6\u522b\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9690\u853d\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u653b\u51fb\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6c61\u67d3\u7387\uff0c\u4f7f\u5e72\u51c0\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u5c0f\u4e8e1%\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5e72\u51c0\u56fe\u50cf\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u6c61\u67d3\u7387\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u660e\u663e\u7684\u5e72\u51c0\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9690\u853d\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9690\u853d\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u672c\u8eab\u6765\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u635f\u5931\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5e72\u51c0\u56fe\u50cf\u540e\u95e8(GCB)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6761\u4ef6InfoGAN\u8bc6\u522b\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u9690\u853d\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u786e\u4fdd\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u4e0e\u826f\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5f81\u6613\u4e8e\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u4f7f\u53d7\u5bb3\u8005\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u4ece\u6781\u5c11\u91cf\u6c61\u67d3\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u95e8\u3002", "result": "GCB\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u4e94\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u56db\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5e72\u51c0\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u5c0f\u4e8e1%\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9996\u6b21\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5e72\u51c0\u56fe\u50cf\u540e\u95e8\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0cGCB\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u591a\u6570\u540e\u95e8\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u6297\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "GCB\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9690\u853d\u7684\u5e72\u51c0\u56fe\u50cf\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u653b\u51fb\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6c61\u67d3\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6b63\u5e38\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5bf9AI\u5b89\u5168\u6784\u6210\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\u3002", "relevance": 65.0}}

We develop an adapter framework using a learnable decoder and causal tokens that extract causal signals from TabPFN's frozen embeddings and decode them into adjacency matrices for causal discovery. Our evaluations demonstrate that TabPFN's embeddings contain causal information, outperforming several traditional causal discovery algorithms, with such causal information being concentrated in mid-range layers.

We investigate ritual as a design scaffold for developing collaborative, multi-user human-AI engagement.

During a two-week run, over five hundred audience members contributed sketches and jazzercise moves that vision language models translated to virtual scenery elements and from choreographic prompts. This paper discusses four facets of interaction-as-ritual within the show: audience input as offerings that AI transforms into components of the ritual; performers as ritual guides, demonstrating how to interact with technology and sorting audience members into cohorts; AI systems as instruments \"played\" by the humans, in which sensing, generative components, and stagecraft create systems that can be mastered over time; and reciprocity of interaction, in which the show's AI machinery guides human behavior as well as being guided by humans, completing a human-AI feedback loop that visibly reshapes the virtual world. Ritual served as a frame for integrating linear narrative, character identity, music and interaction.

This study introduces a remote sensing-driven framework to quantify WASH accessibility-specifically to water pumps, latrines, and bathing cubicles-in the Rohingya camps of Cox's Bazar, one of the world's most densely populated displacement settings. Detecting refugee shelters in such emergent camps presents substantial challenges, primarily due to their dense spatial configuration and irregular geometric patterns. Using sub-meter satellite images, we develop a semi-supervised segmentation framework that achieves an F1-score of 76.4% in detecting individual refugee shelters. Applying the framework across multi-year data reveals declining WASH accessibility, driven by rapid refugee population growth and reduced facility availability, rising from 25 people per facility in 2022 to 29.4 in 2025. Gender-disaggregated analysis further shows that women and girls experience reduced accessibility, in scenarios with inadequate safety-related segregation in WASH facilities. These findings suggest the importance of demand-responsive allocation strategies that can identify areas with under-served populations-such as women and girls-and ensure that limited infrastructure serves the greatest number of people in settings with fixed or shrinking budgets.

In the limit of infinitely large widths and small learning rate, the kernel that is obtained allows to represent the output of the learned model with a closed-form solution. This closed-form solution hinges on the invertibility of the limiting kernel, a property that often holds on real-world datasets. In this work, we analyze the sensitivity of large ReLU networks to increasing depths by characterizing the corresponding limiting kernel. Our theoretical results demonstrate that the normalized limiting kernel approaches the matrix of ones. In contrast, they show the corresponding closed-form solution approaches a fixed limit on the sphere.

As collecting representative examples of all possible anomalies is infeasible, we tackle structural anomaly detection using a self-supervised autoencoder that learns to repair corrupted inputs. To this end, we introduce a corruption model that injects artificial disruptions into training images to mimic structural defects. While reminiscent of denoising autoencoders, our approach differs in two key aspects. First, instead of unstructured i.i.d.\\ noise, we apply structured, spatially coherent perturbations that make the task a hybrid of segmentation and inpainting. Second, and counterintuitively, we add and preserve Gaussian noise on top of the occlusions, which acts as a Tikhonov regularizer anchoring the Jacobian of the reconstruction function toward identity. This identity-anchored regularization stabilizes reconstruction and further improves both detection and segmentation accuracy.

Current multi-modal solutions suffer from static semantic rigidity: predefined candidate words fail to adapt to dataset-specific concepts, and fixed fusion strategies ignore evolving feature interactions. To overcome these limitations, we propose Multi-DProxy, a novel multi-modal dynamic proxy learning framework that leverages cross-modal alignment through learnable textual proxies. Multi-DProxy introduces 1) gated cross-modal fusion that synthesizes discriminative joint representations by adaptively modeling feature interactions. 2) dual-constraint proxy optimization where user interest constraints enforce semantic consistency with domain concepts while concept constraints employ hard example mining to enhance cluster discrimination. 3) dynamic candidate management that refines textual proxies through iterative clustering feedback. Therefore, Multi-DProxy not only effectively captures a user's interest through proxies but also enables the identification of relevant clusterings with greater precision.

We then compare pre-attack and post-attack mitigation responses from the target model, ChatGPT-5 Thinking, to measure the impact of the attack on model performance, using an established evaluation rubric designed for human experts and judge LLMs. Our results show that small perturbations degrade LLM performance by weakening the linkage between observed network traffic features and attack behavior, and by reducing the specificity and practicality of recommended mitigations for resource-constrained devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u653b\u51fb\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u7834\u574fRAG\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4LLM\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0cLLM\u88ab\u7528\u4e8e\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e5f\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u9762\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5LLM\u5728\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u5b89\u5168\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u653b\u51fb\u63cf\u8ff0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8bcd\u7ea7\u3001\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u6765\u7834\u574fRAG\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u6bd4\u8f83\u653b\u51fb\u524d\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u6270\u52a8\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86LLM\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u524a\u5f31\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u6d41\u91cf\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u653b\u51fb\u884c\u4e3a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u5efa\u8bae\u7684\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u5728\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u5b89\u5168\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u5176\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

By aligning visual and textual information, our approach effectively generalizes to unseen objects and provides robust OOD segmentation in diverse driving environments.\n  We conduct extensive experiments on publicly available OOD segmentation datasets such as Fishyscapes, Segment-Me-If-You-Can, and Road Anomaly datasets, demonstrating that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across both pixel-level and object-level evaluations.

However, existing RSSI-based positioning methods often suffer from reduced accuracy due to environmental complexity and challenges in processing multi-source information. To address these issues, we propose a novel multi-graph heterogeneous GNN framework (MG-HGNN) to enhance spatial awareness and improve positioning performance. In this framework, two graph construction branches perform node and edge embedding, respectively, to generate informative graphs. Subsequently, a heterogeneous graph neural network is employed for graph representation learning, enabling accurate positioning. The MG-HGNN framework introduces the following key innovations: 1) multi-type task-directed graph construction that combines label estimation and feature encoding for richer graph information; 2) a heterogeneous GNN structure that enhances the performance of conventional GNN models. Evaluations on the UJIIndoorLoc and UTSIndoorLoc public datasets demonstrate that MG-HGNN not only achieves superior performance compared to several state-of-the-art methods, but also provides a novel perspective for enhancing GNN-based localization methods. Ablation studies further confirm the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u56fe\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684Wi-Fi\u6307\u7eb9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6846\u67b6MG-HGNN\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8282\u70b9\u548c\u8fb9\u5d4c\u5165\u6784\u5efa\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8fdb\u884c\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684RSSI\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6e90\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u9700\u8981\u589e\u5f3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u5206\u652f\u5206\u522b\u8fdb\u884c\u8282\u70b9\u548c\u8fb9\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u7c7b\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u56fe\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u91c7\u7528\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8fdb\u884c\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728UJIIndoorLoc\u548cUTSIndoorLoc\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cMG-HGNN\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MG-HGNN\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8eGNN\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "relevance": 10.0}}

Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution, but their effectiveness depends heavily on how they are prompted. Unlike generic code summarization, test-code summarization poses distinct challenges because test methods validate expected behavior through assertions rather than im- plementing functionality. This paper presents a new benchmark of 91 real-world Java test cases paired with developer-written summaries and conducts a controlled ablation study to investigate how test code-related components-such as the method under test (MUT), assertion messages, and assertion semantics-affect the performance of LLM-generated test summaries. We evaluate four code LLMs (Codex, Codestral, DeepSeek, and Qwen-Coder) across seven prompt configurations using n-gram metrics (BLEU, ROUGE-L, METEOR), semantic similarity (BERTScore), and LLM-based evaluation. Results show that prompting with as- sertion semantics improves summary quality by an average of 0.10 points (2.3%) over full MUT context (4.45 vs. 4.35) while requiring fewer input tokens. Codex and Qwen-Coder achieve the highest alignment with human-written summaries, while DeepSeek underperforms despite high lexical overlap.

Recent methods have introduced a retrieval mechanism that retrieves query-relevant KV caches for question answering, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of long real-world videos. However, the compression and retrieval of KV caches are still not fully explored. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{StreamKV}, a training-free framework that seamlessly equips Video-LLMs with advanced KV cache retrieval and compression. Compared to previous methods that used uniform partitioning, StreamKV dynamically partitions video streams into semantic segments, which better preserves semantic information. For KV cache retrieval, StreamKV calculates a summary vector for each segment to retain segment-level information essential for retrieval. For KV cache compression, StreamKV introduces a guidance prompt designed to capture the key semantic elements within each segment, ensuring only the most informative KV caches are retained for answering questions. Moreover, StreamKV unifies KV cache retrieval and compression within a single module, performing both in a layer-adaptive manner, thereby further improving the effectiveness of streaming video question answering. Extensive experiments on public StreamingVQA benchmarks demonstrate that StreamKV significantly outperforms existing Online Video-LLMs, achieving superior accuracy while substantially improving both memory efficiency and computational latency.

Building on this perspective, we develop a thermodynamic framework to describe the stationary distributions of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with weight decay for scale-invariant neural networks, a setting that both reflects practical architectures with normalization layers and permits theoretical analysis. We establish analogies between training hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, weight decay) and thermodynamic variables such as temperature, pressure, and volume. Starting with a simplified isotropic noise model, we uncover a close correspondence between SGD dynamics and ideal gas behavior, validated through theory and simulation. Extending to training of neural networks, we show that key predictions of the framework, including the behavior of stationary entropy, align closely with experimental observations.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is sensitive to acute ischemic stroke and is a common diagnostic method for stroke. However, manual lesion segmentation performed by experts is tedious, time-consuming, and prone to observer inconsistency. Automatic medical image analysis methods have been proposed to overcome this challenge. However, previous approaches have relied on hand-crafted features that may not capture the irregular and physiologically complex shapes of ischemic stroke lesions. In this study, we present a novel framework for quickly and automatically segmenting ischemic stroke lesions on various MRI sequences, including T1-weighted, T2-weighted, DWI, and FLAIR. The proposed methodology is validated on the ISLES 2015 Brain Stroke sequence dataset, where we trained our model using the Res-Unet architecture twice: first, with pre-existing weights, and then without, to explore the benefits of transfer learning. Evaluation metrics, including the Dice score and sensitivity, were computed across 3D volumes. Finally, a Majority Voting Classifier was integrated to amalgamate the outcomes from each axis, resulting in a comprehensive segmentation method.

The dataset comprises 75 high-resolution phase-contrast microscopy images with over 12,000 annotated cells, providing a realistic testbed for biomedical image analysis. It includes soma annotations and morphological cell categorization provided by biologists. Additional categorization of cells, based on morphology, aims to enhance the utilization of image data for cancer cell research. Glioma C6 consists of two parts: the first is curated with controlled parameters for benchmarking, while the second supports generalization testing under varying conditions.

Existing approaches typically navigate to proximity-based regions without considering affordances, resulting in frequent manipulation failures. We propose Affordance-Guided Coarse-to-Fine Exploration, a zero-shot framework for base placement that integrates semantic understanding from vision-language models (VLMs) with geometric feasibility through an iterative optimization process. Our method constructs cross-modal representations, namely Affordance RGB and Obstacle Map+, to align semantics with spatial context. This enables reasoning that extends beyond the egocentric limitations of RGB perception. To ensure interaction is guided by task-relevant affordances, we leverage coarse semantic priors from VLMs to guide the search toward task-relevant regions and refine placements with geometric constraints, thereby reducing the risk of convergence to local optima.

However, existing approaches often neglect the deeper causal relationships and interactions between objects, which are critical for understanding anomalous behaviors. In this paper, we propose VADER, an LLM-driven framework for Video Anomaly unDErstanding, which integrates keyframe object Relation features with visual cues to enhance anomaly comprehension from video. Specifically, VADER first applies an Anomaly Scorer to assign per-frame anomaly scores, followed by a Context-AwarE Sampling (CAES) strategy to capture the causal context of each anomalous event. A Relation Feature Extractor and a COntrastive Relation Encoder (CORE) jointly model dynamic object interactions, producing compact relational representations for downstream reasoning. These visual and relational cues are integrated with LLMs to generate detailed, causally grounded descriptions and support robust anomaly-related question answering. Experiments on multiple real-world VAU benchmarks demonstrate that VADER achieves strong results across anomaly description, explanation, and causal reasoning tasks, advancing the frontier of explainable video anomaly analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "VADER\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u7406\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u5bf9\u8c61\u5173\u7cfb\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u5f02\u5e38\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5f02\u5e38\u884c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u66f4\u6df1\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u5f02\u5e38\u884c\u4e3a\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "VADER\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u5f02\u5e38\u8bc4\u5206\u5668\u4e3a\u6bcf\u5e27\u5206\u914d\u5f02\u5e38\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u6355\u6349\u5f02\u5e38\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002\u5173\u7cfb\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5173\u7cfb\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5171\u540c\u5efa\u6a21\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u8c61\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u7ebf\u7d22\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754cVAU\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cVADER\u5728\u5f02\u5e38\u63cf\u8ff0\u3001\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5f3a\u52b2\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "VADER\u6846\u67b6\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u5206\u6790\u7684\u524d\u6cbf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u7b54\u3002", "relevance": 65.0}}

Extended version with full Appendix", "summary": "Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) aims to adapt a source-pretrained object detector to a target domain without access to source data. However, existing SFOD methods predominantly rely on internal knowledge from the source model, which limits their capacity to generalize across domains and often results in biased pseudo-labels, thereby hindering both transferability and discriminability. In contrast, Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), pretrained on massive and diverse data, exhibit strong perception capabilities and broad generalization, yet their potential remains largely untapped in the SFOD setting. In this paper, we propose a novel SFOD framework that leverages VFMs as external knowledge sources to jointly enhance feature alignment and label quality. Specifically, we design three VFM-based modules: (1) Patch-weighted Global Feature Alignment (PGFA) distills global features from VFMs using patch-similarity-based weighting to enhance global feature transferability; (2) Prototype-based Instance Feature Alignment (PIFA) performs instance-level contrastive learning guided by momentum-updated VFM prototypes; and (3) Dual-source Enhanced Pseudo-label Fusion (DEPF) fuses predictions from detection VFMs and teacher models via an entropy-aware strategy to yield more reliable supervision. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art SFOD performance, validating the effectiveness of integrating VFMs to simultaneously improve transferability and discriminability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u65e0\u6e90\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u6e90\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u8054\u5408\u589e\u5f3a\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u6e90\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u5bfc\u81f4\u6709\u504f\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u3002\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u65e0\u6e90\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6a21\u5757\uff1a1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u8865\u4e01\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u52a0\u6743\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b2) \u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u91cf\u66f4\u65b0\u539f\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b3) \u901a\u8fc7\u71b5\u611f\u77e5\u7b56\u7565\u878d\u5408\u68c0\u6d4b\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u53cc\u6e90\u589e\u5f3a\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u878d\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65e0\u6e90\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u96c6\u6210\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u548c\u5224\u522b\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u6e90\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u6e90\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "relevance": 65.0}}

While these expressive models do not yet match the peak performance of state-of-the-art Transformers, their potential has been largely untapped due to prohibitively slow training and low hardware utilization. Existing parallelization methods force a fundamental conflict governed by the chunksize hyperparameter: large chunks boost speed but degrade performance, necessitating a fixed, suboptimal compromise. To solve this challenge, we introduce TNT, a novel training paradigm that decouples training efficiency from inference performance through a two-stage process. Stage one is an efficiency-focused pre-training phase utilizing a hierarchical memory. A global module processes large, hardware-friendly chunks for long-range context, while multiple parallel local modules handle fine-grained details. Crucially, by periodically resetting local memory states, we break sequential dependencies to enable massive context parallelization. Stage two is a brief fine-tuning phase where only the local memory modules are adapted to a smaller, high-resolution chunksize, maximizing accuracy with minimal overhead. Evaluated on Titans and TTT models, TNT achieves a substantial acceleration in training speed-up to 17 times faster than the most accurate baseline configuration - while simultaneously improving model accuracy. This improvement removes a critical scalability barrier, establishing a practical foundation for developing expressive RNNs and facilitating future work to close the performance gap with Transformers.", "AI": {"tldr": "TNT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u89e3\u51b3\u6df1\u5ea6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8bb0\u5fc6RNN\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u5185\u5b58\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u8fdb\u884c\u7b80\u77ed\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea617\u500d\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8bb0\u5fc6RNN\uff08\u5982Titans\u548cTTT\uff09\u867d\u7136\u5177\u6709\u7ebf\u6027\u6269\u5c55\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u6781\u6162\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u5176\u6f5c\u529b\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u6316\u6398\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5757\u5927\u5c0f\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u5185\u5b58\u8fdb\u884c\u6548\u7387\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u5757\u5904\u7406\u5927\u5757\u957f\u7a0b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u591a\u4e2a\u5e76\u884c\u672c\u5730\u6a21\u5757\u5904\u7406\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u671f\u91cd\u7f6e\u672c\u5730\u5185\u5b58\u72b6\u6001\u6253\u7834\u987a\u5e8f\u4f9d\u8d56\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u4ec5\u5bf9\u672c\u5730\u5185\u5b58\u6a21\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5bf8\u5757\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728Titans\u548cTTT\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cTNT\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe17\u500d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86RNN\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u969c\u788d\u3002", "conclusion": "TNT\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u8868\u8fbe\u6027RNN\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e0eTransformer\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

We present YoNoSplat, a feedforward model that reconstructs high-quality 3D Gaussian Splatting representations from an arbitrary number of images. Our model is highly versatile, operating effectively with both posed and unposed, calibrated and uncalibrated inputs. YoNoSplat predicts local Gaussians and camera poses for each view, which are aggregated into a global representation using either predicted or provided poses. To overcome the inherent difficulty of jointly learning 3D Gaussians and camera parameters, we introduce a novel mixing training strategy. This approach mitigates the entanglement between the two tasks by initially using ground-truth poses to aggregate local Gaussians and gradually transitioning to a mix of predicted and ground-truth poses, which prevents both training instability and exposure bias. We further resolve the scale ambiguity problem by a novel pairwise camera-distance normalization scheme and by embedding camera intrinsics into the network. Moreover, YoNoSplat also predicts intrinsic parameters, making it feasible for uncalibrated inputs.

Yet, developing downstream vision models for infrared applications is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality annotated data, due to the specialized expertise required for infrared annotation. While synthetic infrared image generation has the potential to accelerate model development by providing large-scale, diverse training data, training foundation-level generative diffusion models in the infrared domain has remained elusive due to limited datasets. In light of such data constraints, we explore an inference-time scaling approach using a domain-adapted CLIP-based verifier for enhanced infrared image generation quality. We adapt FLUX.1-dev, a state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion model, to the infrared domain by finetuning it on a small sample of infrared images using parameter-efficient techniques. The trained verifier is then employed during inference to guide the diffusion sampling process toward higher quality infrared generations that better align with input text prompts. Empirically, we find that our approach leads to consistent improvements in generation quality, reducing FID scores on the KAIST Multispectral Pedestrian Detection Benchmark dataset by 10% compared to unguided baseline samples.

While recent work highlights the role of exploration and entropy stability in improving pass@K, empirical evidence points to a paradox: RLVR and ORM/PRM typically reinforce existing tree-like reasoning paths rather than expanding the reasoning scope, raising the question of why exploration helps at all if no new patterns emerge.\n  To reconcile this paradox, we adopt the perspective of Kim et al. (2025), viewing easy (e.g., simplifying a fraction) versus hard (e.g., discovering a symmetry) reasoning steps as low- versus high-probability Markov transitions, and formalize post-training dynamics through Multi-task Tree-structured Markov Chains (TMC). In this tractable model, pretraining corresponds to tree expansion, while post-training corresponds to chain-of-thought reweighting. We show that several phenomena recently observed in empirical studies arise naturally in this setting: (1) RLVR induces a squeezing effect, reducing reasoning entropy and forgetting some correct paths; (2) population rewards of ORM/PRM encourage consistency rather than accuracy, thereby favoring common patterns; and (3) certain rare, high-uncertainty reasoning paths by the base model are responsible for solving hard problem instances.\n  Together, these explain why exploration -- even when confined to the base model's reasoning scope -- remains essential: it preserves access to rare but crucial reasoning traces needed for difficult cases, which are squeezed out by RLVR or unfavored by inference scaling. Building on this, we further show that exploration strategies such as rejecting easy instances and KL regularization help preserve rare reasoning traces.

Although more flexible and generalizable than conventional models, the practical use of these approaches remains limited by scalability due to the cost of calling one LLM for every traveler. Moreover, it has been found that LLM agents often make opaque choices and produce unstable day-to-day dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose to model each homogeneous traveler group facing the same decision context with a single representative LLM agent who behaves like the population's average, maintaining and updating a mixed strategy over routes that coincides with the group's aggregate flow proportions. Each day, the LLM reviews the travel experience and flags routes with positive reinforcement that they hope to use more often, and an interpretable update rule then converts this judgment into strategy adjustments using a tunable (progressively decaying) step size. The representative-agent design improves scalability, while the separation of reasoning from updating clarifies the decision logic while stabilizing learning. In classic traffic assignment settings, we find that the proposed approach converges rapidly to the user equilibrium. In richer settings with income heterogeneity, multi-criteria costs, and multi-modal choices, the generated dynamics remain stable and interpretable, reproducing plausible behavioral patterns well-documented in psychology and economics, for example, the decoy effect in toll versus non-toll road selection, and higher willingness-to-pay for convenience among higher-income travelers when choosing between driving, transit, and park-and-ride options.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee3\u8868\u6027LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u540c\u8d28\u65c5\u884c\u8005\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u4ea4\u901a\u5206\u914d\u548c\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u90fd\u80fd\u6536\u655b\u5230\u7528\u6237\u5747\u8861\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u5728\u4ea4\u901a\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u56e0\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65c5\u884c\u8005\u90fd\u9700\u8981\u8c03\u7528LLM\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u548c\u65e5\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u540c\u8d28\u65c5\u884c\u8005\u7fa4\u4f53\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027LLM\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u7ef4\u62a4\u548c\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0e\u7fa4\u4f53\u6d41\u91cf\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u89c4\u5219\u5c06LLM\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u4ea4\u901a\u5206\u914d\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u5230\u7528\u6237\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u590d\u73b0\u4e86\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u4e2d\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4ee3\u7406\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u79bb\u6f84\u6e05\u4e86\u51b3\u7b56\u903b\u8f91\u5e76\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u5728\u4ea4\u901a\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "relevance": 65.0}}

Under mild complexity conditions linking consecutive curriculum stages, we show that curriculum post-training avoids the exponential complexity bottleneck.\n  To substantiate this result, drawing insights from the Chain-of-Thoughts (CoTs) solving mathematical problems such as Countdown and parity, we model CoT generation as a states-conditioned autoregressive reasoning tree, define a uniform-branching base model to capture pretrained behavior, and formalize curriculum stages as either depth-increasing (longer reasoning chains) or hint-decreasing (shorter prefixes) subtasks.

Previous image-based streaming diffusion models have powered efficient and creative live streaming products but have hit limits on temporal consistency due to the foundation of image-based designs. Recent advances in video diffusion have markedly improved temporal consistency and sampling efficiency for offline generation. However, offline generation systems primarily optimize throughput by batching large workloads. In contrast, live online streaming operates under strict service-level objectives (SLOs): time-to-first-frame must be minimal, and every frame must meet a per-frame deadline with low jitter. Besides, scalable multi-GPU serving for real-time streams remains largely unresolved so far. To address this, we present StreamDiffusionV2, a training-free pipeline for interactive live streaming with video diffusion models. StreamDiffusionV2 integrates an SLO-aware batching scheduler and a block scheduler, together with a sink-token--guided rolling KV cache, a motion-aware noise controller, and other system-level optimizations. Moreover, we introduce a scalable pipeline orchestration that parallelizes the diffusion process across denoising steps and network layers, achieving near-linear FPS scaling without violating latency guarantees. The system scales seamlessly across heterogeneous GPU environments and supports flexible denoising steps (e.g., 1--4), enabling both ultra-low-latency and higher-quality modes. Without TensorRT or quantization, StreamDiffusionV2 renders the first frame within 0.5s and attains 58.28 FPS with a 14B-parameter model and 64.52 FPS with a 1.3B-parameter model on four H100 GPUs, making state-of-the-art generative live streaming practical and accessible--from individual creators to enterprise-scale platforms.", "AI": {"tldr": "StreamDiffusionV2\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u65f6\u76f4\u64ad\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7SLO\u611f\u77e5\u6279\u5904\u7406\u8c03\u5ea6\u3001\u5757\u8c03\u5ea6\u3001\u6eda\u52a8KV\u7f13\u5b58\u7b49\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5e27\u7387\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u76f4\u64ad\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5dee\u3001\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u670d\u52a1\u7ea7\u522b\u76ee\u6807\uff08SLO\uff09\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u96c6\u6210SLO\u611f\u77e5\u6279\u5904\u7406\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u3001\u5757\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u3001sink-token\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6eda\u52a8KV\u7f13\u5b58\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u566a\u58f0\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7b49\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\u7f16\u6392\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u9aa4\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u5c42\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u57284\u4e2aH100 GPU\u4e0a\uff0c14B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u523058.28 FPS\uff0c1.3B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u523064.52 FPS\uff0c\u9996\u5e27\u6e32\u67d3\u65f6\u95f4\u5c0f\u4e8e0.5\u79d2\uff0c\u652f\u63011-4\u6b65\u53bb\u566a\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "conclusion": "StreamDiffusionV2\u4f7f\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u76f4\u64ad\u53d8\u5f97\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u4ece\u4e2a\u4eba\u521b\u4f5c\u8005\u5230\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7\u5e73\u53f0\u90fd\u80fd\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "relevance": 65.0}}

A crucial question about AI reasoning is whether models can extrapolate learned reasoning patterns to solve harder tasks with longer chain-of-thought (CoT). In this work, we present a theoretical analysis of transformers learning on synthetic state-tracking tasks with gradient descent. We mathematically prove how the algebraic structure of state-tracking problems governs the degree of extrapolation of the learned CoT. Specifically, our theory characterizes the length generalization of transformers through the mechanism of attention concentration, linking the retrieval robustness of the attention layer to the state-tracking task structure of long-context reasoning. Moreover, for transformers with limited reasoning length, we prove that a recursive self-training scheme can progressively extend the range of solvable problem lengths. To our knowledge, we provide the first optimization guarantee that constant-depth transformers provably learn $\\mathsf{NC}^1$-complete problems with CoT, significantly going beyond prior art confined in $\\mathsf{TC}^0$, unless the widely held conjecture $\\mathsf{TC}^0 \\neq \\mathsf{NC}^1$ fails.

Recent advances often integrate frequency-domain modules to compensate for self-attention's low-pass nature by restoring the high-frequency signals critical for personalized recommendations. Nevertheless, existing frequency-aware solutions process each session in isolation and optimize exclusively with time-domain objectives. Consequently, they overlook cross-session spectral dependencies and fail to enforce alignment between predicted and actual spectral signatures, leaving valuable frequency information under-exploited. To this end, we propose FreqRec, a Frequency-Enhanced Dual-Path Network for sequential Recommendation that jointly captures inter-session and intra-session behaviors via a learnable Frequency-domain Multi-layer Perceptrons. Moreover, FreqRec is optimized under a composite objective that combines cross entropy with a frequency-domain consistency loss, explicitly aligning predicted and true spectral signatures.

The core idea of our work is to leverage the rich priors in well-trained video models to extract the common motion patterns and then embed them into a shared low-dimensional latent space. Specifically, we first generate multiple videos of the same object with diverse motions. We then embed each motion into a latent vector and train a shared motion decoder to learn the distribution of motions represented by a structured and compact motion representation, i.e., neural key point trajectories. The canonical 3D Gaussians are then driven by these key points and fused to model the geometry and appearance. During inference time with learned latent space, we can instantly sample diverse 3D motions in a single-forward pass and support several interesting applications including 3D motion interpolation and language-guided motion generation.

Shortening these sequences typically involves costly, time-consuming experimental campaigns. Ideally, we could instead use modern models of massive databases of sequences from nature to learn how to propose shrunken proteins that resemble sequences found in nature. Unfortunately, these models struggle to efficiently search the combinatorial space of all deletions, and are not trained with inductive biases to learn how to delete. To address this gap, we propose SCISOR, a novel discrete diffusion model that deletes letters from sequences to generate protein samples that resemble those found in nature. To do so, SCISOR trains a de-noiser to reverse a forward noising process that adds random insertions to natural sequences.

However, safety regulations and operational constraints in operating rooms (ORs) limit embodied agents from freely perceiving and interacting in realistic settings.

How we may create photorealistic and dynamic digital representations of ORs that capture relevant spatial, visual, and behavioral complexity remains unclear. We introduce TwinOR, a framework for constructing photorealistic, dynamic digital twins of ORs for embodied AI research. The system reconstructs static geometry from pre-scan videos and continuously models human and equipment motion through multi-view perception of OR activities. The static and dynamic components are fused into an immersive 3D environment that supports controllable simulation and embodied exploration. The proposed framework reconstructs complete OR geometry with centimeter level accuracy while preserving dynamic interaction across surgical workflows, enabling realistic renderings and a virtual playground for embodied AI systems. In our experiments, TwinOR simulates stereo and monocular sensor streams for geometry understanding and visual localization tasks. Models such as FoundationStereo and ORB-SLAM3 on TwinOR-synthesized data achieve performance within their reported accuracy on real indoor datasets, demonstrating that TwinOR provides sensor-level realism sufficient for perception and localization challenges.

A promising solution is to use cascaded inference, where small, cheap models handle easy queries, and only the hardest examples are escalated to more powerful models. However, existing cascade methods typically rely on supervised training with labeled data, offer no theoretical generalization guarantees, and provide limited control over test-time computational cost. We introduce C3PO (Cost Controlled Cascaded Prediction Optimization), a self-supervised framework for optimizing LLM cascades under probabilistic cost constraints. By focusing on minimizing regret with respect to the most powerful model (MPM), C3PO avoids the need for labeled data by constructing a cascade using only unlabeled model outputs. It leverages conformal prediction to bound the probability that inference cost exceeds a user-specified budget. We provide theoretical guarantees on both cost control and generalization error, and show that our optimization procedure is effective even with small calibration sets. Empirically, C3PO achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse set of reasoning benchmarks including GSM8K, MATH-500, BigBench-Hard and AIME, outperforming strong LLM cascading baselines in both accuracy and cost-efficiency.

Previous approaches leverage techniques such as flow or Schr\u00f6dinger bridge matching to implicitly learn joint trajectories through data snapshots. However, many systems, including biomolecular systems and heterogeneous cell populations, undergo dynamic interactions that evolve over their trajectory and cannot be captured through static snapshots. To close this gap, we introduce Entangled Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge Matching (EntangledSBM), a framework that learns the first- and second-order stochastic dynamics of interacting, multi-particle systems where the direction and magnitude of each particle's path depend dynamically on the paths of the other particles.

However, evaluations on broad downstream tasks reveal a consistent suboptimality of the routers in existing MoE LLMs, which results in a severe performance gap (e.g., 10-20% in accuracy) to the optimal routing. In this paper, we show that aligning the manifold of routing weights with that of task embedding can effectively reduce the gap and improve MoE LLMs' generalization performance. Our method, \"Routing Manifold Alignment (RoMA)\", introduces an additional manifold regularization term in the post-training objective and only requires lightweight finetuning of routers (with other parameters frozen). Specifically, the regularization encourages the routing weights of each sample to be close to those of its successful neighbors (whose routing weights lead to correct answers) in a task embedding space. Consequently, samples targeting similar tasks will share similar expert choices across layers. Building such bindings between tasks and experts over different samples is essential to achieve better generalization. Moreover, RoMA demonstrates the advantage of unifying the task understanding (by embedding models) with solution generation (by MoE LLMs). In experiments, we finetune routers in OLMoE, DeepSeekMoE, and Qwen3-MoE using RoMA.

To improve the energy and area efficiency of the sparse HDC operations, this work introduces the compressed item memory (CompIM) and simplifies the spatial bundling.

Ultimately, our optimizations achieve a 1.73x more energy- and 2.20x more area-efficient hardware design than the naive sparse implementation.

However, most ICM frameworks utilize learned image compression (LIC) models that operate at a fixed rate and require separate training for each target bitrate, which may limit their practical applications. Existing variable rate LIC approaches mitigate this limitation but typically depend on training, increasing computational cost and deployment complexity. Moreover, variable rate control has not been thoroughly explored for ICM. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free, adaptive quantization step size control scheme that enables flexible bitrate adjustment. By leveraging both channel-wise entropy dependencies and spatial scale parameters predicted by the hyperprior network, the proposed method preserves semantically important regions while coarsely quantizing less critical areas. The bitrate can be continuously controlled through a single parameter.

Timely and accurate diagnosis is essential for effective intervention. Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a non-invasive and accessible method for examining cerebral activity and identifying disease-associated patterns. We propose a novel graph-based deep learning framework, named Edge-gated, axis-mixed Pooling Attention Network (ExPANet), for differentiating major depressive disorder (MDD) patients from healthy controls (HC). EEG recordings undergo preprocessing to eliminate artifacts and are segmented into short periods of activity. We extract 14 features from each segment, which include time, frequency, fractal, and complexity domains. Electrodes are represented as nodes, whereas edges are determined by the phase-locking value (PLV) to represent functional connectivity. The generated brain graphs are examined utilizing an adapted graph attention network. This architecture acquires both localized electrode characteristics and comprehensive functional connectivity patterns. The proposed framework attains superior performance relative to current EEG-based approaches across two different datasets. A fundamental advantage of our methodology is its explainability. We evaluated the significance of features, channels, and edges, in addition to intrinsic attention weights. These studies highlight features, cerebral areas, and connectivity associations that are especially relevant to MDD, many of which correspond with clinical data.

Through controlled experiments on SwinIR, we uncover a striking asymmetry: weight quantization primarily degrades structural similarity, while activation quantization disproportionately affects pixel-level accuracy. This stems from their distinct roles--weights encode learned restoration priors for textures and edges, whereas activations carry input-specific intensity information. Building on this insight, we propose HarmoQ, a unified framework that harmonizes quantization across components through three synergistic steps: structural residual calibration proactively adjusts weights to compensate for activation-induced detail loss, harmonized scale optimization analytically balances quantization difficulty via closed-form solutions, and adaptive boundary refinement iteratively maintains this balance during optimization. Experiments show HarmoQ achieves substantial gains under aggressive compression, outperforming prior art by 0.46 dB on Set5 at 2-bit while delivering 3.2x speedup and 4x memory reduction on A100 GPUs.

Although Deep Learning (DL) has driven advances in Presentation Attack Detection (PAD), the field is fundamentally limited by a lack of data and the poor generalisation of models across various document types and new attack methods.\n  This article presents a systematic literature review (SLR) conducted in accordance with the PRISMA methodology, aiming to analyse and synthesise the current state of AI-based PAD for identity documents from 2020 to 2025 comprehensively. Our analysis reveals a significant methodological evolution: a transition from standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to specialised forensic micro-artefact analysis, and more recently, the adoption of large-scale Foundation Models (FMs), marking a substantial shift in the field.\n  We identify a central paradox that hinders progress: a critical \"Reality Gap\" exists between models validated on extensive, private datasets and those assessed using limited public datasets, which typically consist of mock-ups or synthetic data.

Due to the substantial computational cost and data requirements of training from scratch, many developers choose to fine-tune or modify existing open-source models. While most adhere to open-source licenses, some falsely claim original training despite clear derivation from public models. This raises pressing concerns about intellectual property protection and highlights the need for reliable methods to verify model provenance. In this paper, we propose GhostSpec, a lightweight yet effective method for verifying LLM lineage without access to training data or modification of model behavior. Our approach constructs compact and robust fingerprints by applying singular value decomposition (SVD) to invariant products of internal attention weight matrices, effectively capturing the structural identity of a model. Unlike watermarking or output-based methods, GhostSpec is fully data-free, non-invasive, and computationally efficient. It demonstrates strong robustness to sequential fine-tuning, pruning, block expansion, and even adversarial transformations. Extensive experiments show that GhostSpec can reliably trace the lineage of transformed models with minimal overhead.

Diagnosing ADHD using neuroimaging data, however, remains challenging due to heterogeneous presentations and overlapping symptoms with other conditions. To address this, we propose a novel parameter-efficient transfer learning approach that adapts a large-scale 3D convolutional foundation model, pre-trained on CT images, to an MRI-based ADHD classification task. Our method introduces Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in 3D by factorizing 3D convolutional kernels into 2D low-rank updates, dramatically reducing trainable parameters while achieving superior performance. In a five-fold cross-validated evaluation on a public diffusion MRI database, our 3D LoRA fine-tuning strategy achieved state-of-the-art results, with one model variant reaching 71.9% accuracy and another attaining an AUC of 0.716. Both variants use only 1.64 million trainable parameters (over 113x fewer than a fully fine-tuned foundation model).

This perspectives paper evaluates emerging solutions to the Alpine energy-climate data gap, analyzing datasets from global reanalyses (ERA5, 31 km) to kilometre-scale Digital Twins (Climate DT, Extremes DT, 4.4 km), regional reanalyses (ARA, 2.5 km), and next-generation AI weather prediction models (AIFS, 31 km). The multi-resolution assessment reveals that no single dataset excels universally: coarse reanalyses provide essential climatologies but miss valley-scale processes, while Digital Twins resolve Alpine dynamics yet remain computationally demanding. Effective energy planning therefore requires strategic dataset combinations validated against energy-relevant indices such as population-weighted extremes, wind-gust return periods, and Alpine-adjusted storm thresholds. A key frontier is sub-hourly (10-15 min) temporal resolution to match grid-operation needs. Six evidence-based recommendations outline pathways for bridging spatial and temporal scales.

This paper presents an efficient zero-shot diffusion-based compression method that runs substantially faster than existing methods, while maintaining performance that is on par with the state-of-the-art techniques. Our method builds upon the recently proposed Denoising Diffusion Codebook Models (DDCMs) compression scheme. Specifically, DDCM compresses an image by sequentially choosing the diffusion noise vectors from reproducible random codebooks, guiding the denoiser's output to reconstruct the target image. We modify this framework with Turbo-DDCM, which efficiently combines a large number of noise vectors at each denoising step, thereby significantly reducing the number of required denoising operations. This modification is also coupled with an improved encoding protocol. Furthermore, we introduce two flexible variants of Turbo-DDCM, a priority-aware variant that prioritizes user-specified regions and a distortion-controlled variant that compresses an image based on a target PSNR rather than a target BPP. Comprehensive experiments position Turbo-DDCM as a compelling, practical, and flexible image compression scheme.", "AI": {"tldr": "Turbo-DDCM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6269\u6563\u56fe\u50cf\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u7ec4\u5408\u5927\u91cf\u566a\u58f0\u5411\u91cf\u6765\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u53bb\u566a\u64cd\u4f5c\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fd0\u884c\u66f4\u5feb\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6269\u6563\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\u4e14\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eDDCM\u6846\u67b6\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u9aa4\u9ad8\u6548\u7ec4\u5408\u5927\u91cf\u566a\u58f0\u5411\u91cf\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u53bb\u566a\u64cd\u4f5c\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u7f16\u7801\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u5931\u771f\u63a7\u5236\u4e24\u4e2a\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "result": "Turbo-DDCM\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6280\u672f\u76f8\u5f53\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd0\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u5feb\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "Turbo-DDCM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "relevance": 20.0}}

The ability to perceive, track, and manipulate these objects without prior knowledge of their geometry or kinematic properties remains a fundamental challenge in robotics. In this work, we present a novel method for visuo-tactile-based tracking of unseen objects (single, multiple, or articulated) during robotic interaction without assuming any prior knowledge regarding object shape or dynamics. Our novel pose tracking approach termed ArtReg (stands for Articulated Registration) integrates visuo-tactile point clouds in an unscented Kalman Filter formulation in the SE(3) Lie Group for point cloud registration. ArtReg is used to detect possible articulated joints in objects using purposeful manipulation maneuvers such as pushing or hold-pulling with a two-robot team. Furthermore, we leverage ArtReg to develop a closed-loop controller for goal-driven manipulation of articulated objects to move the object into the desired pose configuration. We have extensively evaluated our approach on various types of unknown objects through real robot experiments. We also demonstrate the robustness of our method by evaluating objects with varying center of mass, low-light conditions, and with challenging visual backgrounds. Furthermore, we benchmarked our approach on a standard dataset of articulated objects and demonstrated improved performance in terms of pose accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our experiments indicate that robust and accurate pose tracking leveraging visuo-tactile information enables robots to perceive and interact with unseen complex articulated objects (with revolute or prismatic joints).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aArtReg\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u89e6\u89c9\u59ff\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4ea4\u4e92\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8ddf\u8e2a\u672a\u77e5\u7269\u4f53\uff08\u5355\u4e2a\u3001\u591a\u4e2a\u6216\u94f0\u63a5\u5f0f\uff09\u7684\u59ff\u6001\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4efb\u4f55\u5173\u4e8e\u7269\u4f53\u5f62\u72b6\u6216\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7ecf\u5e38\u9047\u5230\u5177\u6709\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u94f0\u63a5\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u672a\u77e5\u7269\u4f53\uff0c\u5982\u95e8\u3001\u62bd\u5c49\u3001\u6a71\u67dc\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u5148\u9a8c\u51e0\u4f55\u6216\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7269\u4f53\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "ArtReg\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728SE(3)\u674e\u7fa4\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210\u89c6\u89c9-\u89e6\u89c9\u70b9\u4e91\u5230\u65e0\u8ff9\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u70b9\u4e91\u914d\u51c6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u6216\u62c9\u7b49\u6709\u76ee\u7684\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u52a8\u4f5c\u68c0\u6d4b\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u94f0\u63a5\u5173\u8282\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u95ed\u73af\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u76ee\u6807\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u94f0\u63a5\u7269\u4f53\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u94f0\u63a5\u7269\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u59ff\u6001\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4f4e\u5149\u7167\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u6311\u6218\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9-\u89e6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u51c6\u786e\u59ff\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4f7f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u80fd\u591f\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u590d\u6742\u94f0\u63a5\u7269\u4f53\uff08\u5177\u6709\u65cb\u8f6c\u6216\u68f1\u67f1\u5173\u8282\uff09\u3002", "relevance": 15.0}}

On the downside, they are prone to cause overtrust issues where users rely on their responses even when they are incorrect. What aspects of the conversational interaction paradigm drive people to adopt it, and how it creates personalized experiences that lead to overtrust, is not clear. To understand the factors influencing the adoption of conversational interfaces, we conducted a survey with 173 participants. We examined user perceptions regarding trust, human-likeness (anthropomorphism), and design preferences between ChatGPT and Google. To better understand the overtrust phenomenon, we asked users about their willingness to trade off factuality for constructs like ease of use or human-likeness. Our analysis identified two distinct user groups: those who use both ChatGPT and Google daily (DUB), and those who primarily rely on Google (DUG). The DUB group exhibited higher trust in ChatGPT, perceiving it as more human-like, and expressed greater willingness to trade factual accuracy for enhanced personalization and conversational flow. Conversely, the DUG group showed lower trust toward ChatGPT but still appreciated aspects like ad-free experiences and responsive interactions. Demographic analysis further revealed nuanced patterns, with middle-aged adults using ChatGPT less frequently yet trusting it more, suggesting potential vulnerability to misinformation. Our findings contribute to understanding user segmentation, emphasizing the critical roles of personalization and human-likeness in conversational IR systems, and reveal important implications regarding users' willingness to compromise factual accuracy for more engaging interactions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u67e5173\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86ChatGPT\u548cGoogle\u7684\u7528\u6237\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u7528\u6237\u7fa4\u4f53\uff1a\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528ChatGPT\u548cGoogle\u7684\u7528\u6237(DUB)\u548c\u4e3b\u8981\u4f7f\u7528Google\u7684\u7528\u6237(DUG)\u3002DUB\u7ec4\u5bf9ChatGPT\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u66f4\u613f\u610f\u4e3a\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u548c\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u727a\u7272\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\u754c\u9762(\u5982ChatGPT)\u4e3a\u4f55\u88ab\u7528\u6237\u91c7\u7eb3\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd9\u79cd\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5f0f\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4f53\u9a8c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7528\u6237\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4fe1\u4efb\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u56de\u7b54\u4e0d\u6b63\u786e\u4e5f\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b83\u4eec\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9173\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u95ee\u5377\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u7528\u6237\u5bf9ChatGPT\u548cGoogle\u5728\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\u3001\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u504f\u597d\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u5e76\u8be2\u95ee\u7528\u6237\u662f\u5426\u613f\u610f\u4e3a\u6613\u7528\u6027\u6216\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u727a\u7272\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e24\u4e2a\u7528\u6237\u7fa4\u4f53\uff1aDUB\u7ec4(\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528ChatGPT\u548cGoogle)\u5bf9ChatGPT\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5176\u66f4\u62df\u4eba\u5316\uff0c\u66f4\u613f\u610f\u4e3a\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u548c\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u727a\u7272\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1bDUG\u7ec4(\u4e3b\u8981\u4f7f\u7528Google)\u5bf9ChatGPT\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\u8f83\u4f4e\u4f46\u4ecd\u6b23\u8d4f\u5176\u65e0\u5e7f\u544a\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002\u4e2d\u5e74\u7528\u6237\u4f7f\u7528ChatGPT\u8f83\u5c11\u4f46\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u7ec6\u5206\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u548c\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0f\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7528\u6237\u613f\u610f\u4e3a\u66f4\u5438\u5f15\u4eba\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u800c\u59a5\u534f\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u542f\u793a\u3002", "relevance": 65.0}}

Current methods often struggle to balance the competing demands of interpretability and model flexibility, limiting their effectiveness in extracting meaningful insights from complex data. We introduce Non-negative Stiefel Approximating Flow (NSA-Flow), a general-purpose matrix estimation framework that unifies ideas from sparse matrix factorization, orthogonalization, and constrained manifold learning. NSA-Flow enforces structured sparsity through a continuous balance between reconstruction fidelity and column-wise decorrelation, parameterized by a single tunable weight. The method operates as a smooth flow near the Stiefel manifold with proximal updates for non-negativity and adaptive gradient control, yielding representations that are simultaneously sparse, stable, and interpretable. Unlike classical regularization schemes, NSA-Flow provides an intuitive geometric mechanism for manipulating sparsity at the level of global structure while simplifying latent features. We demonstrate that the NSA-Flow objective can be optimized smoothly and integrates seamlessly with existing pipelines for dimensionality reduction while improving interpretability and generalization in both simulated and real biomedical data. Empirical validation on the Golub leukemia dataset and in Alzheimer's disease demonstrate that the NSA-Flow constraints can maintain or improve performance over related methods with little additional methodological effort.

Detecting and mitigating hallucinations is challenging when ground-truth references are unavailable and model internals are inaccessible. This paper proposes a novel self-contained low-rank approach to automatically rank multiple candidate captions generated by multiple VLMs based on their hallucination levels, using only the captions themselves without requiring external references or model access. By constructing a sentence-embedding matrix and decomposing it into a low-rank consensus component and a sparse residual, we use the residual magnitude to rank captions: selecting the one with the smallest residual as the most hallucination-free. Experiments on the NuScenes dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves 87% selection accuracy in identifying hallucination-free captions, representing a 19% improvement over the unfiltered baseline and a 6-10% improvement over multi-agent debate method. The sorting produced by sparse error magnitudes shows strong correlation with human judgments of hallucinations, validating our scoring mechanism.

Accepted by IROS 2025", "summary": "Efficient, accurate, and flexible relative localization is crucial in air-ground collaborative tasks. However, current approaches for robot relative localization are primarily realized in the form of distributed multi-robot SLAM systems with the same sensor configuration, which are tightly coupled with the state estimation of all robots, limiting both flexibility and accuracy. To this end, we fully leverage the high capacity of Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) to integrate multiple sensors, enabling a semi-distributed cross-modal air-ground relative localization framework. In this work, both the UGV and the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) independently perform SLAM while extracting deep learning-based keypoints and global descriptors, which decouples the relative localization from the state estimation of all agents. The UGV employs a local Bundle Adjustment (BA) with LiDAR, camera, and an IMU to rapidly obtain accurate relative pose estimates. The BA process adopts sparse keypoint optimization and is divided into two stages: First, optimizing camera poses interpolated from LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO), followed by estimating the relative camera poses between the UGV and UAV. Additionally, we implement an incremental loop closure detection algorithm using deep learning-based descriptors to maintain and retrieve keyframes efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves outstanding performance in both accuracy and efficiency. Unlike traditional multi-robot SLAM approaches that transmit images or point clouds, our method only transmits keypoint pixels and their descriptors, effectively constraining the communication bandwidth under 0.3 Mbps.

Recovering similar room impulse response (RIR) directly from reverberant speech offers more accessible and flexible AEM solution. However, this capability also introduces vulnerabilities of arbitrary ``relocation\" if misused by malicious user, such as facilitating advanced voice spoofing attacks or undermining the authenticity of recorded evidence. To address this issue, we propose EchoMark, the first deep learning-based AEM framework that generates perceptually similar RIRs with embedded watermark. Our design tackle the challenges posed by variable RIR characteristics, such as different durations and energy decays, by operating in the latent domain. By jointly optimizing the model with a perceptual loss for RIR reconstruction and a loss for watermark detection, EchoMark achieves both high-quality environment transfer and reliable watermark recovery. Experiments on diverse datasets validate that EchoMark achieves room acoustic parameter matching performance comparable to FiNS, the state-of-the-art RIR estimator. Furthermore, a high Mean Opinion Score (MOS) of 4.22 out of 5, watermark detection accuracy exceeding 99\\%, and bit error rates (BER) below 0.3\\% collectively demonstrate the effectiveness of EchoMark in preserving perceptual quality while ensuring reliable watermark embedding.", "AI": {"tldr": "EchoMark\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u58f0\u5b66\u73af\u5883\u5339\u914d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u751f\u6210\u611f\u77e5\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u623f\u95f4\u8109\u51b2\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u5d4c\u5165\u6c34\u5370\uff0c\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u6076\u610f\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u8bed\u97f3\u6b3a\u9a97\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u58f0\u5b66\u73af\u5883\u5339\u914d\u6280\u672f\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u97f3\u9891\u914d\u97f3\u548c\u6c89\u6d78\u5f0fVR\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u6076\u610f\u7528\u4e8e\u8bed\u97f3\u6b3a\u9a97\u6216\u7834\u574f\u5f55\u97f3\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u73af\u5883\u8f6c\u6362\u53c8\u80fd\u5d4c\u5165\u53ef\u9760\u6c34\u5370\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u57df\u64cd\u4f5c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9RIR\u7684\u53ef\u53d8\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u635f\u5931\u548c\u6c34\u5370\u68c0\u6d4b\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cfRIR\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6c34\u5370\u6062\u590d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cEchoMark\u5728\u623f\u95f4\u58f0\u5b66\u53c2\u6570\u5339\u914d\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684RIR\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668FiNS\u76f8\u5f53\uff0cMOS\u5f97\u52064.22/5\uff0c\u6c34\u5370\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d85\u8fc799%\uff0c\u8bef\u7801\u7387\u4f4e\u4e8e0.3%\u3002", "conclusion": "EchoMark\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u4e3a\u58f0\u5b66\u73af\u5883\u5339\u914d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "relevance": 15.0}}

Therefore, Spectral Deconvolution imaging (SDI) methods based on PSF engineering have been proposed to achieve high-fidelity compact CSI design recently. However, the composite convolution-integration operations of SDI render the normal-equation coefficient matrix scene-dependent, which hampers the efficient exploitation of imaging priors and poses challenges for accurate reconstruction. To tackle the inherent data-dependent operators in SDI, we introduce a Hierarchical Spatial-Spectral Aggregation Unfolding Framework (HSFAUF). By decomposing subproblems and projecting them into the frequency domain, HSFAUF transforms nonlinear processes into linear mappings, thereby enabling efficient solutions. Furthermore, to integrate spatial-spectral priors during iterative refinement, we propose a Spatial-Frequency Aggregation Transformer (SFAT), which explicitly aggregates information across spatial and frequency domains.

Most existing robotic multitask models rely on dense embeddings that entangle both object and background cues, raising concerns about both efficiency and interpretability. In contrast, we study object-relation-centric representations as a pathway to more structured, efficient, and explainable visuomotor control. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we introduce LIBERO+, a fine-grained benchmark dataset designed to enable and evaluate object-relation reasoning in robotic manipulation. Unlike prior datasets, LIBERO+ provides object-centric annotations that enrich demonstrations with box- and mask-level labels as well as instance-level temporal tracking, supporting compact and interpretable visuomotor representations. Second, we propose SlotVLA, a slot-attention-based framework that captures both objects and their relations for action decoding. It uses a slot-based visual tokenizer to maintain consistent temporal object representations, a relation-centric decoder to produce task-relevant embeddings, and an LLM-driven module that translates these embeddings into executable actions.

Existing public datasets, such as CVC-ClinicDB and Kvasir-SEG, provide valuable benchmarks but are limited by small sample sizes, curated image selection, or lack of real-world artifacts. There remains a need for datasets that capture the complexity of clinical practice, particularly in resource-constrained settings. Methods: We introduce a dataset, BUET Polyp Dataset (BPD), of colonoscopy images collected using Olympus 170 and Pentax i-Scan series endoscopes under routine clinical conditions. The dataset contains images with corresponding expert-annotated binary masks, reflecting diverse challenges such as motion blur, specular highlights, stool artifacts, blood, and low-light frames. Annotations were manually reviewed by clinical experts to ensure quality. To demonstrate baseline performance, we provide benchmark results for classification using VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3, and for segmentation using UNet variants with VGG16, ResNet34, and InceptionV4 backbones. Results: The dataset comprises 1,288 images with polyps from 164 patients with corresponding ground-truth masks and 1,657 polyp-free images from 31 patients. Benchmarking experiments achieved up to 90.8% accuracy for binary classification (VGG16) and a maximum Dice score of 0.64 with InceptionV4-UNet for segmentation.

This is achieved through two key innovations: the Convolutional Long-Time Constant Cell (ConvLTC), which dynamically regulates the feature update rate to \"slowly\" process low-frequency backgrounds and \"quickly\" respond to high-frequency boundaries; and the STDP Self-Organizing Module, which significantly mitigates feature conflicts between the encoder and decoder, reducing the conflict rate from approximately 35%-40% to 8%-10%.", "AI": {"tldr": "TauFlow\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u53d7\u8111\u673a\u5236\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u54cd\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u89e3\u51b3\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u5904\u7406\u75c5\u7076\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0e\u80cc\u666f\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u6781\u8f7b\u91cf\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08<0.5M\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1\uff09\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u75c5\u7076\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0e\u80cc\u666f\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5f3a\u70c8\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff1b2\uff09\u5728\u8ffd\u6c42\u6781\u8f7b\u91cf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6025\u5267\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTauFlow\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u53d7\u8111\u673a\u5236\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u54cd\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u521b\u65b0\uff1a\u5377\u79ef\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u5e38\u6570\u5355\u5143\uff08ConvLTC\uff09\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u7279\u5f81\u66f4\u65b0\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u5bf9\u4f4e\u9891\u80cc\u666f\"\u6162\u901f\"\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5bf9\u9ad8\u9891\u8fb9\u754c\"\u5feb\u901f\"\u54cd\u5e94\uff1bSTDP\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6a21\u5757\u663e\u8457\u7f13\u89e3\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0e\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "result": "STDP\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6a21\u5757\u5c06\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0e\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u51b2\u7a81\u7387\u4ece\u7ea635%-40%\u964d\u4f4e\u52308%-10%\u3002", "conclusion": "TauFlow\u901a\u8fc7\u8111\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u54cd\u5e94\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6781\u8f7b\u91cf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "relevance": 20.0}}

Vision-based gesture recognition suffers from high computational cost, sensitivity to lighting conditions, and privacy leakage concerns. Acoustic sensing provides an attractive alternative: by emitting inaudible high-frequency signals and capturing their reflections, channel impulse response (CIR) encodes how gestures perturb the acoustic field in a low-cost and user-transparent manner. However, existing CIR-based gesture recognition methods often rely on extensive training of models on large labeled datasets, making them unsuitable for few-shot VR scenarios. In this work, we propose the first framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for CIR-based gesture recognition in VR/AR systems. Despite LLMs' strengths, it is non-trivial to achieve few-shot and zero-shot learning of CIR gestures due to their inconspicuous features. To tackle this challenge, we collect differential CIR rather than original CIR data. Moreover, we construct a real-world dataset collected from 10 participants performing 15 gestures across three categories (digits, letters, and shapes), with 10 repetitions each. We then conduct extensive experiments on this dataset using an LLM-adopted classifier. Results show that our LLM-based framework achieves accuracy comparable to classical machine learning baselines, while requiring no domain-specific retraining.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u4e8eCIR\u7684\u624b\u52bf\u8bc6\u522b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91c7\u96c6\u5dee\u5206CIR\u6570\u636e\u89e3\u51b3\u7279\u5f81\u4e0d\u660e\u663e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672cVR\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u65e0\u9700\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3VR/AR\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u624b\u52bf\u8bc6\u522b\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3001\u5149\u7167\u654f\u611f\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u73b0\u6709CIR\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6536\u96c6\u5dee\u5206CIR\u6570\u636e\u800c\u975e\u539f\u59cbCIR\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b10\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u300115\u79cd\u624b\u52bf\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528LLM\u9002\u914d\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "LLM\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u53ef\u7528\u4e8eCIR\u624b\u52bf\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672cVR\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "relevance": 65.0}}

Yet, they frequently fail to preserve the critical anatomical details needed for diagnostic tasks. This fundamental limitation hinders their clinical applicability despite their high metric scores. We propose a novel task-adaptive reconstruction framework that addresses this gap by incorporating a frozen pre-trained task network as a regularization term in the reconstruction loss function. Unlike existing joint-training approaches that simultaneously optimize both reconstruction and task networks, and risk diverging from satisfactory reconstructions, our method leverages a pre-trained task model to guide reconstruction training while still maintaining diagnostic quality. We validate our framework on a liver and liver tumor segmentation task. Our task-adaptive models achieve Dice scores up to 0.707, approaching the performance of full-dose scans (0.874), and substantially outperforming joint-training approaches (0.331) and traditional reconstruction methods (0.626). Critically, our framework can be integrated into any existing deep learning-based reconstruction model through simple loss function modification, enabling widespread adoption for task-adaptive optimization in clinical practice.

The identification of loop invariants is a critical step to support automated program safety assessment. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in diverse software engineering (SE) and formal verification tasks. However, we are not aware of the performance of LLMs to infer loop invariants. We report an empirical study of both open-source and closed-source LLMs of varying sizes to assess their proficiency in inferring inductive loop invariants for programs and in fixing incorrect invariants. Our findings reveal that while LLMs exhibit some utility in inferring and repairing loop invariants, their performance is substantially enhanced when supplemented with auxiliary information such as domain knowledge and illustrative examples. LLMs achieve a maximum success rate of 78\\% in generating, but are limited to 16\\% in repairing the invariant.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u65ad\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u5728\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u597d\uff08\u6700\u9ad878%\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4fee\u590d\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u9650\uff08\u4ec516%\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u8f85\u52a9\u4fe1\u606f\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f\u662f\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u867d\u7136LLMs\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u548c\u5f62\u5f0f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u63a8\u65ad\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u95ed\u6e90\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21LLMs\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u63a8\u65ad\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5f52\u7eb3\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u9519\u8bef\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8f85\u52a9\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u793a\u4f8b\uff09\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f\u65b9\u9762\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe\u523078%\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4fee\u590d\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f\u65b9\u9762\u4ec516%\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002\u8f85\u52a9\u4fe1\u606f\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4fee\u590d\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8f85\u52a9\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "relevance": 65.0}}

Despite this progress, current LLM-based approaches typically address each task independently, training separate models that raise computational and deployment resource use while missing potential cross-task synergies. They also rely on fixed-rate token compression, which restricts flexibility in balancing accuracy with efficiency. These limitations highlight the need for a unified framework that can support ASR, VSR, and AVSR while enabling elastic inference. To this end, we present Omni-AVSR, a unified audio-visual LLM that combines efficient multi-granularity training with parameter-efficient adaptation. Specifically, we adapt the matryoshka representation learning paradigm to efficiently train across multiple audio and visual granularities, reducing its inherent training resource use. Furthermore, we explore three LoRA-based strategies for adapting the backbone LLM, balancing shared and task-specific specialization. Experiments on LRS2 and LRS3 show that Omni-AVSR achieves comparable or superior accuracy to state-of-the-art baselines while training a single model at substantially lower training and deployment resource use. The model also remains robust under acoustic noise, and we analyze its scaling behavior as LLM size increases, providing insights into the trade-off between performance and efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "Omni-AVSR\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u9002\u914d\uff0c\u5728ASR\u3001VSR\u548cAVSR\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u72ec\u7acb\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u5927\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u534f\u540c\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5f39\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528matryoshka\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e09\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eLoRA\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u9002\u914d\u9aa8\u5e72LLM\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u5171\u4eab\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728LRS2\u548cLRS3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cOmni-AVSR\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u5728\u58f0\u5b66\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Omni-AVSR\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6743\u8861\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "relevance": 65.0}}

Nonetheless, the characteristics of non-professional acquisition and the subsequent transcoding of UGC video on sharing platforms present significant challenges for NR-VQA. Although NR-VQA models attempt to infer mean opinion scores (MOS), their modeling of subjective scores for compressed content remains limited due to the absence of fine-grained perceptual annotations of artifact types. To address these challenges, we propose CAMP-VQA, a novel NR-VQA framework that exploits the semantic understanding capabilities of large vision-language models. Our approach introduces a quality-aware prompting mechanism that integrates video metadata (e.g., resolution, frame rate, bitrate) with key fragments extracted from inter-frame variations to guide the BLIP-2 pretraining approach in generating fine-grained quality captions. A unified architecture has been designed to model perceptual quality across three dimensions: semantic alignment, temporal characteristics, and spatial characteristics. These multimodal features are extracted and fused, then regressed to video quality scores. Extensive experiments on a wide variety of UGC datasets demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms existing NR-VQA methods, achieving improved accuracy without the need for costly manual fine-grained annotations. Our method achieves the best performance in terms of average rank and linear correlation (SRCC: 0.928, PLCC: 0.938) compared to state-of-the-art methods.

This has led to incremental improvements without a deep understanding of the current failures. While it is straightforward to look at situations where the model fails, it is hard to understand the underlying reason. This motivates us to conduct a systematic study, where inputs to the model are perturbed and the predictions observed. We introduce PlanT 2.0, a lightweight, object-centric planning transformer designed for autonomous driving research in CARLA. The object-level representation enables controlled analysis, as the input can be easily perturbed (e.g., by changing the location or adding or removing certain objects), in contrast to sensor-based models. To tackle the scenarios newly introduced by the challenging CARLA Leaderboard 2.0, we introduce multiple upgrades to PlanT, achieving state-of-the-art performance on Longest6 v2, Bench2Drive, and the CARLA validation routes. Our analysis exposes insightful failures, such as a lack of scene understanding caused by low obstacle diversity, rigid expert behaviors leading to exploitable shortcuts, and overfitting to a fixed set of expert trajectories. Based on these findings, we argue for a shift toward data-centric development, with a focus on richer, more robust, and less biased datasets.

The balance between security and performance is increasingly fragile with the emergence of generative AI systems capable of autonomously generating and optimising sophisticated cryptanalysis and steganalysis algorithms, thereby accelerating the exposure of vulnerabilities in conventional data-hiding schemes.\n  This work introduces SteganoSNN, a neuromorphic steganographic framework that exploits spiking neural networks (SNNs) to achieve secure, low-power, and high-capacity multimedia data hiding. Digitised audio samples are converted into spike trains using leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons, encrypted via a modulo-based mapping scheme, and embedded into the least significant bits of RGBA image channels using a dithering mechanism to minimise perceptual distortion. Implemented in Python using NEST and realised on a PYNQ-Z2 FPGA, SteganoSNN attains real-time operation with an embedding capacity of 8 bits per pixel. Experimental evaluations on the DIV2K 2017 dataset demonstrate image fidelity between 40.4 dB and 41.35 dB in PSNR and SSIM values consistently above 0.97, surpassing SteganoGAN in computational efficiency and robustness.

In the last decade, a large body of work has emerged on local robustness, i.e., checking if the decision of a neural network remains unchanged when the input is slightly perturbed. However, many of these approaches require specialized encoding and often ignore the confidence of a neural network on its output. In this paper, our goal is to build a generalized framework to specify and verify variants of robustness in neural network verification. We propose a specification framework using a simple grammar, which is flexible enough to capture most existing variants. This allows us to introduce new variants of robustness that take into account the confidence of the neural network in its outputs. Next, we develop a novel and powerful unified technique to verify all such variants in a homogeneous way, viz., by adding a few additional layers to the neural network. This enables us to use any state-of-the-art neural network verification tool, without having to tinker with the encoding within, while incurring an approximation error that we show is bounded. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation over a large suite of 8870 benchmarks having 138M parameters in a largest network, and show that we are able to capture a wide set of robustness variants and outperform direct encoding approaches by a significant margin.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u8bed\u6cd5\u5b9a\u4e49\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u6dfb\u52a0\u989d\u5916\u5c42\u6765\u7edf\u4e00\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u73b0\u6709\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u7f16\u7801\u4e14\u5ffd\u7565\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u8bed\u6cd5\u89c4\u8303\u6846\u67b6\u5b9a\u4e49\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6dfb\u52a0\u989d\u5916\u5c42\u5c06\u9a8c\u8bc1\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6807\u51c6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9a8c\u8bc1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53ef\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "result": "\u57288870\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08\u6700\u5927\u7f51\u7edc1.38\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u83b7\u591a\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u4e14\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u8003\u8651\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u65b0\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

However, their reliability remains a challenge, especially in long-horizon tasks, since they often produce overconfident yet wrong outputs. Conformal Prediction (CP) has been leveraged to address this issue by wrapping LLM outputs into prediction sets that contain the correct action with a user-defined confidence. When the prediction set is a singleton, the planner executes that action; otherwise, it requests help from a user. This has led to LLM-based planners that can ensure plan correctness with a user-defined probability. However, as LLMs are trained in an uncertainty-agnostic manner, without awareness of prediction sets, they tend to produce unnecessarily large sets, particularly at higher confidence levels, resulting in frequent human interventions limiting autonomous deployment. To address this, we introduce CoFineLLM (Conformal Finetuning for LLMs), the first CP-aware finetuning framework for LLM-based planners that explicitly reduces prediction-set size and, in turn, the need for user interventions. We evaluate our approach on multiple language-instructed robot planning problems and show consistent improvements over uncertainty-aware and uncertainty-agnostic finetuning baselines in terms of prediction-set size, and help rates.

This overall new approach consists of three complementary custom-tailored evaluation sub-methodologies, each of which has been designed to assess specific aspects of an index's behaviour while preventing potential biases of the other sub-methodologies. Each sub-methodology features two complementary measures of performance, alongside mechanisms that allow for an in-depth investigation of more complex behaviours of the internal validity indexes under study. Additionally, a new collection of 16177 datasets has been produced, paired with eight widely-used clustering algorithms, for a wider applicability scope and representation of more diverse clustering scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5bf926\u79cd\u5185\u90e8\u6709\u6548\u6027\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7ecf\u5178\u6307\u6807\u548c\u65b0\u8fd1\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u6307\u6807\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e8616177\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c8\u79cd\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u805a\u7c7b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5728\u805a\u7c7b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u5185\u90e8\u6709\u6548\u6027\u6307\u6807\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u5b9e\u8df5\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u752816177\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c8\u79cd\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e24\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8861\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf926\u79cd\u5185\u90e8\u6709\u6548\u6027\u6307\u6807\u7684\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u805a\u7c7b\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u805a\u7c7b\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u5185\u90e8\u6709\u6548\u6027\u6307\u6807\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "relevance": 15.0}}

Recent video generation models can synthesize photorealistic visual demonstrations from language commands and images, offering a powerful yet underexplored source of training signals for robotics. However, directly retargeting pixel motions from generated videos to robots neglects physics, often resulting in inaccurate manipulations. PhysWorld addresses this limitation by coupling video generation with physical world reconstruction. Given a single image and a task command, our method generates task-conditioned videos and reconstructs the underlying physical world from the videos, and the generated video motions are grounded into physically accurate actions through object-centric residual reinforcement learning with the physical world model. This synergy transforms implicit visual guidance into physically executable robotic trajectories, eliminating the need for real robot data collection and enabling zero-shot generalizable robotic manipulation. Experiments on diverse real-world tasks demonstrate that PhysWorld substantially improves manipulation accuracy compared to previous approaches.

Often, the dependence of the solution of the ODE on additional parameters is of interest, e.g.\\ when dealing with uncertainty quantification or design optimization. Directly studying this dependence can quickly become too computationally expensive, such that cheaper surrogate models approximating the solution are of interest. One popular class of surrogate models are Gaussian processes (GPs). They perform well when approximating stationary functions, functions which have a similar level of variation along any given parameter direction, however solutions to stiff ODEs are often characterized by a mixture of regions of rapid and slow variation along the time axis and when dealing with such nonstationary functions, GP performance frequently degrades drastically. We therefore aim to reparameterize stiff ODE solutions based on the available data, to make them appear more stationary and hence recover good GP performance. This approach comes with minimal computational overhead and requires no internal changes to the GP implementation, as it can be seen as a separate preprocessing step.

We present Lightning Grasp, a novel high-performance procedural grasp synthesis algorithm that achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups over state-of-the-art approaches, while enabling unsupervised grasp generation for irregular, tool-like objects. The method avoids many limitations of prior approaches, such as the need for carefully tuned energy functions and sensitive initialization.

To achieve this, a pervasive paradigm is to leverage the rich vision-semantic priors of large vision-language models (VLMs). However, the fundamental question persists: How do VLAs effectively inherit the prior knowledge from VLMs? To address this critical question, we introduce a diagnostic benchmark, GrinningFace, an emoji tabletop manipulation task where the robot arm is asked to place objects onto printed emojis corresponding to language instructions. This task design is particularly revealing -- knowledge associated with emojis is ubiquitous in Internet-scale datasets used for VLM pre-training, yet emojis themselves are largely absent from standard robotics datasets. Consequently, they provide a clean proxy: successful task completion indicates effective transfer of VLM priors to embodied control. We implement this diagnostic task in both simulated environment and a real robot, and compare various promising techniques for knowledge transfer. Specifically, we investigate the effects of parameter-efficient fine-tuning, VLM freezing, co-training, predicting discretized actions, and predicting latent actions.

While such a legality check needs to be precisely computed in general, we can use an approximate legality prediction model in certain cases, such as training a reinforcement learning (RL) agent for schedule prediction. In this paper, we propose an approximate method for legality checks. We propose a novel DL model for predicting the legality of transformations. The model takes the code representation and a list of transformations as input and predicts whether applying those transformations to the code is legal. We implement and evaluate the proposed model, demonstrating its effectiveness. Our evaluation shows an F1 score of 0.91 on a test set of randomly generated programs. To further evaluate the model in a practical scenario, we used the model to replace the legality check used during the training of an RL agent designed for automatic code optimization. We demonstrate that such a replacement enables the agent to train on twice as many steps, resulting in faster training and reducing resource usage by approximately 80\\% for CPU and 35\\% for RAM. The agent trained using this approach maintains comparable performance, with only a 4\\% reduction on benchmarks from the Polybench suite compared to the traditional method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7801\u8f6c\u6362\u5408\u6cd5\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fd1\u4f3c\u9884\u6d4b\u4ee3\u7801\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u5408\u6cd5\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u66ff\u4ee3\u7cbe\u786e\u68c0\u67e5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u4f18\u5316\u7b49\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5408\u6cd5\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u800c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u52a0\u901f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8f93\u5165\u4ee3\u7801\u8868\u793a\u548c\u8f6c\u6362\u5217\u8868\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u5e94\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8f6c\u6362\u662f\u5426\u5408\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0aF1\u5206\u6570\u8fbe0.91\uff1b\u5728RL\u4ee3\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u6b65\u6570\u7ffb\u500d\uff0cCPU\u8d44\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u51cf\u5c1180%\uff0cRAM\u51cf\u5c1135%\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4ec5\u4e0b\u964d4%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5408\u6cd5\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7801\u4f18\u5316\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "relevance": 25.0}}

In contrast, soft robotic simulation frameworks remain scarce and are seldom adopted by the soft robotics community. This gap stems partly from the lack of easy-to-use, general-purpose frameworks and partly from the high computational cost of accurately simulating continuum mechanics, which often renders policy learning infeasible. In this work, we demonstrate that rapid soft robot policy learning is indeed achievable via implicit time-stepping. Our simulator of choice, DisMech, is a general-purpose, fully implicit soft-body simulator capable of handling both soft dynamics and frictional contact. We further introduce delta natural curvature control, a method analogous to delta joint position control in rigid manipulators, providing an intuitive and effective means of enacting control for soft robot learning. To highlight the benefits of implicit time-stepping and delta curvature control, we conduct extensive comparisons across four diverse soft manipulator tasks against one of the most widely used soft-body frameworks, Elastica. With implicit time-stepping, parallel stepping of 500 environments achieves up to 6x faster speeds for non-contact cases and up to 40x faster for contact-rich scenarios. Finally, a comprehensive sim-to-sim gap evaluation--training policies in one simulator and evaluating them in another--demonstrates that implicit time-stepping provides a rare free lunch: dramatic speedups achieved without sacrificing accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u9690\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u8fdb\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5feb\u901f\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Dismech\u4eff\u771f\u5668\u548cdelta\u81ea\u7136\u66f2\u7387\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b040\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4eff\u771f\u6846\u67b6\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4eff\u771f\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Dismech\u9690\u5f0f\u8f6f\u4f53\u4eff\u771f\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408delta\u81ea\u7136\u66f2\u7387\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u5e76\u884c\u73af\u5883\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728500\u4e2a\u5e76\u884c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u975e\u63a5\u89e6\u573a\u666f\u52a0\u901f6\u500d\uff0c\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u573a\u666f\u52a0\u901f40\u500d\uff1bsim-to-sim\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u52a0\u901f\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9690\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u8fdb\u4e3a\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "relevance": 5.0}}

A key step for CTR prediction is to learn accurate user representation to capture their interests. Generally, the interest expressed by a user is time-variant, i.e., a user activates different interests at different time. However, most previous CTR prediction methods overlook the correlation between the activated interest and the occurrence time, resulting in what they actually learn is the mixture of the interests expressed by the user at all time, rather than the real-time interest at the certain prediction time. To capture the correlation between the activated interest and the occurrence time, in this paper we investigate users' interest evolution from the perspective of the whole time line and develop two regular patterns: periodic pattern and time-point pattern. Based on the two patterns, we propose a novel time-aware long- and short-term user interest modeling method to model users' dynamic interests at different time. Extensive experiments on public datasets as well as an industrial dataset verify the effectiveness of exploiting the two patterns and demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method compared with other state-of-the-art ones.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u957f\u77ed\u671f\u7528\u6237\u5174\u8da3\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u5468\u671f\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u6a21\u5f0f\u6765\u6355\u6349\u7528\u6237\u5174\u8da3\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u70b9\u51fb\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u591a\u6570CTR\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5174\u8da3\u4e0e\u53d1\u751f\u65f6\u95f4\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u662f\u7528\u6237\u5728\u6240\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u5174\u8da3\u6df7\u5408\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u7279\u5b9a\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u5174\u8da3\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u6574\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u7ebf\u89d2\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u7528\u6237\u5174\u8da3\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5468\u671f\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u5f0f\u6784\u5efa\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u957f\u77ed\u671f\u7528\u6237\u5174\u8da3\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8003\u8651\u5174\u8da3\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u6355\u6349\u7528\u6237\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u5174\u8da3\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347CTR\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "relevance": 30.0}}

We show that some strictly increasing hyperpriors, such as half-Laplace and half-generalized Gaussian with the power in $(0,1)$, effectively promote sparsity and improve solution stability with respect to measurement noise. Based on this analysis, we adopt a proximal alternating linearized minimization (PALM) algorithm with convergence guaranties for both convex and concave hyperpriors.

We show that FAS achieves superior transition path sampling performance across synthetic potential and real molecular systems, including Alanine Dipeptide and Chignolin.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u529f\u80fd\u4f34\u968f\u91c7\u6837\u5668\uff08FAS\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u9650\u7ef4\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5bf9\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u8fdb\u884c\u91c7\u6837\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6709\u9650\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5409\u5e03\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u9762\u8fdb\u5c55\u8fc5\u901f\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u65e0\u9650\u7ef4\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u91c7\u6837\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8def\u5f84\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u6700\u5927\u503c\u539f\u7406\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u4f34\u968f\u91c7\u6837\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u529f\u80fd\u8868\u793a\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5339\u914d\u578b\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "FAS\u5728\u5408\u6210\u52bf\u80fd\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u5206\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u4e19\u6c28\u9178\u4e8c\u80bd\u548cChignolin\uff09\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u8fc7\u6e21\u8def\u5f84\u91c7\u6837\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "FAS\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u65e0\u9650\u7ef4\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5409\u5e03\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u91c7\u6837\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "relevance": 25.0}}

We believe this misleads decision-makers into choosing unsafe methods. We argue that the difficulty in interpreting privacy budgets does not stem from the definition of differential privacy itself, but from the intrinsic difficulty of estimating privacy risks in context, a challenge that any rigorous method for privacy risk assessment face.

Their effectiveness highly depends on the specific nature of the task, especially the required domain knowledge. Existing approaches, such as mixture-of-experts, typically operate at the task level; they are too coarse to effectively solve the heterogeneous problems involving multiple subjects. This work proposes a novel framework that performs fine-grained analysis at subject level equipped with a designated multi-agent collaboration strategy for addressing heterogeneous problem reasoning. Specifically, given an input query, we first employ a Graph Neural Network to identify the relevant subjects and infer their interdependencies to generate an \\textit{Subject-based Directed Acyclic Graph} (S-DAG), where nodes represent subjects and edges encode information flow. Then we profile the LLM models by assigning each model a subject-specific expertise score, and select the top-performing one for matching corresponding subject of the S-DAG. Such subject-model matching enables graph-structured multi-agent collaboration where information flows from the starting model to the ending model over S-DAG.

This improvement cannot be achieved when using an existing library based on a naive automatic differentiator. We numerically demonstrate that RMHMC effectively samples from the posterior, allowing the calculation of model evidence, in a Bayesian logistic regression on simulated data and in the estimation of propensity functions for the American national medical expenditure data using several Bayesian multiple-kernel models.

We identify this previously unexplained phenomenon as amplitude suppression, which we diagnose through analyzing training histories and loss landscapes. Three interacting factors emerge: S-wave onsets exhibit high temporal uncertainty relative to high-amplitude boundaries; CNN's bias toward sharp amplitude changes anchors predictions to these boundaries rather than subtle onsets; and point-wise Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss lacks lateral corrective forces, providing only vertical gradients that suppress amplitude while temporal gaps persist. This geometric trap points to a shape-then-align solution where stable geometric templates must precede temporal alignment. We implement this through a conditional GAN framework by augmenting conventional BCE training with a discriminator that enforces shape constraints. Training for 10,000 steps, this achieves a 64% increase in effective S-phase detections.

However, a central challenge is the goal setting problem: robots must propose feasible and diverse goals that are achievable in their current environment. Existing methods like RIG (Visual Reinforcement Learning with Imagined Goals) use variational autoencoder (VAE) to generate goals in a learned latent space but have the limitation of producing physically implausible goals that hinder learning efficiency. We propose Physics-Informed RIG (PI-RIG), which integrates physical constraints directly into the VAE training process through a novel Enhanced Physics-Informed Variational Autoencoder (Enhanced p3-VAE), enabling the generation of physically consistent and achievable goals. Our key innovation is the explicit separation of the latent space into physics variables governing object dynamics and environmental factors capturing visual appearance, while enforcing physical consistency through differential equation constraints and conservation laws. This enables the generation of physically consistent and achievable goals that respect fundamental physical principles such as object permanence, collision constraints, and dynamic feasibility.

While qualitative studies highlight the potential of integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) with traditional optimization, a formal, quantitative demonstration of this synergy is lacking. This paper introduces a novel stochastic learning-optimization framework that integrates Bayesian inference with inventory optimization for supply chain management (SCM). We model a two-echelon inventory system subject to stochastic demand and supply disruptions, comparing a traditional static optimization policy against an adaptive policy where Bayesian learning continuously updates parameter estimates to inform stochastic optimization. Our simulations over 365 periods across three operational scenarios demonstrate that the integrated approach achieves 7.4\\% cost reduction in stable environments and 5.7\\% improvement during supply disruptions, while revealing important limitations during sudden demand shocks due to the inherent conservatism of Bayesian updating.

Current shallow alignment methods that rely on direct refusal of malicious queries fail to provide robust protection, particularly against adversarial jailbreaks. While deliberative safety reasoning alignment offers deeper alignment for defending against sophisticated attacks, effectively implanting such reasoning capability in SLMs with limited capabilities remains an open challenge. Moreover, safety reasoning incurs significant computational overhead as models apply reasoning to nearly all queries, making it impractical for resource-constrained edge deployment scenarios that demand rapid responses. We propose EASE, a novel framework that enables practical and Efficient safety Alignment for Small languagE models. Our approach first identifies the optimal safety reasoning teacher that can effectively distill safety reasoning capabilities to SLMs. We then align models to selectively activate safety reasoning for dangerous adversarial jailbreak queries while providing direct responses to straightforward malicious queries and general helpful tasks. This selective mechanism enables small models to maintain robust safety guarantees against sophisticated attacks while preserving computational efficiency for benign interactions. Experimental results demonstrate that EASE reduces jailbreak attack success rates by up to 17% compared to shallow alignment methods while reducing inference overhead by up to 90% compared to deliberative safety reasoning alignment, making it practical for SLMs real-world edge deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "EASE\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5b89\u5168\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u8fc7\u5927\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u8bc6\u522b\u6700\u4f18\u5b89\u5168\u63a8\u7406\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5b89\u5168\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u4ec5\u5bf9\u5371\u9669\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8d8a\u72f1\u67e5\u8be2\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5bf9\u76f4\u63a5\u6076\u610f\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u4e00\u822c\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u5feb\u901f\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u6d45\u5c42\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cEASE\u5c06\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u8fbe17%\uff1b\u76f8\u6bd4\u6df1\u601d\u719f\u8651\u5b89\u5168\u63a8\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u51cf\u5c11\u8fbe90%\u3002", "conclusion": "EASE\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u9ad8\u6548\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u5927\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u62a4\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

This review surveys recent advances in physics-informed neural networks and operator learning, differentiable molecular simulation, and hybrid physics-ML potentials, with emphasis on long-timescale kinetics, rare events, and free-energy estimation.

Existing recommendation unlearning methods, while capable of removing target data influence, suffer from inefficient unlearning speed and degraded performance, failing to meet real-time unlearning demands. Considering the ranking-oriented nature of recommendation systems, we present unranking, the process of reducing the ranking positions of target items while ensuring the formal guarantees of recommendation unlearning. To achieve efficient unranking, we propose Learning to Fast Unrank in Collaborative Filtering Recommendation (L2UnRank), which operates through three key stages: (a) identifying the influenced scope via interaction-based p-hop propagation, (b) computing structural and semantic influences for entities within this scope, and (c) performing efficient, ranking-aware parameter updates guided by influence information. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and backbone models demonstrate L2UnRank's model-agnostic nature, achieving state-of-the-art unranking effectiveness and maintaining recommendation quality comparable to retraining, while also delivering a 50x speedup over existing methods.

However, despite the analytical capabilities of platforms such as the Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO), their application remains largely confined to domain experts. Developing realistic simulation scenarios requires expertise in network construction, origin-destination modeling, and parameter configuration for policy experimentation, creating substantial barriers for non-expert users such as policymakers, urban planners, and city officials. Moreover, the requests expressed by these users are often incomplete and abstract-typically articulated as high-level objectives, which are not well aligned with the imperative, sequential workflows employed in existing language-model-based simulation frameworks. To address these challenges, this study proposes AgentSUMO, an agentic framework for interactive simulation scenario generation via large language models. AgentSUMO departs from imperative, command-driven execution by introducing an adaptive reasoning layer that interprets user intents, assesses task complexity, infers missing parameters, and formulates executable simulation plans. The framework is structured around two complementary components, the Interactive Planning Protocol, which governs reasoning and user interaction, and the Model Context Protocol, which manages standardized communication and orchestration among simulation tools. Through this design, AgentSUMO converts abstract policy objectives into executable simulation scenarios. Experiments on urban networks in Seoul and Manhattan demonstrate that the agentic workflow achieves substantial improvements in traffic flow metrics while maintaining accessibility for non-expert users, successfully bridging the gap between policy goals and executable simulation workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "AgentSUMO\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u65b9\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u4ea4\u901a\u4eff\u771f\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5c06\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u76ee\u6807\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u975e\u4e13\u5bb6\u7528\u6237\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u95e8\u69db\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4ea4\u901a\u4eff\u771f\u5e73\u53f0\u5982SUMO\u4e3b\u8981\u9762\u5411\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u975e\u4e13\u5bb6\u7528\u6237\uff08\u5982\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u3001\u57ce\u5e02\u89c4\u5212\u8005\uff09\u96be\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4e14\u7528\u6237\u9700\u6c42\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u9ad8\u5c42\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u9a71\u52a8\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAgentSUMO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4ea4\u4e92\u89c4\u5212\u534f\u8bae\uff08\u7ba1\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\uff09\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u534f\u8bae\uff08\u7ba1\u7406\u4eff\u771f\u5de5\u5177\u95f4\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u7f16\u6392\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a8\u7406\u5c42\u89e3\u91ca\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3001\u63a8\u65ad\u7f3a\u5931\u53c2\u6570\u5e76\u5236\u5b9a\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u4eff\u771f\u8ba1\u5212\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9996\u5c14\u548c\u66fc\u54c8\u987f\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u7f51\u7edc\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cAgentSUMO\u5728\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5bf9\u975e\u4e13\u5bb6\u7528\u6237\u7684\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "AgentSUMO\u6210\u529f\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u653f\u7b56\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u4eff\u771f\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ea4\u901a\u4eff\u771f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6613\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "relevance": 40.0}}

However, obtaining high-resolution CSI remains challenging in practical wireless communication systems. To address this issue, we propose to utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and score-based generative models to enable robust HBF under imperfect CSI conditions. Firstly, we develop the Hybrid Message Graph Attention Network (HMGAT) which updates both node and edge features through node-level and edge-level message passing. Secondly, we design a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)-based Noise Conditional Score Network (NCSN) to learn the distribution of high-resolution CSI, facilitating CSI generation and data augmentation to further improve HMGAT's performance. Finally, we present a Denoising Score Network (DSN) framework and its instantiation, termed DeBERT, which can denoise imperfect CSI under arbitrary channel error levels, thereby facilitating robust HBF.

This work investigates the performance of five LLMs in generating RAG-based responses to medicine-related queries. Our contributions are three-fold: i) the creation of a benchmark dataset using consumer medicine information documents from the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), where headings are repurposed as natural language questions, ii) the retrieval of PubMed abstracts using TGA headings, stratified across multiple publication years, to enable controlled temporal evaluation of outdated evidence, and iii) a comparative analysis of the frequency and impact of outdated or contradictory content on model-generated responses, assessing how LLMs integrate and reconcile temporally inconsistent information. Our findings show that contradictions between highly similar abstracts do, in fact, degrade performance, leading to inconsistencies and reduced factual accuracy in model answers.

In a further main result of this work, which we refer to as \\emph{Adam symmetry theorem}, we illustrate the optimality of the established convergence rates by proving for a special class of simple quadratic strongly convex SOPs that Adam converges as the number of gradient steps increases to infinity to the solution of the SOP (the unique minimizer of the strongly convex objective function) if and \\emph{only} if the random variables in the SOP (the data in the SOP) are \\emph{symmetrically distributed}. In particular, in the standard case where the random variables in the SOP are not symmetrically distributed we \\emph{disprove} that Adam converges to the minimizer of the SOP as the number of Adam steps increases to infinity.

Leveraging this fine-grained model, we introduce Differentiated Bi-Directional Intervention (DBDI), a new white-box framework that precisely neutralizes the safety alignment at critical layer. DBDI applies adaptive projection nullification to the refusal execution direction while suppressing the harm detection direction via direct steering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DBDI outperforms prominent jailbreaking methods, achieving up to a 97.88\\% attack success rate on models such as Llama-2.

To address this, we developed ET2dNet, a deep learning-based EPI-TIRF cross-modality network that achieves TIRF-comparable background subtraction and axial super-resolution from a single wide-field image without requiring hardware modifications. The model employs a physics-informed hybrid architecture, synergizing supervised learning with registered EPI-TIRF image pairs and self-supervised physical modeling via convolution with the point spread function. This framework ensures exceptional generalization across microscope objectives, enabling few-shot adaptation to new imaging setups. Rigorous validation on cellular and tissue samples confirms ET2dNet's superiority in background suppression and axial resolution enhancement, while maintaining compatibility with deconvolution techniques for lateral resolution improvement. Furthermore, by extending this paradigm through knowledge distillation, we developed ET3dNet, a dedicated three-dimensional reconstruction network that produces artifact-reduced volumetric results. ET3dNet effectively removes out-of-focus background signals even when the input image stack lacks the source of background.

Ehrhardt"], "title": "Bilevel Learning via Inexact Stochastic Gradient Descent", "categories": ["math.OC", "cs.LG"], "comment": null, "summary": "Bilevel optimization is a central tool in machine learning for high-dimensional hyperparameter tuning. Its applications are vast; for instance, in imaging it can be used for learning data-adaptive regularizers and optimizing forward operators in variational regularization. These problems are large in many ways: a lot of data is usually available to train a large number of parameters, calling for stochastic gradient-based algorithms. However, exact gradients with respect to parameters (so-called hypergradients) are not available, and their precision is usually linearly related to computational cost. Hence, algorithms must solve the problem efficiently without unnecessary precision. The design of such methods is still not fully understood, especially regarding how accuracy requirements and step size schedules affect theoretical guarantees and practical performance. Existing approaches introduce stochasticity at both the upper level (e.g., in sampling or mini-batch estimates) and the lower level (e.g., in solving the inner problem) to improve generalization, but they typically fix the number of lower-level iterations, which conflicts with asymptotic convergence assumptions. In this work, we advance the theory of inexact stochastic bilevel optimization. We prove convergence and establish rates under decaying accuracy and step size schedules, showing that with optimal configurations convergence occurs at an $\\mathcal{O}(k^{-1/4})$ rate in expectation. Experiments on image denoising and inpainting with convex ridge regularizers and input-convex networks confirm our analysis: decreasing step sizes improve stability, accuracy scheduling is more critical than step size strategy, and adaptive preconditioning (e.g., Adam) further boosts performance.

However, training such models from scratch is both computationally expensive and yields diminishing returns once convergence is reached. To remedy these challenges, we propose ReFiT, a new framework that integrates Reinforcement learning (RL)-based Fine-Tuning into diffusion-based recommender systems. In contrast to prior RL approaches for diffusion models depending on external reward models, ReFiT adopts a task-aligned design: it formulates the denoising trajectory as a Markov decision process (MDP) and incorporates a collaborative signal-aware reward function that directly reflects recommendation quality. By tightly coupling the MDP structure with this reward signal, ReFiT empowers the RL agent to exploit high-order connectivity for fine-grained optimization, while avoiding the noisy or uninformative feedback common in naive reward designs. Leveraging policy gradient optimization, ReFiT maximizes exact log-likelihood of observed interactions, thereby enabling effective post hoc fine-tuning of diffusion recommenders. Comprehensive experiments on wide-ranging real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed ReFiT framework (a) exhibits substantial performance gains over strong competitors (up to 36.3% on sequential recommendation), (b) demonstrates strong efficiency with linear complexity in the number of users or items, and (c) generalizes well across multiple diffusion-based recommendation scenarios.

Under review", "summary": "The substantial memory bandwidth and computational demand of large language models (LLMs) present critical challenges for efficient inference. To tackle this, the literature has explored heterogeneous systems that combine neural processing units (NPUs) with DRAM-based processing-in-memory (PIM) for LLM acceleration. However, existing high-precision (e.g., FP16) PIM compute units incur significant area and power overhead in DRAM technology, limiting the effective computation throughput. In this paper, we introduce P3-LLM, a novel NPU-PIM integrated accelerator for LLM inference using hybrid numerical formats. Our approach is threefold: First, we propose a flexible mixed-precision quantization scheme, which leverages hybrid numerical formats to quantize different LLM operands with high compression efficiency and minimal accuracy loss. Second, we architect an efficient PIM accelerator co-design for P3-LLM, featuring lightweight compute units to support our hybrid numerical formats. The enhanced PIM compute units significantly boost the computation throughput under iso-area constraints. Third, we optimize the low-precision dataflow of different LLM modules by applying operator fusion to minimize the overhead of runtime dequantization. Our evaluation on a diverse set of representative LLMs and tasks demonstrates that P3-LLM achieves state-of-the-art quantization accuracy in terms of both KV-cache-only quantization and weight-activation quantization. Combining the proposed quantization scheme with PIM architecture co-design, P3-LLM yields an average of $4.9\\times$, $2.0\\times$, and $3.4\\times$ speedups over the state-of-the-art LLM accelerators HBM-PIM, Ecco, and Pimba, respectively.

In particular, we add organ segmentation masks from the TotalSegmentator tool as auxiliary inputs to provide anatomical context to nnDetection, which is the state-of-the-art for lesion detection, and Swin Transformer. The latter is trained in two stages that combine self-supervised pre-training and supervised fine-tuning. The method is tested in the AutoPET and Karolinska lymphoma datasets. The results indicate that the inclusion of anatomical priors substantially improves the detection performance within the nnDetection framework, while it has almost no impact on the performance of the vision transformer.

In this paper, we propose Diffolio, a diffusion model designed for multivariate financial time-series forecasting and portfolio construction. Diffolio employs a denoising network with a hierarchical attention architecture, comprising both asset-level and market-level layers. Furthermore, to better reflect cross-sectional correlations, we introduce a correlation-guided regularizer informed by a stable estimate of the target correlation matrix. This structure effectively extracts salient features not only from historical returns but also from asset-specific and systematic covariates, significantly enhancing the performance of forecasts and portfolios. Experimental results on the daily excess returns of 12 industry portfolios show that Diffolio outperforms various probabilistic forecasting baselines in multivariate forecasting accuracy and portfolio performance. Moreover, in portfolio experiments, portfolios constructed from Diffolio's forecasts show consistently robust performance, thereby outperforming those from benchmarks by achieving higher Sharpe ratios for the mean-variance tangency portfolio and higher certainty equivalents for the growth-optimal portfolio. These results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed Diffolio in terms of not only statistical accuracy but also economic significance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Diffolio\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u5143\u91d1\u878d\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u5f15\u5bfc\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u6765\u6355\u6349\u8de8\u8d44\u4ea7\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u610f\u4e49\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u5143\u91d1\u878d\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u8003\u8651\u590d\u6742\u6a2a\u622a\u9762\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6355\u6349\u8de8\u8d44\u4ea7\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDiffolio\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5177\u6709\u8d44\u4ea7\u7ea7\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u7ea7\u5c42\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u964d\u566a\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u76f8\u5173\u77e9\u9635\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u5f15\u5bfc\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u572812\u4e2a\u884c\u4e1a\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u65e5\u8d85\u989d\u6536\u76ca\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0cDiffolio\u5728\u591a\u5143\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u8868\u73b0\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u5404\u79cd\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u590f\u666e\u6bd4\u7387\u548c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7b49\u4ef7\u3002", "conclusion": "Diffolio\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u610f\u4e49\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u91d1\u878d\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u6784\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "relevance": 30.0}}

However, existing benchmarks for LLM-based code review face three major limitations. (1) Lack of semantic context: most benchmarks provide only code diffs without textual information such as issue descriptions, which are crucial for understanding developer intent. (2) Data quality issues: without rigorous validation, many samples are noisy-e.g., reviews on outdated or irrelevant code-reducing evaluation reliability. (3) Coarse granularity: most benchmarks operate at the file or commit level, overlooking the fine-grained, line-level reasoning essential for precise review.\n  We introduce ContextCRBench, a high-quality, context-rich benchmark for fine-grained LLM evaluation in code review. Our construction pipeline comprises: (1) Raw Data Crawling, collecting 153.7K issues and pull requests from top-tier repositories; (2) Comprehensive Context Extraction, linking issue-PR pairs for textual context and extracting the full surrounding function or class for code context; and (3) Multi-stage Data Filtering, combining rule-based and LLM-based validation to remove outdated, malformed, or low-value samples, resulting in 67,910 context-enriched entries.\n  ContextCRBench supports three evaluation scenarios aligned with the review workflow: (1) hunk-level quality assessment, (2) line-level defect localization, and (3) line-level comment generation. Evaluating eight leading LLMs (four closed-source and four open-source) reveals that textual context yields greater performance gains than code context alone, while current LLMs remain far from human-level review ability.

Quantum error mitigation (QEM) techniques are leading solutions to improve computation fidelity with relatively low qubit-overhead, while full-scale quantum error correction remains a distant goal. However, QEM techniques incur substantial measurement overheads, especially when applied to families of quantum circuits parameterized by classical inputs. Focusing on zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE), a widely adopted QEM technique, here we devise the surrogate-enabled ZNE (S-ZNE), which leverages classical learning surrogates to perform ZNE entirely on the classical side. Unlike conventional ZNE, whose measurement cost scales linearly with the number of circuits, S-ZNE requires only constant measurement overhead for an entire family of quantum circuits, offering superior scalability. Theoretical analysis indicates that S-ZNE achieves accuracy comparable to conventional ZNE in many practical scenarios, and numerical experiments on up to 100-qubit ground-state energy and quantum metrology tasks confirm its effectiveness.

However, malicious exploitation like voice-cloning fraud poses severe security risks. Existing defense techniques struggle to address the production large language model (LLM)-based speech synthesis. While previous studies have considered the protection for fine-tuning synthesizers, they assume manually annotated transcripts. Given the labor intensity of manual annotation, end-to-end (E2E) systems leveraging automatic speech recognition (ASR) to generate transcripts are becoming increasingly prevalent, e.g., voice cloning via commercial APIs. Therefore, this E2E speech synthesis also requires new security mechanisms. To tackle these challenges, we propose E2E-VGuard, a proactive defense framework for two emerging threats: (1) production LLM-based speech synthesis, and (2) the novel attack arising from ASR-driven E2E scenarios. Specifically, we employ the encoder ensemble with a feature extractor to protect timbre, while ASR-targeted adversarial examples disrupt pronunciation. Moreover, we incorporate the psychoacoustic model to ensure perturbative imperceptibility.

NMF is a difficult problem in general (NP-hard), and its solutions are typically not unique. To address these two issues, additional constraints or assumptions are often used. In particular, separability assumes that the basis vectors in the NMF are equal to some columns of the input matrix. In that case, the problem is referred to as separable NMF (SNMF) and can be solved in polynomial-time with robustness guarantees, while identifying a unique solution. However, in real-world scenarios, due to noise or variability, multiple data points may lie near the basis vectors, which SNMF does not leverage. In this work, we rely on the smooth separability assumption, which assumes that each basis vector is close to multiple data points. We explore the properties of the corresponding problem, referred to as smooth SNMF (SSNMF), and examine how it relates to SNMF and orthogonal NMF. We then propose a convex model for SSNMF and show that it provably recovers the sought-after factors, even in the presence of noise. We finally adapt an existing fast gradient method to solve this convex model for SSNMF, and show that it compares favorably with state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and hyperspectral datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5e73\u6ed1\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u975e\u8d1f\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u89e3(SSNMF)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5047\u8bbe\u6bcf\u4e2a\u57fa\u5411\u91cf\u63a5\u8fd1\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u5206\u79bbNMF\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u51f8\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u68af\u5ea6\u6c42\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u53ef\u5206\u79bbNMF\u5047\u8bbe\u57fa\u5411\u91cf\u7b49\u4e8e\u8f93\u5165\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u67d0\u4e9b\u5217\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7531\u4e8e\u566a\u58f0\u6216\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u53ef\u80fd\u4f4d\u4e8e\u57fa\u5411\u91cf\u9644\u8fd1\uff0c\u800cSNMF\u672a\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e00\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e73\u6ed1\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u63d0\u51faSSNMF\u51f8\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u76ee\u6807\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u5feb\u901f\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SSNMF\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u5e73\u6ed1\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u5b58\u5728\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u6062\u590d\u56e0\u5b50\u3002", "relevance": 10.0}}

Factors such as tire characteristics, road surface conditions, aerodynamic disturbances, and vehicle load make it infeasible to model real-world dynamics accurately, which hinders direct transfer of RL agents trained in simulation. In this paper, we present a framework that decouples motion planning from vehicle control through a spatial and temporal alignment strategy between a virtual vehicle and the real system. An RL agent is first trained in simulation using a kinematic bicycle model to output continuous control actions. Its behavior is then distilled into a trajectory-predicting agent that generates finite-horizon ego-vehicle trajectories, enabling synchronization between virtual and real vehicles. At deployment, a Stanley controller governs lateral dynamics, while longitudinal alignment is maintained through adaptive update mechanisms that compensate for deviations between virtual and real trajectories. We validate our approach on a real vehicle and demonstrate that the proposed alignment strategy enables robust zero-shot transfer of RL-based motion planning from simulation to reality, successfully decoupling high-level trajectory generation from low-level vehicle control.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c06\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u8f66\u8f86\u63a7\u5236\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u865a\u62df\u8f66\u8f86\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0RL\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ece\u4eff\u771f\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u8f66\u8f86\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5c06\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u76f4\u63a5\u90e8\u7f72\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u8f66\u8f86\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u8f6e\u80ce\u7279\u6027\u3001\u8def\u9762\u6761\u4ef6\u3001\u7a7a\u6c14\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6270\u52a8\u548c\u8f66\u8f86\u8f7d\u8377\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u4f7f\u5f97\u51c6\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u81ea\u884c\u8f66\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3RL\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8f93\u51fa\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u70bc\u4e3a\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u57df\u81ea\u8f66\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528Stanley\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u63a7\u5236\u6a2a\u5411\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u66f4\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u4fdd\u6301\u7eb5\u5411\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u8f66\u8f86\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8eRL\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u4ece\u4eff\u771f\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c06\u9ad8\u5c42\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u4f4e\u5c42\u8f66\u8f86\u63a7\u5236\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4eff\u771f\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "relevance": 20.0}}

These systems can be characterized by estimating their parameters from sampled data. The key problem is how to optimally select sampling points to achieve accurate parameter estimation. Classical approaches often rely on Fisher information matrix-based criteria such as A-, D-, and E-optimality, which require an initial parameter estimate and may yield suboptimal results when the estimate is inaccurate. This study proposes two simulation-based methods for optimal sampling design that do not depend on initial parameter estimates. The first method, E-optimal-ranking (EOR), employs the E-optimal criterion, while the second utilizes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. Simulation studies based on the Lotka-Volterra and three-compartment models demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform both random selection and classical E-optimal design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u91c7\u6837\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08EOR\u548cLSTM\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u521d\u59cb\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728Lotka-Volterra\u548c\u4e09\u5ba4\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u7ecf\u5178E\u6700\u4f18\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u4e2d\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u9700\u8981\u6700\u4f18\u91c7\u6837\u70b9\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4f46\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u521d\u59cb\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u6b21\u4f18\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09E\u6700\u4f18\u6392\u5e8f\uff08EOR\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528E\u6700\u4f18\u51c6\u5219\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8eLSTM\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u521d\u59cb\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u5728Lotka-Volterra\u548c\u4e09\u5ba4\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u7ecf\u5178E\u6700\u4f18\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u51c6\u786e\u521d\u59cb\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "relevance": 15.0}}

Most privacy analyses provide privacy bounds specifying a noise level sufficient to achieve a target privacy guarantee. Sometimes, these bounds are pessimistic and suggest adding excessive noise, which overwhelms the meaningful signal. It remains unclear if such high noise levels are truly necessary or a limitation of the proof techniques. This paper explores whether we can obtain sharp privacy characterizations that identify the smallest noise level required to achieve a target privacy level for a given mechanism. We study this problem in the context of differentially private principal component analysis, where the goal is to privatize the leading principal components (PCs) of a dataset with n samples and p features. We analyze the exponential mechanism for this problem in a model-free setting and provide sharp utility and privacy characterizations in the high-dimensional limit ($p\\rightarrow\\infty$). Our privacy result shows that, in high dimensions, detecting the presence of a target individual in the dataset using the privatized PCs is exactly as hard as distinguishing two Gaussians with slightly different means, where the mean difference depends on certain spectral properties of the dataset. Our privacy analysis combines the hypothesis-testing formulation of privacy guarantees proposed by Dong, Roth, and Su (2022) with classical contiguity arguments due to Le Cam to obtain sharp high-dimensional privacy characterizations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4e2d\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u5206\u6790(DP-PCA)\u7684\u5c16\u9510\u9690\u79c1\u8868\u5f81\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6307\u6570\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5c06\u4e2a\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u533a\u5206\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u5206\u6790\u5f80\u5f80\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4fdd\u5b88\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6dfb\u52a0\u8fc7\u591a\u566a\u58f0\u6df9\u6ca1\u6709\u7528\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u9700\u8981\u786e\u5b9a\u5b9e\u73b0\u76ee\u6807\u9690\u79c1\u7ea7\u522b\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u8fc7\u5ea6\u566a\u58f0\u6dfb\u52a0\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Dong\u7b49\u4eba\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Le Cam\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u90bb\u63a5\u6027\u8bba\u8bc1\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6781\u9650(p\u2192\u221e)\u4e0b\u5206\u6790\u6307\u6570\u673a\u5236\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u79c1\u6709\u5316\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u68c0\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u4e2a\u4f53\u662f\u5426\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\u7b49\u540c\u4e8e\u533a\u5206\u4e24\u4e2a\u5747\u503c\u7565\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5747\u503c\u5dee\u5f02\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u8c31\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86DP-PCA\u7684\u5c16\u9510\u9690\u79c1\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u4e3a\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u5c0f\u5fc5\u8981\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7528\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "relevance": 35.0}}

We exploit idiosyncratic variation introduced by the recommendation algorithm to identify and separately value these components as well as to recover model-free diversion ratios that we can use to validate our structural model. We use the model to evaluate counterfactuals that quantify the incremental engagement generated by personalized recommendations. First, we show that replacing the current recommender system with a matrix factorization or popularity-based algorithm would lead to 4% and 12% reduction in engagement, respectively, and decreased consumption diversity.

This paper introduces a Probabilistic Active Inference Resilience Agent (PAIR-Agent) to achieve resilience in DCC systems. PAIR-Agent performs three core operations: (i) constructing a causal fault graph from device logs, (ii) identifying faults while managing certainties and uncertainties using Markov blankets and the free-energy principle, and (iii) autonomously healing issues through active inference. Through continuous monitoring and adaptive reconfiguration, the agent maintains service continuity and stability under diverse failure conditions. Theoretical validations confirm the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6982\u7387\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a8\u7406\u5f39\u6027\u4ee3\u7406(PAIR-Agent)\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fde\u7eed\u4f53\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f39\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u56e0\u679c\u6545\u969c\u56fe\u3001\u7ba1\u7406\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u81ea\u4e3b\u4fee\u590d\u6765\u7ef4\u6301\u670d\u52a1\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u590d\u6742\u548c\u5f02\u6784\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fde\u7eed\u4f53(DCC)\u4e2d\uff0c\u6545\u969c\u662f\u5e38\u6001\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u8de8\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684IoT\u8fb9\u7f18\u8282\u70b9\u5230\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u5b9e\u65f6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u534f\u8c03\u7684AI\u9a71\u52a8\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u3002", "method": "PAIR-Agent\u6267\u884c\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u64cd\u4f5c\uff1a(i)\u4ece\u8bbe\u5907\u65e5\u5fd7\u6784\u5efa\u56e0\u679c\u6545\u969c\u56fe\uff0c(ii)\u4f7f\u7528\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6bef\u548c\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\u539f\u7406\u7ba1\u7406\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u6545\u969c\uff0c(iii)\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a8\u7406\u81ea\u4e3b\u4fee\u590d\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u63a7\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cd\u914d\u7f6e\u6765\u7ef4\u6301\u670d\u52a1\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u6545\u969c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7ef4\u6301\u670d\u52a1\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "PAIR-Agent\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fde\u7eed\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f39\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7ba1\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6545\u969c\u6062\u590d\u3002", "relevance": 30.0}}

Furthermore, we offer an interpretation of Mahalanobis whitening as a two-stage de-individualization of data which is motivated by similarity as captured by the Bures distance, which is connected to quantum mechanics.

In this paper, we reflect the main research achievements of MIR along the three EDICS related to music analysis, processing and generation. We then review a set of successful practices that fuel the rapid development of MIR research. One practice is the annual research benchmark, the Music Information Retrieval Evaluation eXchange, where participants compete on a set of research tasks. Another practice is the pursuit of reproducible and open research. The active engagement with industry research and products is another key factor for achieving large societal impacts and motivating younger generations of students to join the field.

Effective LLM assistance hinges on selecting informative context -- the minimal set of cells whose code, data, or outputs suffice to answer a prompt. As notebooks grow long and messy, users can lose track of the mental model of their analysis. They thus fail to curate appropriate contexts for LLM tasks, causing frustration and tedious prompt engineering. We conducted a formative study (n=6) that surfaced challenges in LLM context selection and mental model maintenance.

LLMServingSim2.0 addresses two key limitations of its predecessor: (1) integrating hardware models into system-level simulators is non-trivial due to the lack of a clear abstraction, and (2) existing simulators support only a narrow subset of serving techniques, leaving no infrastructure that captures the breadth of approaches in modern LLM serving. To overcome these issues, LLMServingSim2.0 adopts trace-driven performance modeling, accompanied by an operator-level latency profiler, enabling the integration of new accelerators with a single command. It further embeds up-to-date serving techniques while exposing flexible interfaces for request routing, cache management, and scheduling policies. In a TPU case study, our profiler requires 18.5x fewer LoC and outperforms the predecessor's hardware-simulator integration, demonstrating LLMServingSim2.0's low-effort hardware extensibility.

We introduce the Walsh-Hadamard Neural Operator (WHNO), which leverages Walsh-Hadamard transforms-a spectral basis of rectangular wave functions naturally suited for piecewise constant fields-combined with learnable spectral weights that transform low-sequency Walsh coefficients to capture global dependencies efficiently. We validate WHNO on three problems: steady-state Darcy flow (preliminary validation), heat conduction with discontinuous thermal conductivity, and the 2D Burgers equation with discontinuous initial conditions. In controlled comparisons with Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) under identical conditions, WHNO demonstrates superior accuracy with better preservation of sharp solution features at material interfaces. Critically, we discover that weighted ensemble combinations of WHNO and FNO achieve substantial improvements over either model alone: for both heat conduction and Burgers equation, optimal ensembles reduce mean squared error by 35-40 percent and maximum error by up to 25 percent compared to individual models.

To address this, we propose a Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) framework to enable UAV-assisted communication by jointly optimizing UAV trajectories, transmission power, and user-UAV association under a sleeping ground base station (GBS) strategy. This framework aims to ensure the resilience of active users in the network and the long-term operability of UAVs. Specifically, it maximizes service coverage for users during power outages or NES zones, while minimizing the energy consumption of UAVs. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MADDPG policy consistently achieves high coverage ratio across different testing episodes, outperforming other baselines. Moreover, the MADDPG framework attains the lowest total energy consumption, with a reduction of approximately 24\\% compared to the conventional all GBS ON configuration, while maintaining a comparable user service rate.

While AI tools can potentially alleviate social barriers and institutional constraints, there are risks of misinformation and uprooting human camaraderie. Our findings contribute design considerations for AI that support LEP patients and care teams via rapport-building, education, and language support, and minimizing disruptions to existing practices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6545\u4e8b\u677f\u8bbf\u8c08\u63a2\u8ba8AI\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u8bed\u6709\u9650\u82f1\u8bed\u80fd\u529b\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u533b\u7597\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6587\u5316\u8bef\u89e3\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u652f\u6301\u60a3\u8005\u548c\u62a4\u7406\u56e2\u961f\u7684AI\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8003\u8651\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f8e\u56fd\u6709\u9650\u82f1\u8bed\u80fd\u529b\u60a3\u8005\u9762\u4e34\u8d85\u8d8a\u8bed\u8a00\u969c\u788d\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u533b\u7597\u58c1\u5792\uff0cAI\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u5373\u65f6\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6539\u5584\u6c9f\u901a\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u52a0\u5267\u73b0\u6709\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u3002", "method": "\u5bf914\u540d\u60a3\u8005\u5bfc\u822a\u5458\u8fdb\u884c\u6545\u4e8b\u677f\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8bbf\u8c08\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8AI\u5982\u4f55\u5851\u9020\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u8bed\u6709\u9650\u82f1\u8bed\u80fd\u529b\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u62a4\u7406\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6587\u5316\u8bef\u89e3\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u62c5\u5fe7\u7b49\u7d27\u5f20\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0AI\u53ef\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u793e\u4f1a\u969c\u788d\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u7834\u574f\u4eba\u9645\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e94\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acb\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u652f\u6301\u6765\u5e2e\u52a9\u6709\u9650\u82f1\u8bed\u80fd\u529b\u60a3\u8005\u548c\u62a4\u7406\u56e2\u961f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "relevance": 30.0}}

Previous studies have attempted to identify noisy samples through their diverged data patterns, such as higher loss values, and mitigate their influence through sample dropping or reweighting. However, we observed that noisy samples and hard samples display similar patterns, leading to hard-noisy confusion issue. Such confusion is problematic as hard samples are vital for modeling user preferences. To solve this problem, we propose LLMHNI framework, leveraging two auxiliary user-item relevance signals generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) to differentiate hard and noisy samples. LLMHNI obtains user-item semantic relevance from LLM-encoded embeddings, which is used in negative sampling to select hard negatives while filtering out noisy false negatives. An objective alignment strategy is proposed to project LLM-encoded embeddings, originally for general language tasks, into a representation space optimized for user-item relevance modeling. LLMHNI also exploits LLM-inferred logical relevance within user-item interactions to identify hard and noisy samples. These LLM-inferred interactions are integrated into the interaction graph and guide denoising with cross-graph contrastive alignment. To eliminate the impact of unreliable interactions induced by LLM hallucination, we propose a graph contrastive learning strategy that aligns representations from randomly edge-dropped views to suppress unreliable edges. Empirical results demonstrate that LLMHNI significantly improves denoising and recommendation performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMHNI\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u8f85\u52a9\u7528\u6237-\u7269\u54c1\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u533a\u5206\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u56f0\u96be\u6837\u672c\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u8d1f\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u53bb\u566a\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u8350\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u53cd\u9988\u5b58\u5728\u566a\u58f0\uff08\u5982\u8bef\u70b9\u51fb\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u5dee\uff09\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u635f\u5931\u503c\u7b49\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u566a\u58f0\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u56f0\u96be\u6837\u672c\u4e0e\u566a\u58f0\u6837\u672c\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u4f3c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6df7\u6dc6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "method": "1) \u5229\u7528LLM\u7f16\u7801\u5d4c\u5165\u83b7\u53d6\u7528\u6237-\u7269\u54c1\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8d1f\u91c7\u6837\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51fa\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\u5c06LLM\u5d4c\u5165\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u7528\u6237-\u7269\u54c1\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b3) \u5229\u7528LLM\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8bc6\u522b\u56f0\u96be/\u566a\u58f0\u6837\u672c\uff1b4) \u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u9f50\u968f\u673a\u8fb9\u4e22\u5f03\u89c6\u56fe\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u6765\u6291\u5236\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u8fb9\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eLLMHNI\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u53bb\u566a\u548c\u63a8\u8350\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMHNI\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u56f0\u96be\u6837\u672c\u4e0e\u566a\u58f0\u6837\u672c\u7684\u6df7\u6dc6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u4fe1\u53f7\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "relevance": 75.0}}

Yet the calculation of $n$-RDMs is often computationally inefficient for strongly-correlated states, particularly when the system sizes are large. In this work, we propose to use neural network (NN) architectures to accelerate the calculation of, and even predict, the $n$-RDMs for large-size systems. The underlying intuition is that $n$-RDMs are often smooth functions over the Brillouin zone (BZ) (certainly true for gapped states) and are thus interpolable, allowing NNs trained on small-size $n$-RDMs to predict large-size ones. Building on this intuition, we devise two NNs: (i) a self-attention NN that maps random RDMs to physical ones, and (ii) a Sinusoidal Representation Network (SIREN) that directly maps momentum-space coordinates to RDM values. We test the NNs in three 2D models: the pair-pair correlation functions of the Richardson model of superconductivity, the translationally-invariant 1-RDM in a four-band model with short-range repulsion, and the translation-breaking 1-RDM in the half-filled Hubbard model. We find that a SIREN trained on a $6\\times 6$ momentum mesh can predict the $18\\times 18$ pair-pair correlation function with a relative accuracy of $0.839$. The NNs trained on $6\\times 6 \\sim 8\\times 8$ meshes can provide high-quality initial guesses for $50\\times 50$ translation-invariant Hartree-Fock (HF) and $30\\times 30$ fully translation-breaking-allowed HF, reducing the number of iterations required for convergence by up to $91.63\\%$ and $92.78\\%$, respectively, compared to random initializations. Our results illustrate the potential of using NN-based methods for interpolable $n$-RDMs, which might open a new avenue for future research on strongly correlated phases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u52a0\u901f\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u5927\u5c3a\u5bf8\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684n\u7c92\u5b50\u7ea6\u5316\u5bc6\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635(n-RDMs)\uff0c\u5229\u7528n-RDMs\u5728\u5e03\u91cc\u6e0a\u533a\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5bf8\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u5927\u5c3a\u5bf8\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684n-RDMs\u3002", "motivation": "n-RDMs\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u5173\u8054\u7269\u8d28\u76f8\u4e2d\u8d77\u6838\u5fc3\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f3a\u5173\u8054\u6001\u7684\u5927\u5c3a\u5bf8\u7cfb\u7edfn-RDMs\u901a\u5e38\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u5229\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u52a0\u901f\u8fd9\u4e00\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff1a(1)\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5c06\u968f\u673aRDM\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u7269\u7406RDM\uff1b(2)\u6b63\u5f26\u8868\u793a\u7f51\u7edc(SIREN)\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5c06\u52a8\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u5750\u6807\u6620\u5c04\u5230RDM\u503c\u3002\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a2D\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "SIREN\u57286\u00d76\u52a8\u91cf\u7f51\u683c\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\uff0c\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b18\u00d718\u914d\u5bf9-\u914d\u5bf9\u5173\u8054\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8fbe0.839\u3002\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11Hartree-Fock\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u51cf\u5c1192.78%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u53ef\u63d2\u503cn-RDMs\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5173\u8054\u76f8\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u8f9f\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "relevance": 15.0}}

Yet, how to effectively use these models for closed-loop symbolic planning remains largely unexplored. Because they operate as black boxes, LLMs and VLMs can produce unpredictable or costly errors, making their use in high-level robotic planning especially challenging. In this work, we investigate how to use VLMs as closed-loop symbolic planners for robotic applications from a control-theoretic perspective. Concretely, we study how the control horizon and warm-starting impact the performance of VLM symbolic planners. We design and conduct controlled experiments to gain insights that are broadly applicable to utilizing VLMs as closed-loop symbolic planners, and we discuss recommendations that can help improve the performance of VLM symbolic planners.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u4ece\u63a7\u5236\u7406\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\u4f7f\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u95ed\u73af\u7b26\u53f7\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u63a7\u5236\u65f6\u57df\u548c\u70ed\u542f\u52a8\u5bf9\u89c4\u5212\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs\u548cVLMs\u5728\u5177\u8eab\u7b26\u53f7\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ed1\u76d2\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u5c24\u5176\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u95ed\u73af\u7b26\u53f7\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u63a7\u5236\u7406\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53d7\u63a7\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u63a7\u5236\u65f6\u57df\u548c\u70ed\u542f\u52a8\u5bf9VLM\u7b26\u53f7\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u53ef\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u63a7\u5236\u65f6\u57df\u548c\u70ed\u542f\u52a8\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cdVLM\u7b26\u53f7\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ece\u63a7\u5236\u7406\u8bba\u89d2\u5ea6\u5206\u6790VLM\u7b26\u53f7\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff0c\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdb\u5176\u95ed\u73af\u89c4\u5212\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\u548c\u6307\u5bfc\u539f\u5219\u3002", "relevance": 65.0}}
