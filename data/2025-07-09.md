TL;DR: TokenShapley是一种新颖的基于令牌级别的归因方法，结合Shapley值和KNN检索技术，显著提升了LLM生成响应的正确性验证能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在验证LLM生成响应的正确性时，特别是在特定关键词（如数字、年份、名称）的归因上存在不足。

Method: 提出TokenShapley方法，结合Shapley值的数据归因和KNN检索技术，利用预计算的数据存储进行上下文检索，量化令牌重要性。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，TokenShapley在令牌级别归因上优于现有方法，准确率提升11-23%。

Conclusion: TokenShapley为LLM生成响应的细粒度数据归因提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in in-context
learning, but verifying the correctness of their generated responses remains a
challenge. Prior work has explored attribution at the sentence level, but these
methods fall short when users seek attribution for specific keywords within the
response, such as numbers, years, or names. To address this limitation, we
propose TokenShapley, a novel token-level attribution method that combines
Shapley value-based data attribution with KNN-based retrieval techniques
inspired by recent advances in KNN-augmented LLMs. By leveraging a precomputed
datastore for contextual retrieval and computing Shapley values to quantify
token importance, TokenShapley provides a fine-grained data attribution
approach. Extensive evaluations on four benchmarks show that TokenShapley
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in token-level attribution, achieving an
11-23% improvement in accuracy.

TL;DR: 论文提出用户行为预测作为衡量LLM泛化能力的新方法，替代传统的知识检索和推理任务，并在实验中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数据污染问题，传统方法难以准确衡量LLM的泛化能力，因此需要一种更可靠的方法。

Method: 提出基于用户行为预测的框架，并在电影和音乐推荐数据集上测试GPT-4o、GPT-4o-mini和Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct。

Result: GPT-4o表现优于其他模型，但所有模型仍有改进空间，尤其是Llama。

Conclusion: 用户行为预测是一种理论可靠、可扩展且稳健的替代方法，适用于衡量LLM的泛化能力。

Abstract: Measuring the generalization ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
challenging due to data contamination. As models grow and computation becomes
cheaper, ensuring tasks and test cases are unseen during training phases will
become nearly impossible. We argue that knowledge-retrieval and reasoning tasks
are not ideal for measuring generalization, as LLMs are not trained for
specific tasks. Instead, we propose user behavior prediction, also a key aspect
of personalization, as a theoretically sound, scalable, and robust alternative.
We introduce a novel framework for this approach and test it on movie and music
recommendation datasets for GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct.
Results align with our framework's predictions, showing GPT-4o outperforms
GPT-4o-mini and Llama, though all models have much room for improvement,
especially Llama.

Conclusion: LAG是一种高效且灵活的方法，适用于知识密集型任务，并能与其他解决方案结合使用。

Abstract: The proliferation of fine-tuned language model experts for specific tasks and
domains signals the need for efficient selection and combination methods. We
propose LoRA-Augmented Generation (LAG) for leveraging large libraries of
knowledge and task-specific LoRA adapters. LAG requires no additional training

per-token and layer basis. We evaluate LAG on various knowledge-intensive
tasks, achieving superior performance over existing data-free methods. We
explore scenarios where additional data is available, demonstrating LAG's
compatibility with alternative solutions such as retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG).

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，在LLMs中，低效但连贯的推理痕迹比最优痕迹更能提升模型泛化能力，与模型对下一标记预测的信心相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过优化推理痕迹（如链式思维）提升LLMs的推理能力，尤其是在计算资源分配和系统性推理方面。

Method: 使用最短路径任务和分层图构建受控环境，训练解码器Transformer模型，比较不同推理痕迹（最优动态规划与低效回溯）的效果。

Result: 低效但连贯的推理痕迹在相同训练标记预算下泛化能力更强，与模型预测信心相关。

Conclusion: 长且连贯的推理痕迹更易于优化训练信号，而非单纯增加冗余。

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing highlight two key factors for
improving reasoning in large language models (LLMs): (i) allocating more
test-time compute tends to help on harder problems but often introduces
redundancy in the reasoning trace, and (ii) compute is most effective when
reasoning is systematic and incremental, forming structured chains of thought
(CoTs) akin to human problem-solving. To study these factors in isolation, we
introduce a controlled setting based on shortest-path tasks in layered graphs.
We train decoder-only transformers on question-trace-answer triples using a
custom tokenizer, comparing models trained on optimal bottom-up dynamic
programming traces with those trained on longer, valid traces involving
backtracking. Surprisingly, with the same training-token budget, models trained
on inefficient traces generalize better to unseen graphs. This benefit is not
due to length alone-injecting arbitrary redundancy into reasoning traces fails
to help and can even hurt performance. Instead, we find that generalization
correlates with the model's confidence in next-token prediction, suggesting
that long, coherent, and locally incremental traces make the training signal
easier to optimize.

TL;DR: InfoRidge框架通过信息论分析Transformer中间层在训练中的信息流动，发现预测信息在中间层形成“泛化岭”，揭示中间层对泛化的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解Transformer内部机制，尤其是中间层如何促进泛化能力。

Method: 提出InfoRidge框架，通过信息论分析预测信息在层间的变化，并引入残差缩放系数作为功能探针。

Result: 预测信息在中间层达到峰值（泛化岭），最终层依赖减少；分布偏移时模型更依赖中间层。

Conclusion: 中间层在Transformer泛化中起关键作用，为模型内部机制提供新见解。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models have achieved state-of-the-art performance
in natural language generation (NLG) tasks, yet their internal mechanisms for
synthesizing task-relevant information remain insufficiently understood. While
prior studies suggest that intermediate layers often yield more generalizable
representations than final layers, how this generalization ability emerges and
propagates across layers during training remains unclear. To address this gap,
we propose InfoRidge, an information-theoretic framework, to characterize how
predictive information-the mutual information between hidden representations
and target outputs-varies across depth. Estimating this quantity enables us to
trace the flow of task-relevant information throughout the model during
training. Our experiments across various models and datasets reveal a
consistent non-monotonic trend: predictive information peaks in upper-middle
layers-forming a generalization ridge-before declining in final layers,
reflecting a transition between generalization and memorization. To further
investigate this phenomenon, we introduce residual scaling
coefficients-trainable scalar parameters applied to each residual block-which
serve as functional probes for assessing the relative importance of individual
transformer layers. These coefficients reveal that, under distribution shift,
models downweight final layers and increasingly rely on ridge layers,
highlighting their role in generalization. Together, these findings offer new
insights into the internal mechanisms of transformers and underscore the
critical role of intermediate layers in supporting generalization.

TL;DR: 论文提出GeoFact-X基准和BRIDGE方法，提升多语言推理能力，解决LLMs在低资源语言中的偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在多语言任务中表现不足，尤其在低资源语言中易出现偏差，影响准确性和可信度。

Method: 引入GeoFact-X基准和BRIDGE训练方法，结合监督微调和强化学习，通过语言一致性奖励优化推理。

Result: BRIDGE显著提升多语言推理的准确性和一致性。

Conclusion: 推理感知的多语言强化学习对跨语言泛化至关重要。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance in domains like
mathematics, factual QA, and code generation, yet their multilingual reasoning
capabilities in these tasks remain underdeveloped. Especially for low-resource
languages such as Swahili or Thai, LLMs can often misinterpret prompts or
default to reasoning in English. This implicit bias toward high-resource
languages undermines factual accuracy, interpretability, and trust. Current
multilingual benchmarks focus only on final answers, overlooking whether models
actually reason in the target language. To address this gap, we introduce
GeoFact-X, a geography-based multilingual factual reasoning benchmark with
annotated reasoning traces in five languages: English, Hindi, Japanese,
Swahili, and Thai. We further propose BRIDGE, a novel training method that
guides supervised fine-tuning and test-time reinforcement learning with a
language-consistency reward to align reasoning with the input language.
Finally, we develop an automatic evaluation protocol using LLM-as-a-judge to
assess answer correctness and the quality and language consistency of reasoning
traces, enabling nuanced and scalable analysis beyond surface-level metrics.
Our results show that BRIDGE significantly enhances multilingual reasoning
fidelity, demonstrating that reasoning-aware multilingual reinforcement
learning is crucial for robust cross-lingual generalization.

TL;DR: CoPE框架评估大语言模型（LLMs）如何整合上下文知识（CK）和参数知识（PK），发现LLMs存在‘later-in-the-lost’现象，即忽视上下文中的后部信息。CoT提示会降低上下文利用，而CK-informed提示可改善事实基础和减少幻觉。

Motivation: 探索LLMs如何优先和整合上下文与参数知识，填补这一研究空白。

Method: 提出CoPE评估框架，使用MultiWikiAtomic数据集分析LLMs在开放问答中的表现，发现‘later-in-the-lost’现象。

Result: LLMs存在位置偏见，CoT提示降低上下文利用；CK-informed提示改善事实基础。

Conclusion: CK-informed提示能有效提升LLMs的上下文利用和事实基础。

Abstract: Large language models are capable of leveraging both contextual and
parametric knowledge but how they prioritize and integrate these sources
remains underexplored. We introduce CoPE, a novel evaluation framework that
systematically measures contextual knowledge (CK) and parametric knowledge (PK)
across models and languages. Using our MultiWikiAtomic dataset in English,
Spanish, and Danish, we analyze how large language models (LLMs) integrate
context, prioritize information, and incorporate PK in open-ended question
answering. Our analysis uncovers a phenomenon we call lost-in-the-later, where
LLMs tend to overlook or deprioritize information that appears later in a given
context, revealing a strong positional bias that affects contextual grounding.
We further find that reasoning models, as well as non-reasoning models prompted
with chain-of-thought (CoT), use context even less than non-reasoning models
without CoT and fail to mitigate the lost-in-the-later effect. CoT prompting,
in particular, results in lower recall and shorter responses, leading to
degraded contextual grounding. Based on these insights, we design prompt-based
methods to effectively leverage input context. A case study applying CoPE to
summarization demonstrates that CK-informed prompting improves factual
grounding and reduces hallucination.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT demonstrated the potential to
replicate human language abilities through technology, ranging from text
generation to engaging in conversations. However, it remains controversial to
what extent these systems truly understand language. We examine this issue by
narrowing the question down to the semantics of LLMs at the word and sentence
level. By examining the inner workings of LLMs and their generated
representation of language and by drawing on classical semantic theories by
Frege and Russell, we get a more nuanced picture of the potential semantic
capabilities of LLMs.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a promising paradigm in language modeling,
leveraging additional computational resources at inference time to enhance
model performance. In this work, we introduce R2-LLMs, a novel and versatile
hierarchical retrieval-augmented reasoning framework designed to improve
test-time scaling in large language models (LLMs) without requiring
distillation from more advanced models to obtain chain-of-thought (CoT)
training data. R2-LLMs enhances inference-time generalization by integrating
dual-level retrieval-based in-context learning: (1) At the coarse level, our
approach extracts abstract templates from complex reasoning problems and
retrieves similar problem-answer pairs to facilitate high-level in-context
learning; (2) At the fine level, during Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), R2-LLMs
efficiently retrieves analogous intermediate solution steps from reference
mathematical problem datasets, refining step-wise reasoning with the aid of a
process reward model (PRM) for scoring. R2-LLMs is a robust hierarchical
reasoning-augmentation method that enhances in-context-level reasoning while
seamlessly integrating with step-level tree search methods. Utilizing PRM, it
refines both candidate generation and decision-making for improved reasoning
accuracy. Empirical evaluations on the MATH500, GSM8K, and OlympiadBench-TO
datasets achieve substantial relative improvement with an increase of up to 16%
using LLaMA-3.1-8B compared to the baselines, showcasing the effectiveness of
our approach in complex reasoning tasks.

Result: 实验显示，Re5在少量数据下达到与GPT-4o-mini相当的指令遵循性能，且64.24%优于未修订响应。

Conclusion: Re5是一种高效且资源节约的解决方案，可提升指令遵循性能。

Abstract: Various techniques have been proposed to improve large language models (LLMs)
adherence to formatting and instruction constraints. One of the most effective
approaches involves utilizing high-quality data generated by powerful models.
However, such models often fail to fully comply with complex instructions in a
single generation. To address this limitation, iterative revision methods have
been introduced. Nevertheless, as the number of data points and revision
iterations increases, the associated monetary costs grow significantly. As a
resource-efficient alternative, methods have been proposed that leverage
high-performance evaluation tools to compensate for the limited self-evaluation
capabilities of open-source LLMs. However, these approaches often lead to a
degradation in output quality due to excessive revision. To overcome these
challenges, we propose Re5, a self-evaluation and revision framework designed
to enhance instruction-following performance while preserving the quality of
the generated content. Re5 extracts task and constraint components from user
instructions, performs structural evaluations to prevent error accumulation,
and applies fine-grained constraint-specific content evaluations followed by
selective revisions. This process ensures precise and quality-preserving
improvements. The final high-quality outputs are used for alignment tuning,
enabling long-term alignment improvements through a data-centric iterative
refinement loop. Experimental results demonstrate that Re5 achieves
instruction-following performance comparable to models trained on data
generated by GPT-4o-mini, a high-performance model, even with a small amount of
data while maintaining response quality with a 64.24%-win rate over the
non-revised initial responses. These results validate Re5 as an efficient and
effective solution for enhancing instruction adherence with minimal external
supervision.

Conclusion: 翻转知识蒸馏范式能够有效结合SLM的领域专长和LLM的语义理解能力，提升LLM在特定任务中的表现。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation typically involves transferring knowledge from a Large
Language Model (LLM) to a Smaller Language Model (SLM). However, in tasks such
as text matching, fine-tuned smaller models often yield more effective
domain-specific representations, as they focus on optimizing the similarity of
input pairs. To leverage both the specialized strengths of small models and the
rich semantic understanding of LLMs, we introduce a flipped knowledge
distillation paradigm, where LLM learns from SLM. Specifically, we address the
architectural gap between decoder-only LLMs and smaller encoder-based models by
reinterpreting LLMs in an encoder-decoder manner using LoRA. The encoder
generates compressed representations, while the decoder maps them to the output
space. During training, the encoder produces representations and their
similarities, which are then aligned with the similarity scores produced by the
teacher, using our proposed Margin-aware Contrastive Learning (MCL) approach.
The MCL ensures accurate similarity for both positive and negative pairs, and
adaptively handles the internal differences within positive and negative
samples. Our paradigm requires only a reasonably good-performing SLM, allowing
the LLM to achieve improved performance. Experiments on financial and
healthcare benchmarks, as well as real-world applications, confirm its
effectiveness, and the model has been fully deployed in an online environment.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) extends large language models (LLMs)
with external knowledge but faces key challenges: restricted effective context
length and redundancy in retrieved documents. Pure compression-based approaches
reduce input size but often discard fine-grained details essential for factual
accuracy. We propose SARA, a unified RAG framework that balances local
precision and global knowledge coverage under tight context budgets. SARA
combines natural-language text snippets with semantic compression vectors to
jointly enhance context efficiency and answer correctness. It represents
contexts at two complementary levels: 1) fine-grained natural-language spans
that preserve critical entities and numerical values, and 2) compact,
interpretable vectors that summarize high-level semantics. An iterative
evidence-selection module employs the compression vectors for dynamic reranking
of contexts. Across 9 datasets and 5 open-source LLMs spanning 3 model families
(Mistral, Llama, and Gemma), SARA consistently improves answer relevance
(+17.71), answer correctness (+13.72), and semantic similarity (+15.53),
demonstrating the importance of integrating textual and compressed

Conclusion: HIRAG方法通过分层思维链有效提升了RAG模型的能力，解决了现有挑战。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a fundamental paradigm for
addressing the challenges faced by large language models in handling real-time
information and domain-specific problems. Traditional RAG systems primarily
rely on the in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of the large language model
itself. Still, in-depth research on the specific capabilities needed by the RAG
generation model is lacking, leading to challenges with inconsistent document
quality and retrieval system imperfections. Even the limited studies that
fine-tune RAG generative models often \textit{lack a granular focus on RAG
task} or \textit{a deeper utilization of chain-of-thought processes}. To
address this, we propose that RAG models should possess three progressively
hierarchical abilities (1) Filtering: the ability to select relevant
information; (2) Combination: the ability to combine semantic information
across paragraphs; and (3) RAG-specific reasoning: the ability to further
process external knowledge using internal knowledge. Thus, we introduce our new
RAG instruction fine-tuning method, Hierarchical-Thought Instruction-Tuning
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (HIRAG) incorporates a "think before answering"
strategy. This method enhances the model's open-book examination capability by
utilizing multi-level progressive chain-of-thought. Experiments show that the
HIRAG training strategy significantly improves the model's performance on
datasets such as RGB, PopQA, MuSiQue, HotpotQA, and PubmedQA.

Motivation: LLMs在多轮对话任务中表现不佳，因为其预训练数据主要是连续文本，缺乏对话结构。

Method: 提出了一种将相关文档转化为多轮、多主题对话的流程，并基于维基百科创建了DocTalk数据集。

Result: 使用DocTalk预训练的LLMs在多轮对话能力（如上下文记忆和理解）上提升了40%。

Conclusion: 合成的对话数据可以显著提升LLMs的多轮对话能力，且不影响基础性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in multi-turn
conversational tasks, yet their pre-training data predominantly consists of
continuous prose, creating a potential mismatch between required capabilities
and training paradigms. We introduce a novel approach to address this
discrepancy by synthesizing conversational data from existing text corpora. We
present a pipeline that transforms a cluster of multiple related documents into
an extended multi-turn, multi-topic information-seeking dialogue. Applying our
pipeline to Wikipedia articles, we curate DocTalk, a multi-turn pre-training
dialogue corpus consisting of over 730k long conversations. We hypothesize that
exposure to such synthesized conversational structures during pre-training can
enhance the fundamental multi-turn capabilities of LLMs, such as context memory
and understanding. Empirically, we show that incorporating DocTalk during
pre-training results in up to 40% gain in context memory and understanding,
without compromising base performance. DocTalk is available at

Motivation: 随着心理测量调查在评估LLMs特质中的应用增加，需要一种高效且可扩展的方法生成和验证调查项目，确保其结构效度。传统方法依赖大规模人类数据收集，成本高昂。

Method: 通过模拟具有不同中介因素的虚拟受访者，识别能够稳健测量目标特质的调查项目。实验基于三种心理特质理论（Big5、Schwartz、VIA），验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究为低成本调查开发开辟了新方向，并深化了对LLMs如何模拟人类行为的理解。数据集和代码将公开以支持未来研究。

Abstract: As psychometric surveys are increasingly used to assess the traits of large
language models (LLMs), the need for scalable survey item generation suited for
LLMs has also grown. A critical challenge here is ensuring the construct
validity of generated items, i.e., whether they truly measure the intended
trait. Traditionally, this requires costly, large-scale human data collection.
To make it efficient, we present a framework for virtual respondent simulation
using LLMs. Our central idea is to account for mediators: factors through which
the same trait can give rise to varying responses to a survey item. By
simulating respondents with diverse mediators, we identify survey items that
robustly measure intended traits. Experiments on three psychological trait
theories (Big5, Schwartz, VIA) show that our mediator generation methods and
simulation framework effectively identify high-validity items. LLMs demonstrate
the ability to generate plausible mediators from trait definitions and to
simulate respondent behavior for item validation. Our problem formulation,
metrics, methodology, and dataset open a new direction for cost-effective
survey development and a deeper understanding of how LLMs replicate human-like
behavior. We will publicly release our dataset and code to support future work.

Abstract: We introduce OpenFActScore, an open-source implementation of the FActScore
framework for evaluating the factuality of text generated by large language
models (LLMs). FActScore evaluates the factual accuracy of long-form text by
using Atomic Fact Generation (AFG) to extract individual factual claims and
Atomic Fact Validation (AFV) to verify each claim against a trusted knowledge
source. While the original FActScore relies on closed-source and commercial
models such as InstructGPT and ChatGPT, OpenFActScore enables the use of any
Hugging Face-compatible model for both AFG and AFV. We provide a detailed
technical overview of our implementation, highlighting design choices and
modifications made to support open models. We evaluate multiple open-source
LLMs on both AFG and AFV using the original FActScore benchmark, reporting
BERTScore-F1 for AFG and Error Rate relative to human annotations for AFV. Our
results show that open models can approximate the performance of closed-source
systems, with Gemma achieving the best overall performance, and our final setup
obtains a 0.99 Pearson correlation with the original FActScore experiments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and their safety classifiers often perform
poorly on low-resource languages due to limited training data and evaluation
benchmarks. This paper introduces RabakBench, a new multilingual safety
benchmark localized to Singapore's unique linguistic context, covering
Singlish, Chinese, Malay, and Tamil. RabakBench is constructed through a
scalable three-stage pipeline: (i) Generate - adversarial example generation by
augmenting real Singlish web content with LLM-driven red teaming; (ii) Label -
semi-automated multi-label safety annotation using majority-voted LLM labelers
aligned with human judgments; and (iii) Translate - high-fidelity translation
preserving linguistic nuance and toxicity across languages. The final dataset
comprises over 5,000 safety-labeled examples across four languages and six
fine-grained safety categories with severity levels. Evaluations of 11 popular
open-source and closed-source guardrail classifiers reveal significant
performance degradation. RabakBench not only enables robust safety evaluation
in Southeast Asian multilingual settings but also offers a reproducible
framework for building localized safety datasets in low-resource environments.
The benchmark dataset, including the human-verified translations, and

Conclusion: 自进化方法在性能和可持续性上优于传统方法。

Abstract: A common training approach for language models involves using a large-scale
language model to expand a human-provided dataset, which is subsequently used
for model training.This method significantly reduces training costs by
eliminating the need for extensive human data annotation. However, it still
faces challenges such as high carbon emissions during data augmentation and the
risk of data leakage when we use closed-source LLMs. To address these issues,
we propose a self-evolution method for language models. First, we introduce the
Multi-level Principle Generation, which enables a large-scale model to
summarize task-completion principles based on a small amount of task data.
Then, we propose the Principle-based Instance Generation, in which a
smaller-scale language model uses these task principles to generate a large
amount of data. This data is then used for model training. Experimental results
show that our proposed method significantly improves model performance compared
to directly using a smaller-scale language model to generate data.
Additionally, since we only use the large-scale language model to generate the
task-completion principles, the carbon emissions associated with training the
model are greatly reduced.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to memorize portions of their training
data, sometimes reproducing content verbatim when prompted appropriately. In
this work, we investigate a fundamental yet under-explored question in the
domain of memorization: How to characterize memorization difficulty of training
data in LLMs? Through empirical experiments on OLMo, a family of open models,
we present the Entropy-Memorization Law. It suggests that data entropy is
linearly correlated with memorization score. Moreover, in a case study of
memorizing highly randomized strings, or "gibberish", we observe that such
sequences, despite their apparent randomness, exhibit unexpectedly low
empirical entropy compared to the broader training corpus. Adopting the same
strategy to discover Entropy-Memorization Law, we derive a simple yet effective
approach to distinguish training and testing data, enabling Dataset Inference

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in code
generation, yet their true programming competence remains underexplored. We
introduce the Code Triangle framework, which systematically evaluates LLMs
across three fundamental dimensions: editorial analysis, code implementation,
and test case generation. Through extensive experiments on competitive
programming benchmarks, we reveal that while LLMs can form a self-consistent
system across these dimensions, their solutions often lack the diversity and
robustness of human programmers. We identify a significant distribution shift
between model cognition and human expertise, with model errors tending to
cluster due to training data biases and limited reasoning transfer. Our study
demonstrates that incorporating human-generated editorials, solutions, and
diverse test cases, as well as leveraging model mixtures, can substantially
enhance both the performance and robustness of LLMs. Furthermore, we reveal
both the consistency and inconsistency in the cognition of LLMs that may
facilitate self-reflection and self-improvement, providing a potential
direction for developing more powerful coding models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities, especially when guided by explicit chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning that verbalizes intermediate steps. While CoT improves both
interpretability and accuracy, its dependence on natural language reasoning
limits the model's expressive bandwidth. Latent reasoning tackles this
bottleneck by performing multi-step inference entirely in the model's
continuous hidden state, eliminating token-level supervision. To advance latent
reasoning research, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of the
emerging field of latent reasoning. We begin by examining the foundational role
of neural network layers as the computational substrate for reasoning,
highlighting how hierarchical representations support complex transformations.
Next, we explore diverse latent reasoning methodologies, including
activation-based recurrence, hidden state propagation, and fine-tuning
strategies that compress or internalize explicit reasoning traces. Finally, we
discuss advanced paradigms such as infinite-depth latent reasoning via masked
diffusion models, which enable globally consistent and reversible reasoning
processes. By unifying these perspectives, we aim to clarify the conceptual
landscape of latent reasoning and chart future directions for research at the
frontier of LLM cognition. An associated GitHub repository collecting the

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been applied to reranking tasks in
information retrieval, achieving strong performance. However, their high
computational demands often hinder practical deployment. Existing studies
evaluate the efficiency of LLM-based rerankers using proxy metrics such as
latency, the number of forward passes, input tokens, and output tokens.
However, these metrics depend on hardware and running-time choices (\eg
parallel or not, batch size, etc), and often fail to account for model size,
making it difficult to interpret and obscuring the evaluation of the
efficiency-effectiveness tradeoff. To address this issue, we propose
E\textsuperscript{2}R-FLOPs, for LLM-based rerankers: ranking metrics per
PetaFLOP (RPP) for relevance per compute and queries per PetaFLOP (QPP) for
hardware-agnostic throughput. Companied with the new metrics, an interpretable
FLOPs estimator is built to estimate the FLOPs of an LLM-based reranker even
without running any experiments. Based on the proposed metrics, we conduct
comprehensive experiments to evaluate a wide range of LLM-based rerankers with
different architecture, studying the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off and
bringing this issue to the attention of the research community.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate increasingly sophisticated code
processing capabilities, evaluating their performance on engineering-level code
remains challenging. Existing repository-level benchmarks primarily focus on
single scenarios, such as code generation or bug fixing, without adequately
capturing the diversity and complexity of real-world software or project
engineering workflows. Furthermore, these benchmarks suffer from limited
controllability in question positioning and reliability issues in their
generated test cases. To address these limitations, we present CorePipe, a
fully automated pipeline that converts repositories into comprehensive test
cases, and introduce CoreCodeBench, a configurable multi-scenario
repository-level benchmark. To simulate real engineering scenarios, CorePipe
generates three types of atomic questions (Development, BugFix, and Test-Driven
Development) specifically targeting core code segments. These atomic questions
are further combined into three types of composite questions, with difficulty
levels flexibly adjusted through hyperparameter tuning. CoreCodeBench provides
a comprehensive and extensive repository-level benchmark to investigate the
applicability of LLMs in real-world engineering projects. Experiments with 16
LLMs across diverse scenarios reveal varying capabilities and offer

Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
automated discharge summary generation, they still suffer from hallucination
issues, such as generating inaccurate content or fabricating information
without valid sources. In addition, electronic medical records (EMRs) typically
consist of long-form data, making it challenging for LLMs to attribute the
generated content to the sources. To address these challenges, we propose LCDS,
a Logic-Controlled Discharge Summary generation system. LCDS constructs a
source mapping table by calculating textual similarity between EMRs and
discharge summaries to constrain the scope of summarized content. Moreover,
LCDS incorporates a comprehensive set of logical rules, enabling it to generate
more reliable silver discharge summaries tailored to different clinical fields.
Furthermore, LCDS supports source attribution for generated content, allowing
experts to efficiently review, provide feedback, and rectify errors. The
resulting golden discharge summaries are subsequently recorded for incremental
fine-tuning of LLMs. Our project and demo video are in the GitHub repository

Conclusion: 需要开发能更好理解和执行用户隐私偏好的模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are primarily accessed via commercial APIs, but
this often requires users to expose their data to service providers. In this
paper, we explore how users can stay in control of their data by using privacy
profiles: simple natural language instructions that say what should and should
not be revealed. We build a framework where a local model uses these
instructions to rewrite queries, only hiding details deemed sensitive by the
user, before sending them to an external model, thus balancing privacy with
performance. To support this research, we introduce PEEP, a multilingual
dataset of real user queries annotated to mark private content and paired with
synthetic privacy profiles. Our experiments with lightweight LLMs show they can
follow these instructions to some extent, but also face consistent challenges,
highlighting the need for models that better understand and comply with
user-defined privacy preferences.

Abstract: We introduce Skywork-R1V3, an advanced, open-source vision-language model

in effectively transferring reasoning skills from text-only Large Language

activates and enhances the model's reasoning ability, without the need for
additional continue pre-training. Through this framework, we further uncover
the fundamental role of the connector module in achieving robust cross-modal
alignment for multimodal reasoning models. In addition, we introduce a unique
indicator of reasoning capability, the entropy of critical reasoning tokens,
which has proven highly effective for checkpoint selection during RL training.
Skywork-R1V3 achieves state-of-the-art results on MMMU, significantly improving
from 64.3% to 76.0%. This performance matches entry-level human capabilities.
Remarkably, our RL-powered post-training approach enables even the 38B
parameter model to rival top closed-source VLMs. The implementation
successfully transfers mathematical reasoning to other subject-related
reasoning tasks. We also include an analysis of curriculum learning and
reinforcement finetuning strategies, along with a broader discussion on
multimodal reasoning. Skywork-R1V3 represents a significant leap in multimodal
reasoning, showcasing RL as a powerful engine for advancing open-source VLM
capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言代理在跨领域任务中无法共享和学习彼此经验的局限性。

Method: 提出Agent KB框架，通过捕获高层策略和详细执行日志，构建共享知识库，实现跨代理知识迁移。

Result: 在GAIA基准测试中，成功率提升高达16.28个百分点；Claude-3和GPT-4在特定任务中表现显著提升。

Conclusion: Agent KB为代理提供了模块化、框架无关的基础设施，支持从历史经验中学习并推广成功策略。

Abstract: As language agents tackle increasingly complex tasks, they struggle with
effective error correction and experience reuse across domains. We introduce
Agent KB, a hierarchical experience framework that enables complex agentic
problem solving via a novel Reason-Retrieve-Refine pipeline. Agent KB addresses
a core limitation: agents traditionally cannot learn from each other's
experiences. By capturing both high-level strategies and detailed execution
logs, Agent KB creates a shared knowledge base that enables cross-agent
knowledge transfer. Evaluated on the GAIA benchmark, Agent KB improves success
rates by up to 16.28 percentage points. On the most challenging tasks, Claude-3
improves from 38.46% to 57.69%, while GPT-4 improves from 53.49% to 73.26% on
intermediate tasks. On SWE-bench code repair, Agent KB enables Claude-3 to
improve from 41.33% to 53.33%. Our results suggest that Agent KB provides a
modular, framework-agnostic infrastructure for enabling agents to learn from
past experiences and generalize successful strategies to new tasks.

Method: 采用共享路由器策略，使不同MoE层的路由器共享选择逻辑，增强专家协作。

Result: 在大规模伪标记数据集和10个多样化ASR基准测试中，Omni-router Transformer表现优于密集和Switch Transformer模型，词错误率分别降低11.2%和8.2%。

Conclusion: 共享路由器策略提高了专家协作和模型性能，同时增强了数据多样性的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures have expanded from language modeling
to automatic speech recognition (ASR). Traditional MoE methods, such as the
Switch Transformer, route experts independently within each layer. Our analysis
reveals that routers in most layers make expert choices that are not strongly
correlated with the choices of the routers in other layers. To increase the
cooperation between experts in different layers and encourage greater
specialization, we use a shared router across different MoE layers. We call
this model \emph{Omni-router Transformer}. Extensive experiments on a
large-scale pseudo-labeled dataset and evaluations across 10 diverse,
out-of-domain ASR benchmarks demonstrate that the Omni-router Transformer is
able to achieve lower training loss and consistently outperform dense and
Switch Transformer models, reducing average word error rates by 11.2% and 8.2%,
respectively, while providing structured expert usage and improved robustness

Abstract: Model editing has been gaining increasing attention over the past few years.
For Knowledge Editing in particular, more challenging evaluation datasets have
recently been released. These datasets use different methodologies to score the
success of editors. Yet, it remains under-explored how robust these
methodologies are and whether they unfairly favor some editors. Moreover, the
disruptive impact of these editors on overall model capabilities remains a
constant blind spot.
  We address both of these problems and show that choosing different metrics
and evaluation methodologies as well as different edit batch sizes can lead to
a different ranking of knowledge editors. Crucially we demonstrate this effect
also on general language understanding tasks evaluated alongside the knowledge
editing tasks. Further we include a manual assessment of the string matching
based evaluation method for knowledge editing that is favored by recently
released datasets, revealing a tendency to produce false positive matches.

Conclusion: 文档级实体和关系提取对最先进的大语言模型仍具挑战性。

Abstract: Large, high-quality annotated corpora remain scarce in document-level entity

present a fully automatic, LLM-based pipeline for synthetic data generation and
in-context learning for document-level entity and relation extraction. In
contrast to existing approaches that rely on manually annotated demonstrations
or direct zero-shot inference, our method combines synthetic data generation
with retrieval-based in-context learning, using a reasoning-optimized language
model. This allows us to build a high-quality demonstration database without
manual annotation and to dynamically retrieve relevant examples at inference
time. Based on our approach we produce a synthetic dataset of over $5k$
Wikipedia abstracts with approximately $59k$ entities and $30k$ relation
triples. Finally, we evaluate in-context learning performance on the DocIE
shared task, extracting entities and relations from long documents in a
zero-shot setting. We find that in-context joint entity and relation extraction
at document-level remains a challenging task, even for state-of-the-art large

Conclusion: ContextASR-Bench为评估上下文语音识别提供了全面工具，展示了LALMs的潜力。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has been extensively investigated, yet
prior evaluative efforts have largely been restricted to contextless paradigms.
This constraint stems from the limited proficiency of conventional ASR models
in context modeling and their deficiency in memory and reasoning based on world
knowledge. Recent breakthroughs in the development of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and corresponding Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) have markedly
enhanced the visibility of general artificial intelligence capabilities.
Consequently, there exists a compelling need for a benchmark that can evaluate
both the generality and intelligence of ASR systems. To address this gap, we
propose ContextASR-Bench: a comprehensive, large-scale benchmark designed to
assess contextual speech recognition. This benchmark encompasses up to 40,000
data entries across over 10 domains, enabling a thorough evaluation of model
performance in scenarios that omit or incorporate coarse-grained or
fine-grained contextual information. Moreover, diverging from conventional ASR
evaluations, our benchmark includes an analysis of model efficacy in
recognizing named entities mentioned within the auditory input. Our extensive
evaluation highlights that LALMs, with strong world knowledge and context
learning capabilities, outperform conventional ASR models by a large margin.

Abstract: Automatic toxic language detection is critical for creating safe, inclusive
online spaces. However, it is a highly subjective task, with perceptions of
toxic language shaped by community norms and lived experience. Existing
toxicity detection models are typically trained on annotations that collapse
diverse annotator perspectives into a single ground truth, erasing important
context-specific notions of toxicity such as reclaimed language. To address
this, we introduce MODELCITIZENS, a dataset of 6.8K social media posts and 40K
toxicity annotations across diverse identity groups. To capture the role of
conversational context on toxicity, typical of social media posts, we augment
MODELCITIZENS posts with LLM-generated conversational scenarios.
State-of-the-art toxicity detection tools (e.g. OpenAI Moderation API,
GPT-o4-mini) underperform on MODELCITIZENS, with further degradation on
context-augmented posts. Finally, we release LLAMACITIZEN-8B and
GEMMACITIZEN-12B, LLaMA- and Gemma-based models finetuned on MODELCITIZENS,
which outperform GPT-o4-mini by 5.5% on in-distribution evaluations. Our

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o and o1 have demonstrated strong
performance on clinical natural language processing (NLP) tasks across multiple
medical benchmarks. Nonetheless, two high-impact NLP tasks - structured tabular
reporting from nurse dictations and medical order extraction from
doctor-patient consultations - remain underexplored due to data scarcity and
sensitivity, despite active industry efforts. Practical solutions to these
real-world clinical tasks can significantly reduce the documentation burden on
healthcare providers, allowing greater focus on patient care. In this paper, we
investigate these two challenging tasks using private and open-source clinical
datasets, evaluating the performance of both open- and closed-weight LLMs, and
analyzing their respective strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we propose
an agentic pipeline for generating realistic, non-sensitive nurse dictations,
enabling structured extraction of clinical observations. To support further
research in both areas, we release SYNUR and SIMORD, the first open-source
datasets for nurse observation extraction and medical order extraction.

Abstract: Translating natural language mathematical statements into formal, executable
code is a fundamental challenge in automated theorem proving. While prior work
has focused on generation and compilation success, little attention has been
paid to the critic phase-the evaluation of whether generated formalizations
truly capture the semantic intent of the original problem. In this paper, we
introduce CriticLean, a novel critic-guided reinforcement learning framework
that elevates the role of the critic from a passive validator to an active
learning component. Specifically, first, we propose the CriticLeanGPT, trained
via supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, to rigorously assess the
semantic fidelity of Lean 4 formalizations. Then, we introduce CriticLeanBench,
a benchmark designed to measure models' ability to distinguish semantically
correct from incorrect formalizations, and demonstrate that our trained
CriticLeanGPT models can significantly outperform strong open- and
closed-source baselines. Building on the CriticLean framework, we construct
FineLeanCorpus, a dataset comprising over 285K problems that exhibits rich
domain diversity, broad difficulty coverage, and high correctness based on
human evaluation. Overall, our findings highlight that optimizing the critic
phase is essential for producing reliable formalizations, and we hope our
CriticLean will provide valuable insights for future advances in formal
mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: One of the main objectives in developing large vision-language models (LVLMs)
is to engineer systems that can assist humans with multimodal tasks, including
interpreting descriptions of perceptual experiences. A central phenomenon in
this context is amodal completion, in which people perceive objects even when
parts of those objects are hidden. Although numerous studies have assessed
whether computer-vision algorithms can detect or reconstruct occluded regions,
the inferential abilities of LVLMs on texts related to amodal completion remain
unexplored. To address this gap, we constructed a benchmark grounded in Basic
Formal Ontology to achieve a systematic classification of amodal completion.
Our results indicate that while many LVLMs achieve human-comparable performance
overall, their accuracy diverges for certain types of objects being completed.
Notably, in certain categories, some LLaVA-NeXT variants and Claude 3.5 Sonnet
exhibit lower accuracy on original images compared to blank stimuli lacking
visual content. Intriguingly, this disparity emerges only under Japanese
prompting, suggesting a deficiency in Japanese-specific linguistic competence
among these models.

Motivation: 社交媒体中隐性性别歧视的传播广泛且难以检测，传统方法效果不佳，因此提出ASCEND框架以改进检测能力。

Method: 采用阈值对比学习，结合余弦相似度和可学习阈值优化嵌入空间，同时融合文本、情感、情绪和毒性特征，联合优化对比损失和交叉熵损失。

Result: 在EXIST2021和MLSC数据集上，ASCEND平均Macro F1分别提升9.86%、29.63%和32.51%，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ASCEND通过对比学习和多特征融合有效捕捉隐性性别歧视的细微线索，为社交媒体内容检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: The global reach of social media has amplified the spread of hateful content,
including implicit sexism, which is often overlooked by conventional detection
methods. In this work, we introduce an Adaptive Supervised Contrastive lEarning
framework for implicit sexism detectioN (ASCEND). A key innovation of our
method is the incorporation of threshold-based contrastive learning: by
computing cosine similarities between embeddings, we selectively treat only
those sample pairs as positive if their similarity exceeds a learnable
threshold. This mechanism refines the embedding space by robustly pulling
together representations of semantically similar texts while pushing apart
dissimilar ones, thus reducing false positives and negatives. The final
classification is achieved by jointly optimizing a contrastive loss with a
cross-entropy loss. Textual features are enhanced through a word-level
attention module. Additionally, we employ sentiment, emotion, and toxicity
features. Evaluations on the EXIST2021 and MLSC datasets demonstrate that
ASCEND significantly outperforms existing methods, with average Macro F1
improvements of 9.86%, 29.63%, and 32.51% across multiple tasks, highlighting
its efficacy in capturing the subtle cues of implicit sexist language.

Conclusion: PhoniTale在助记符生成方面表现良好，但仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Vocabulary acquisition poses a significant challenge for second-language (L2)
learners, especially when learning typologically distant languages such as
English and Korean, where phonological and structural mismatches complicate
vocabulary learning. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to
generate keyword mnemonics by leveraging similar keywords from a learner's
first language (L1) to aid in acquiring L2 vocabulary. However, most of this
research has focused on native English speakers learning other languages,
rather than the reverse. In this paper, we present PhoniTale, a novel
cross-lingual mnemonic generation system that retrieves L1 keyword sequence
based on phonological similarity and uses LLMs to generate mnemonics. We
evaluate PhoniTale using both automated metrics and human evaluations,
comparing its output to mnemonics created by humans and by previous automated
approaches. To assess practical effectiveness, we also conduct a short-term
recall test measuring mnemonic helpfulness. Our findings show that PhoniTale
performs comparably to human-authored mnemonics. We also highlight key areas
for future improvement in mnemonic quality and methodology.

Result: 平均错误率不足以全面衡量系统表现，需结合其他度量方法。

Conclusion: 建议报告ASR性能与偏见时采用更全面的度量方法，以更好反映系统对多样说话者群体的表现及整体偏见。

Abstract: There is increasingly more evidence that automatic speech recognition (ASR)
systems are biased against different speakers and speaker groups, e.g., due to
gender, age, or accent. Research on bias in ASR has so far primarily focused on
detecting and quantifying bias, and developing mitigation approaches. Despite
this progress, the open question is how to measure the performance and bias of
a system. In this study, we compare different performance and bias measures,
from literature and proposed, to evaluate state-of-the-art end-to-end ASR
systems for Dutch. Our experiments use several bias mitigation strategies to
address bias against different speaker groups. The findings reveal that
averaged error rates, a standard in ASR research, alone is not sufficient and
should be supplemented by other measures. The paper ends with recommendations
for reporting ASR performance and bias to better represent a system's
performance for diverse speaker groups, and overall system bias.

Result: DAEDCMD在实验中显著优于六种MMD基线和三种持续学习方法。

Conclusion: DAEDCMD有效解决了持续多模态虚假信息检测中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Nowadays, misinformation articles, especially multimodal ones, are widely
spread on social media platforms and cause serious negative effects. To control
their propagation, Multimodal Misinformation Detection (MMD) becomes an active
topic in the community to automatically identify misinformation. Previous MMD
methods focus on supervising detectors by collecting offline data. However, in
real-world scenarios, new events always continually emerge, making MMD models
trained on offline data consistently outdated and ineffective. To address this
issue, training MMD models under online data streams is an alternative,
inducing an emerging task named continual MMD. Unfortunately, it is hindered by
two major challenges. First, training on new data consistently decreases the
detection performance on past data, named past knowledge forgetting. Second,
the social environment constantly evolves over time, affecting the
generalization on future data. To alleviate these challenges, we propose to
remember past knowledge by isolating interference between event-specific
parameters with a Dirichlet process-based mixture-of-expert structure, and
anticipate future environmental distributions by learning a continuous-time
dynamics model. Accordingly, we induce a new continual MMD method DAEDCMD.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAEDCMD can consistently and
significantly outperform the compared methods, including six MMD baselines and
three continual learning methods.

Conclusion: 非深度学习方法在效率和性能上更优，但深度学习方法在未知查询上表现更好。上下文对性能提升至关重要。

Abstract: Ghosting, the ability to predict a user's intended text input for inline
query auto-completion, is an invaluable feature for modern search engines and
chat interfaces, greatly enhancing user experience. By suggesting completions
to incomplete queries (or prefixes), ghosting aids users with slow typing
speeds, disabilities, or limited language proficiency. Ghosting is a
challenging problem and has become more important with the ubiquitousness of
chat-based systems like ChatGPT, Copilot, etc. Despite the increasing
prominence of chat-based systems utilizing ghosting, this challenging problem
of Chat-Ghosting has received little attention from the NLP/ML research
community. There is a lack of standardized benchmarks and relative performance
analysis of deep learning and non-deep learning methods. We address this
through an open and thorough study of this problem using four publicly
available dialog datasets: two human-human (DailyDialog and DSTC7-Ubuntu) and
two human-bot (Open Assistant and ShareGPT). We experiment with various
existing query auto-completion methods (using tries), n-gram methods and deep
learning methods, with and without dialog context. We also propose a novel
entropy-based dynamic early stopping strategy. Our analysis finds that
statistical n-gram models and tries outperform deep learning based models in
terms of both model performance and inference efficiency for seen prefixes. For
unseen queries, neural models like T5 and Phi-2 lead to better results. Adding
conversational context leads to significant improvements in ghosting quality,
especially for Open-Assistant and ShareGPT. We make code and data publicly
available

Abstract: Text-to-image generation advancements have been predominantly
English-centric, creating barriers for non-English speakers and perpetuating
digital inequities. While existing systems rely on translation pipelines, these
introduce semantic drift, computational overhead, and cultural misalignment. We
introduce NeoBabel, a novel multilingual image generation framework that sets a
new Pareto frontier in performance, efficiency and inclusivity, supporting six
languages: English, Chinese, Dutch, French, Hindi, and Persian. The model is
trained using a combination of large-scale multilingual pretraining and
high-resolution instruction tuning. To evaluate its capabilities, we expand two
English-only benchmarks to multilingual equivalents: m-GenEval and m-DPG.
NeoBabel achieves state-of-the-art multilingual performance while retaining
strong English capability, scoring 0.75 on m-GenEval and 0.68 on m-DPG.
Notably, it performs on par with leading models on English tasks while
outperforming them by +0.11 and +0.09 on multilingual benchmarks, even though
these models are built on multilingual base LLMs. This demonstrates the
effectiveness of our targeted alignment training for preserving and extending
crosslingual generalization. We further introduce two new metrics to rigorously
assess multilingual alignment and robustness to code-mixed prompts. Notably,
NeoBabel matches or exceeds English-only models while being 2-4x smaller. We
release an open toolkit, including all code, model checkpoints, a curated
dataset of 124M multilingual text-image pairs, and standardized multilingual
evaluation protocols, to advance inclusive AI research. Our work demonstrates
that multilingual capability is not a trade-off but a catalyst for improved
robustness, efficiency, and cultural fidelity in generative AI.

Abstract: AI-powered search systems are emerging as new information gatekeepers,

providers: OpenAI, Perplexity, and Google. Among the over 366,000 citations
embedded in these responses, 9% reference news sources. We find that while
models from different providers cite distinct news sources, they exhibit shared
patterns in citation behavior. News citations concentrate heavily among a small
number of outlets and display a pronounced liberal bias, though low-credibility
sources are rarely cited. User preference analysis reveals that neither the
political leaning nor the quality of cited news sources significantly
influences user satisfaction. These findings reveal significant challenges in
current AI search systems and have important implications for their design and

Abstract: Student dropout in distance learning remains a critical challenge, with
profound societal and economic consequences. While classical machine learning
models leverage structured socio-demographic and behavioral data, they often
fail to capture the nuanced emotional and contextual factors embedded in
unstructured student interactions. This paper introduces a transformative AI
framework that redefines dropout prediction through three synergistic
innovations: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for domain-specific sentiment
analysis, prompt engineering to decode academic stressors, and cross-modal
attention fusion to dynamically align textual, behavioral, and
socio-demographic insights. By grounding sentiment analysis in a curated
knowledge base of pedagogical content, our RAG-enhanced BERT model interprets
student comments with unprecedented contextual relevance, while optimized
prompts isolate indicators of academic distress (e.g., "isolation," "workload
anxiety"). A cross-modal attention layer then fuses these insights with
temporal engagement patterns, creating holistic risk profiles. Evaluated on a
longitudinal dataset of 4 423 students, the framework achieves 89% accuracy and
an F1-score of 0.88, outperforming conventional models by 7% and reducing false
negatives by 21%. Beyond prediction, the system generates interpretable
interventions by retrieving contextually aligned strategies (e.g., mentorship
programs for isolated learners). This work bridges the gap between predictive
analytics and actionable pedagogy, offering a scalable solution to mitigate
dropout risks in global education systems

Result: 右到左标记化和长上下文窗口未显著提升性能，证据质量是主要瓶颈。最佳系统在CheckThat! 2025任务3中排名前四，F1得分为0.57。

Conclusion: 证据质量是数值声明事实核查的关键限制因素，未来研究需聚焦于此。

Abstract: Numerical claims, statements involving quantities, comparisons, and temporal
references, pose unique challenges for automated fact-checking systems. In this
study, we evaluate modeling strategies for veracity prediction of such claims
using the QuanTemp dataset and building our own evidence retrieval pipeline. We
investigate three key factors: (1) the impact of more evidences with longer
input context windows using ModernBERT, (2) the effect of right-to-left (R2L)
tokenization, and (3) their combined influence on classification performance.
Contrary to prior findings in arithmetic reasoning tasks, R2L tokenization does
not boost natural language inference (NLI) of numerical tasks. A longer context
window does also not enhance veracity performance either, highlighting evidence
quality as the dominant bottleneck. Our best-performing system achieves
competitive macro-average F1 score of 0.57 and places us among the Top-4
submissions in Task 3 of CheckThat! 2025. Our code is available at

Motivation: 观察到高质量嵌入在嵌入空间中占据几何稳定的区域并表现出一致的邻域结构。

Method: 结合量化鲁棒性和邻域密度指标，预测检索性能。

Result: 在4个标准检索数据集上，Recall@10比基线提高了9.4±1.2%。

Conclusion: 框架计算开销低（少于检索时间的5%），支持自适应检索策略，并为训练数据增强提供见解。

Abstract: Vector retrieval systems exhibit significant performance variance across
queries due to heterogeneous embedding quality. We propose a lightweight
framework for predicting retrieval performance at the query level by combining
quantization robustness and neighborhood density metrics. Our approach is
motivated by the observation that high-quality embeddings occupy geometrically
stable regions in the embedding space and exhibit consistent neighborhood
structures. We evaluate our method on 4 standard retrieval datasets, showing
consistent improvements of 9.4$\pm$1.2\% in Recall@10 over competitive
baselines. The framework requires minimal computational overhead (less than 5\%
of retrieval time) and enables adaptive retrieval strategies. Our analysis
reveals systematic patterns in embedding quality across different query types,
providing insights for targeted training data augmentation.

Abstract: We introduce EduCoder, a domain-specialized tool designed to support
utterance-level annotation of educational dialogue. While general-purpose text
annotation tools for NLP and qualitative research abound, few address the
complexities of coding education dialogue transcripts -- with diverse
teacher-student and peer interactions. Common challenges include defining
codebooks for complex pedagogical features, supporting both open-ended and
categorical coding, and contextualizing utterances with external features, such
as the lesson's purpose and the pedagogical value of the instruction. EduCoder
is designed to address these challenges by providing a platform for researchers
and domain experts to collaboratively define complex codebooks based on
observed data. It incorporates both categorical and open-ended annotation types
along with contextual materials. Additionally, it offers a side-by-side
comparison of multiple annotators' responses, allowing comparison and
calibration of annotations with others to improve data reliability. The system
is open-source, with a demo video available.

Abstract: The U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health
Organization marked a turning point in the national debate over reproductive
rights. While the ideological divide over abortion is well documented, less is
known about how gender and local sociopolitical contexts interact to shape
public discourse. Drawing on nearly 10 million abortion-related posts on X
(formerly Twitter) from users with inferred gender, ideology and location, we
show that gender significantly moderates abortion attitudes and emotional
expression, particularly in conservative regions, and independently of
ideology. This creates a gender gap in abortion attitudes that grows more
pronounced in conservative regions. The leak of the Dobbs draft opinion further
intensified online engagement, disproportionately mobilizing pro-abortion women
in areas where access was under threat. These findings reveal that abortion
discourse is not only ideologically polarized but also deeply structured by
gender and place, highlighting the central role of identity in shaping
political expression during moments of institutional disruption.

Motivation: 解决多模态模型处理高分辨率图像时视觉标记过多且无关的问题，通过强化学习自动聚焦关键区域。

Method: 使用多轮对话框架和强化学习，通过裁剪子图像和二进制奖励函数优化模型定位能力。

Result: 在无标注数据上训练后，MGPO在多个基准测试中表现优于基线方法，甚至超越了一些先进模型。

Conclusion: MGPO展示了强化学习在多模态模型定位任务中的潜力，尤其在无标注数据场景下表现优异。

Abstract: State-of-the-art large multi-modal models (LMMs) face challenges when
processing high-resolution images, as these inputs are converted into enormous
visual tokens, many of which are irrelevant to the downstream task. In this
paper, we propose Multi-turn Grounding-based Policy Optimization (MGPO), an
end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables LMMs to
iteratively focus on key visual regions by automatically cropping sub-images,
based on model-predicted grounding coordinates within a multi-turn conversation
framework. Compared to supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which requires costly
additional grounding annotations, our approach highlights that LMMs can emerge
robust grounding abilities during the RL training process, leveraging only a
binary reward function derived from the correctness of the final answer.
Additionally, we observe that LMMs struggle to autonomously trigger visual
grounding during the rollout process. To address this cold start problem, we
design a multi-turn conversational template and restrict policy loss
computation to model outputs generated across multiple dialogue rounds, thereby
promoting stable optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, when
trained on standard visual-question-short answering data without grounding
annotations, MGPO effectively elicits stronger grounding capabilities compared
to GRPO, leading to 5.4\% improvement on in-distribution MME-Realworld and
5.2\% improvement on the challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) V* Bench.
Notably, MGPO post-training on Qwen2.5-VL-7B with 21K samples surpasses
OpenAI's o1 and GPT-4o models on the OOD V* Bench. Codes are available at

Motivation: 现有基于提示和适配器的方法在微调VLM时难以保持对新类别的泛化能力，主要原因是未能区分特征的重要性。

Method: DRA通过动态分配特征秩和通道响应机制，优先保留和调整重要特征，同时引入L1正则化稳定训练。

Result: 实验表明DRA在多个基准测试中显著提升了新类别的性能，包括基-新类别、跨数据集评估和领域泛化。

Conclusion: DRA通过动态特征重要性分配有效提升了VLM的泛化能力，尤其在处理新类别时表现优越。

Abstract: Pre-trained large vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP demonstrate
impressive generalization ability. Existing prompt-based and adapter-based
works have made significant progress in fine-tuning VLMs but still face the
challenges of maintaining strong generalization abilities, particularly towards
unseen new classes. This limitation partly arises from these methods treating
all tokens of the image and text encoder equally, which can lead to overfitting
on less informative features (e.g., background noise, template words) and
degrade the general representations that are crucial for novel concept
recognition. To address this issue, we propose Dynamic Rank Adaptation (DRA), a
novel adapter variant method, designed specifically to enhance new class
generalization. DRA dynamically allocates adaptation ranks based on the
importance of features during training to preserve general knowledge. DRA first
employs token importance grouping, using sequence attention to evaluate and
group tokens by their importance. Then, we adopt rank adaptation according to
the importance of each token group dynamically by assigning higher feature
ranks to the more important tokens. Also, we design a new channel response
mechanism to prioritize the preservation and adaptation of feature channels
identified as the most informative for each instance. In addition, a L1
regularization term is introduced to stabilize the training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed DRA
over existing works, especially on enhancing the performance of new classes on
various benchmarks, including base-new classes, cross-datasets evaluation and
domain generalization. The source code will be published after the paper is
received.

Abstract: Current video understanding models excel at recognizing "what" is happening

To bridge this cognitive gap, we propose a novel framework that synergistically
fuses a powerful Vision Foundation Model (VFM) for deep visual perception with
a Large Language Model (LLM) serving as a knowledge-driven reasoning core. Our
key technical innovation is a sophisticated fusion module, inspired by the
Q-Former architecture, which distills complex spatiotemporal and object-centric
visual features into a concise, language-aligned representation. This enables
the LLM to effectively ground its inferential processes in direct visual
evidence. The model is trained via a two-stage strategy, beginning with
large-scale alignment pre-training on video-text data, followed by targeted
instruction fine-tuning on a curated dataset designed to elicit advanced
reasoning and prediction skills. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging benchmarks.
Notably, it exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization to unseen reasoning
tasks, and our in-depth ablation studies validate the critical contribution of
each architectural component. This work pushes the boundary of machine
perception from simple recognition towards genuine cognitive understanding,
paving the way for more intelligent and capable AI systems in robotics,

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have demonstrated remarkable
generalization in zero- and few-shot settings, but adapting them efficiently to
decentralized, heterogeneous data remains a challenge. While prompt tuning has
emerged as a popular parameter-efficient approach in personalized federated
learning, existing methods often sacrifice generalization in favor of
personalization, struggling particularly on unseen classes or domains. In this
work, we propose pFedMMA, the first personalized federated learning framework
that leverages multi-modal adapters for vision-language tasks. Each adapter
contains modality-specific up- and down-projection layers alongside a globally
shared projection that aligns cross-modal features. Our asymmetric optimization
strategy allows clients to locally adapt to personalized data distributions
while collaboratively training the shared projection to improve global
generalization. This design is also communication-efficient, as only the shared
component is exchanged during rounds. Through extensive experiments across
eleven datasets, including domain- and label-shift scenarios, we show that
pFedMMA achieves state-of-the-art trade-offs between personalization and
generalization, outperforming recent federated prompt tuning methods. The code

Abstract: The ability to segment objects based on open-ended language prompts remains a

OpenWorldSAM, a framework that extends the prompt-driven Segment Anything Model
v2 (SAM2) to open-vocabulary scenarios by integrating multi-modal embeddings
extracted from a lightweight vision-language model (VLM). Our approach is
guided by four key principles: i) Unified prompting: OpenWorldSAM supports a
diverse range of prompts, including category-level and sentence-level language
descriptions, providing a flexible interface for various segmentation tasks.
ii) Efficiency: By freezing the pre-trained components of SAM2 and the VLM, we
train only 4.5 million parameters on the COCO-stuff dataset, achieving
remarkable resource efficiency. iii) Instance Awareness: We enhance the model's
spatial understanding through novel positional tie-breaker embeddings and
cross-attention layers, enabling effective segmentation of multiple instances.
iv) Generalization: OpenWorldSAM exhibits strong zero-shot capabilities,
generalizing well on unseen categories and an open vocabulary of concepts
without additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
OpenWorldSAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-vocabulary semantic,
instance, and panoptic segmentation across multiple benchmarks, including

Abstract: Content-aware layout aims to arrange design elements appropriately on a given
canvas to convey information effectively. Recently, the trend for this task has
been to leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate layouts
automatically, achieving remarkable performance. However, existing LLM-based
methods fail to adequately interpret spatial relationships among visual themes
and design elements, leading to structural and diverse problems in layout
generation. To address this issue, we introduce ReLayout, a novel method that
leverages relation-CoT to generate more reasonable and aesthetically coherent
layouts by fundamentally originating from design concepts. Specifically, we
enhance layout annotations by introducing explicit relation definitions, such
as region, salient, and margin between elements, with the goal of decomposing
the layout into smaller, structured, and recursive layouts, thereby enabling
the generation of more structured layouts. Furthermore, based on these defined
relationships, we introduce a layout prototype rebalance sampler, which defines
layout prototype features across three dimensions and quantifies distinct
layout styles. This sampler addresses uniformity issues in generation that
arise from data bias in the prototype distribution balance process. Extensive
experimental results verify that ReLayout outperforms baselines and can
generate structural and diverse layouts that are more aligned with human
aesthetics and more explainable.

Abstract: Visual agent models for automating human activities on Graphical User
Interfaces (GUIs) have emerged as a promising research direction, driven by

Abstract: Prompt learning methods have significantly extended the transferability of
pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP for various downstream
tasks. These methods adopt handcraft templates or learnable vectors to provide
text or image instructions in fine-tuning VLMs. However, most existing works
ignore the structural relationships between learnable prompts and tokens within
and between modalities. Moreover, balancing the performance of base and new
classes remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose an
Integrated Structural Prompt (ISP) for VLMs to enhance the interaction of
information representations between the text and image branches. ISP introduces
self-structural and cross-structural prompt modules to model the structural
relationships between learnable prompts and frozen tokens within and across
modalities. This enables efficient information transfer while preserving
feature stability. Additionally, we propose a sample probing module that
dynamically adjusts loss coefficients based on sample difficulty, preventing
the mode from overfitting to simple samples and improving generalization
ability to new classes. Extensive experiments on three widely used settings:
base-to-new generalization, cross-dataset evaluation, and domain generalization
demonstrate that the proposed ISP achieves competitive performance against
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: As a challenging vision-language (VL) task, Composed Image Retrieval (CIR)
aims to retrieve target images using multimodal (image+text) queries. Although
many existing CIR methods have attained promising performance, their reliance
on costly, manually labeled triplets hinders scalability and zero-shot
capability. To address this issue, we propose a scalable pipeline for automatic

Retrieval on High-quality Synthetic Triplets (CIRHS). Our pipeline leverages a
large language model (LLM) to generate diverse prompts, controlling a
text-to-image generative model to produce image pairs with identical elements
in each pair, which are then filtered and reorganized to form the CIRHS
dataset. In addition, we introduce Hybrid Contextual Alignment (CoAlign), a
novel CIR framework, which can accomplish global alignment and local reasoning
within a broader context, enabling the model to learn more robust and
informative representations. By utilizing the synthetic CIRHS dataset, CoAlign
achieves outstanding zero-shot performance on three commonly used benchmarks,
demonstrating for the first time the feasibility of training CIR models on a

as the input of diffusion decoders, which produce high-quality videos
conditioned on these visual clues. To fully unlock the potential of our system
for unified video modeling, we integrate several technical improvements: 1) a
lightweight architectural design that respectively attaches a vision head on
the top of MLLMs and a adapter before the input of diffusion decoders, the
former produce visual tokens for the latter, which adapts these visual tokens
to the conditional space of diffusion decoders; and 2) an efficient multi-stage
training scheme that facilitates a fast connection between MLLMs and diffusion
decoders with limited data and computational resources. We empirically
demonstrate that our model exhibits satisfactory generalization abilities

Result: CultureCLIP在文化相关任务中比CLIP提升5.49%的细粒度识别能力，同时保持泛化能力。

Conclusion: 数据合成和定制训练范式能有效捕捉文化差异。

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP excel in multimodal
understanding but struggle with contextually relevant fine-grained visual
features, making it difficult to distinguish visually similar yet culturally
distinct concepts. This limitation stems from the scarcity of high-quality
culture-specific datasets, the lack of integrated contextual knowledge, and the
absence of hard negatives highlighting subtle distinctions. To address these
challenges, we first design a data curation pipeline that leverages
open-sourced VLMs and text-to-image diffusion models to construct CulTwin, a
synthetic cultural dataset. This dataset consists of paired
concept-caption-image triplets, where concepts visually resemble each other but
represent different cultural contexts. Then, we fine-tune CLIP on CulTwin to
create CultureCLIP, which aligns cultural concepts with contextually enhanced
captions and synthetic images through customized contrastive learning, enabling
finer cultural differentiation while preserving generalization capabilities.
Experiments on culturally relevant benchmarks show that CultureCLIP outperforms

Motivation: 生成模型在文本到图像任务中因数据噪声大而难以准确遵循提示，需依赖复杂的提示工程。

Result: 结构化标注显著提升了文本-图像对齐分数。

Conclusion: 结构化标注能有效提升模型可控性和对齐能力。

Abstract: We argue that generative text-to-image models often struggle with prompt
adherence due to the noisy and unstructured nature of large-scale datasets like
LAION-5B. This forces users to rely heavily on prompt engineering to elicit
desirable outputs. In this work, we propose that enforcing a consistent caption
structure during training can significantly improve model controllability and
alignment. We introduce Re-LAION-Caption 19M, a high-quality subset of
Re-LAION-5B, comprising 19 million 1024x1024 images with captions generated by
a Mistral 7B Instruct-based LLaVA-Next model. Each caption follows a four-part
template: subject, setting, aesthetics, and camera details. We fine-tune
PixArt-$\Sigma$ and Stable Diffusion 2 using both structured and randomly
shuffled captions, and show that structured versions consistently yield higher
text-image alignment scores using visual question answering (VQA) models. The
dataset is publicly available at

Conclusion: CorrDetail为可解释的人脸伪造检测提供了有效解决方案，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: With the swift progression of image generation technology, the widespread
emergence of facial deepfakes poses significant challenges to the field of
security, thus amplifying the urgent need for effective deepfake
detection.Existing techniques for face forgery detection can broadly be
categorized into two primary groups: visual-based methods and multimodal
approaches. The former often lacks clear explanations for forgery details,
while the latter, which merges visual and linguistic modalities, is more prone
to the issue of hallucinations.To address these shortcomings, we introduce a
visual detail enhanced self-correction framework, designated CorrDetail, for
interpretable face forgery detection. CorrDetail is meticulously designed to
rectify authentic forgery details when provided with error-guided questioning,
with the aim of fostering the ability to uncover forgery details rather than
yielding hallucinated responses. Additionally, to bolster the reliability of
its findings, a visual fine-grained detail enhancement module is incorporated,
supplying CorrDetail with more precise visual forgery details. Ultimately, a
fusion decision strategy is devised to further augment the model's
discriminative capacity in handling extreme samples, through the integration of
visual information compensation and model bias reduction.Experimental results
demonstrate that CorrDetail not only achieves state-of-the-art performance
compared to the latest methodologies but also excels in accurately identifying
forged details, all while exhibiting robust generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: 神经驱动生成模型在无障碍图像编辑中具有潜力，为认知驱动创意技术开辟新方向。

Abstract: Traditional image editing typically relies on manual prompting, making it
labor-intensive and inaccessible to individuals with limited motor control or
language abilities. Leveraging recent advances in brain-computer interfaces
(BCIs) and generative models, we propose LoongX, a hands-free image editing
approach driven by multimodal neurophysiological signals. LoongX utilizes
state-of-the-art diffusion models trained on a comprehensive dataset of 23,928
image editing pairs, each paired with synchronized electroencephalography
(EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), photoplethysmography
(PPG), and head motion signals that capture user intent. To effectively address
the heterogeneity of these signals, LoongX integrates two key modules. The
cross-scale state space (CS3) module encodes informative modality-specific
features. The dynamic gated fusion (DGF) module further aggregates these
features into a unified latent space, which is then aligned with edit semantics
via fine-tuning on a diffusion transformer (DiT). Additionally, we pre-train
the encoders using contrastive learning to align cognitive states with semantic
intentions from embedded natural language. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that LoongX achieves performance comparable to text-driven methods (CLIP-I:
0.6605 vs. 0.6558; DINO: 0.4812 vs. 0.4636) and outperforms them when neural
signals are combined with speech (CLIP-T: 0.2588 vs. 0.2549). These results
highlight the promise of neural-driven generative models in enabling
accessible, intuitive image editing and open new directions for
cognitive-driven creative technologies. Datasets and code will be released to
support future work and foster progress in this emerging area.

Abstract: Diffusion models for image generation function by progressively adding noise
to an image set and training a model to separate out the signal from the noise.
The noise profile used by these models is white noise -- that is, noise based
on independent normal distributions at each point whose mean and variance is
independent of the scale. By contrast, most natural image sets exhibit a type
of scale invariance in their low-order statistical properties characterized by
a power-law scaling. Consequently, natural images are closer (in a quantifiable
sense) to a different probability distribution that emphasizes large scale
correlations and de-emphasizes small scale correlations. These scale invariant
noise profiles can be incorporated into diffusion models in place of white
noise to form what we will call a ``Cloud Diffusion Model". We argue that these
models can lead to faster inference, improved high-frequency details, and
greater controllability. In a follow-up paper, we will build and train a Cloud
Diffusion Model that uses scale invariance at a fundamental level and compare
it to classic, white noise diffusion models.

Conclusion: LoomNet通过共享潜在空间和协同推理，显著提升了多视图生成的一致性和质量。

Abstract: Generating consistent multi-view images from a single image remains
challenging. Lack of spatial consistency often degrades 3D mesh quality in
surface reconstruction. To address this, we propose LoomNet, a novel multi-view
diffusion architecture that produces coherent images by applying the same
diffusion model multiple times in parallel to collaboratively build and
leverage a shared latent space for view consistency. Each viewpoint-specific
inference generates an encoding representing its own hypothesis of the novel
view from a given camera pose, which is projected onto three orthogonal planes.
For each plane, encodings from all views are fused into a single aggregated
plane. These aggregated planes are then processed to propagate information and
interpolate missing regions, combining the hypotheses into a unified, coherent
interpretation. The final latent space is then used to render consistent
multi-view images. LoomNet generates 16 high-quality and coherent views in just
15 seconds. In our experiments, LoomNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
both image quality and reconstruction metrics, also showing creativity by
producing diverse, plausible novel views from the same input.

Conclusion: Accordion成功地将AI生成的设计转换为可编辑的分层设计，并通过优化文本内容提升了实用性，为设计师提供了高效的工具。

Abstract: Graphic design is crucial for conveying ideas and messages. Designers usually
organize their work into objects, backgrounds, and vectorized text layers to
simplify editing. However, this workflow demands considerable expertise. With
the rise of GenAI methods, an endless supply of high-quality graphic designs in
pixel format has become more accessible, though these designs often lack
editability. Despite this, non-layered designs still inspire human designers,
influencing their choices in layouts and text styles, ultimately guiding the
creation of layered designs. Motivated by this observation, we propose
Accordion, a graphic design generation framework taking the first attempt to
convert AI-generated designs into editable layered designs, meanwhile refining
nonsensical AI-generated text with meaningful alternatives guided by user
prompts. It is built around a vision language model (VLM) playing distinct
roles in three curated stages. For each stage, we design prompts to guide the
VLM in executing different tasks. Distinct from existing bottom-up methods
(e.g., COLE and Open-COLE) that gradually generate elements to create layered
designs, our approach works in a top-down manner by using the visually
harmonious reference image as global guidance to decompose each layer.
Additionally, it leverages multiple vision experts such as SAM and element
removal models to facilitate the creation of graphic layers. We train our
method using the in-house graphic design dataset Design39K, augmented with
AI-generated design images coupled with refined ground truth created by a
customized inpainting model. Experimental results and user studies by designers
show that Accordion generates favorable results on the DesignIntention
benchmark, including tasks such as text-to-template, adding text to background,
and text de-rendering, and also excels in creating design variations.

Result: KDS显著提升了超分辨率和图像修复任务的定量和定性性能。

Conclusion: KDS是一种无需重新训练或外部验证的即插即用框架，适用于多种扩散采样器。

Abstract: Diffusion models show promise for image restoration, but existing methods
often struggle with inconsistent fidelity and undesirable artifacts. To address
this, we introduce Kernel Density Steering (KDS), a novel inference-time
framework promoting robust, high-fidelity outputs through explicit local
mode-seeking. KDS employs an $N$-particle ensemble of diffusion samples,
computing patch-wise kernel density estimation gradients from their collective
outputs. These gradients steer patches in each particle towards shared,
higher-density regions identified within the ensemble. This collective local
mode-seeking mechanism, acting as "collective wisdom", steers samples away from
spurious modes prone to artifacts, arising from independent sampling or model
imperfections, and towards more robust, high-fidelity structures. This allows
us to obtain better quality samples at the expense of higher compute by
simultaneously sampling multiple particles. As a plug-and-play framework, KDS
requires no retraining or external verifiers, seamlessly integrating with
various diffusion samplers. Extensive numerical validations demonstrate KDS
substantially improves both quantitative and qualitative performance on
challenging real-world super-resolution and image inpainting tasks.

Abstract: Domain-specific image generation aims to produce high-quality visual content
for specialized fields while ensuring semantic accuracy and detail fidelity.
However, existing methods exhibit two critical limitations: First, current
approaches address prompt engineering and model adaptation separately,
overlooking the inherent dependence between semantic understanding and visual
representation in specialized domains. Second, these techniques inadequately
incorporate domain-specific semantic constraints during content synthesis,
resulting in generation outcomes that exhibit hallucinations and semantic
deviations. To tackle these issues, we propose AdaptaGen, a hierarchical
semantic optimization framework that integrates matrix-based prompt
optimization with multi-perspective understanding, capturing comprehensive
semantic relationships from both global and local perspectives. To mitigate
hallucinations in specialized domains, we design a cross-modal adaptation
mechanism, which, when combined with intelligent content synthesis, enables
preserving core thematic elements while incorporating diverse details across
images. Additionally, we introduce a two-phase caption semantic transformation
during the generation phase. This approach maintains semantic coherence while
enhancing visual diversity, ensuring the generated images adhere to
domain-specific constraints. Experimental results confirm our approach's
effectiveness, with our framework achieving superior performance across 40
categories from diverse datasets using only 16 images per category,
demonstrating significant improvements in image quality, diversity, and

Conclusion: LiON-LoRA 为 VDM 提供了更稳定和精确的控制方法。

Abstract: Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
synthesizing realistic videos by learning from large-scale data. Although
vanilla Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can learn specific spatial or temporal
movement to driven VDMs with constrained data, achieving precise control over
both camera trajectories and object motion remains challenging due to the
unstable fusion and non-linear scalability. To address these issues, we propose
LiON-LoRA, a novel framework that rethinks LoRA fusion through three core
principles: Linear scalability, Orthogonality, and Norm consistency. First, we
analyze the orthogonality of LoRA features in shallow VDM layers, enabling
decoupled low-level controllability. Second, norm consistency is enforced
across layers to stabilize fusion during complex camera motion combinations.
Third, a controllable token is integrated into the diffusion transformer (DiT)
to linearly adjust motion amplitudes for both cameras and objects with a
modified self-attention mechanism to ensure decoupled control. Additionally, we
extend LiON-LoRA to temporal generation by leveraging static-camera videos,
unifying spatial and temporal controllability. Experiments demonstrate that
LiON-LoRA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in trajectory control accuracy
and motion strength adjustment, achieving superior generalization with minimal

Abstract: Panoptic Scene Graph Generation (PSG) integrates instance segmentation with
relation understanding to capture pixel-level structural relationships in
complex scenes. Although recent approaches leveraging pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved performance in the
open-vocabulary setting, they commonly ignore the inherent limitations of VLMs
in spatial relation reasoning, such as difficulty in distinguishing object
relative positions, which results in suboptimal relation prediction. Motivated
by the denoising diffusion model's inversion process in preserving the spatial
structure of input images, we propose SPADE (SPatial-Aware Denoising-nEtwork)
framework -- a novel approach for open-vocabulary PSG. SPADE consists of two
key steps: (1) inversion-guided calibration for the UNet adaptation, and (2)
spatial-aware context reasoning. In the first step, we calibrate a general
pre-trained teacher diffusion model into a PSG-specific denoising network with
cross-attention maps derived during inversion through a lightweight LoRA-based
fine-tuning strategy. In the second step, we develop a spatial-aware relation
graph transformer that captures both local and long-range contextual
information, facilitating the generation of high-quality relation queries.
Extensive experiments on benchmark PSG and Visual Genome datasets demonstrate
that SPADE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both closed- and open-set
scenarios, particularly for spatial relationship prediction.

Abstract: Document reconstruction constitutes a significant facet of document analysis
and recognition, a field that has been progressively accruing interest within
the scholarly community. A multitude of these researchers employ an array of
document understanding models to generate predictions on distinct subtasks,
subsequently integrating their results into a holistic document reconstruction
format via heuristic principles. Nevertheless, these multi-stage methodologies
are hindered by the phenomenon of error propagation, resulting in suboptimal
performance. Furthermore, contemporary studies utilize generative models to
extract the logical sequence of plain text, tables and mathematical expressions
in an end-to-end process. However, this approach is deficient in preserving the
information related to element layouts, which are vital for document
reconstruction. To surmount these aforementioned limitations, we in this paper
present an innovative autoregressive model specifically designed for document
reconstruction, referred to as Document Reconstruction via End-to-end
Autoregressive Model (DREAM). DREAM transmutes the text image into a sequence
of document reconstruction in a comprehensive, end-to-end process,
encapsulating a broader spectrum of document element information. In addition,
we establish a standardized definition of the document reconstruction task, and
introduce a novel Document Similarity Metric (DSM) and DocRec1K dataset for
assessing the performance of the task. Empirical results substantiate that our
methodology attains unparalleled performance in the realm of document
reconstruction. Furthermore, the results on a variety of subtasks, encompassing
document layout analysis, text recognition, table structure recognition,
formula recognition and reading order detection, indicate that our model is

Abstract: The development of safe and robust autonomous driving functions is heavily
dependent on large-scale, high-quality sensor data. However, real-word data
acquisition demands intensive human labor and is strongly limited by factors
such as labeling cost, driver safety protocols and diverse scenario coverage.
Thus, multiple lines of work focus on the conditional generation of synthetic
camera sensor data. We identify a significant gap in research regarding daytime
variation, presumably caused by the scarcity of available labels. Consequently,
we present the solar altitude as global conditioning variable. It is readily
computable from latitude-longitude coordinates and local time, eliminating the
need for extensive manual labeling. Our work is complemented by a tailored
normalization approach, targeting the sensitivity of daylight towards small
numeric changes in altitude. We demonstrate its ability to accurately capture
lighting characteristics and illumination-dependent image noise in the context
of diffusion models.

Abstract: The annotation bottleneck in semantic segmentation has driven significant
interest in few-shot segmentation, which aims to develop segmentation models
capable of generalizing rapidly to novel classes using minimal exemplars.
Conventional training paradigms typically generate query prior maps by
extracting masked-area features from support images, followed by making
predictions guided by these prior maps. However, current approaches remain
constrained by two critical limitations stemming from inter- and intra-image
discrepancies, both of which significantly degrade segmentation performance: 1)
The semantic gap between support and query images results in mismatched
features and inaccurate prior maps; 2) Visually similar yet semantically
distinct regions within support or query images lead to false negative or false
positive predictions. We propose a novel FSS method called \textbf{I$^2$R}: 1)
Using category-specific high level representations which aggregate global
semantic cues from support and query images, enabling more precise inter-image
region localization and address the first limitation. 2) Directional masking
strategy that suppresses inconsistent support-query pixel pairs, which exhibit
high feature similarity but conflicting mask, to mitigate the second issue.
Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving improvements of 1.9\% and 2.1\% in mIoU under the 1-shot
setting on PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ benchmarks, respectively.

Abstract: The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in remote sensing (RS) image
understanding has achieved notable progress, demonstrating the basic ability to
recognize and describe geographical entities. However, existing RS-VLMs are
mostly limited to image-level and region-level tasks, lacking the capability to
handle pixel-level tasks and performing poorly in small-object recognition
scenarios. Moreover, RS-VLMs consume significant computational resources when
processing high-resolution RS images, further restricting their practical
applicability. In this context, we propose GeoMag (Geographical Magnifier), an
end-to-end general-purpose large model framework for RS. GeoMag dynamically
focuses the attention scope based on prompt semantics to effectively perform
remote sensing image parsing across multiple levels of granularity. This method
introduces Task-driven Multi-granularity Resolution Adjustment (TMRA) and
Prompt-guided Semantic-aware Cropping (PSC), which adaptively reduce the
spatial resolution of task-irrelevant regions while enhancing the visual
representation of task-relevant areas. This approach improves the model's
perception of critical target regions, suppresses background redundancy, and
reduces the computational cost of interpreting high-resolution RS imagery.
Extensive comparative experiments on 10 benchmarks demonstrate that GeoMag not
only excels in handling pixel-level tasks but also maintains competitive
performance across tasks of other granularities compared to existing RS-VLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal data is known to be helpful for visual tracking by improving
robustness to appearance variations. However, sensor synchronization challenges
often compromise data availability, particularly in video settings where
shortages can be temporal. Despite its importance, this area remains
underexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study on
tracker performance with temporally incomplete multimodal data. Unsurprisingly,
under such a circumstance, existing trackers exhibit significant performance
degradation, as their rigid architectures lack the adaptability needed to
effectively handle missing modalities. To address these limitations, we propose
a flexible framework for robust multimodal tracking. We venture that a tracker
should dynamically activate computational units based on missing data rates.
This is achieved through a novel Heterogeneous Mixture-of-Experts fusion
mechanism with adaptive complexity, coupled with a video-level masking strategy
that ensures both temporal consistency and spatial completeness which is
critical for effective video tracking. Surprisingly, our model not only adapts
to varying missing rates but also adjusts to scene complexity. Extensive
experiments show that our model achieves SOTA performance across 9 benchmarks,
excelling in both conventional complete and missing modality settings. The code

improvements to expand its capabilities in both appearance and motion
customization. Specifically, we introduce a decoupled personalization extractor

conditioning during training. Moreover, we introduce a contrastive loss that
jointly optimizes trajectory dynamics and entity consistency through explicit
mapping between motion and personalization embeddings. Tora2 is, to our best

Abstract: While diffusion model fine-tuning offers a powerful approach for customizing
pre-trained models to generate specific objects, it frequently suffers from
overfitting when training samples are limited, compromising both generalization
capability and output diversity. This paper tackles the challenging yet most
impactful task of adapting a diffusion model using just a single concept image,
as single-image customization holds the greatest practical potential. We
introduce T-LoRA, a Timestep-Dependent Low-Rank Adaptation framework
specifically designed for diffusion model personalization. In our work we show
that higher diffusion timesteps are more prone to overfitting than lower ones,
necessitating a timestep-sensitive fine-tuning strategy. T-LoRA incorporates
two key innovations: (1) a dynamic fine-tuning strategy that adjusts
rank-constrained updates based on diffusion timesteps, and (2) a weight
parametrization technique that ensures independence between adapter components
through orthogonal initialization. Extensive experiments show that T-LoRA and
its individual components outperform standard LoRA and other diffusion model
personalization techniques. They achieve a superior balance between concept
fidelity and text alignment, highlighting the potential of T-LoRA in
data-limited and resource-constrained scenarios. Code is available at

Abstract: Partial multi-label learning aims to extract knowledge from incompletely
annotated data, which includes known correct labels, known incorrect labels,
and unknown labels. The core challenge lies in accurately identifying the
ambiguous relationships between labels and instances. In this paper, we
emphasize that matching co-occurrence patterns between labels and instances is
key to addressing this challenge. To this end, we propose Semantic
Co-occurrence Insight Network (SCINet), a novel and effective framework for
partial multi-label learning. Specifically, SCINet introduces a bi-dominant
prompter module, which leverages an off-the-shelf multimodal model to capture
text-image correlations and enhance semantic alignment. To reinforce
instance-label interdependencies, we develop a cross-modality fusion module
that jointly models inter-label correlations, inter-instance relationships, and
co-occurrence patterns across instance-label assignments. Moreover, we propose
an intrinsic semantic augmentation strategy that enhances the model's
understanding of intrinsic data semantics by applying diverse image
transformations, thereby fostering a synergistic relationship between label
confidence and sample difficulty. Extensive experiments on four widely-used
benchmark datasets demonstrate that SCINet surpasses state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The modern text-to-image diffusion models boom has opened a new era in
digital content production as it has proven the previously unseen ability to
produce photorealistic and stylistically diverse imagery based on the semantics
of natural-language descriptions. However, the consistent disadvantage of these
models is that they cannot generate readable, meaningful, and correctly spelled
text in generated images, which significantly limits the use of practical
purposes like advertising, learning, and creative design. This paper introduces
a new framework, namely Glyph-Conditioned Diffusion with Character-Aware
Attention (GCDA), using which a typical diffusion backbone is extended by three
well-designed modules. To begin with, the model has a dual-stream text encoder
that encodes both semantic contextual information and explicit glyph
representations, resulting in a character-aware representation of the input
text that is rich in nature. Second, an attention mechanism that is aware of
the character is proposed with a new attention segregation loss that aims to
limit the attention distribution of each character independently in order to
avoid distortion artifacts. Lastly, GCDA has an OCR-in-the-loop fine-tuning
phase, where a full text perceptual loss, directly optimises models to be
legible and accurately spell. Large scale experiments to benchmark datasets,
such as MARIO-10M and T2I-CompBench, reveal that GCDA sets a new
state-of-the-art on all metrics, with better character based metrics on text
rendering (Character Error Rate: 0.08 vs 0.21 for the previous best; Word Error
Rate: 0.15 vs 0.25), human perception, and comparable image synthesis quality
on high-fidelity (FID: 14.3).

control over lip movements and facial expressions. Beyond conventional
audio-driven lip synchronization, we integrate audio and speech text,
predicting frame-wise intensity variations and dynamically adjusting static
emotion features to generate realistic emotional expressions. Furthermore, to
enhance control and personalization, we incorporate multimodal inputs-including
text descriptions and reference expression images-to guide the generation of
user-specified facial expressions. With MetaHuman as the priority, our
generated results can be conveniently integrated into the industrial production

Abstract: In recent years, affective computing and its applications have become a
fast-growing research topic. Despite significant advancements, the lack of
affective multi-modal datasets remains a major bottleneck in developing
accurate emotion recognition systems. Furthermore, the use of contact-based
devices during emotion elicitation often unintentionally influences the
emotional experience, reducing or altering the genuine spontaneous emotional
response. This limitation highlights the need for methods capable of extracting
affective cues from multiple modalities without physical contact, such as
remote physiological emotion recognition. To address this, we present the
Contactless Affective States Through Physiological Signals Database
(CAST-Phys), a novel high-quality dataset explicitly designed for multi-modal
remote physiological emotion recognition using facial and physiological cues.
The dataset includes diverse physiological signals, such as
photoplethysmography (PPG), electrodermal activity (EDA), and respiration rate
(RR), alongside high-resolution uncompressed facial video recordings, enabling
the potential for remote signal recovery. Our analysis highlights the crucial
role of physiological signals in realistic scenarios where facial expressions
alone may not provide sufficient emotional information. Furthermore, we
demonstrate the potential of remote multi-modal emotion recognition by
evaluating the impact of individual and fused modalities, showcasing its
effectiveness in advancing contactless emotion recognition technologies.

Abstract: Accurately rendering scenes with reflective surfaces remains a significant
challenge in novel view synthesis, as existing methods like Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) often misinterpret reflections
as physical geometry, resulting in degraded reconstructions. Previous methods
rely on incomplete and non-generalizable geometric constraints, leading to
misalignment between the positions of Gaussian splats and the actual scene
geometry. When dealing with real-world scenes containing complex geometry, the
accumulation of Gaussians further exacerbates surface artifacts and results in
blurred reconstructions. To address these limitations, in this work, we propose
Ref-Unlock, a novel geometry-aware reflection modeling framework based on 3D
Gaussian Splatting, which explicitly disentangles transmitted and reflected
components to better capture complex reflections and enhance geometric
consistency in real-world scenes. Our approach employs a dual-branch
representation with high-order spherical harmonics to capture high-frequency
reflective details, alongside a reflection removal module providing pseudo
reflection-free supervision to guide clean decomposition. Additionally, we
incorporate pseudo-depth maps and a geometry-aware bilateral smoothness
constraint to enhance 3D geometric consistency and stability in decomposition.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ref-Unlock significantly outperforms
classical GS-based reflection methods and achieves competitive results with
NeRF-based models, while enabling flexible vision foundation models (VFMs)
driven reflection editing. Our method thus offers an efficient and
generalizable solution for realistic rendering of reflective scenes. Our code

Abstract: Diffusion models has underpinned much recent advances of dataset augmentation
in various computer vision tasks. However, when involving generating
multi-object images as real scenarios, most existing methods either rely
entirely on text condition, resulting in a deviation between the generated
objects and the original data, or rely too much on the original images,
resulting in a lack of diversity in the generated images, which is of limited
help to downstream tasks. To mitigate both problems with one stone, we propose
a prompt-free conditional diffusion framework for multi-object image
augmentation. Specifically, we introduce a local-global semantic fusion
strategy to extract semantics from images to replace text, and inject knowledge
into the diffusion model through LoRA to alleviate the category deviation
between the original model and the target dataset. In addition, we design a
reward model based counting loss to assist the traditional reconstruction loss
for model training. By constraining the object counts of each category instead
of pixel-by-pixel constraints, bridging the quantity deviation between the
generated data and the original data while improving the diversity of the
generated data. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed method over several representative state-of-the-art baselines and
showcase strong downstream task gain and out-of-domain generalization
capabilities. Code is available at

Abstract: Smoothing a signal based on local neighborhoods is a core operation in
machine learning and geometry processing. On well-structured domains such as
vector spaces and manifolds, the Laplace operator derived from differential
geometry offers a principled approach to smoothing via heat diffusion, with
strong theoretical guarantees. However, constructing such Laplacians requires a
carefully defined domain structure, which is not always available. Most
practitioners thus rely on simple convolution kernels and message-passing
layers, which are biased against the boundaries of the domain. We bridge this
gap by introducing a broad class of smoothing operators, derived from general
similarity or adjacency matrices, and demonstrate that they can be normalized
into diffusion-like operators that inherit desirable properties from
Laplacians. Our approach relies on a symmetric variant of the Sinkhorn
algorithm, which rescales positive smoothing operators to match the structural
behavior of heat diffusion. This construction enables Laplacian-like smoothing
and processing of irregular data such as point clouds, sparse voxel grids or
mixture of Gaussians. We show that the resulting operators not only approximate
heat diffusion but also retain spectral information from the Laplacian itself,
with applications to shape analysis and matching.

Abstract: Technical reports and articles often contain valuable information in the form
of semi-structured data like charts, and figures. Interpreting these and using
the information from them is essential for downstream tasks such as question
answering (QA). Current approaches to visual question answering often struggle
with the precision required for scientific data interpretation, particularly in
handling numerical values, multi-step reasoning over visual elements, and
maintaining consistency between visual observation and textual reasoning. We
present our approach to the SciVQA 2025 shared task, focusing on answering
visual and non-visual questions grounded in scientific figures from scholarly
articles.
  We conducted a series of experiments using models with 5B to 8B parameters.
Our strongest individual model, InternVL3, achieved ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L F1
scores of \textbf{0.740} and a BERTScore of \textbf{0.983} on the SciVQA test
split. We also developed an ensemble model with multiple vision language models
(VLMs). Through error analysis on the validation split, our ensemble approach
improved performance compared to most individual models, though InternVL3
remained the strongest standalone performer. Our findings underscore the
effectiveness of prompt optimization, chain-of-thought reasoning and ensemble
modeling in improving the model's ability in visual question answering.

Abstract: Semantic scene completion (SSC) aims to infer both the 3D geometry and
semantics of a scene from single images. In contrast to prior work on SSC that
heavily relies on expensive ground-truth annotations, we approach SSC in an
unsupervised setting. Our novel method, SceneDINO, adapts techniques from
self-supervised representation learning and 2D unsupervised scene understanding
to SSC. Our training exclusively utilizes multi-view consistency
self-supervision without any form of semantic or geometric ground truth. Given
a single input image, SceneDINO infers the 3D geometry and expressive 3D DINO
features in a feed-forward manner. Through a novel 3D feature distillation
approach, we obtain unsupervised 3D semantics. In both 3D and 2D unsupervised
scene understanding, SceneDINO reaches state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy.
Linear probing our 3D features matches the segmentation accuracy of a current
supervised SSC approach. Additionally, we showcase the domain generalization
and multi-view consistency of SceneDINO, taking the first steps towards a
strong foundation for single image 3D scene understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理复杂语义关系和跨模态对齐时存在局限性，主要原因是耦合处理机制导致错误传播和泛化能力受限。

Method: 采用双阶段框架：CLIP用于粗定位和生成提示，SAM用于精细分割；设计了级联二阶提示器以优化语义提示。

Result: 在多个数据集上，RSRefSeg 2的分割精度（gIoU）提升了约3%，且能更好地处理复杂语义。

Conclusion: 解耦框架和基础模型协作显著提升了遥感图像分割的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation provides a flexible and
fine-grained framework for remote sensing scene analysis via vision-language
collaborative interpretation. Current approaches predominantly utilize a
three-stage pipeline encompassing dual-modal encoding, cross-modal interaction,
and pixel decoding. These methods demonstrate significant limitations in
managing complex semantic relationships and achieving precise cross-modal
alignment, largely due to their coupled processing mechanism that conflates
target localization with boundary delineation. This architectural coupling
amplifies error propagation under semantic ambiguity while restricting model
generalizability and interpretability. To address these issues, we propose
RSRefSeg 2, a decoupling paradigm that reformulates the conventional workflow
into a collaborative dual-stage framework: coarse localization followed by fine
segmentation. RSRefSeg 2 integrates CLIP's cross-modal alignment strength with
SAM's segmentation generalizability through strategic foundation model
collaboration. Specifically, CLIP is employed as the dual-modal encoder to
activate target features within its pre-aligned semantic space and generate
localization prompts. To mitigate CLIP's misactivation challenges in
multi-entity scenarios described by referring texts, a cascaded second-order
prompter is devised, which enhances precision through implicit reasoning via
decomposition of text embeddings into complementary semantic subspaces. These
optimized semantic prompts subsequently direct the SAM to generate pixel-level
refined masks, thereby completing the semantic transmission pipeline. Extensive
experiments (RefSegRS, RRSIS-D, and RISBench) demonstrate that RSRefSeg 2
surpasses contemporary methods in segmentation accuracy (+~3% gIoU) and complex
semantic interpretation. Code is available at:

Conclusion: DreamGrasp克服了现有方法的局限性，适用于复杂多物体环境。

Abstract: Partial-view 3D recognition -- reconstructing 3D geometry and identifying
object instances from a few sparse RGB images -- is an exceptionally
challenging yet practically essential task, particularly in cluttered, occluded
real-world settings where full-view or reliable depth data are often
unavailable. Existing methods, whether based on strong symmetry priors or
supervised learning on curated datasets, fail to generalize to such scenarios.
In this work, we introduce DreamGrasp, a framework that leverages the
imagination capability of large-scale pre-trained image generative models to
infer the unobserved parts of a scene. By combining coarse 3D reconstruction,
instance segmentation via contrastive learning, and text-guided instance-wise
refinement, DreamGrasp circumvents limitations of prior methods and enables
robust 3D reconstruction in complex, multi-object environments. Our experiments
show that DreamGrasp not only recovers accurate object geometry but also
supports downstream tasks like sequential decluttering and target retrieval
with high success rates.

shows superior performance compared to SSL-trained models in cancer subtyping
benchmarks and is fully trained on freely available data. Furthermore, a shared

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle perception systems require robust pedestrian detection,
particularly on geometrically complex roadways like Type-S curved surfaces,
where standard RGB camera-based methods face limitations. This paper introduces
YOLO-APD, a novel deep learning architecture enhancing the YOLOv8 framework
specifically for this challenge. YOLO-APD integrates several key architectural
modifications: a parameter-free SimAM attention mechanism, computationally
efficient C3Ghost modules, a novel SimSPPF module for enhanced multi-scale
feature pooling, the Mish activation function for improved optimization, and an
Intelligent Gather & Distribute (IGD) module for superior feature fusion in the
network's neck. The concept of leveraging vehicle steering dynamics for
adaptive region-of-interest processing is also presented. Comprehensive
evaluations on a custom CARLA dataset simulating complex scenarios demonstrate
that YOLO-APD achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy, reaching 77.7%
mAP@0.5:0.95 and exceptional pedestrian recall exceeding 96%, significantly
outperforming baseline models, including YOLOv8. Furthermore, it maintains
real-time processing capabilities at 100 FPS, showcasing a superior balance
between accuracy and efficiency. Ablation studies validate the synergistic
contribution of each integrated component. Evaluation on the KITTI dataset

Result: 在3D基准数据集上，Spotlight改进了形态学表示，同时保持了像素级精度。

Conclusion: Spotlight生成的虚拟染色更适合分割和分析等下游任务。

Abstract: Microscopy enables direct observation of cellular morphology in 3D, with
transmitted-light methods offering low-cost, minimally invasive imaging and
fluorescence microscopy providing specificity and contrast. Virtual staining
combines these strengths by using machine learning to predict fluorescence
images from label-free inputs. However, training of existing methods typically
relies on loss functions that treat all pixels equally, thus reproducing
background noise and artifacts instead of focusing on biologically meaningful
signals. We introduce Spotlight, a simple yet powerful virtual staining
approach that guides the model to focus on relevant cellular structures.
Spotlight uses histogram-based foreground estimation to mask pixel-wise loss
and to calculate a Dice loss on soft-thresholded predictions for shape-aware
learning. Applied to a 3D benchmark dataset, Spotlight improves morphological
representation while preserving pixel-level accuracy, resulting in virtual
stains better suited for downstream tasks such as segmentation and profiling.

agricultural domain perspective, we describe a requirements framework for an
ideal agricultural foundation model (CropFM). We then survey and compare
existing general-purpose foundational models in this framework and empirically
evaluate two exemplary of them in three representative agriculture specific
tasks. Finally, we highlight the need for a dedicated foundational model
tailored specifically to agriculture.

Abstract: Many 3D scene editing tasks focus on modifying local regions rather than the
entire scene, except for some global applications like style transfer, and in
the context of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), where scenes are represented by a
series of Gaussians, this structure allows for precise regional edits, offering
enhanced control over specific areas of the scene; however, the challenge lies
in the fact that 3D semantic parsing often underperforms compared to its 2D
counterpart, making targeted manipulations within 3D spaces more difficult and
limiting the fidelity of edits, which we address by leveraging 2D diffusion
editing to accurately identify modification regions in each view, followed by
inverse rendering for 3D localization, then refining the frontal view and
initializing a coarse 3DGS with consistent views and approximate shapes derived
from depth maps predicted by a 2D foundation model, thereby supporting an
iterative, view-consistent editing process that gradually enhances structural
details and textures to ensure coherence across perspectives. Experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while
delivering up to a $4\times$ speedup, providing a more efficient and effective
approach to 3D scene local editing.

Abstract: We introduce scenario-based cognitive status identification in older drivers
from Naturalistic driving videos and large vision models. In recent times,
cognitive decline, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive
impairment (MCI), is often underdiagnosed due to the time-consuming and costly
nature of current diagnostic methods. By analyzing real-world driving behavior
captured through in-vehicle systems, this research aims to extract "digital
fingerprints" that correlate with functional decline and clinical features of
MCI and AD. Moreover, modern large vision models can draw meaningful insights
from everyday driving patterns of older patients to early detect cognitive
decline. We propose a framework that uses large vision models and naturalistic
driving videos to analyze driver behavior, classify cognitive status and
predict disease progression. We leverage the strong relationship between
real-world driving behavior as an observation of the current cognitive status
of the drivers where the vehicle can be utilized as a "diagnostic tool". Our
method identifies early warning signs of functional impairment, contributing to
proactive intervention strategies. This work enhances early detection and
supports the development of scalable, non-invasive monitoring systems to
mitigate the growing societal and economic burden of cognitive decline in the
aging population.

Conclusion: CTNet通过一致性特征转换和辅助模态学习，有效解决了多模态FAS中的分布差异和模态缺失问题。

Abstract: Multi-modal face anti-spoofing (FAS) aims to detect genuine human presence by
extracting discriminative liveness cues from multiple modalities, such as RGB,
infrared (IR), and depth images, to enhance the robustness of biometric
authentication systems. However, because data from different modalities are
typically captured by various camera sensors and under diverse environmental
conditions, multi-modal FAS often exhibits significantly greater distribution
discrepancies across training and testing domains compared to single-modal FAS.
Furthermore, during the inference stage, multi-modal FAS confronts even greater
challenges when one or more modalities are unavailable or inaccessible. In this
paper, we propose a novel Cross-modal Transition-guided Network (CTNet) to
tackle the challenges in the multi-modal FAS task. Our motivation stems from
that, within a single modality, the visual differences between live faces are
typically much smaller than those of spoof faces. Additionally, feature
transitions across modalities are more consistent for the live class compared
to those between live and spoof classes. Upon this insight, we first propose
learning consistent cross-modal feature transitions among live samples to
construct a generalized feature space. Next, we introduce learning the
inconsistent cross-modal feature transitions between live and spoof samples to
effectively detect out-of-distribution (OOD) attacks during inference. To
further address the issue of missing modalities, we propose learning
complementary infrared (IR) and depth features from the RGB modality as
auxiliary modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CTNet
outperforms previous two-class multi-modal FAS methods across most protocols.

Abstract: In the realm of industrial quality inspection, defect detection stands as a
critical component, particularly in high-precision, safety-critical sectors
such as automotive components aerospace, and medical devices. Traditional
methods, reliant on manual inspection or early image processing algorithms,
suffer from inefficiencies, high costs, and limited robustness. This paper
introduces a semi-supervised defect detection framework based on conditional
diffusion (DSYM), leveraging a two-stage collaborative training mechanism and a
staged joint optimization strategy. The framework utilizes labeled data for
initial training and subsequently incorporates unlabeled data through the
generation of pseudo-labels. A conditional diffusion model synthesizes
multi-scale pseudo-defect samples, while a CLIP cross-modal feature-based noise
filtering mechanism mitigates label contamination. Experimental results on the
NEU-DET dataset demonstrate a 78.4% mAP@0.5 with the same amount of labeled
data as traditional supervised methods, and 75.1% mAP@0.5 with only 40% of the
labeled data required by the original supervised model, showcasing significant
advantages in data efficiency. This research provides a high-precision,
low-labeling-dependent solution for defect detection in industrial quality
inspection scenarios. The work of this article has been open-sourced at

Conclusion: GSVR在视频表示和解码效率上取得了显著进步，适用于高效视频处理任务。

Abstract: Implicit neural representations for video have been recognized as a novel and
promising form of video representation. Existing works pay more attention to
improving video reconstruction quality but little attention to the decoding
speed. However, the high computation of convolutional network used in existing
methods leads to low decoding speed. Moreover, these convolution-based video
representation methods also suffer from long training time, about 14 seconds
per frame to achieve 35+ PSNR on Bunny. To solve the above problems, we propose
GSVR, a novel 2D Gaussian-based video representation, which achieves 800+ FPS
and 35+ PSNR on Bunny, only needing a training time of $2$ seconds per frame.
Specifically, we propose a hybrid deformation field to model the dynamics of
the video, which combines two motion patterns, namely the tri-plane motion and
the polynomial motion, to deal with the coupling of camera motion and object
motion in the video. Furthermore, we propose a Dynamic-aware Time Slicing
strategy to adaptively divide the video into multiple groups of pictures(GOP)
based on the dynamic level of the video in order to handle large camera motion
and non-rigid movements. Finally, we propose quantization-aware fine-tuning to
avoid performance reduction after quantization and utilize image codecs to
compress Gaussians to achieve a compact representation. Experiments on the
Bunny and UVG datasets confirm that our method converges much faster than
existing methods and also has 10x faster decoding speed compared to other
methods. Our method has comparable performance in the video interpolation task
to SOTA and attains better video compression performance than NeRV.

Abstract: Enabling photorealistic avatar animations in virtual and augmented reality
(VR/AR) has been challenging because of the difficulty of obtaining ground
truth state of faces. It is physically impossible to obtain synchronized images
from head-mounted cameras (HMC) sensing input, which has partial observations
in infrared (IR), and an array of outside-in dome cameras, which have full
observations that match avatars' appearance. Prior works relying on
analysis-by-synthesis methods could generate accurate ground truth, but suffer
from imperfect disentanglement between expression and style in their
personalized training. The reliance of extensive paired captures (HMC and dome)
for the same subject makes it operationally expensive to collect large-scale
datasets, which cannot be reused for different HMC viewpoints and lighting. In
this work, we propose a novel generative approach, Generative HMC (GenHMC),
that leverages large unpaired HMC captures, which are much easier to collect,
to directly generate high-quality synthetic HMC images given any conditioning
avatar state from dome captures. We show that our method is able to properly
disentangle the input conditioning signal that specifies facial expression and
viewpoint, from facial appearance, leading to more accurate ground truth.
Furthermore, our method can generalize to unseen identities, removing the
reliance on the paired captures. We demonstrate these breakthroughs by both
evaluating synthetic HMC images and universal face encoders trained from these
new HMC-avatar correspondences, which achieve better data efficiency and
state-of-the-art accuracy.

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) represents a novel retrieval paradigm that is
capable of expressing users' intricate retrieval requirements flexibly. It
enables the user to give a multimodal query, comprising a reference image and a
modification text, and subsequently retrieve the target image. Notwithstanding
the considerable advances made by prevailing methodologies, CIR remains in its
nascent stages due to two limitations: 1) inhomogeneity between dominant and
noisy portions in visual data is ignored, leading to query feature degradation,
and 2) the priority of textual data in the image modification process is
overlooked, which leads to a visual focus bias. To address these two
limitations, this work presents a focus mapping-based feature extractor, which
consists of two modules: dominant portion segmentation and dual focus mapping.
It is designed to identify significant dominant portions in images and guide
the extraction of visual and textual data features, thereby reducing the impact
of noise interference. Subsequently, we propose a textually guided focus
revision module, which can utilize the modification requirements implied in the
text to perform adaptive focus revision on the reference image, thereby
enhancing the perception of the modification focus on the composed features.
The aforementioned modules collectively constitute the segmentatiOn-based Focus
shiFt reviSion nETwork (\mbox{OFFSET}), and comprehensive experiments on four
benchmark datasets substantiate the superiority of our proposed method. The

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional performance across various
domains due to their ability to model and generate complicated data
distributions. However, when applied to PolSAR data, traditional real-valued
diffusion models face challenges in capturing complex-valued phase
information.Moreover, these models often struggle to preserve fine structural
details. To address these limitations, we leverage the Contourlet transform,
which provides rich multiscale and multidirectional representations well-suited
for PolSAR imagery. We propose a structural knowledge-guided complex diffusion
model for PolSAR image classification in the Contourlet domain. Specifically,
the complex Contourlet transform is first applied to decompose the data into
low- and high-frequency subbands, enabling the extraction of statistical and
boundary features. A knowledge-guided complex diffusion network is then
designed to model the statistical properties of the low-frequency components.
During the process, structural information from high-frequency coefficients is
utilized to guide the diffusion process, improving edge preservation.
Furthermore, multiscale and multidirectional high-frequency features are
jointly learned to further boost classification accuracy. Experimental results
on three real-world PolSAR datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses
state-of-the-art methods, particularly in preserving edge details and
maintaining region homogeneity in complex terrain.

Abstract: Brain lesions are abnormalities or injuries in brain tissue that are often
detectable using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which reveals structural
changes in the affected areas. This broad definition of brain lesions includes
areas of the brain that are irreversibly damaged, as well as areas of brain
tissue that are deformed as a result of lesion growth or swelling. Despite the
importance of differentiating between damaged and deformed tissue, existing
lesion segmentation methods overlook this distinction, labeling both of them as
a single anomaly. In this work, we introduce a diffusion model-based framework
for analyzing and reversing the brain lesion process. Our pipeline first
segments abnormal regions in the brain, then estimates and reverses tissue
deformations by restoring displaced tissue to its original position, isolating
the core lesion area representing the initial damage. Finally, we inpaint the
core lesion area to arrive at an estimation of the pre-lesion healthy brain.
This proposed framework reverses a forward lesion growth process model that is
well-established in biomechanical studies that model brain lesions. Our results
demonstrate improved accuracy in lesion segmentation, characterization, and
brain labeling compared to traditional methods, offering a robust tool for
clinical and research applications in brain lesion analysis. Since pre-lesion
healthy versions of abnormal brains are not available in any public dataset for
validation of the reverse process, we simulate a forward model to synthesize
multiple lesioned brain images.

Abstract: Spacecraft pose estimation is crucial for autonomous in-space operations,
such as rendezvous, docking and on-orbit servicing. Vision-based pose
estimation methods, which typically employ RGB imaging sensors, is a compelling
solution for spacecraft pose estimation, but are challenged by harsh lighting
conditions, which produce imaging artifacts such as glare, over-exposure,
blooming and lens flare. Due to their much higher dynamic range, neuromorphic
or event sensors are more resilient to extreme lighting conditions. However,
event sensors generally have lower spatial resolution and suffer from reduced
signal-to-noise ratio during periods of low relative motion. This work
addresses these individual sensor limitations by introducing a sensor fusion
approach combining RGB and event sensors. A beam-splitter prism was employed to
achieve precise optical and temporal alignment. Then, a RANSAC-based technique
was developed to fuse the information from the RGB and event channels to
achieve pose estimation that leveraged the strengths of the two modalities. The
pipeline was complemented by dropout uncertainty estimation to detect extreme
conditions that affect either channel. To benchmark the performance of the
proposed event-RGB fusion method, we collected a comprehensive real dataset of
RGB and event data for satellite pose estimation in a laboratory setting under
a variety of challenging illumination conditions. Encouraging results on the
dataset demonstrate the efficacy of our event-RGB fusion approach and further
supports the usage of event sensors for spacecraft pose estimation. To support
community research on this topic, our dataset will be released publicly.

Conclusion: SenseShift6D将6D姿态评估从数据为中心扩展到传感器感知的鲁棒性，为自适应感知系统奠定基础。

Abstract: Recent advances on 6D object-pose estimation has achieved high performance on
representative benchmarks such as LM-O, YCB-V, and T-Less. However, these
datasets were captured under fixed illumination and camera settings, leaving
the impact of real-world variations in illumination, exposure, gain or
depth-sensor mode - and the potential of test-time sensor control to mitigate
such variations - largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce
SenseShift6D, the first RGB-D dataset that physically sweeps 13 RGB exposures,
9 RGB gains, auto-exposure, 4 depth-capture modes, and 5 illumination levels.
For three common household objects (spray, pringles, and tincase), we acquire
101.9k RGB and 10k depth images, which can provide 1,380 unique sensor-lighting
permutations per object pose. Experiments with state-of-the-art models on our
dataset show that applying sensor control during test-time induces greater
performance improvement over digital data augmentation, achieving performance
comparable to or better than costly increases in real-world training data
quantity and diversity. Adapting either RGB or depth sensors individually is
effective, while jointly adapting multimodal RGB-D configurations yields even
greater improvements. SenseShift6D extends the 6D-pose evaluation paradigm from
data-centered to sensor-aware robustness, laying a foundation for adaptive,
self-tuning perception systems capable of operating robustly in uncertain
real-world environments. Our dataset is available at:

Abstract: Generating articulated objects, such as laptops and microwaves, is a crucial
yet challenging task with extensive applications in Embodied AI and AR/VR.
Current image-to-3D methods primarily focus on surface geometry and texture,
neglecting part decomposition and articulation modeling. Meanwhile, neural
reconstruction approaches (e.g., NeRF or Gaussian Splatting) rely on dense
multi-view or interaction data, limiting their scalability. In this paper, we
introduce DreamArt, a novel framework for generating high-fidelity,
interactable articulated assets from single-view images. DreamArt employs a
three-stage pipeline: firstly, it reconstructs part-segmented and complete 3D
object meshes through a combination of image-to-3D generation, mask-prompted 3D
segmentation, and part amodal completion. Second, we fine-tune a video
diffusion model to capture part-level articulation priors, leveraging movable
part masks as prompt and amodal images to mitigate ambiguities caused by
occlusion. Finally, DreamArt optimizes the articulation motion, represented by
a dual quaternion, and conducts global texture refinement and repainting to
ensure coherent, high-quality textures across all parts. Experimental results
demonstrate that DreamArt effectively generates high-quality articulated
objects, possessing accurate part shape, high appearance fidelity, and
plausible articulation, thereby providing a scalable solution for articulated
asset generation. Our project page is available at

Conclusion: 通过3D表示进行编辑能够显著提升2D图像编辑的一致性和对象身份保持能力。

Abstract: Generative models have achieved significant progress in advancing 2D image
editing, demonstrating exceptional precision and realism. However, they often
struggle with consistency and object identity preservation due to their
inherent pixel-manipulation nature. To address this limitation, we introduce a
novel "2D-3D-2D" framework. Our approach begins by lifting 2D objects into 3D
representation, enabling edits within a physically plausible,
rigidity-constrained 3D environment. The edited 3D objects are then reprojected
and seamlessly inpainted back into the original 2D image. In contrast to
existing 2D editing methods, such as DragGAN and DragDiffusion, our method
directly manipulates objects in a 3D environment. Extensive experiments
highlight that our framework surpasses previous methods in general performance,
delivering highly consistent edits while robustly preserving object identity.

Result: 在两个公开数据集上实验表明，USIGAN在IoD和Pearson-R等临床指标上表现优异。

Conclusion: USIGAN显著提升了生成结果的病理语义一致性和临床相关性。

Abstract: Immunohistochemical (IHC) virtual staining is a task that generates virtual
IHC images from H\&E images while maintaining pathological semantic consistency
with adjacent slices. This task aims to achieve cross-domain mapping between
morphological structures and staining patterns through generative models,
providing an efficient and cost-effective solution for pathological analysis.
However, under weakly paired conditions, spatial heterogeneity between adjacent
slices presents significant challenges. This can lead to inaccurate one-to-many
mappings and generate results that are inconsistent with the pathological
semantics of adjacent slices. To address this issue, we propose a novel
unbalanced self-information feature transport for IHC virtual staining, named
USIGAN, which extracts global morphological semantics without relying on
positional correspondence.By removing weakly paired terms in the joint marginal
distribution, we effectively mitigate the impact of weak pairing on joint
distributions, thereby significantly improving the content consistency and
pathological semantic consistency of the generated results. Moreover, we design
the Unbalanced Optimal Transport Consistency (UOT-CTM) mechanism and the
Pathology Self-Correspondence (PC-SCM) mechanism to construct correlation
matrices between H\&E and generated IHC in image-level and real IHC and
generated IHC image sets in intra-group level.. Experiments conducted on two
publicly available datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior
performance across multiple clinically significant metrics, such as IoD and
Pearson-R correlation, demonstrating better clinical relevance.

Abstract: Free-viewpoint video (FVV) enables immersive 3D experiences, but efficient
compression of dynamic 3D representations remains a major challenge. Recent
advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and its dynamic extensions have
enabled high-fidelity scene modeling. However, existing methods often couple
scene reconstruction with optimization-dependent coding, which limits
generalizability. This paper presents Feedforward Compression of Dynamic
Gaussian Splatting (D-FCGS), a novel feedforward framework for compressing
temporally correlated Gaussian point cloud sequences. Our approach introduces a
Group-of-Frames (GoF) structure with I-P frame coding, where inter-frame
motions are extracted via sparse control points. The resulting motion tensors
are compressed in a feedforward manner using a dual prior-aware entropy model
that combines hyperprior and spatial-temporal priors for accurate rate
estimation. For reconstruction, we perform control-point-guided motion
compensation and employ a refinement network to enhance view-consistent
fidelity. Trained on multi-view video-derived Gaussian frames, D-FCGS
generalizes across scenes without per-scene optimization. Experiments show that
it matches the rate-distortion performance of optimization-based methods,
achieving over 40 times compression in under 2 seconds while preserving visual
quality across viewpoints. This work advances feedforward compression for
dynamic 3DGS, paving the way for scalable FVV transmission and storage in
immersive applications.

Abstract: The development of explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) methods for
scene classification problems has attracted great attention in remote sensing
(RS). Most xAI methods and the related evaluation metrics in RS are initially
developed for natural images considered in computer vision (CV), and their
direct usage in RS may not be suitable. To address this issue, in this paper,
we investigate the effectiveness of explanation methods and metrics in the
context of RS image scene classification. In detail, we methodologically and
experimentally analyze ten explanation metrics spanning five categories
(faithfulness, robustness, localization, complexity, randomization), applied to
five established feature attribution methods (Occlusion, LIME, GradCAM, LRP,
and DeepLIFT) across three RS datasets. Our methodological analysis identifies
key limitations in both explanation methods and metrics. The performance of
perturbation-based methods, such as Occlusion and LIME, heavily depends on
perturbation baselines and spatial characteristics of RS scenes. Gradient-based
approaches like GradCAM struggle when multiple labels are present in the same
image, while some relevance propagation methods (LRP) can distribute relevance
disproportionately relative to the spatial extent of classes. Analogously, we
find limitations in evaluation metrics. Faithfulness metrics share the same
problems as perturbation-based methods. Localization metrics and complexity
metrics are unreliable for classes with a large spatial extent. In contrast,
robustness metrics and randomization metrics consistently exhibit greater
stability. Our experimental results support these methodological findings.
Based on our analysis, we provide guidelines for selecting explanation methods,
metrics, and hyperparameters in the context of RS image scene classification.

an auxiliary training guide for feature learning. Though DS exhibits limited
effectiveness, benchmark evaluations demonstrate that EDC and SV significantly

Abstract: Generalizable neural surface reconstruction has become a compelling technique
to reconstruct from few images without per-scene optimization, where dense 3D
feature volume has proven effective as a global representation of scenes.
However, the dense representation does not scale well to increasing voxel
resolutions, severely limiting the reconstruction quality. We thus present a
sparse representation method, that maximizes memory efficiency and enables
significantly higher resolution reconstructions on standard hardware. We
implement this through a two-stage approach: First training a network to
predict voxel occupancies from posed images and associated depth maps, then
computing features and performing volume rendering only in voxels with
sufficiently high occupancy estimates. To support this sparse representation,
we developed custom algorithms for efficient sampling, feature aggregation, and
querying from sparse volumes-overcoming the dense-volume assumptions inherent
in existing works. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our approach
reduces storage requirements by more than 50 times without performance
degradation, enabling reconstructions at $512^3$ resolution compared to the
typical $128^3$ on similar hardware, and achieving superior reconstruction
accuracy over current state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖网格域，无法充分利用2D计算机视觉和图形的快速视觉创新，因此提出VisualSpeaker以填补这一空白。

Method: 提出一种感知唇读损失，通过预训练的视觉自动语音识别模型监督光真实感3D高斯泼溅渲染。

Result: 在MEAD数据集上，唇部顶点误差降低56.1%，同时保持网格驱动动画的可控性。

Conclusion: VisualSpeaker在3D面部动画中实现了更高的感知质量和准确性，特别适用于手语虚拟角色。

Abstract: Realistic, high-fidelity 3D facial animations are crucial for expressive
avatar systems in human-computer interaction and accessibility. Although prior
methods show promising quality, their reliance on the mesh domain limits their
ability to fully leverage the rapid visual innovations seen in 2D computer
vision and graphics. We propose VisualSpeaker, a novel method that bridges this
gap using photorealistic differentiable rendering, supervised by visual speech
recognition, for improved 3D facial animation. Our contribution is a perceptual
lip-reading loss, derived by passing photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting
avatar renders through a pre-trained Visual Automatic Speech Recognition model
during training. Evaluation on the MEAD dataset demonstrates that VisualSpeaker
improves both the standard Lip Vertex Error metric by 56.1% and the perceptual
quality of the generated animations, while retaining the controllability of
mesh-driven animation. This perceptual focus naturally supports accurate
mouthings, essential cues that disambiguate similar manual signs in sign
language avatars.

Abstract: Accurate driving behavior recognition and reasoning are critical for
autonomous driving video understanding. However, existing methods often tend to
dig out the shallow causal, fail to address spurious correlations across
modalities, and ignore the ego-vehicle level causality modeling. To overcome
these limitations, we propose a novel Multimodal Causal Analysis Model (MCAM)
that constructs latent causal structures between visual and language
modalities. Firstly, we design a multi-level feature extractor to capture
long-range dependencies. Secondly, we design a causal analysis module that
dynamically models driving scenarios using a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of
driving states. Thirdly, we utilize a vision-language transformer to align
critical visual features with their corresponding linguistic expressions.
Extensive experiments on the BDD-X, and CoVLA datasets demonstrate that MCAM
achieves SOTA performance in visual-language causal relationship learning.
Furthermore, the model exhibits superior capability in capturing causal
characteristics within video sequences, showcasing its effectiveness for
autonomous driving applications. The code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了3D表面重建的准确性和适用性。

Abstract: Recovering a 3D surface from its surface normal map, a problem known as
normal integration, is a key component for photometric shape reconstruction
techniques such as shape-from-shading and photometric stereo. The vast majority
of existing approaches for normal integration handle only implicitly the
presence of depth discontinuities and are limited to orthographic or ideal
pinhole cameras. In this paper, we propose a novel formulation that allows
modeling discontinuities explicitly and handling generic central cameras. Our
key idea is based on a local planarity assumption, that we model through
constraints between surface normals and ray directions. Compared to existing
methods, our approach more accurately approximates the relation between depth
and surface normals, achieves state-of-the-art results on the standard normal
integration benchmark, and is the first to directly handle generic central
camera models.

OmniPart uniquely decouples this complex task into two synergistic stages: (1)
an autoregressive structure planning module generates a controllable,
variable-length sequence of 3D part bounding boxes, critically guided by
flexible 2D part masks that allow for intuitive control over part decomposition
without requiring direct correspondences or semantic labels; and (2) a
spatially-conditioned rectified flow model, efficiently adapted from a

Abstract: Human motion, with its inherent complexities, such as non-rigid deformations,
articulated movements, clothing distortions, and frequent occlusions caused by
limbs or other individuals, provides a rich and challenging source of
supervision that is crucial for training robust and generalizable point
trackers. Despite the suitability of human motion, acquiring extensive training
data for point tracking remains difficult due to laborious manual annotation.
Our proposed pipeline, AnthroTAP, addresses this by proposing an automated
pipeline to generate pseudo-labeled training data, leveraging the Skinned
Multi-Person Linear (SMPL) model. We first fit the SMPL model to detected
humans in video frames, project the resulting 3D mesh vertices onto 2D image
planes to generate pseudo-trajectories, handle occlusions using ray-casting,
and filter out unreliable tracks based on optical flow consistency. A point
tracking model trained on AnthroTAP annotated dataset achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the TAP-Vid benchmark, surpassing other models trained on real

Abstract: Tumor segmentation in CT scans is key for diagnosis, surgery, and prognosis,
yet segmentation masks are scarce because their creation requires time and
expertise. Public abdominal CT datasets have from dozens to a couple thousand
tumor masks, but hospitals have hundreds of thousands of tumor CTs with
radiology reports. Thus, leveraging reports to improve segmentation is key for
scaling. In this paper, we propose a report-supervision loss (R-Super) that
converts radiology reports into voxel-wise supervision for tumor segmentation
AI. We created a dataset with 6,718 CT-Report pairs (from the UCSF Hospital),
and merged it with public CT-Mask datasets (from AbdomenAtlas 2.0). We used our
R-Super to train with these masks and reports, and strongly improved tumor
segmentation in internal and external validation--F1 Score increased by up to
16% with respect to training with masks only. By leveraging readily available
radiology reports to supplement scarce segmentation masks, R-Super strongly
improves AI performance both when very few training masks are available (e.g.,
50), and when many masks were available (e.g., 1.7K).

Conclusion: 该方法通过噪声感知设计，显著提升了LACT重建的鲁棒性和可靠性。

Abstract: Limited-Angle Computed Tomography (LACT) is a challenging inverse problem
where missing angular projections lead to incomplete sinograms and severe
artifacts in the reconstructed images. While recent learning-based methods have
demonstrated effectiveness, most of them assume ideal, noise-free measurements
and fail to address the impact of measurement noise. To overcome this
limitation, we treat LACT as a sinogram inpainting task and propose a
diffusion-based framework that completes missing angular views using a
Mean-Reverting Stochastic Differential Equation (MR-SDE) formulation. To
improve robustness under realistic noise, we propose RNSD$^+$, a novel
noise-aware rectification mechanism that explicitly models inference-time
uncertainty, enabling reliable and robust reconstruction. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method consistently surpasses baseline models in data
consistency and perceptual quality, and generalizes well across varying noise
intensity and acquisition scenarios.

Abstract: Computational pathology (CoPath) leverages histopathology images to enhance
diagnostic precision and reproducibility in clinical pathology. However,
publicly available datasets for CoPath that are annotated with extensive
histological tissue type (HTT) taxonomies at a granular level remain scarce due
to the significant expertise and high annotation costs required. Existing
datasets, such as the Atlas of Digital Pathology (ADP), address this by
offering diverse HTT annotations generalized to multiple organs, but limit the
capability for in-depth studies on specific organ diseases. Building upon this
foundation, we introduce ADPv2, a novel dataset focused on gastrointestinal
histopathology. Our dataset comprises 20,004 image patches derived from healthy
colon biopsy slides, annotated according to a hierarchical taxonomy of 32
distinct HTTs of 3 levels. Furthermore, we train a multilabel representation

We leverage the VMamba architecture and achieving a mean average precision

biomarker discovery by analyzing the model's prediction behavior on tissues

Abstract: In autonomous robotic systems, precise localization is a prerequisite for
safe navigation. However, in complex urban environments, GNSS positioning often
suffers from signal occlusion and multipath effects, leading to unreliable
absolute positioning. Traditional mapping approaches are constrained by storage
requirements and computational inefficiency, limiting their applicability to
resource-constrained robotic platforms. To address these challenges, we propose
3DGS-LSR: a large-scale relocalization framework leveraging 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS), enabling centimeter-level positioning using only a single
monocular RGB image on the client side. We combine multi-sensor data to
construct high-accuracy 3DGS maps in large outdoor scenes, while the robot-side
localization requires just a standard camera input. Using SuperPoint and
SuperGlue for feature extraction and matching, our core innovation is an
iterative optimization strategy that refines localization results through
step-by-step rendering, making it suitable for real-time autonomous navigation.
Experimental validation on the KITTI dataset demonstrates our 3DGS-LSR achieves
average positioning accuracies of 0.026m, 0.029m, and 0.081m in town roads,
boulevard roads, and traffic-dense highways respectively, significantly
outperforming other representative methods while requiring only monocular RGB
input. This approach provides autonomous robots with reliable localization

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle technology has been developed in the last decades with
recent advances in sensing and computing technology. There is an urgent need to
ensure the reliability and robustness of autonomous driving systems (ADSs).
Despite the recent achievements in testing various ADS modules, little
attention has been paid on the automated testing of traffic light detection
models in ADSs. A common practice is to manually collect and label traffic
light data. However, it is labor-intensive, and even impossible to collect
diverse data under different driving environments.
  To address these problems, we propose and implement TigAug to automatically
augment labeled traffic light images for testing traffic light detection models
in ADSs. We construct two families of metamorphic relations and three families
of transformations based on a systematic understanding of weather environments,
camera properties, and traffic light properties. We use augmented images to
detect erroneous behaviors of traffic light detection models by
transformation-specific metamorphic relations, and to improve the performance
of traffic light detection models by retraining. Large-scale experiments with
four state-of-the-art traffic light detection models and two traffic light
datasets have demonstrated that i) TigAug is effective in testing traffic light
detection models, ii) TigAug is efficient in synthesizing traffic light images,
and iii) TigAug generates traffic light images with acceptable naturalness.

Abstract: Edge computing enables data processing closer to the source, significantly
reducing latency an essential requirement for real-time vision-based analytics
such as object detection in surveillance and smart city environments. However,
these tasks place substantial demands on resource constrained edge devices,
making the joint optimization of energy consumption and detection accuracy
critical. To address this challenge, we propose ECORE, a framework that
integrates multiple dynamic routing strategies including estimation based
techniques and a greedy selection algorithm to direct image processing requests
to the most suitable edge device-model pair. ECORE dynamically balances energy
efficiency and detection performance based on object characteristics. We
evaluate our approach through extensive experiments on real-world datasets,
comparing the proposed routers against widely used baseline techniques. The
evaluation leverages established object detection models (YOLO, SSD,
EfficientDet) and diverse edge platforms, including Jetson Orin Nano, Raspberry
Pi 4 and 5, and TPU accelerators. Results demonstrate that our proposed

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning, particularly neural networks, have
significantly impacted a wide range of fields, including the automatic
enhancement of underwater images. This paper presents a deep learning-based
approach to improving underwater image quality by integrating human subjective
assessments into the training process. To this end, we utilize publicly
available datasets containing underwater images labeled by experts as either
high or low quality. Our method involves first training a classifier network to
distinguish between high- and low-quality images. Subsequently, generative
adversarial networks (GANs) are trained using various enhancement criteria to
refine the low-quality images. The performance of the GAN models is evaluated
using quantitative metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and UIQM, as well as through
qualitative analysis. Results demonstrate that the proposed model --
particularly when incorporating criteria such as color fidelity and image
sharpness -- achieves substantial improvements in both perceived and measured
image quality.

Abstract: Uniform and excessive herbicide application in modern agriculture contributes
to increased input costs, environmental pollution, and the emergence of
herbicide resistant weeds. To address these challenges, we developed a vision
guided, AI-driven variable rate sprayer system capable of detecting weed
presence, estimating canopy size, and dynamically adjusting nozzle activation
in real time. The system integrates lightweight YOLO11n and YOLO11n-seg deep
learning models, deployed on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano for onboard inference,
and uses an Arduino Uno-based relay interface to control solenoid actuated
nozzles based on canopy segmentation results. Indoor trials were conducted
using 15 potted Hibiscus rosa sinensis plants of varying canopy sizes to
simulate a range of weed patch scenarios. The YOLO11n model achieved a mean
average precision (mAP@50) of 0.98, with a precision of 0.99 and a recall close
to 1.0. The YOLO11n-seg segmentation model achieved a mAP@50 of 0.48, precision
of 0.55, and recall of 0.52. System performance was validated using water
sensitive paper, which showed an average spray coverage of 24.22% in zones
where canopy was present. An upward trend in mean spray coverage from 16.22%
for small canopies to 21.46% and 21.65% for medium and large canopies,
respectively, demonstrated the system's capability to adjust spray output based
on canopy size in real time. These results highlight the potential of combining
real time deep learning with low-cost embedded hardware for selective herbicide
application. Future work will focus on expanding the detection capabilities to
include three common weed species in South Dakota: water hemp (Amaranthus
tuberculatus), kochia (Bassia scoparia), and foxtail (Setaria spp.), followed
by further validation in both indoor and field trials within soybean and corn
production systems.

Abstract: Hyperspectral images are high-dimensional datasets consisting of hundreds of
contiguous spectral bands, enabling detailed material and surface analysis.
Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) refers to the technique of identifying
and locating anomalous targets in such data without prior information about a
hyperspectral scene or target spectrum. This technology has seen rapid
advancements in recent years, with applications in agriculture, defence,
military surveillance, and environmental monitoring. Despite this significant

various HAD techniques, categorising them into statistical models,
representation-based methods, classical machine learning approaches, and deep
learning models. We evaluated these methods across 17 benchmarking datasets
using different performance metrics, such as ROC, AUC, and separability map to

Abstract: As critical transportation infrastructure, bridges face escalating challenges
from aging and deterioration, while traditional manual inspection methods
suffer from low efficiency. Although 3D point cloud technology provides a new
data-driven paradigm, its application potential is often constrained by the
incompleteness of real-world data, which results from missing labels and
scanning occlusions. To overcome the bottleneck of insufficient generalization
in existing synthetic data methods, this paper proposes a systematic framework
for generating 3D bridge data.
  This framework can automatically generate complete point clouds featuring
component-level instance annotations, high-fidelity color, and precise normal
vectors. It can be further extended to simulate the creation of diverse and
physically realistic incomplete point clouds, designed to support the training
of segmentation and completion networks, respectively. Experiments demonstrate
that a PointNet++ model trained with our synthetic data achieves a mean
Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 84.2% in real-world bridge semantic
segmentation. Concurrently, a fine-tuned KT-Net exhibits superior performance
on the component completion task.
  This research offers an innovative methodology and a foundational dataset for
the 3D visual analysis of bridge structures, holding significant implications
for advancing the automated management and maintenance of infrastructure.

Conclusion: DFYP在作物产量预测中表现出色，具有较高的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurate remote sensing-based crop yield prediction remains a fundamental
challenging task due to complex spatial patterns, heterogeneous spectral
characteristics, and dynamic agricultural conditions. Existing methods often
suffer from limited spatial modeling capacity, weak generalization across crop
types and years. To address these challenges, we propose DFYP, a novel Dynamic
Fusion framework for crop Yield Prediction, which combines spectral channel
attention, edge-adaptive spatial modeling and a learnable fusion mechanism to
improve robustness across diverse agricultural scenarios. Specifically, DFYP
introduces three key components: (1) a Resolution-aware Channel Attention (RCA)
module that enhances spectral representation by adaptively reweighting input
channels based on resolution-specific characteristics; (2) an Adaptive Operator
Learning Network (AOL-Net) that dynamically selects operators for convolutional
kernels to improve edge-sensitive spatial feature extraction under varying crop
and temporal conditions; and (3) a dual-branch architecture with a learnable
fusion mechanism, which jointly models local spatial details and global
contextual information to support cross-resolution and cross-crop
generalization. Extensive experiments on multi-year datasets MODIS and
multi-crop dataset Sentinel-2 demonstrate that DFYP consistently outperforms
current state-of-the-art baselines in RMSE, MAE, and R2 across different
spatial resolutions, crop types, and time periods, showcasing its effectiveness
and robustness for real-world agricultural monitoring.

Result: 在KITTI和Perth数据集上分别实现了55.3%和77.4%的平面配准精度提升，以及30.5%和50.4%的高程相关性提升。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了无GNSS信号区域的点云配准精度，适用于大规模城市3D地图重建。

Abstract: Accurate geo-registration of LiDAR point clouds presents significant
challenges in GNSS signal denied urban areas with high-rise buildings and
bridges. Existing methods typically rely on real-time GNSS and IMU data, that
require pre-calibration and assume stable positioning during data collection.
However, this assumption often fails in dense urban areas, resulting in
localization errors. To address this, we propose a structured geo-registration
and spatial correction method that aligns 3D point clouds with satellite
images, enabling frame-wise recovery of GNSS information and reconstruction of
city scale 3D maps without relying on prior localization. The proposed approach
employs a pre-trained Point Transformer model to segment the road points and
then extracts the road skeleton and intersection points from the point cloud as
well as the target map for alignment. Global rigid alignment of the two is
performed using the intersection points, followed by local refinement using
radial basis function (RBF) interpolation. Elevation correction is then applied
to the point cloud based on terrain information from SRTM dataset to resolve
vertical discrepancies. The proposed method was tested on the popular KITTI
benchmark and a locally collected Perth (Western Australia) CBD dataset. On the
KITTI dataset, our method achieved an average planimetric alignment standard
deviation (STD) of 0.84~m across sequences with intersections, representing a
55.3\% improvement over the original dataset. On the Perth dataset, which lacks
GNSS information, our method achieved an average STD of 0.96~m compared to the
GPS data extracted from Google Maps API. This corresponds to a 77.4\%
improvement from the initial alignment. Our method also resulted in elevation
correlation gains of 30.5\% on the KITTI dataset and 50.4\% on the Perth
dataset.

Conclusion: 首次提出提取纯共同特征的方法，促进脑机接口技术的广泛应用。

Abstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) based on motor imagery (MI) enables direct
control of external devices by decoding the electroencephalogram (EEG)
generated in the brain during imagined movements. However, due to
inter-individual variability in brain activity, existing BCI models exhibit
poor adaptability across subjects, thereby limiting their generalizability and
widespread application. To address this issue, this paper proposes a
cross-subject BCI algorithm named Cross-Subject DD (CSDD), which constructs a
universal BCI model by extracting common features across subjects. The specific
methods include: 1) training personalized models for each subject; 2)
transforming personalized models into relation spectrums; 3) identifying common
features through statistical analysis; and 4) constructing a cross-subject
universal model based on common features. The experiments utilized the BCIC IV
2a dataset, involving nine subjects. Eight of these subjects were selected for
training and extracing the common features, and the cross-subject decoding
performance of the model was validated on the remaining subject. The results
demonstrate that, compared with existing similar methods, our approach achieves
a 3.28% improvement in performance. This paper introduces for the first time a
novel method for extracting pure common features and constructing a universal
cross-subject BCI model, thereby facilitating broader applications of BCI
technology.

Abstract: Two-factor authentication (2FA) has become widely adopted as an efficient and
secure way to validate someone's identity online. Two-factor authentication is
difficult in virtual reality (VR) because users are usually wearing a
head-mounted display (HMD) which does not allow them to see their real-world
surroundings. We present NRXR-ID, a technique to implement two-factor
authentication while using extended reality systems and smartphones. The
proposed method allows users to complete an authentication challenge using
their smartphones without removing their HMD. We performed a user study where
we explored four types of challenges for users, including a novel
checkers-style challenge. Users responded to these challenges under three
different configurations, including a technique that uses the smartphone to
support gaze-based selection without the use of VR controllers. A 4X3
within-subjects design allowed us to study all the variations proposed. We
collected performance metrics and performed user experience questionnaires to
collect subjective impressions from 30 participants. Results suggest that the
checkers-style visual matching challenge was the most appropriate option,
followed by entering a digital PIN challenge submitted via the smartphone and
answered within the VR environment.

Abstract: Ultrasound microvascular imaging (UMI) is often hindered by low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), especially in contrast-free or deep tissue
scenarios, which impairs subsequent vascular quantification and reliable
disease diagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose
Half-Angle-to-Half-Angle (HA2HA), a self-supervised denoising framework
specifically designed for UMI. HA2HA constructs training pairs from
complementary angular subsets of beamformed radio-frequency (RF) blood flow
data, across which vascular signals remain consistent while noise varies. HA2HA
was trained using in-vivo contrast-free pig kidney data and validated across
diverse datasets, including contrast-free and contrast-enhanced data from pig
kidneys, as well as human liver and kidney. An improvement exceeding 15 dB in
both contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and SNR was observed, indicating a
substantial enhancement in image quality. In addition to power Doppler imaging,
denoising directly in the RF domain is also beneficial for other downstream
processing such as color Doppler imaging (CDI). CDI results of human liver
derived from the HA2HA-denoised signals exhibited improved microvascular flow
visualization, with a suppressed noisy background. HA2HA offers a label-free,
generalizable, and clinically applicable solution for robust vascular imaging
in both contrast-free and contrast-enhanced UMI.

non-culprit vessels were included in the present analysis. The lumen borders
annotated by expert analysts in 61,655 NIRS-IVUS and 62,334 OCT frames, and the
side branches and calcific tissue identified in 10,000 NIRS-IVUS frames and
10,000 OCT frames, were used to train DL solutions for the automated extraction

OCT images and their output was used by a dynamic time warping algorithm to
co-register longitudinally the NIRS-IVUS and OCT images, while the
circumferential registration of the IVUS and OCT was optimized through dynamic
programming. On a test set of 77 vessels from 22 patients, the DL method showed
high concordance with the expert analysts for the longitudinal and
circumferential co-registration of the two imaging sets (concordance
correlation coefficient >0.99 for the longitudinal and >0.90 for the
circumferential co-registration). The Williams Index was 0.96 for longitudinal
and 0.97 for circumferential co-registration, indicating a comparable
performance to the analysts. The time needed for the DL pipeline to process
imaging data from a vessel was <90s. Conclusion: The fully automated, DL-based
framework introduced in this study for the co-registration of IVUS and OCT is
fast and provides estimations that compare favorably to the expert analysts.
These features renders it useful in research in the analysis of large-scale
data collected in studies that incorporate multimodality imaging to

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Despite the success of deep learning across various domains, it remains
vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Although many existing adversarial attack
methods achieve high success rates, they typically rely on $\ell_{p}$-norm
perturbation constraints, which do not align with human perceptual
capabilities. Consequently, researchers have shifted their focus toward
generating natural, unrestricted adversarial examples (UAEs). GAN-based
approaches suffer from inherent limitations, such as poor image quality due to
instability and mode collapse. Meanwhile, diffusion models have been employed
for UAE generation, but they still rely on iterative PGD perturbation
injection, without fully leveraging their central denoising capabilities. In
this paper, we introduce a novel approach for generating UAEs based on
diffusion models, named ScoreAdv. This method incorporates an interpretable
adversarial guidance mechanism to gradually shift the sampling distribution
towards the adversarial distribution, while using an interpretable saliency map
to inject the visual information of a reference image into the generated
samples. Notably, our method is capable of generating an unlimited number of
natural adversarial examples and can attack not only classification models but
also retrieval models. We conduct extensive experiments on ImageNet and CelebA
datasets, validating the performance of ScoreAdv across ten target models in
both black-box and white-box settings. Our results demonstrate that ScoreAdv
achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates and image quality. Furthermore,
the dynamic balance between denoising and adversarial perturbation enables
ScoreAdv to remain robust even under defensive measures.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of large language models (LLMs) across critical
domains has amplified the societal risks posed by algorithmically generated
misinformation. Unlike traditional false content, LLM-generated misinformation
can be self-reinforcing, highly plausible, and capable of rapid propagation
across multiple languages, which traditional detection methods fail to mitigate
effectively. This paper introduces a proactive defense paradigm, shifting from
passive post hoc detection to anticipatory mitigation strategies. We propose a
Three Pillars framework: (1) Knowledge Credibility, fortifying the integrity of
training and deployed data; (2) Inference Reliability, embedding
self-corrective mechanisms during reasoning; and (3) Input Robustness,
enhancing the resilience of model interfaces against adversarial attacks.
Through a comprehensive survey of existing techniques and a comparative
meta-analysis, we demonstrate that proactive defense strategies offer up to
63\% improvement over conventional methods in misinformation prevention,
despite non-trivial computational overhead and generalization challenges. We
argue that future research should focus on co-designing robust knowledge
foundations, reasoning certification, and attack-resistant interfaces to ensure
LLMs can effectively counter misinformation across varied domains.

Conclusion: SingLoRA通过简单设计解决了LoRA的稳定性问题，并在多个任务中验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has significantly advanced parameter-efficient
fine-tuning of large pretrained models. LoRA augments the pre-trained weights
of a model by adding the product of two smaller matrices that together form a
low-rank matrix update. Recent research has shown that scale disparities
between these two matrices often cause unstable training dynamics, leading to
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose SingLoRA, which reformulates
low-rank adaptation by learning the weights update as a decomposition of a
single low-rank matrix multiplied by its transpose. This simple design
inherently removes inter-matrix scale conflicts, ensuring stable optimization,
and roughly halves the parameter count. We analyze SingLoRA within the
infinite-width neural network framework, showing that it guarantees stable
feature learning by construction. Extensive experiments on multiple tasks

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Text-to-SQL任务中复杂查询生成准确SQL的挑战，利用LLM的潜力但避免其生成不可执行SQL的问题。

Method: 采用强化学习框架，基于执行正确性和格式合规性的轻量级奖励信号，直接优化SQL生成任务。

Result: 在Text2SQL和BIRD基准测试中达到最先进的执行准确率，优于更大的监督和指令调优模型。

Conclusion: RL方法在轻量级硬件上高效且可扩展，同时发布两个数据集以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Translating natural language into SQL (Text-to-SQL) remains a core challenge
at the intersection of language understanding and structured data access.
Although large language models (LLMs) have improved fluency, generating correct
and executable SQL, especially for complex queries, continues to be
challenging. We introduce CogniSQL-R1-Zero, a reinforcement learning (RL)
framework and model that produces accurate SQL using a lightweight reward
signal based on execution correctness and format-tag compliance. By avoiding
intermediate supervision, hybrid pipelines and complex reward shaping, our
method encourages stable learning and stronger alignment with the ultimate task
objective-producing executable programs. CogniSQL-R1-Zero achieves
state-of-the-art execution accuracy on Text2SQL benchmark; BIRD bench,
outperforming prior supervised and instruction-tuned baselines including SFT
CodeS-7B, DeepSeek-Coder 236B, and Mistral 123B-despite being trained on a
significantly smaller 7B backbone. This result underscores the scalability and
efficiency of our RL-based approach when trained on just four NVIDIA A100 GPUs
(40 GB VRAM each). To support further research in efficient and interpretable
Text-to-SQL modeling, we release two curated datasets: (i) a collection of
5,024 reasoning traces with varying context lengths, and (ii) a
positive-sampled corpus of 36,356 corpus of weakly supervised queries, each
annotated with six semantically diverse reasoning paths. Together, these
contributions advance scalable, execution-aligned Text-to-SQL generation.

Conclusion: 多阶段增强框架显著提升LLM在金融领域的性能。

Abstract: Advancements in reasoning for large language models (LLMs) have lead to
significant performance improvements for LLMs in various fields such as
mathematics and programming. However, research applying these advances to the
financial domain, where considerable domain-specific knowledge is necessary to
complete tasks, remains limited. To address this gap, we introduce FEVO
(Financial Evolution), a multi-stage enhancement framework developed to enhance
LLM performance in the financial domain. FEVO systemically enhances LLM
performance by using continued pre-training (CPT) to expand financial domain
knowledge, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to instill structured, elaborate
reasoning patterns, and reinforcement learning (RL) to further integrate the
expanded financial domain knowledge with the learned structured reasoning. To
ensure effective and efficient training, we leverage frontier reasoning models
and rule-based filtering to curate FEVO-Train, high-quality datasets
specifically designed for the different post-training phases. Using our
framework, we train the FEVO series of models -- C32B, S32B, R32B -- from
Qwen2.5-32B and evaluate them on seven benchmarks to assess financial and
general capabilities, with results showing that FEVO-R32B achieves
state-of-the-art performance on five financial benchmarks against much larger
models as well as specialist models. More significantly, FEVO-R32B demonstrates
markedly better performance than FEVO-R32B-0 (trained from Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct
using only RL), thus validating the effectiveness of financial domain knowledge
expansion and structured, logical reasoning distillation

Method: 开发OpenAgentSafety框架，结合规则分析和LLM评估，测试代理在350多个多轮任务中的行为。

Result: 测试显示，不同LLM在安全漏洞任务中的不安全行为比例从51.2%到72.7%。

Conclusion: OpenAgentSafety揭示了LLM在真实场景中的安全隐患，强调需加强安全保障。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI agents capable of solving complex, everyday tasks, from
scheduling to customer service, have enabled deployment in real-world settings,
but their possibilities for unsafe behavior demands rigorous evaluation. While
prior benchmarks have attempted to assess agent safety, most fall short by
relying on simulated environments, narrow task domains, or unrealistic tool
abstractions. We introduce OpenAgentSafety, a comprehensive and modular
framework for evaluating agent behavior across eight critical risk categories.
Unlike prior work, our framework evaluates agents that interact with real
tools, including web browsers, code execution environments, file systems, bash
shells, and messaging platforms; and supports over 350 multi-turn, multi-user
tasks spanning both benign and adversarial user intents. OpenAgentSafety is
designed for extensibility, allowing researchers to add tools, tasks, websites,
and adversarial strategies with minimal effort. It combines rule-based analysis
with LLM-as-judge assessments to detect both overt and subtle unsafe behaviors.
Empirical analysis of five prominent LLMs in agentic scenarios reveals unsafe
behavior in 51.2% of safety-vulnerable tasks with Claude-Sonnet-3.7, to 72.7%
with o3-mini, highlighting critical safety vulnerabilities and the need for
stronger safeguards before real-world deployment.

Motivation: 研究动机在于探索如何利用弱监督数据（如配对偏好数据）提升语言模型性能，尤其是在强监督稀缺的情况下。

Method: 方法包括提出delta学习假设，并通过实验验证，使用小规模模型生成配对数据（如3B和1.5B模型）来训练8B模型。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在11个基准测试（如MATH、MMLU）上达到了与Tulu 3相当的性能，且无需依赖强监督（如GPT-4）。

Conclusion: 结论表明，delta学习为低成本、高效的后训练提供了新思路，模型可以从通常被视为弱的数据中学习。

Abstract: Improvements in language models are often driven by improving the quality of
the data we train them on, which can be limiting when strong supervision is
scarce. In this work, we show that paired preference data consisting of
individually weak data points can enable gains beyond the strength of each
individual data point. We formulate the delta learning hypothesis to explain
this phenomenon, positing that the relative quality delta between points
suffices to drive learning via preference tuning--even when supervised
finetuning on the weak data hurts. We validate our hypothesis in controlled
experiments and at scale, where we post-train 8B models on preference data
generated by pairing a small 3B model's responses with outputs from an even
smaller 1.5B model to create a meaningful delta. Strikingly, on a standard
11-benchmark evaluation suite (MATH, MMLU, etc.), our simple recipe matches the
performance of Tulu 3, a state-of-the-art open model tuned from the same base
model while relying on much stronger supervisors (e.g., GPT-4o). Thus, delta
learning enables simpler and cheaper open recipes for state-of-the-art
post-training. To better understand delta learning, we prove in logistic
regression that the performance gap between two weak teacher models provides
useful signal for improving a stronger student. Overall, our work shows that
models can learn surprisingly well from paired data that might typically be
considered weak.

Conclusion: 定性分析揭示了复杂控制结构和反向依赖模式等关键挑战，为提升LLM的代码推理能力提供了方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted across diverse software
engineering domains, such as code generation, program repair, and vulnerability
detection. These applications require understanding beyond surface-level code
patterns: value propagation, control flow, and interdependence between program
elements. However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate end-to-end outcomes,
such as whether code is correctly repaired or generated, leaving the models
ability for program semantic reasoning underexplored. This work presents CoRe,
a high-quality, human-verified benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on
fundamental static analysis tasks. CoRe includes 12,553 task instances spanning
data dependency, control dependency, and information flow across programs
written in C/C++, Java, and Python. To ensure semantic diversity and reasoning
complexity, we propose a semantics-aware diverse sampling strategy that selects
targets and task instances based on structural coverage and dependency depth.
We evaluate 10 mainstream LLMs and show that, while they perform well at
identifying dependencies, models still struggle with tasks that require deeper
semantic understanding and multi-step reasoning. We further conduct qualitative
analyses to uncover key challenges, such as complex control structures and
backward dependency patterns, offering insights into improving LLMs code
reasoning capabilities.

compiler error explanations, derived from real introductory programming (CS1/2)
student-generated programming errors, which we used to fine-tune three
open-source models: Qwen3-4B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Qwen3-32B. We performed a dual
evaluation, combining expert human reviews with a large-scale automated
analysis of 8,000 responses using a validated LLM-as-judge ensemble. Our
results show that SFT significantly boosts the pedagogical quality of smaller
models, achieving performance comparable to much larger models. We analyse the
trade-offs between model size and quality, confirming that fine-tuning compact,
efficient models on high-quality, domain-specific data is a potent strategy for
creating specialised models to drive educational tools. We provide a replicable

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models, such as LLMs, have revolutionized
conversational AI. Chatbots are increasingly being developed by customizing
LLMs on specific conversational datasets. However, mitigating toxicity during
this customization, especially when dealing with untrusted training data,
remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce TuneShield, a
defense framework designed to mitigate toxicity during chatbot fine-tuning
while preserving conversational quality. TuneShield leverages LLM-based
toxicity classification, utilizing the instruction-following capabilities and
safety alignment of LLMs to effectively identify toxic samples, outperforming
industry API services. TuneShield generates synthetic conversation samples,
termed 'healing data', based on the identified toxic samples, using them to
mitigate toxicity while reinforcing desirable behavior during fine-tuning. It
performs an alignment process to further nudge the chatbot towards producing
desired responses. Our findings show that TuneShield effectively mitigates
toxicity injection attacks while preserving conversational quality, even when
the toxicity classifiers are imperfect or biased. TuneShield proves to be
resilient against adaptive adversarial and jailbreak attacks. Additionally,
TuneShield demonstrates effectiveness in mitigating adaptive toxicity injection
attacks during dialog-based learning (DBL).

Abstract: LLM-integrated applications and agents are vulnerable to prompt injection
attacks, in which adversaries embed malicious instructions within seemingly
benign user inputs to manipulate the LLM's intended behavior. Recent defenses
based on $\textit{known-answer detection}$ (KAD) have achieved near-perfect
performance by using an LLM to classify inputs as clean or contaminated. In
this work, we formally characterize the KAD framework and uncover a structural
vulnerability in its design that invalidates its core security premise. We
design a methodical adaptive attack, $\textit{DataFlip}$, to exploit this
fundamental weakness. It consistently evades KAD defenses with detection rates
as low as $1.5\%$ while reliably inducing malicious behavior with success rates
of up to $88\%$, without needing white-box access to the LLM or any
optimization procedures.

Abstract: Assessing the trustworthiness of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
robustness, has garnered significant attention. Recently, metamorphic testing
that defines Metamorphic Relations (MRs) has been widely applied to evaluate
the robustness of LLM executions. However, the MR-based robustness testing
still requires a scalable number of MRs, thereby necessitating the optimization
of selecting MRs. Most extant LLM testing studies are limited to automatically
generating test cases (i.e., MRs) to enhance failure detection. Additionally,
most studies only considered a limited test space of single perturbation MRs in
their evaluation of LLMs. In contrast, our paper proposes a search-based
approach for optimizing the MR groups to maximize failure detection and
minimize the LLM execution cost. Moreover, our approach covers the
combinatorial perturbations in MRs, facilitating the expansion of test space in
the robustness assessment. We have developed a search process and implemented
four search algorithms: Single-GA, NSGA-II, SPEA2, and MOEA/D with novel
encoding to solve the MR selection problem in the LLM robustness testing. We
conducted comparative experiments on the four search algorithms along with a
random search, using two major LLMs with primary Text-to-Text tasks. Our
statistical and empirical investigation revealed two key findings: (1) the
MOEA/D algorithm performed the best in optimizing the MR space for LLM
robustness testing, and (2) we identified silver bullet MRs for the LLM
robustness testing, which demonstrated dominant capabilities in confusing LLMs
across different Text-to-Text tasks. In LLM robustness assessment, our research
sheds light on the fundamental problem for optimized testing and provides
insights into search-based solutions.

Abstract: Generative AI is transforming business applications by enabling natural
language interfaces and intelligent automation. However, the underlying large
language models (LLMs) are evolving rapidly and so prompting them consistently
is a challenge. This leads to inconsistent and unpredictable application
behavior, undermining the reliability that businesses require for
mission-critical workflows. In this paper, we introduce the concept of prompt
migration as a systematic approach to stabilizing GenAI applications amid
changing LLMs. Using the Tursio enterprise search application as a case study,
we analyze the impact of successive GPT model upgrades, detail our migration
framework including prompt redesign and a migration testbed, and demonstrate
how these techniques restore application consistency. Our results show that
structured prompt migration can fully recover the application reliability that
was lost due to model drift. We conclude with practical lessons learned,
emphasizing the need for prompt lifecycle management and robust testing to
ensure dependable GenAI-powered business applications.

protection against malicious queries, but various jailbreak attack methods
reveal the vulnerability of this security mechanism. Previous studies have
isolated LLM jailbreak attacks and defenses. We analyze the security protection

Our method is based on the linearly separable property of LLM intermediate
layer embedding, as well as the essence of jailbreak attack, which aims to
embed harmful problems and transfer them to the safe area. We utilize
generative adversarial network (GAN) to learn the security judgment boundary
inside the LLM to achieve efficient jailbreak attack and defense. The
experimental results indicate that our method achieves an average jailbreak
success rate of 88.85\% across three popular LLMs, while the defense success
rate on the state-of-the-art jailbreak dataset reaches an average of 84.17\%.

Abstract: The exponential growth of social media and generative AI has transformed
information dissemination, fostering connectivity but also accelerating the
spread of misinformation. Understanding information propagation dynamics and
developing effective control strategies is essential to mitigate harmful
content. Traditional models, such as SIR, provide basic insights but
inadequately capture the complexities of online interactions. Advanced methods,
including attention mechanisms and graph neural networks, enhance accuracy but
typically overlook user psychology and behavioral dynamics. Large language
models (LLMs), with their human-like reasoning, offer new potential for
simulating psychological aspects of information spread. We introduce an
LLM-based simulation environment capturing agents' evolving attitudes,
emotions, and responses. Initial experiments, however, revealed significant
gaps between LLM-generated behaviors and authentic human dynamics, especially
in stance detection and psychological realism. A detailed evaluation through
Social Information Processing Theory identified major discrepancies in
goal-setting and feedback evaluation, stemming from the lack of emotional
processing in standard LLM training. To address these issues, we propose the
Social Information Processing-based Chain of Thought (SIP-CoT) mechanism
enhanced by emotion-guided memory. This method improves the interpretation of
social cues, personalization of goals, and evaluation of feedback. Experimental
results confirm that SIP-CoT-enhanced LLM agents more effectively process
social information, demonstrating behaviors, attitudes, and emotions closer to

Conclusion: BlueLM-2.5-3B为设备端多模态大语言模型提供了高效解决方案，并展示了数据效率的优势。

Abstract: We present BlueLM-2.5-3B, a compact and unified dense Multimodal Large
Language Model (MLLM) designed for efficient edge-device deployment, offering
strong general-purpose and reasoning capabilities. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first 3B-scale MLLM to support both thinking and
non-thinking modes, while also enabling explicit control over thinking token
budget. BlueLM-2.5-3B is developed through diversified data curation, key data
resampling, hybrid heterogeneous reinforcement learning, and a high-performance
training infrastructure. Our model achieves superior multimodal capacity while
preserving competitive pure-text performance with only 2.9 billion parameters.
We conduct comprehensive evaluations across a broad range of multimodal and
text-only benchmarks. In thinking mode, BlueLM-2.5-3B achieves comparable
performance to Qwen3-4B on text-only benchmarks, and trails the larger
Kimi-VL-A3B-16B by only about 5% on average across multimodal evaluations. In
non-thinking mode, it outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-3B on the majority of multimodal
benchmarks. Additionally, BlueLM-2.5-3B exhibits exceptional data efficiency.
All of the aforementioned performance is achieved with substantially less total
training data than Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen3-4B. We hope our work contributes to
the advancement of high-performance, on-device MLLMs and provides meaningful
insights to the research community.

Motivation: 研究如何利用LLM自主发现和利用智能合约漏洞，探索攻击与防御的经济不对称性。

Method: A1通过六个领域特定工具实现自主漏洞发现，结合LLM生成策略并验证，利用蒙特卡洛分析评估成功率。

Result: 在36个真实漏洞合约中成功率为62.96%，提取最高859万美元，蒙特卡洛分析显示成功概率为85.9%-88.8%。

Conclusion: A1在漏洞利用上表现出色，但攻击者与防御者的经济不对称性引发AI代理是否必然偏向攻击的伦理问题。

Abstract: We present A1, an agentic execution driven system that transforms any LLM
into an end-to-end exploit generator. A1 has no hand-crafted heuristics and
provides the agent with six domain-specific tools that enable autonomous
vulnerability discovery. The agent can flexibly leverage these tools to
understand smart contract behavior, generate exploit strategies, test them on
blockchain states, and refine approaches based on execution feedback. All
outputs are concretely validated to eliminate false positives.
  The evaluation across 36 real-world vulnerable contracts on Ethereum and
Binance Smart Chain demonstrates a 62.96% (17 out of 27) success rate on the
VERITE benchmark. Beyond the VERITE dataset, A1 identified 9 additional
vulnerable contracts, with 5 cases occurring after the strongest model's
training cutoff date. Across all 26 successful cases, A1 extracts up to 8.59
million USD per case and 9.33 million USD total. Through 432 experiments across
six LLMs, we analyze iteration-wise performance showing diminishing returns
with average marginal gains of +9.7%, +3.7%, +5.1%, and +2.8% for iterations
2-5 respectively, with per-experiment costs ranging $0.01-$3.59. A Monte Carlo
analysis of 19 historical attacks shows success probabilities of 85.9%-88.8%
without detection delays.
  We investigate whether an attacker or a defender benefits most from deploying
A1 as a continuous on-chain scanning system. Our model shows that OpenAI's
o3-pro maintains profitability up to a 30.0 days scanning delay at 0.100%
vulnerability incidence rates, while faster models require >=1.000% rates to
break-even. The findings exposes a troubling asymmetry: at 0.1% vulnerability
rates, attackers achieve an on-chain scanning profitability at a $6000 exploit
value, while defenders require $60000, raising fundamental questions about
whether AI agents inevitably favor exploitation over defense.

Conclusion: SASRecLLM为LLM推荐提供了模块化且有效的融合范式。

Abstract: Self-Attentive Sequential Recommendation (SASRec) effectively captures
long-term user preferences by applying attention mechanisms to historical
interactions. Concurrently, the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has
motivated research into LLM-based recommendation, which leverages their
powerful generalization and language understanding capabilities. However, LLMs
often lack the domain-specific knowledge and collaborative signals essential
for high-quality recommendations when relying solely on textual prompts. To
address this limitation, this study proposes SASRecLLM, a novel framework that
integrates SASRec as a collaborative encoder with an LLM fine-tuned using
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). The components are connected via a mapping layer to
align their dimensional spaces, and three targeted training strategies are
designed to optimize the hybrid architecture. Extensive experiments on multiple
datasets demonstrate that SASRecLLM achieves robust and consistent improvements
over strong baselines in both cold-start and warm-start scenarios. This work
advances the field of LLM-based recommendation by presenting a modular and
effective paradigm for fusing structured collaborative filtering with the
semantic power of fine-tuned LLMs. The implementation is available on GitHub:

Conclusion: 有效的AI红队测试需结合技术和社会因素，全面覆盖开发和部署过程。

Abstract: Red teaming has evolved from its origins in military applications to become a
widely adopted methodology in cybersecurity and AI. In this paper, we take a
critical look at the practice of AI red teaming. We argue that despite its
current popularity in AI governance, there exists a significant gap between red
teaming's original intent as a critical thinking exercise and its narrow focus
on discovering model-level flaws in the context of generative AI. Current AI
red teaming efforts focus predominantly on individual model vulnerabilities
while overlooking the broader sociotechnical systems and emergent behaviors
that arise from complex interactions between models, users, and environments.
To address this deficiency, we propose a comprehensive framework
operationalizing red teaming in AI systems at two levels: macro-level system
red teaming spanning the entire AI development lifecycle, and micro-level model
red teaming. Drawing on cybersecurity experience and systems theory, we further
propose a set of recommendations. In these, we emphasize that effective AI red
teaming requires multifunctional teams that examine emergent risks, systemic
vulnerabilities, and the interplay between technical and social factors.

Conclusion: 基于提示的生成技术能显著提升临床和生理预测任务的解释性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFs) offer human-centric insights into machine
learning predictions by highlighting minimal changes required to alter an
outcome. Therefore, CFs can be used as (i) interventions for abnormality
prevention and (ii) augmented data for training robust models. In this work, we
explore large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4o-mini, for generating
CFs in a zero-shot and three-shot setting. We evaluate our approach on two
datasets: the AI-Readi flagship dataset for stress prediction and a public
dataset for heart disease detection. Compared to traditional methods such as
DiCE, CFNOW, and NICE, our few-shot LLM-based approach achieves high
plausibility (up to 99%), strong validity (up to 0.99), and competitive
sparsity. Moreover, using LLM-generated CFs as augmented samples improves
downstream classifier performance (an average accuracy gain of 5%), especially
in low-data regimes. This demonstrates the potential of prompt-based generative
techniques to enhance explainability and robustness in clinical and
physiological prediction tasks. Code base: github.com/anonymous/SenseCF.

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在多个领域表现优异，但其在ROP风险预测中的应用尚未被充分探索，因此作者旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用CROP数据集，结合三种提示策略（Instruction、CoT、ICL）和情感元素，评估LLMs的预测能力和情感偏见。

Result: LLMs在仅依赖内部知识时表现有限，但结合外部知识后性能显著提升；情感偏见明显，但积极情感提示能减少偏见。

Conclusion: 情感敏感的提示工程对提升诊断可靠性至关重要，Affective-ROPTester框架可用于评估和减少临床语言模型中的情感偏见。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of large language models (LLMs) across
various domains, their capacity to predict retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)
risk remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a novel
Chinese benchmark dataset, termed CROP, comprising 993 admission records
annotated with low, medium, and high-risk labels. To systematically examine the
predictive capabilities and affective biases of LLMs in ROP risk
stratification, we propose Affective-ROPTester, an automated evaluation
framework incorporating three prompting strategies: Instruction-based,
Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and In-Context Learning (ICL). The Instruction scheme
assesses LLMs' intrinsic knowledge and associated biases, whereas the CoT and
ICL schemes leverage external medical knowledge to enhance predictive accuracy.
Crucially, we integrate emotional elements at the prompt level to investigate
how different affective framings influence the model's ability to predict ROP
and its bias patterns. Empirical results derived from the CROP dataset yield
two principal observations. First, LLMs demonstrate limited efficacy in ROP
risk prediction when operating solely on intrinsic knowledge, yet exhibit
marked performance gains when augmented with structured external inputs.
Second, affective biases are evident in the model outputs, with a consistent
inclination toward overestimating medium- and high-risk cases. Third, compared
to negative emotions, positive emotional framing contributes to mitigating
predictive bias in model outputs. These findings highlight the critical role of
affect-sensitive prompt engineering in enhancing diagnostic reliability and
emphasize the utility of Affective-ROPTester as a framework for evaluating and
mitigating affective bias in clinical language modeling systems.

Abstract: There is growing excitement about building software verifiers, synthesizers,

practice for constructing such neurosymbolic AR systems is an ad hoc
programming model that does not have the strong guarantees of traditional
symbolic algorithms, nor a deep enough synchronization of neural networks and
symbolic reasoning to unlock the full potential of LLM-powered reasoning. I
propose Neurosymbolic Transition Systems as a principled computational model
that can underlie infrastructure for building neurosymbolic AR tools. In this
model, symbolic state is paired with intuition, and state transitions operate
over symbols and intuition in parallel. I argue why this new paradigm can scale
logical reasoning beyond current capabilities while retaining the strong
guarantees of symbolic algorithms, and I sketch out how the computational model
I propose can be reified in a logic programming language.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into browser extensions has

assistance. However, these AI-powered extensions introduce unprecedented
challenges in testing and reliability assurance. Traditional browser extension
testing approaches fail to address the non-deterministic behavior,
context-sensitivity, and complex web environment integration inherent to
LLM-powered extensions. Similarly, existing LLM testing methodologies operate
in isolation from browser-specific contexts, creating a critical gap in
effective evaluation frameworks. To bridge this gap, we present ASSURE, a
modular automated testing framework specifically designed for AI-powered
browser extensions. ASSURE comprises three principal components: (1) a modular
test case generation engine that supports plugin-based extension of testing
scenarios, (2) an automated execution framework that orchestrates the complex
interactions between web content, extension processing, and AI model behavior,
and (3) a configurable validation pipeline that systematically evaluates
behavioral consistency and security invariants rather than relying on exact
output matching. Our evaluation across six widely-used AI browser extensions
demonstrates ASSURE's effectiveness, identifying 531 distinct issues spanning
security vulnerabilities, metamorphic relation violations, and content
alignment problems. ASSURE achieves 6.4x improved testing throughput compared
to manual approaches, detecting critical security vulnerabilities within 12.4
minutes on average. This efficiency makes ASSURE practical for integration into
development pipelines, offering a comprehensive solution to the unique
challenges of testing AI-powered browser extensions.

based on side-by-side comparison, and also provide detailed feedback separately
by assessing intermediate steps or specific text spans within the final report.
Furthermore, we develop Simple Deepresearch, an end-to-end agent scaffold. This
scaffold serves as a baseline that facilitates the easy integration of various

Conclusion: LLM生成的检索练习问题可有效支持学习，但需人工验证以确保质量。

Abstract: Retrieval practice is a well-established pedagogical technique known to
significantly enhance student learning and knowledge retention. However,
generating high-quality retrieval practice questions is often time-consuming
and labor intensive for instructors, especially in rapidly evolving technical
subjects. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the potential to automate this
process by generating questions in response to prompts, yet the effectiveness
of LLM-generated retrieval practice on student learning remains to be
established. In this study, we conducted an empirical study involving two
college-level data science courses, with approximately 60 students. We compared
learning outcomes during one week in which students received LLM-generated
multiple-choice retrieval practice questions to those from a week in which no
such questions were provided. Results indicate that students exposed to
LLM-generated retrieval practice achieved significantly higher knowledge
retention, with an average accuracy of 89%, compared to 73% in the week without
such practice. These findings suggest that LLM-generated retrieval questions
can effectively support student learning and may provide a scalable solution
for integrating retrieval practice into real-time teaching. However, despite
these encouraging outcomes and the potential time-saving benefits, cautions
must be taken, as the quality of LLM-generated questions can vary. Instructors
must still manually verify and revise the generated questions before releasing

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统XAI方法对非专家用户不够直观，FGNS旨在通过改进样本选择提升解释性。

Method: 提出Feature-Guided Neighbor Selection (FGNS)，结合局部和全局特征重要性选择样本。

Result: 在用户研究中，FGNS显著提升非专家识别模型错误的能力，同时保持对正确预测的认可。

Conclusion: FGNS是提升模型解释性的一步，但需进一步缩小解释质量与用户信任之间的差距。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) methods often struggle to generate clear, interpretable
outputs for users without domain expertise. We introduce Feature-Guided
Neighbor Selection (FGNS), a post hoc method that enhances interpretability by
selecting class-representative examples using both local and global feature
importance. In a user study (N = 98) evaluating Kannada script classifications,
FGNS significantly improved non-experts' ability to identify model errors while
maintaining appropriate agreement with correct predictions. Participants made
faster and more accurate decisions compared to those given traditional k-NN
explanations. Quantitative analysis shows that FGNS selects neighbors that
better reflect class characteristics rather than merely minimizing
feature-space distance, leading to more consistent selection and tighter
clustering around class prototypes. These results support FGNS as a step toward
more human-aligned model assessment, although further work is needed to address
the gap between explanation quality and perceived trust.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种对齐评分规则（ASR），通过优化最小化均方误差，使文本评分更符合人类偏好，同时保持评分规则的正确性。


<details>

Motivation: 随着语言模型的发展，文本信息获取需要更符合人类偏好的评分规则，而现有方法在保持评分规则正确性的同时未能充分满足这一需求。

Method: 设计了ASR，通过优化最小化均方误差，将评分规则与参考分数（如人类评分）对齐。

Result: 实验表明，ASR在保持评分规则正确性的同时，显著优于现有方法，更符合人类偏好。

Conclusion: ASR为文本评分提供了一种更符合人类偏好的解决方案，同时保持了评分规则的正确性。

Abstract: Scoring rules elicit probabilistic predictions from a strategic agent by
scoring the prediction against a ground truth state. A scoring rule is proper
if, from the agent's perspective, reporting the true belief maximizes the
expected score. With the development of language models, Wu and Hartline (2024)
proposes a reduction from textual information elicitation to the numerical
(i.e. probabilistic) information elicitation problem, which achieves provable
properness for textual elicitation. However, not all proper scoring rules are
well aligned with human preference over text. Our paper designs the Aligned
Scoring rule (ASR) for text by optimizing and minimizing the mean squared error
between a proper scoring rule and a reference score (e.g. human score). Our
experiments show that our ASR outperforms previous methods in aligning with
human preference while maintaining properness.

Abstract: The increasing deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and other
autonomous algorithmic systems presents the world with new systemic risks.
While focus often lies on the function of individual algorithms, a critical and
underestimated danger arises from their interactions, particularly when
algorithmic systems operate without awareness of each other, or when those
deploying them are unaware of the full algorithmic ecosystem deployment is
occurring in. These interactions can lead to unforeseen, rapidly escalating
negative outcomes - from market crashes and energy supply disruptions to
potential physical accidents and erosion of public trust - often exceeding the
human capacity for effective monitoring and the legal capacities for proper
intervention. Current governance frameworks are inadequate as they lack
visibility into this complex ecosystem of interactions. This paper outlines the
nature of this challenge and proposes some initial policy suggestions centered
on increasing transparency and accountability through phased system
registration, a licensing framework for deployment, and enhanced monitoring
capabilities.

Result: 在Java确定性数组程序的基准测试中，实验表明LLMs能够生成可行的候选WP，且通过FG可以显著提升其性能。

Conclusion: LLMs结合FG能够有效生成和改进WP，为程序验证和错误检查提供了新思路。

Abstract: The weakest precondition (WP) of a program describes the largest set of
initial states from which all terminating executions of the program satisfy a
given postcondition. The generation of WPs is an important task with practical
applications in areas ranging from verification to run-time error checking.
  This paper proposes the combination of Large Language Models (LLMs) and fuzz
testing for generating WPs. In pursuit of this goal, we introduce Fuzzing
Guidance (FG); FG acts as a means of directing LLMs towards correct WPs using
program execution feedback. FG utilises fuzz testing for approximately checking
the validity and weakness of candidate WPs, this information is then fed back
to the LLM as a means of context refinement.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a comprehensive benchmark
set of deterministic array programs in Java. Our experiments indicate that LLMs
are capable of producing viable candidate WPs, and that this ability can be
practically enhanced through FG.

Conclusion: LLMs能高效生成元数据，但需考虑任务特定标准和领域背景。

Abstract: Efficient data exploration is crucial as data becomes increasingly important
for accelerating processes, improving forecasts and developing new business
models. Data consumers often spend 25-98 % of their time searching for suitable
data due to the exponential growth, heterogeneity and distribution of data.
Data catalogs can support and accelerate data exploration by using metadata to
answer user queries. However, as metadata creation and maintenance is often a
manual process, it is time-consuming and requires expertise. This study
investigates whether LLMs can automate metadata maintenance of text-based data
and generate high-quality DCAT-compatible metadata. We tested zero-shot and
few-shot prompting strategies with LLMs from different vendors for generating
metadata such as titles and keywords, along with a fine-tuned model for
classification. Our results show that LLMs can generate metadata comparable to
human-created content, particularly on tasks that require advanced semantic
understanding. Larger models outperformed smaller ones, and fine-tuning
significantly improves classification accuracy, while few-shot prompting yields
better results in most cases. Although LLMs offer a faster and reliable way to
create metadata, a successful application requires careful consideration of
task-specific criteria and domain context.

Abstract: In July 2025, 18 academic manuscripts on the preprint website arXiv were
found to contain hidden instructions known as prompts designed to manipulate
AI-assisted peer review. Instructions such as "GIVE A POSITIVE REVIEW ONLY"
were concealed using techniques like white-colored text. Author responses
varied: one planned to withdraw the affected paper, while another defended the
practice as legitimate testing of reviewer compliance. This commentary analyzes
this practice as a novel form of research misconduct. We examine the technique
of prompt injection in large language models (LLMs), revealing four types of
hidden prompts, ranging from simple positive review commands to detailed
evaluation frameworks. The defense that prompts served as "honeypots" to detect
reviewers improperly using AI fails under examination--the consistently
self-serving nature of prompt instructions indicates intent to manipulate.
Publishers maintain inconsistent policies: Elsevier prohibits AI use in peer
review entirely, while Springer Nature permits limited use with disclosure
requirements. The incident exposes systematic vulnerabilities extending beyond
peer review to any automated system processing scholarly texts, including
plagiarism detection and citation indexing. Our analysis underscores the need
for coordinated technical screening at submission portals and harmonized
policies governing generative AI (GenAI) use in academic evaluation.

Method: 通过理论建模和实验验证，分析了N-gram水印在代码混淆攻击下的表现，并测试了多种水印方案、LLM和编程语言。

Result: 实验表明，所有水印检测器在混淆代码上的检测能力接近随机（AUROC≈0.5），且存在攻击效果显著的混淆器。

Conclusion: N-gram水印在代码混淆攻击下不鲁棒，需探索更健壮的水印方案。

Abstract: Distinguishing AI-generated code from human-written code is becoming crucial
for tasks such as authorship attribution, content tracking, and misuse
detection. Based on this, N-gram-based watermarking schemes have emerged as
prominent, which inject secret watermarks to be detected during the generation.
  However, their robustness in code content remains insufficiently evaluated.
Most claims rely solely on defenses against simple code transformations or code
optimizations as a simulation of attack, creating a questionable sense of
robustness. In contrast, more sophisticated schemes already exist in the
software engineering world, e.g., code obfuscation, which significantly alters
code while preserving functionality. Although obfuscation is commonly used to
protect intellectual property or evade software scanners, the robustness of
code watermarking techniques against such transformations remains largely
unexplored.
  In this work, we formally model the code obfuscation and prove the
impossibility of N-gram-based watermarking's robustness with only one intuitive
and experimentally verified assumption, distribution consistency, satisfied.
Given the original false positive rate of the watermarking detection, the ratio
that the detector failed on the watermarked code after obfuscation will
increase to 1 - fpr.
  The experiments have been performed on three SOTA watermarking schemes, two
LLMs, two programming languages, four code benchmarks, and four obfuscators.
Among them, all watermarking detectors show coin-flipping detection abilities
on obfuscated codes (AUROC tightly surrounds 0.5). Among all models,
watermarking schemes, and datasets, both programming languages own obfuscators
that can achieve attack effects with no detection AUROC higher than 0.6 after
the attack. Based on the theoretical and practical observations, we also
proposed a potential path of robust code watermarking.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel Differentiable Reward Optimization (DiffRO)
method aimed at enhancing the performance of neural codec language models based
text-to-speech (TTS) systems. In contrast to conventional reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) approaches applied to TTS, DiffRO directly
compute the rewards based on neural codec tokens, rather than relying on
synthesized audio. Furthermore, we employ the Gumbel-Softmax technique to
render the reward function differentiable, thereby streamlining the RLHF
training process. Additionally, we introduce a multi-task reward (MTR) model
which can provide feedback from different perspectives and find that it can
augment the system's capability to follow instructions effectively.Experimental
results indicate that DiffRO significantly improves the pronunciation accuracy
of the TTS system, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) WER results on the
seed-tts-eval benchmark. Moreover, with the integration of the MTR model, we
demonstrate the ability to control emotional and quality attributes in a
zero-shot manner.

Abstract: Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) are opening up new
opportunities in geotechnical engineering and engineering geology. While
general-purpose LLMs possess broad capabilities, effective application in
geotechnics often requires domain-specific adaptation. Such tailored LLMs are
increasingly employed to streamline geotechnical workflows. This paper presents
the first survey of the adaptation and application of LLMs in geotechnical
engineering. It outlines key methodologies for adaptation to geotechnical
domain, including prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation,
domain-adaptive pretraining, and fine-tuning. The survey examines the
state-of-the-art applications of geotechnical-adapted LLMs, including
geological interpretation, subsurface characterization, site planning, design
calculations, numerical modeling, safety and risk assessment, and educational
tutoring. It also analyzes benefits and limitations of geotechnical-adapted
LLMs, and identifies promising directions for future research in this
interdisciplinary discipline. The findings serve as a valuable resource for
practitioners seeking to integrate LLMs into geotechnical practice, while also
providing a foundation to stimulate further investigation within the academic

Abstract: Pre-timed traffic signal control, commonly used for operating signalized
intersections and coordinated arterials, requires tedious manual work for
signaling plan creating and updating. When the time-of-day or day-of-week plans
are utilized, one intersection is often associated with multiple plans, leading
to further repetitive manual plan parameter inputting. To enable a
user-friendly traffic signal control plan management process, this study
proposes Chat2SPaT, a method to convert users' semi-structured and ambiguous
descriptions on the signal control plan to exact signal phase and timing (SPaT)
results, which could further be transformed into structured stage-based or
ring-based plans to interact with intelligent transportation system (ITS)
software and traffic signal controllers. With curated prompts, Chat2SPaT first
leverages large language models' (LLMs) capability of understanding users' plan
descriptions and reformulate the plan as a combination of phase sequence and
phase attribute results in the json format. Based on LLM outputs, python
scripts are designed to locate phases in a cycle, address nuances of traffic
signal control, and finally assemble the complete traffic signal control plan.
Within a chat, the pipeline can be utilized iteratively to conduct further plan
editing. Experiments show that Chat2SPaT can generate plans with an accuracy of
over 94% for both English and Chinese cases, using a test dataset with over 300
plan descriptions. As the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capability of
understanding traffic signal control plan descriptions, Chat2SPaT provides an
easy-to-use plan management pipeline for traffic practitioners and researchers,
serving as a potential new building block for a more accurate and versatile
application of LLMs in the field of ITS. The source codes, prompts and test

the Closed Visual Question Answering (CVQA) task, where the goal is to select
the correct answer to multiple-choice clinical questions based on both
user-submitted images and accompanying symptom descriptions. The proposed
approach combines three core components: (1) fine-tuning open-source multimodal
models from the Qwen, Gemma, and LLaMA families on the competition dataset, (2)
introducing a structured reasoning layer that reconciles and adjudicates
between candidate model outputs, and (3) incorporating agentic
retrieval-augmented generation (agentic RAG), which adds relevant information
from the American Academy of Dermatology's symptom and condition database to
fill in gaps in patient context. The team achieved second place with a
submission that scored sixth, demonstrating competitive performance and high
accuracy. Beyond competitive benchmarks, this research addresses a practical
challenge in telemedicine: diagnostic decisions must often be made
asynchronously, with limited input and with high accuracy and interpretability.
By emulating the systematic reasoning patterns employed by dermatologists when
evaluating skin conditions, this architecture provided a pathway toward more
reliable automated diagnostic support systems.

Abstract: Automated depression diagnosis aims to analyze multimodal information from
interview videos to predict participants' depression scores. Previous studies
often lack clear explanations of how these scores were determined, limiting
their adoption in clinical practice. While the advent of LLMs provides a
possible pathway for explainable depression diagnosis, current LLMs capable of
processing multimodal data lack training on interview data, resulting in poor
diagnostic performance when used directly. In this paper, we propose a novel
multimodal large language model (MLlm-DR) that can understand multimodal
information inputs and supports explainable depression diagnosis. MLlm-DR
integrates a smaller LLMs and a lightweight query module (LQ-former).
Specifically, the smaller LLMs is designed to generate depression scores and
corresponding evaluation rationales. To enhance its logical reasoning for
domain-specific tasks while maintaining practicality, we constructed a robust
training dataset to fine-tune it. Meanwhile, the LQ-former captures
depression-related features from speech and visual data, aiding the model's
ability to process multimodal information, to achieve comprehensive depression
diagnosis. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on two
interview-based benchmark datasets, CMDC and E-DAIC-WOZ, demonstrating its

Abstract: Multimodal emotion and intent recognition is essential for automated
human-computer interaction, It aims to analyze users' speech, text, and visual
information to predict their emotions or intent. One of the significant
challenges is that missing modalities due to sensor malfunctions or incomplete
data. Traditional methods that attempt to reconstruct missing information often
suffer from over-coupling and imprecise generation processes, leading to
suboptimal outcomes. To address these issues, we introduce an Attention-based
Diffusion model for Missing Modalities feature Completion (ADMC). Our framework
independently trains feature extraction networks for each modality, preserving
their unique characteristics and avoiding over-coupling. The Attention-based
Diffusion Network (ADN) generates missing modality features that closely align
with authentic multimodal distribution, enhancing performance across all
missing-modality scenarios. Moreover, ADN's cross-modal generation offers
improved recognition even in full-modality contexts. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results on the IEMOCAP and MIntRec benchmarks, demonstrating
its effectiveness in both missing and complete modality scenarios.

Abstract: Background: Evaluating AI-generated treatment plans is a key challenge as AI
expands beyond diagnostics, especially with new reasoning models. This study
compares plans from human experts and two AI models (a generalist and a
reasoner), assessed by both human peers and a superior AI judge.
  Methods: Ten dermatologists, a generalist AI (GPT-4o), and a reasoning AI
(o3) generated treatment plans for five complex dermatology cases. The
anonymized, normalized plans were scored in two phases: 1) by the ten human
experts, and 2) by a superior AI judge (Gemini 2.5 Pro) using an identical
rubric.
  Results: A profound 'evaluator effect' was observed. Human experts scored
peer-generated plans significantly higher than AI plans (mean 7.62 vs. 7.16;
p=0.0313), ranking GPT-4o 6th (mean 7.38) and the reasoning model, o3, 11th
(mean 6.97). Conversely, the AI judge produced a complete inversion, scoring AI
plans significantly higher than human plans (mean 7.75 vs. 6.79; p=0.0313). It
ranked o3 1st (mean 8.20) and GPT-4o 2nd, placing all human experts lower.
  Conclusions: The perceived quality of a clinical plan is fundamentally
dependent on the evaluator's nature. An advanced reasoning AI, ranked poorly by

Motivation: 解决AI模型在临床实践中因真实世界变化（如硬件、光照或人口统计变化）导致的性能下降问题，提供可访问和可解释的工具。

Method: ModelAuditor通过多代理架构与用户对话，选择任务特定指标，模拟临床相关分布偏移，并生成解释性报告。

Result: 在三个真实临床场景中，ModelAuditor能正确识别故障模式，恢复15-25%的性能损失，优于基线模型和最新增强方法。

Conclusion: ModelAuditor提供了一种高效、低成本的方法，显著提升AI模型在临床部署中的可靠性。

Abstract: The deployment of AI models in clinical practice faces a critical challenge:
models achieving expert-level performance on benchmarks can fail
catastrophically when confronted with real-world variations in medical imaging.
Minor shifts in scanner hardware, lighting or demographics can erode accuracy,
but currently reliability auditing to identify such catastrophic failure cases
before deployment is a bespoke and time-consuming process. Practitioners lack
accessible and interpretable tools to expose and repair hidden failure modes.
Here we introduce ModelAuditor, a self-reflective agent that converses with
users, selects task-specific metrics, and simulates context-dependent,
clinically relevant distribution shifts. ModelAuditor then generates
interpretable reports explaining how much performance likely degrades during
deployment, discussing specific likely failure modes and identifying root
causes and mitigation strategies. Our comprehensive evaluation across three
real-world clinical scenarios - inter-institutional variation in
histopathology, demographic shifts in dermatology, and equipment heterogeneity
in chest radiography - demonstrates that ModelAuditor is able correctly
identify context-specific failure modes of state-of-the-art models such as the
established SIIM-ISIC melanoma classifier. Its targeted recommendations recover
15-25% of performance lost under real-world distribution shift, substantially
outperforming both baseline models and state-of-the-art augmentation methods.
These improvements are achieved through a multi-agent architecture and execute
on consumer hardware in under 10 minutes, costing less than US$0.50 per audit.

Method: 1) 测试时扩展方法：采样多个候选动作提案，利用评判模型选择最优；2) 强化学习模型：通过奖励机制提升视觉定位准确性。

Conclusion: GTA1结合测试时扩展和强化学习，显著提升了GUI代理的性能和任务成功率。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents autonomously operate across platforms
(e.g., Linux) to complete tasks by interacting with visual elements.
Specifically, a user instruction is decomposed into a sequence of action
proposals, each corresponding to an interaction with the GUI. After each
action, the agent observes the updated GUI environment to plan the next step.
However, two main challenges arise: i) resolving ambiguity in task planning
(i.e., the action proposal sequence), where selecting an appropriate plan is
non-trivial, as many valid ones may exist; ii) accurately grounding actions in
complex and high-resolution interfaces, i.e., precisely interacting with visual
targets.
  This paper investigates the two aforementioned challenges with our GUI
Test-time Scaling Agent, namely GTA1. First, to select the most appropriate
action proposal, we introduce a test-time scaling method. At each step, we
sample multiple candidate action proposals and leverage a judge model to
evaluate and select the most suitable one. It trades off computation for better
decision quality by concurrent sampling, shortening task execution steps, and
improving overall performance. Second, we propose a model that achieves
improved accuracy when grounding the selected action proposal to its
corresponding visual elements. Our key insight is that reinforcement learning
(RL) facilitates visual grounding through inherent objective alignments,
rewarding successful clicks on interface elements.
  Experimentally, our method establishes state-of-the-art performance across
diverse benchmarks. For example, GTA1-7B achieves 50.1%, 92.4%, and 67.7%
accuracies on Screenspot-Pro, Screenspot-V2, and OSWorld-G, respectively. When
paired with a planner applying our test-time scaling strategy, it exhibits
state-of-the-art agentic performance (e.g., 45.2% task success rate on
OSWorld). We open-source our code and models here.

Abstract: With the advent of Transformers, time series forecasting has seen significant
advances, yet it remains challenging due to the need for effective sequence
representation, memory construction, and accurate target projection. Time
series forecasting remains a challenging task, demanding effective sequence
representation, meaningful information extraction, and precise future
projection. Each dataset and forecasting configuration constitutes a distinct
task, each posing unique challenges the model must overcome to produce accurate
predictions. To systematically address these task-specific difficulties, this
work decomposes the time series forecasting pipeline into three core stages:
input sequence representation, information extraction and memory construction,
and final target projection. Within each stage, we investigate a range of
architectural configurations to assess the effectiveness of various modules,
such as convolutional layers for feature extraction and self-attention
mechanisms for information extraction, across diverse forecasting tasks,
including evaluations on seven benchmark datasets. Our models achieve
state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy while greatly enhancing computational
efficiency, with reduced training and inference times and a lower parameter
count. The source code is available at

Abstract: Humans can imagine various atmospheres and settings when listening to music,
envisioning movie scenes that complement each piece. For example, slow,
melancholic music might evoke scenes of heartbreak, while upbeat melodies
suggest celebration. This paper explores whether a Music Language Model, e.g.
MU-LLaMA, can perform a similar task, called Music Scene Imagination (MSI),
which requires cross-modal information from video and music to train. To
improve upon existing music captioning models which focusing solely on musical
elements, we introduce MusiScene, a music captioning model designed to imagine
scenes that complement each music. In this paper, (1) we construct a
large-scale video-audio caption dataset with 3,371 pairs, (2) we finetune Music
Understanding LLaMA for the MSI task to create MusiScene, and (3) we conduct
comprehensive evaluations and prove that our MusiScene is more capable of
generating contextually relevant captions compared to MU-LLaMA. We leverage the
generated MSI captions to enhance Video Background Music Generation (VBMG) from

Conclusion: 提出的统一基础模型在无线网络多任务预测中具有广泛适用性和高效性能。

Abstract: With the growing complexity and dynamics of the mobile communication
networks, accurately predicting key system parameters, such as channel state
information (CSI), user location, and network traffic, has become essential for
a wide range of physical (PHY)-layer and medium access control (MAC)-layer
tasks. Although traditional deep learning (DL)-based methods have been widely
applied to such prediction tasks, they often struggle to generalize across
different scenarios and tasks. In response, we propose a unified foundation
model for multi-task prediction in wireless networks that supports diverse
prediction intervals. The proposed model enforces univariate decomposition to
unify heterogeneous tasks, encodes granularity for interval awareness, and uses
a causal Transformer backbone for accurate predictions. Additionally, we
introduce a patch masking strategy during training to support arbitrary input
lengths. After trained on large-scale datasets, the proposed foundation model
demonstrates strong generalization to unseen scenarios and achieves zero-shot
performance on new tasks that surpass traditional full-shot baselines.

Result: 识别了技术、整合者角色和人机交互三方面的挑战，并提出了应对策略。

Conclusion: 整合者在AI系统集成中至关重要，需解决技术和社会技术系统的挑战。

Abstract: The integration of AI systems into the military domain is changing the way
war-related decisions are made. It binds together three disparate groups of
actors - developers, integrators, users - and creates a relationship between
these groups and the machine, embedded in the (pre-)existing organisational and
system structures. In this article, we focus on the important, but often
neglected, group of integrators within such a sociotechnical system. In complex
human-machine configurations, integrators carry responsibility for linking the
disparate groups of developers and users in the political and military system.
To act as the mediating group requires a deep understanding of the other
groups' activities, perspectives and norms. We thus ask which challenges and
shortcomings emerge from integrating AI systems into resort-to-force (RTF)
decision-making processes, and how to address them. To answer this, we proceed
in three steps. First, we conceptualise the relationship between different
groups of actors and AI systems as a sociotechnical system. Second, we identify
challenges within such systems for human-machine teaming in RTF decisions. We
focus on challenges that arise a) from the technology itself, b) from the
integrators' role in the sociotechnical system, c) from the human-machine
interaction. Third, we provide policy recommendations to address these
shortcomings when integrating AI systems into RTF decision-making structures.

Conclusion: HITL设置涉及多方技术决策，需法律更精准地分配责任，以实现伦理、法律和社会技术目标。

Abstract: The legal compliance and safety of different Human-in-the-loop (HITL) setups
for AI can vary greatly. This manuscript aims to identify new ways of choosing
between such setups, and shows that there is an unavoidable trade-off between
the attribution of legal responsibility and the technical explainability of AI.
We begin by using the notion of oracle machines from computability theory to
formalise different HITL setups, distinguishing between trivial human
monitoring, single endpoint human action, and highly involved interaction
between the human(s) and the AI. These correspond to total functions, many-one
reductions, and Turing reductions respectively. A taxonomy categorising HITL
failure modes is then presented, highlighting the limitations on what any HITL
setup can actually achieve. Our approach then identifies oversights from UK and
EU legal frameworks, which focus on certain HITL setups which may not always
achieve the desired ethical, legal, and sociotechnical outcomes. We suggest
areas where the law should recognise the effectiveness of different HITL setups
and assign responsibility in these contexts, avoiding unnecessary and
unproductive human "scapegoating". Overall, we show how HITL setups involve
many technical design decisions, and can be prone to failures which are often
out of the humans' control. This opens up a new analytic perspective on the
challenges arising in the creation of HITL setups, helping inform AI developers
and lawmakers on designing HITL to better achieve their desired outcomes.

Result: 两种方法在数据未适当转换时表现不佳，提出了未来系统的设计建议。

Conclusion: LLM在可视化代码适配中具有潜力，但需改进数据转换问题。

Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of visualization examples published on the web,
retargeting existing custom chart implementations to new datasets remains
difficult, time-intensive, and tedious. The adaptation process assumes author
familiarity with both the implementation of the example as well as how the new
dataset might need to be transformed to fit into the example code. With recent
advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), automatic adaptation of code can be
achieved from high-level user prompts, reducing the barrier for visualization
retargeting. To better understand how LLMs can assist retargeting and its
potential limitations, we characterize and evaluate the performance of LLM
assistance across multiple datasets and charts of varying complexity,
categorizing failures according to type and severity. In our evaluation, we
compare two approaches: (1) directly instructing the LLM model to fully
generate and adapt code by treating code as text inputs and (2) a more
constrained program synthesis pipeline where the LLM guides the code
construction process by providing structural information (e.g., visual
encodings) based on properties of the example code and data. We find that both
approaches struggle when new data has not been appropriately transformed, and
discuss important design recommendations for future retargeting systems.

Conclusion: 多任务LSTM模型通过共享信息和任务特定优化，有效提升了学习路径推荐的性能。

Abstract: Personalized learning is a student-centered educational approach that adapts
content, pace, and assessment to meet each learner's unique needs. As the key
technique to implement the personalized learning, learning path recommendation
sequentially recommends personalized learning items such as lectures and
exercises. Advances in deep learning, particularly deep reinforcement learning,
have made modeling such recommendations more practical and effective. This
paper proposes a multi-task LSTM model that enhances learning path
recommendation by leveraging shared information across tasks. The approach
reframes learning path recommendation as a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq)
prediction problem, generating personalized learning paths from a learner's
historical interactions. The model uses a shared LSTM layer to capture common
features for both learning path recommendation and deep knowledge tracing,
along with task-specific LSTM layers for each objective. To avoid redundant
recommendations, a non-repeat loss penalizes repeated items within the
recommended learning path. Experiments on the ASSIST09 dataset show that the
proposed model significantly outperforms baseline methods for the learning path
recommendation.

Abstract: We consider the multinomial logistic bandit problem, a variant of generalized
linear bandits where a learner interacts with an environment by selecting
actions to maximize expected rewards based on probabilistic feedback from
multiple possible outcomes. In the binary setting, recent work has focused on
understanding the impact of the non-linearity of the logistic model (Faury et
al., 2020; Abeille et al., 2021). They introduced a problem-dependent constant
$\kappa_*$, that may be exponentially large in some problem parameters and
which is captured by the derivative of the sigmoid function. It encapsulates
the non-linearity and improves existing regret guarantees over $T$ rounds from
$\smash{O(d\sqrt{T})}$ to $\smash{O(d\sqrt{T/\kappa_*})}$, where $d$ is the
dimension of the parameter space. We extend their analysis to the multinomial
logistic bandit framework, making it suitable for complex applications with
more than two choices, such as reinforcement learning or recommender systems.
To achieve this, we extend the definition of $\kappa_*$ to the multinomial
setting and propose an efficient algorithm that leverages the problem's
non-linearity. Our method yields a problem-dependent regret bound of order $
\smash{\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}( Kd \sqrt{{T}/{\kappa_*}})} $, where $K$ is the
number of actions and $\kappa_* \ge 1$. This improves upon the best existing
guarantees of order $ \smash{\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}( Kd \sqrt{T} )} $.
Moreover, we provide a $\smash{ \Omega(d\sqrt{T/\kappa_*})}$ lower-bound,
showing that our dependence on $\kappa_*$ is optimal.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose PLACE (Prompt Learning for Attributed Community

prompt-tuning in Natural Language Processing (NLP), where learnable prompt
tokens are inserted to contextualize NLP queries, PLACE integrates structural
and learnable prompt tokens into the graph as a query-dependent refinement
mechanism, forming a prompt-augmented graph. Within this prompt-augmented graph
structure, the learned prompt tokens serve as a bridge that strengthens
connections between graph nodes for the query, enabling the GNN to more
effectively identify patterns of structural cohesiveness and attribute
similarity related to the specific query. We employ an alternating training
paradigm to optimize both the prompt parameters and the GNN jointly. Moreover,
we design a divide-and-conquer strategy to enhance scalability, supporting the
model to handle million-scale graphs. Extensive experiments on 9 real-world
graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of PLACE for three types of ACS queries,
where PLACE achieves higher F1 scores by 22% compared to the state-of-the-arts
on average.

Abstract: AI agents and business automation tools interacting with external web

online is often presented as unstructured, free-form HTML documentation,
requiring external users to spend significant time manually converting it into
a structured format. To address this, we introduce OASBuilder, a novel
framework that transforms long and diverse API documentation pages into
consistent, machine-readable API specifications. This is achieved through a
carefully crafted pipeline that integrates large language models and rule-based
algorithms which are guided by domain knowledge of the structure of
documentation webpages. Our experiments demonstrate that OASBuilder generalizes
well across hundreds of APIs, and produces valid OpenAPI specifications that
encapsulate most of the information from the original documentation. OASBuilder
has been successfully implemented in an enterprise environment, saving
thousands of hours of manual effort and making hundreds of complex enterprise
APIs accessible as tools for LLMs.

Abstract: Generative diffusion models have received increasing attention in medical

diffusion models achieve high-quality image reconstruction but require a large
number of sampling steps during inference, resulting in substantial
computational overhead. Although skip-sampling strategies have been proposed to
improve efficiency, they often lead to loss of fine structural details. To
address this issue, we propose a prior information embedding and wavelet
feature fusion fast sampling diffusion model for LACT reconstruction. The PWD
enables efficient sampling while preserving reconstruction fidelity in LACT,
and effectively mitigates the degradation typically introduced by
skip-sampling. Specifically, during the training phase, PWD maps the
distribution of LACT images to that of fully sampled target images, enabling
the model to learn structural correspondences between them. During inference,
the LACT image serves as an explicit prior to guide the sampling trajectory,
allowing for high-quality reconstruction with significantly fewer steps. In
addition, PWD performs multi-scale feature fusion in the wavelet domain,
effectively enhancing the reconstruction of fine details by leveraging both
low-frequency and high-frequency information. Quantitative and qualitative
evaluations on clinical dental arch CBCT and periapical datasets demonstrate
that PWD outperforms existing methods under the same sampling condition. Using
only 50 sampling steps, PWD achieves at least 1.7 dB improvement in PSNR and
10% gain in SSIM.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-assisted education have encouraged the integration of
vision-language models (VLMs) into academic assessment, particularly for tasks
that require both quantitative and qualitative evaluation. However, existing
VLM based approaches struggle with complex educational artifacts, such as
programming tasks with executable components and measurable outputs, that
require structured reasoning and alignment with clearly defined evaluation
criteria. We introduce AGACCI, a multi-agent system that distributes
specialized evaluation roles across collaborative agents to improve accuracy,
interpretability, and consistency in code-oriented assessment. To evaluate the
framework, we collected 360 graduate-level code-based assignments from 60
participants, each annotated by domain experts with binary rubric scores and
qualitative feedback. Experimental results demonstrate that AGACCI outperforms
a single GPT-based baseline in terms of rubric and feedback accuracy,
relevance, consistency, and coherence, while preserving the instructional
intent and evaluative depth of expert assessments. Although performance varies
across task types, AGACCI highlights the potential of multi-agent systems for
scalable and context-aware educational evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据库研究和开发需要大量SQL查询进行基准测试，但获取真实SQL查询困难且现有方法缺乏定制化和满足实际约束的能力。

Method: SQLBarber结合LLM、自校正模块和贝叶斯优化器，通过自然语言输入生成定制化SQL模板，并满足目标成本分布。

Result: SQLBarber显著减少查询生成时间，并比现有方法更好地匹配目标成本分布。

Conclusion: SQLBarber是唯一能生成定制化SQL模板的系统，在效率和准确性上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Database research and development often require a large number of SQL queries
for benchmarking purposes. However, acquiring real-world SQL queries is
challenging due to privacy concerns, and existing SQL generation methods are
limited in customization and in satisfying realistic constraints. To address
this issue, we present SQLBarber, a system based on Large Language Models
(LLMs) to generate customized and realistic SQL workloads. SQLBarber (i)
eliminates the need for users to manually craft SQL templates in advance, while
providing the flexibility to accept natural language specifications to
constrain SQL templates, (ii) scales efficiently to generate large volumes of
queries matching any user-defined cost distribution (e.g., cardinality and
execution plan cost), and (iii) uses execution statistics from Amazon Redshift
and Snowflake to derive SQL template specifications and query cost
distributions that reflect real-world query characteristics. SQLBarber
introduces (i) a declarative interface for users to effortlessly generate
customized SQL templates, (ii) an LLM-powered pipeline augmented with a
self-correction module that profiles, refines, and prunes SQL templates based
on query costs, and (iii) a Bayesian Optimizer to efficiently explore different
predicate values and identify a set of queries that satisfy the target cost
distribution. We construct and open-source ten benchmarks of varying difficulty
levels and target query cost distributions based on real-world statistics from
Snowflake and Amazon Redshift. Extensive experiments on these benchmarks show
that SQLBarber is the only system that can generate customized SQL templates.
It reduces query generation time by one to three orders of magnitude, and
significantly improves alignment with the target cost distribution, compared
with existing methods.

Conclusion: 亟需开发更安全可靠的数据集审计方法以抵御对抗性攻击。

Abstract: The widespread application of Deep Learning across diverse domains hinges
critically on the quality and composition of training datasets. However, the
common lack of disclosure regarding their usage raises significant privacy and
copyright concerns. Dataset auditing techniques, which aim to determine if a
specific dataset was used to train a given suspicious model, provide promising
solutions to addressing these transparency gaps. While prior work has developed
various auditing methods, their resilience against dedicated adversarial
attacks remains largely unexplored. To bridge the gap, this paper initiates a
comprehensive study evaluating dataset auditing from an adversarial
perspective. We start with introducing a novel taxonomy, classifying existing
methods based on their reliance on internal features (IF) (inherent to the
data) versus external features (EF) (artificially introduced for auditing).
Subsequently, we formulate two primary attack types: evasion attacks, designed
to conceal the use of a dataset, and forgery attacks, intending to falsely
implicate an unused dataset. Building on the understanding of existing methods
and attack objectives, we further propose systematic attack strategies:
decoupling, removal, and detection for evasion; adversarial example-based
methods for forgery. These formulations and strategies lead to our new
benchmark, DATABench, comprising 17 evasion attacks, 5 forgery attacks, and 9
representative auditing methods. Extensive evaluations using DATABench reveal
that none of the evaluated auditing methods are sufficiently robust or
distinctive under adversarial settings. These findings underscore the urgent
need for developing a more secure and reliable dataset auditing method capable
of withstanding sophisticated adversarial manipulation. Code is available at

Conclusion: DESIGN为安全图分析提供了一个高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in
various graph-based learning tasks. However, enabling privacy-preserving GNNs
in encrypted domains, such as under Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE),
typically incurs substantial computational overhead, rendering real-time and
privacy-preserving inference impractical. In this work, we propose DESIGN
(EncrypteD GNN Inference via sErver-Side Input Graph pruNing), a novel
framework for efficient encrypted GNN inference. DESIGN tackles the critical
efficiency limitations of existing FHE GNN approaches, which often overlook
input data redundancy and apply uniform computational strategies. Our framework
achieves significant performance gains through a hierarchical optimization
strategy executed entirely on the server: first, FHE-compatible node importance
scores (based on encrypted degree statistics) are computed from the encrypted
graph. These scores then guide a homomorphic partitioning process, generating
multi-level importance masks directly under FHE. This dynamically generated
mask facilitates both input graph pruning (by logically removing unimportant
elements) and a novel adaptive polynomial activation scheme, where activation
complexity is tailored to node importance levels. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that DESIGN substantially accelerates FHE GNN inference compared to
state-of-the-art methods while maintaining competitive model accuracy,
presenting a robust solution for secure graph analytics.

Motivation: 低剂量CT（LDCT）图像质量差，现有深度学习方法忽视高层语义指导。VLM的进展为利用语言作为监督信号提供了新机会。

Method: 1. 预训练LangAE，利用冻结VLM将正常剂量CT（NDCT）映射到语义空间；2. 结合SEED（高效Mamba机制）和LangDA损失（双空间对齐）指导LDCT去噪。

Result: LangMamba在公开数据集上优于现有方法，显著提升细节保留和视觉保真度，LangAE具有强泛化性，LangDA损失增强可解释性。

Conclusion: 语言可作为监督信号推动LDCT去噪，LangMamba为语言驱动的医学图像重建提供了新思路。

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) reduces radiation exposure but often
degrades image quality, potentially compromising diagnostic accuracy. Existing
deep learning-based denoising methods focus primarily on pixel-level mappings,
overlooking the potential benefits of high-level semantic guidance. Recent
advances in vision-language models (VLMs) suggest that language can serve as a
powerful tool for capturing structured semantic information, offering new
opportunities to improve LDCT reconstruction. In this paper, we introduce
LangMamba, a Language-driven Mamba framework for LDCT denoising that leverages
VLM-derived representations to enhance supervision from normal-dose CT (NDCT).
LangMamba follows a two-stage learning strategy. First, we pre-train a
Language-guided AutoEncoder (LangAE) that leverages frozen VLMs to map NDCT
images into a semantic space enriched with anatomical information. Second, we
synergize LangAE with two key components to guide LDCT denoising:
Semantic-Enhanced Efficient Denoiser (SEED), which enhances NDCT-relevant local
semantic while capturing global features with efficient Mamba mechanism, and
Language-engaged Dual-space Alignment (LangDA) Loss, which ensures that
denoised images align with NDCT in both perceptual and semantic spaces.
Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that LangMamba
outperforms conventional state-of-the-art methods, significantly improving
detail preservation and visual fidelity. Remarkably, LangAE exhibits strong
generalizability to unseen datasets, thereby reducing training costs.
Furthermore, LangDA loss improves explainability by integrating language-guided
insights into image reconstruction and offers a plug-and-play fashion. Our
findings shed new light on the potential of language as a supervisory signal to
advance LDCT denoising. The code is publicly available on
https://github.com/hao1635/LangMamba.

Abstract: Recently, large vision-language models (LVLMs) unleash powerful analysis
capabilities for low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite Earth observation images in
the data center. However, fast satellite motion, brief satellite-ground station
(GS) contact windows, and large size of the images pose a data download
challenge. To enable near real-time Earth observation applications (e.g.,
disaster and extreme weather monitoring), we should explore how to deploy LVLM
in LEO satellite networks, and design SpaceVerse, an efficient satellite-ground
synergistic LVLM inference system. To this end, firstly, we deploy compact
LVLMs on satellites for lightweight tasks, whereas regular LVLMs operate on GSs
to handle computationally intensive tasks. Then, we propose a computing and
communication co-design framework comprised of a progressive confidence network
and an attention-based multi-scale preprocessing, used to identify on-satellite
inferring data, and reduce data redundancy before satellite-GS transmission,
separately. We implement and evaluate SpaceVerse on real-world LEO satellite

Abstract: Recent advances in song identification leverage deep neural networks to learn
compact audio fingerprints directly from raw waveforms. While these methods
perform well under controlled conditions, their accuracy drops significantly in
real-world scenarios where the audio is captured via mobile devices in noisy
environments. In this paper, we introduce a novel evaluation protocol designed
to better reflect such real-world conditions. We generate three recordings of
the same audio, each with increasing levels of noise, captured using a mobile
device's microphone. Our results reveal a substantial performance drop for two
state-of-the-art CNN-based models under this protocol, compared to previously
reported benchmarks. Additionally, we highlight the critical role of the
augmentation pipeline during training with contrastive loss. By introduction
low pass and high pass filters in the augmentation pipeline we significantly
increase the performance of both systems in our proposed evaluation.
Furthermore, we develop a transformer-based model with a tailored projection
module and demonstrate that transferring knowledge from a semantically relevant
domain yields a more robust solution. The transformer architecture outperforms
CNN-based models across all noise levels, and query durations. In low noise
conditions it achieves 47.99% for 1-sec queries, and 97% for 10-sec queries in
finding the correct song, surpassing by 14%, and by 18.5% the second-best

Abstract: Machine learning-based supervised classifiers are widely used for security
tasks, and their improvement has been largely focused on algorithmic
advancements. We argue that data challenges that negatively impact the
performance of these classifiers have received limited attention. We address
the following research question: Can developments in Generative AI (GenAI)
address these data challenges and improve classifier performance? We propose
augmenting training datasets with synthetic data generated using GenAI
techniques to improve classifier generalization. We evaluate this approach
across 7 diverse security tasks using 6 state-of-the-art GenAI methods and
introduce a novel GenAI scheme called Nimai that enables highly controlled data
synthesis. We find that GenAI techniques can significantly improve the
performance of security classifiers, achieving improvements of up to 32.6% even
in severely data-constrained settings (only ~180 training samples).
Furthermore, we demonstrate that GenAI can facilitate rapid adaptation to
concept drift post-deployment, requiring minimal labeling in the adjustment
process. Despite successes, our study finds that some GenAI schemes struggle to
initialize (train and produce data) on certain security tasks. We also identify
characteristics of specific tasks, such as noisy labels, overlapping class
distributions, and sparse feature vectors, which hinder performance boost using
GenAI. We believe that our study will drive the development of future GenAI
tools designed for security tasks.

Abstract: Creating a cast of characters by attending to their relational dynamics is a
critical aspect of most long-form storywriting. However, our formative study
(N=14) reveals that writers struggle to envision new characters that could
influence existing ones, to balance similarities and differences among
characters, and to intricately flesh out their relationships. Based on these
observations, we designed Constella, an LLM-based multi-agent tool that
supports storywriters' interconnected character creation process. Constella
suggests related characters (FRIENDS DISCOVERY feature), reveals the inner
mindscapes of several characters simultaneously (JOURNALS feature), and
manifests relationships through inter-character responses (COMMENTS feature).
Our 7-8 day deployment study with storywriters (N=11) shows that Constella
enabled the creation of expansive communities composed of related characters,
facilitated the comparison of characters' thoughts and emotions, and deepened
writers' understanding of character relationships. We conclude by discussing
how multi-agent interactions can help distribute writers' attention and effort
across the character cast.

Abstract: In the traditional understanding of the neocortex, sensory information flows
up a hierarchy of regions, with each level processing increasingly complex
features. Information also flows down the hierarchy via a different set of
connections. Although the hierarchical model has significant support, many
anatomical connections do not conform to the standard hierarchical
interpretation. In addition, hierarchically arranged regions sometimes respond
in parallel, not sequentially as would occur in a hierarchy. This and other
evidence suggests that two regions can act in parallel and hierarchically at
the same time. Given this flexibility, the word "heterarchy" might be a more
suitable term to describe neocortical organization. This paper proposes a new
interpretation of how sensory and motor information is processed in the
neocortex. The key to our proposal is what we call the "Thousand Brains
Theory", which posits that every cortical column is a sensorimotor learning
system. Columns learn by integrating sensory input over multiple movements of a
sensor. In this view, even primary and secondary regions, such as V1 and V2,
can learn and recognize complete 3D objects. This suggests that the
hierarchical connections between regions are used to learn the compositional
structure of parent objects composed of smaller child objects. We explain the
theory by examining the different types of long-range connections between
cortical regions and between the neocortex and thalamus. We describe these
connections, and then suggest the specific roles they play in the context of a
heterarchy of sensorimotor regions. We also suggest that the thalamus plays an
essential role in transforming the pose between objects and sensors. The novel
perspective we argue for here has broad implications for both neuroscience and
artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Data scaling has driven remarkable success in foundation models for Natural
Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), yet the principles of
effective data scaling in robotic manipulation remain insufficiently
understood. In this work, we investigate the nuanced role of data diversity in
robot learning by examining three critical dimensions-task (what to do),
embodiment (which robot to use), and expert (who demonstrates)-challenging the
conventional intuition of "more diverse is better". Throughout extensive
experiments on various robot platforms, we reveal that (1) task diversity
proves more critical than per-task demonstration quantity, benefiting transfer
from diverse pre-training tasks to novel downstream scenarios; (2)
multi-embodiment pre-training data is optional for cross-embodiment
transfer-models trained on high-quality single-embodiment data can efficiently
transfer to different platforms, showing more desirable scaling property during
fine-tuning than multi-embodiment pre-trained models; and (3) expert diversity,
arising from individual operational preferences and stochastic variations in
human demonstrations, can be confounding to policy learning, with velocity
multimodality emerging as a key contributing factor. Based on this insight, we
propose a distribution debiasing method to mitigate velocity ambiguity, the
yielding GO-1-Pro achieves substantial performance gains of 15%, equivalent to
using 2.5 times pre-training data. Collectively, these findings provide new
perspectives and offer practical guidance on how to scale robotic manipulation
datasets effectively.

Motivation: 前缀加法器的设计空间随位宽指数增长，现有方法在性能、泛化和可扩展性方面存在局限。

Method: 将问题分解为子任务（如骨架合成和结构优化），利用E-graph收集数据并微调LLM。

Result: PrefixAgent合成的加法器面积更小，同时在商业EDA流程中保持可扩展性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: PrefixAgent为前缀加法器优化提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Prefix adders are fundamental arithmetic circuits, but their design space
grows exponentially with bit-width, posing significant optimization challenges.
Previous works face limitations in performance, generalization, and
scalability. To address these challenges, we propose PrefixAgent, a large
language model (LLM)-powered framework that enables efficient prefix adder
optimization. Specifically, PrefixAgent reformulates the problem into subtasks
including backbone synthesis and structure refinement, which effectively
reduces the search space. More importantly, this new design perspective enables
us to efficiently collect enormous high-quality data and reasoning traces with
E-graph, which further results in an effective fine-tuning of LLM. Experimental
results show that PrefixAgent synthesizes prefix adders with consistently
smaller areas compared to baseline methods, while maintaining scalability and
generalization in commercial EDA flows.

Method: EC-Flow通过结合体现的固有运动学特性，预测体现中心流，并引入目标对齐模块，联合优化运动一致性和目标图像预测。

Conclusion: EC-Flow通过体现中心流和目标对齐模块，显著提升了机器人操作的泛化能力和实用性。

Abstract: Current language-guided robotic manipulation systems often require low-level
action-labeled datasets for imitation learning. While object-centric flow
prediction methods mitigate this issue, they remain limited to scenarios
involving rigid objects with clear displacement and minimal occlusion. In this
work, we present Embodiment-Centric Flow (EC-Flow), a framework that directly
learns manipulation from action-unlabeled videos by predicting
embodiment-centric flow. Our key insight is that incorporating the embodiment's
inherent kinematics significantly enhances generalization to versatile
manipulation scenarios, including deformable object handling, occlusions, and
non-object-displacement tasks. To connect the EC-Flow with language
instructions and object interactions, we further introduce a goal-alignment
module by jointly optimizing movement consistency and goal-image prediction.
Moreover, translating EC-Flow to executable robot actions only requires a
standard robot URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) file to specify
kinematic constraints across joints, which makes it easy to use in practice. We
validate EC-Flow on both simulation (Meta-World) and real-world tasks,
demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance in occluded object handling (62%
improvement), deformable object manipulation (45% improvement), and
non-object-displacement tasks (80% improvement) than prior state-of-the-art
object-centric flow methods. For more information, see our project website at

Abstract: This paper tackles the urgent need for efficient energy management in
healthcare facilities, where fluctuating demands challenge operational
efficiency and sustainability. Traditional methods often prove inadequate,
causing inefficiencies and higher costs. To address this, the study presents an
AI-based framework combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), genetic algorithm
(GA), and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations), specifically designed for
healthcare energy management. Although LSTM is widely used for time-series
forecasting, its application in healthcare energy prediction remains
underexplored. The results reveal that LSTM significantly outperforms ARIMA and
Prophet models in forecasting complex, non-linear demand patterns. LSTM
achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 21.69 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
of 29.96, far better than Prophet (MAE: 59.78, RMSE: 81.22) and ARIMA (MAE:
87.73, RMSE: 125.22), demonstrating superior performance. The genetic algorithm
is applied to optimize model parameters and improve load balancing strategies,
enabling adaptive responses to real-time energy fluctuations. SHAP analysis
further enhances model transparency by explaining the influence of different
features on predictions, fostering trust in decision-making processes. This
integrated LSTM-GA-SHAP approach offers a robust solution for improving
forecasting accuracy, boosting energy efficiency, and advancing sustainability
in healthcare facilities. Future research may explore real-time deployment and
hybridization with reinforcement learning for continuous optimization. Overall,
the study establishes a solid foundation for using AI in healthcare energy
management, highlighting its scalability, efficiency, and resilience potential.

Conclusion: 该框架为缺乏完整因果知识时的因果效应识别提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Identifying the effect of a treatment from observational data typically
requires assuming a fully specified causal diagram. However, such diagrams are
rarely known in practice, especially in complex or high-dimensional settings.
To overcome this limitation, recent works have explored the use of causal
abstractions-simplified representations that retain partial causal information.
In this paper, we consider causal abstractions formalized as collections of
causal diagrams, and focus on the identifiability of causal queries within such
collections. We introduce and formalize several identifiability criteria under
this setting. Our main contribution is to organize these criteria into a
structured hierarchy, highlighting their relationships. This hierarchical view
enables a clearer understanding of what can be identified under varying levels
of causal knowledge. We illustrate our framework through examples from the
literature and provide tools to reason about identifiability when full causal
knowledge is unavailable.

Result: 在COMA数据集上，3DGeoMeshNet展示了更高的重建精度。

Conclusion: 3DGeoMeshNet通过直接处理原始网格数据，显著提升了3D形状重建的准确性。

Abstract: 3D meshes are fundamental data representations for capturing complex
geometric shapes in computer vision and graphics applications. While
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have excelled in structured data like
images, extending them to irregular 3D meshes is challenging due to the
non-Euclidean nature of the data. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) offer a
solution by applying convolutions to graph-structured data, but many existing
methods rely on isotropic filters or spectral decomposition, limiting their
ability to capture both local and global mesh features. In this paper, we
introduce 3D Geometric Mesh Network (3DGeoMeshNet), a novel GCN-based framework
that uses anisotropic convolution layers to effectively learn both global and
local features directly in the spatial domain. Unlike previous approaches that
convert meshes into intermediate representations like voxel grids or point
clouds, our method preserves the original polygonal mesh format throughout the
reconstruction process, enabling more accurate shape reconstruction. Our
architecture features a multi-scale encoder-decoder structure, where separate
global and local pathways capture both large-scale geometric structures and
fine-grained local details. Extensive experiments on the COMA dataset
containing human faces demonstrate the efficiency of 3DGeoMeshNet in terms of
reconstruction accuracy.

Conclusion: DLSTM通过分解时间序列有效隔离噪声，展示了机器学习在太阳耀斑预测中的潜力。

Abstract: We investigate the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and
Decomposition-LSTM (DLSTM) networks, combined with an ensemble algorithm, to
predict solar flare occurrences using time-series data from the GOES catalog.
The dataset spans from 2003 to 2023 and includes 151,071 flare events. Among
approximately possible patterns, 7,552 yearly pattern windows are identified,
highlighting the challenge of long-term forecasting due to the Sun's complex,
self-organized criticality-driven behavior. A sliding window technique is
employed to detect temporal quasi-patterns in both irregular and regularized
flare time series. Regularization reduces complexity, enhances large flare
activity, and captures active days more effectively. To address class
imbalance, resampling methods are applied. LSTM and DLSTM models are trained on
sequences of peak fluxes and waiting times from irregular time series, while
LSTM and DLSTM, integrated with an ensemble approach, are applied to sliding
windows of regularized time series with a 3-hour interval. Performance metrics,
particularly TSS (0.74), recall (0.95) and the area under the curve (AUC=0.87)
in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC), indicate that DLSTM with an
ensemble approach on regularized time series outperforms other models, offering
more accurate large-flare forecasts with fewer false errors compared to models
trained on irregular time series. The superior performance of DLSTM is
attributed to its ability to decompose time series into trend and seasonal
components, effectively isolating random noise. This study underscores the
potential of advanced machine learning techniques for solar flare prediction
and highlights the importance of incorporating various solar cycle phases and
resampling strategies to enhance forecasting reliability.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled real-time novel
view synthesis (NVS) with impressive quality in indoor scenes. However,
achieving high-fidelity rendering requires meticulously captured images
covering the entire scene, limiting accessibility for general users. We aim to
develop a practical 3DGS-based NVS framework using simple panorama-style motion
with a handheld camera (e.g., mobile device). While convenient, this
rotation-dominant motion and narrow baseline make accurate camera pose and 3D
point estimation challenging, especially in textureless indoor scenes. To
address these challenges, we propose LighthouseGS, a novel framework inspired
by the lighthouse-like sweeping motion of panoramic views. LighthouseGS
leverages rough geometric priors, such as mobile device camera poses and
monocular depth estimation, and utilizes the planar structures often found in
indoor environments. We present a new initialization method called plane
scaffold assembly to generate consistent 3D points on these structures,
followed by a stable pruning strategy to enhance geometry and optimization
stability. Additionally, we introduce geometric and photometric corrections to
resolve inconsistencies from motion drift and auto-exposure in mobile devices.
Tested on collected real and synthetic indoor scenes, LighthouseGS delivers
photorealistic rendering, surpassing state-of-the-art methods and demonstrating
the potential for panoramic view synthesis and object placement.

Abstract: Deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained mobile devices
presents significant challenges, particularly in achieving real-time
performance while simultaneously coping with limited computational resources
and battery life. While Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) offers collaborative
inference with GPU servers as a promising solution, existing approaches
primarily rely on layer-wise model partitioning and undergo significant
transmission bottlenecks caused by the sequential execution of DNN operations.
To address this challenge, we present Intra-DP, a high-performance
collaborative inference system optimized for DNN inference on MEC. Intra DP
employs a novel parallel computing technique based on local operators (i.e.,
operators whose minimum unit input is not the entire input tensor, such as the
convolution kernel). By decomposing their computations (operations) into
several independent sub-operations and overlapping the computation and
transmission of different sub-operations through parallel execution, Intra-DP
mitigates transmission bottlenecks in MEC, achieving fast and energy-efficient
inference. The evaluation demonstrates that Intra-DP reduces per-inference
latency by up to 50% and energy consumption by up to 75% compared to
state-of-the-art baselines, without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a compelling methodology for the

additional downlink bandwidth resources to ensure timely update dissemination.
Initially, we implement this strategy within an asynchronous framework,
introducing the Asynchronous Staleness-aware Model Update (FedASMU), which
integrates both server-side and device-side methodologies. On the server side,
we present an asynchronous FL system model that employs a dynamic model
aggregation technique, which harmonizes local model updates with the global
model to enhance both accuracy and efficiency. Concurrently, on the device
side, we propose an adaptive model adjustment mechanism that integrates the
latest global model with local models during training to further elevate
accuracy. Subsequently, we extend this approach to a synchronous context,
referred to as FedSSMU. Theoretical analyses substantiate the convergence of
our proposed methodologies. Extensive experiments, encompassing six models and
five public datasets, demonstrate that FedASMU and FedSSMU significantly
surpass baseline methods in terms of both accuracy (up to 145.87%) and
efficiency (up to 97.59%).

Abstract: For securing systems, it is essential to manage their vulnerability posture
and design appropriate security controls. Vulnerability management allows to
proactively address vulnerabilities by incorporating pertinent security
controls into systems designs. Current vulnerability management approaches do
not support systematic reasoning about the vulnerability postures of systems
designs. To effectively manage vulnerabilities and design security controls, we
propose a formally grounded automated reasoning mechanism. We integrate the
mechanism into an open-source security design tool and demonstrate its
application through an illustrative example driven by real-world challenges.
The automated reasoning mechanism allows system designers to identify
vulnerabilities that are applicable to a specific system design, explicitly
specify vulnerability mitigation options, declare selected controls, and thus
systematically manage vulnerability postures.

Conclusion: 事件分区方法在保护隐私的同时，有效减少了匿名化对日志效用的负面影响。

Abstract: Information systems support the execution of business processes. The event
logs of these executions generally contain sensitive information about
customers, patients, and employees. The corresponding privacy challenges can be
addressed by anonymizing the event logs while still retaining utility for
process discovery. However, trading off utility and privacy is difficult: the
higher the complexity of event log, the higher the loss of utility by
anonymization. In this work, we propose a pipeline that combines anonymization
and event data partitioning, where event abstraction is utilized for
partitioning. By leveraging event abstraction, event logs can be segmented into
multiple parts, allowing each sub-log to be anonymized separately. This
pipeline preserves privacy while mitigating the loss of utility. To validate
our approach, we study the impact of event partitioning on two anonymization
techniques using three real-world event logs and two process discovery
techniques. Our results demonstrate that event partitioning can bring
improvements in process discovery utility for directly-follows-based
anonymization techniques.

Abstract: Automatic speech quality assessment plays a crucial role in the development
of speech synthesis systems, but existing models exhibit significant
performance variations across different granularity levels of prediction tasks.
This paper proposes an enhanced MOS prediction system based on self-supervised
learning speech models, incorporating a Mixture of Experts (MoE) classification
head and utilizing synthetic data from multiple commercial generation models
for data augmentation. Our method builds upon existing self-supervised models
such as wav2vec2, designing a specialized MoE architecture to address different
types of speech quality assessment tasks. We also collected a large-scale
synthetic speech dataset encompassing the latest text-to-speech, speech
conversion, and speech enhancement systems. However, despite the adoption of
the MoE architecture and expanded dataset, the model's performance improvements
in sentence-level prediction tasks remain limited. Our work reveals the
limitations of current methods in handling sentence-level quality assessment,
provides new technical pathways for the field of automatic speech quality
assessment, and also delves into the fundamental causes of performance
differences across different assessment granularities.

Abstract: Complex networks have become essential tools for understanding diverse
phenomena in social systems, traffic systems, biomolecular systems, and
financial systems. Identifying critical nodes is a central theme in
contemporary research, serving as a vital bridge between theoretical
foundations and practical applications. Nevertheless, the intrinsic complexity
and structural heterogeneity characterizing real-world networks, with
particular emphasis on dynamic and higher-order networks, present substantial
obstacles to the development of universal frameworks for critical node
identification. This paper provides a comprehensive review of critical node
identification techniques, categorizing them into seven main classes:
centrality, critical nodes deletion problem, influence maximization, network
control, artificial intelligence, higher-order and dynamic methods. Our review
bridges the gaps in existing surveys by systematically classifying methods
based on their methodological foundations and practical implications, and by
highlighting their strengths, limitations, and applicability across different
network types. Our work enhances the understanding of critical node research by
identifying key challenges, such as algorithmic universality, real-time
evaluation in dynamic networks, analysis of higher-order structures, and
computational efficiency in large-scale networks. The structured synthesis
consolidates current progress and highlights open questions, particularly in
modeling temporal dynamics, advancing efficient algorithms, integrating machine
learning approaches, and developing scalable and interpretable metrics for
complex systems.

Conclusion: 4通道双边控制为低成本机械臂的力反馈远程操作提供了可行方案，并在模仿学习中表现出实用价值。

Abstract: In recent years, the advancement of imitation learning has led to increased
interest in teleoperating low-cost manipulators to collect demonstration data.
However, most existing systems rely on unilateral control, which only transmits
target position values. While this approach is easy to implement and suitable
for slow, non-contact tasks, it struggles with fast or contact-rich operations
due to the absence of force feedback. This work demonstrates that fast
teleoperation with force feedback is feasible even with force-sensorless,
low-cost manipulators by leveraging 4-channel bilateral control. Based on
accurately identified manipulator dynamics, our method integrates nonlinear
terms compensation, velocity and external force estimation, and variable gain
corresponding to inertial variation. Furthermore, using data collected by
4-channel bilateral control, we show that incorporating force information into
both the input and output of learned policies improves performance in imitation
learning. These results highlight the practical effectiveness of our system for
high-fidelity teleoperation and data collection on affordable hardware.

Conclusion: 论文为Lockean信念集的逻辑闭合和最小修订提供了理论支持和方法。

Abstract: Within the formal setting of the Lockean thesis, an agent belief set is
defined in terms of degrees of confidence and these are described in
probabilistic terms. This approach is of established interest, notwithstanding
some limitations that make its use troublesome in some contexts, like, for
instance, in belief change theory. Precisely, Lockean belief sets are not
generally closed under (classical) logical deduction. The aim of the present
paper is twofold: on one side we provide two characterizations of those belief
sets that are closed under classical logic deduction, and on the other we
propose an approach to probabilistic update that allows us for a minimal
revision of those beliefs, i.e., a revision obtained by making the fewest
possible changes to the existing belief set while still accommodating the new
information. In particular, we show how we can deductively close a belief set
via a minimal revision.

Motivation: CBCT图像通常存在伪影和视觉质量低的问题，而合成CT（sCT）生成是一种潜在解决方案。然而，CBCT和CT数据之间的不对齐限制了多模态学习的有效性。

Method: 引入了一个端到端可学习的配准模块，结合CBCT和CT数据进行多模态学习，并在合成数据集和真实临床数据集上验证。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在79/90的评估场景中优于基线方法，尤其在CBCT质量低且CT数据中度不对齐时效果显著。

Conclusion: 多模态学习结合配准模块能显著提升sCT生成质量。

Abstract: Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is widely used for intraoperative
imaging due to its rapid acquisition and low radiation dose. However, CBCT
images typically suffer from artifacts and lower visual quality compared to
conventional Computed Tomography (CT). A promising solution is synthetic CT
(sCT) generation, where CBCT volumes are translated into the CT domain. In this
work, we enhance sCT generation through multimodal learning by jointly
leveraging intraoperative CBCT and preoperative CT data. To overcome the
inherent misalignment between modalities, we introduce an end-to-end learnable
registration module within the sCT pipeline. This model is evaluated on a
controlled synthetic dataset, allowing precise manipulation of data quality and
alignment parameters. Further, we validate its robustness and generalizability
on two real-world clinical datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
integrating registration in multimodal sCT generation improves sCT quality,
outperforming baseline multimodal methods in 79 out of 90 evaluation settings.
Notably, the improvement is most significant in cases where CBCT quality is low
and the preoperative CT is moderately misaligned.

Conclusion: GATMesh提供了一种高效且准确的时钟网格分析方法。

Abstract: Clock meshes are essential in high-performance VLSI systems for minimizing
skew and handling PVT variations, but analyzing them is difficult due to
reconvergent paths, multi-source driving, and input mesh buffer skew. SPICE
simulations are accurate but slow; yet simplified models miss key effects like
slew and input skew. We propose GATMesh, a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based
framework that models the clock mesh as a graph with augmented structural and
physical features. Trained on SPICE data, GATMesh achieves high accuracy with
average delay error of 5.27ps on unseen benchmarks, while achieving speed-ups

Conclusion: Dijkstra算法适用于静态地形导航，为动态路径规划研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle navigation in unstructured environments, such as forests
and mountainous regions, presents significant challenges due to irregular
terrain and complex road conditions. This work provides a comparative
evaluation of mainstream and well-established path planning algorithms applied
to weighted pixel-level road networks derived from high-resolution satellite
imagery and airborne LiDAR data. For 2D road-map navigation, where the weights
reflect road conditions and terrain difficulty, A*, Dijkstra, RRT*, and a Novel
Improved Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm (NIACO) are tested on the DeepGlobe
satellite dataset. For 3D road-map path planning, 3D A*, 3D Dijkstra,
RRT-Connect, and NIACO are evaluated using the Hamilton airborne LiDAR dataset,
which provides detailed elevation information. All algorithms are assessed
under identical start and end point conditions, focusing on path cost,
computation time, and memory consumption. Results demonstrate that Dijkstra
consistently offers the most stable and efficient performance in both 2D and 3D
scenarios, particularly when operating on dense, pixel-level geospatial
road-maps. These findings highlight the reliability of Dijkstra-based planning
for static terrain navigation and establish a foundation for future research on
dynamic path planning under complex environmental constraints.

Abstract: A novel algorithm is presented for the estimation of collision probabilities

adaptive sigma-point sampling scheme, which ultimately produces a fast, simple
algorithm capable of estimating the collision probability with a median error
of 3.5%, and a median runtime of 0.21ms, when measured on an Intel Xeon Gold
6226R Processor. Importantly, the algorithm explicitly accounts for the
collision probability's temporal dependence, which is often neglected in prior
work and otherwise leads to an overestimation of the collision probability.
Finally, the method is tested on a diverse set of relevant real-world
scenarios, consisting of 400 6-second snippets of autonomous vehicle logs,
where the accuracy and latency is rigorously evaluated.

Conclusion: OLG++为法律知识表示提供了更强大的工具，尤其在复杂法律推理中表现优异。

Abstract: We present OLG++, a semantic extension of the Obligation Logic Graph (OLG)
for modeling regulatory and legal rules in municipal and interjurisdictional
contexts. OLG++ introduces richer node and edge types, including spatial,
temporal, party group, defeasibility, and logical grouping constructs, enabling
nuanced representations of legal obligations, exceptions, and hierarchies. The
model supports structured reasoning over rules with contextual conditions,
precedence, and complex triggers. We demonstrate its expressiveness through
examples from food business regulations, showing how OLG++ supports legal
question answering using property graph queries. OLG++ also improves over
LegalRuleML by providing native support for subClassOf, spatial constraints,

Conclusion: TLJD通过司法数据显著提升了FDI预测的准确性，为地方政府提供了更可靠的决策支持。

Abstract: To advance the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal on promoting
sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, foreign direct
investment (FDI) plays a crucial role in catalyzing economic expansion and
fostering innovation. Precise city-level FDI prediction is quite important for
local government and is commonly studied based on economic data (e.g., GDP).
However, such economic data could be prone to manipulation, making predictions
less reliable. To address this issue, we try to leverage large-scale judicial
data which reflects judicial performance influencing local investment security
and returns, for city-level FDI prediction. Based on this, we first build an
index system for the evaluation of judicial performance over twelve million
publicly available adjudication documents according to which a tabular dataset
is reformulated. We then propose a new Tabular Learning method on Judicial Data
(TLJD) for city-level FDI prediction. TLJD integrates row data and column data
in our built tabular dataset for judicial performance indicator encoding, and
utilizes a mixture of experts model to adjust the weights of different
indicators considering regional variations. To validate the effectiveness of
TLJD, we design cross-city and cross-time tasks for city-level FDI predictions.
Extensive experiments on both tasks demonstrate the superiority of TLJD (reach
to at least 0.92 R2) over the other ten state-of-the-art baselines in different
evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Real-time monitoring of the state of health (SoH) of batteries remains a
major challenge, particularly in microgrids where operational constraints limit
the use of traditional methods. As part of the 4BLife project, we propose an
innovative method based on the analysis of a discharge pulse at the end of the
charge phase. The parameters of the equivalent electrical model describing the
voltage evolution across the battery terminals during this current pulse are
then used to estimate the SoH. Based on the experimental data acquired so far,
the initial results demonstrate the relevance of the proposed approach. After
training using the parameters of two batteries with a capacity degradation of
around 85%, we successfully predicted the degradation of two other batteries,
cycled down to approximately 90% SoH, with a mean absolute error of around 1%
in the worst case, and an explainability score of the estimator close to 0.9.
If these performances are confirmed, this method can be easily integrated into
battery management systems (BMS) and paves the way for optimized battery
management under continuous operation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of tasks, yet they also exhibit memorization of their training
data. This phenomenon raises critical questions about model behavior, privacy
risks, and the boundary between learning and memorization. Addressing these
concerns, this paper synthesizes recent studies and investigates the landscape
of memorization, the factors influencing it, and methods for its detection and
mitigation. We explore key drivers, including training data duplication,
training dynamics, and fine-tuning procedures that influence data memorization.
In addition, we examine methodologies such as prefix-based extraction,
membership inference, and adversarial prompting, assessing their effectiveness
in detecting and measuring memorized content. Beyond technical analysis, we
also explore the broader implications of memorization, including the legal and
ethical implications. Finally, we discuss mitigation strategies, including data
cleaning, differential privacy, and post-training unlearning, while
highlighting open challenges in balancing the minimization of harmful
memorization with utility. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the
current state of research on LLM memorization across technical, privacy, and
performance dimensions, identifying critical directions for future work.

Result: HEPO在标准基准测试中表现优异，即使启发式奖励设计不佳也能取得良好效果。

Conclusion: HEPO为强化学习中启发式奖励的有效利用提供了新思路，显著减少人工设计负担。

Abstract: In many reinforcement learning (RL) applications, augmenting the task rewards
with heuristic rewards that encode human priors about how a task should be
solved is crucial for achieving desirable performance. However, because such
heuristics are usually not optimal, much human effort and computational
resources are wasted in carefully balancing tasks and heuristic rewards.
Theoretically rigorous ways of incorporating heuristics rely on the idea of
\textit{policy invariance}, which guarantees that the performance of a policy
obtained by maximizing heuristic rewards is the same as the optimal policy with
respect to the task reward. However, in practice, policy invariance doesn't
result in policy improvement, and such methods are known to empirically perform
poorly. We propose a new paradigm to mitigate reward hacking and effectively
use heuristics based on the practical goal of maximizing policy improvement
instead of policy improvement. Our framework, Heuristic Enhanced Policy
Optimization (HEPO), effectively leverages heuristics while avoiding the
pitfall of prior methods for mitigating reward hacking. HEPO achieves superior
performance on standard benchmarks with well-engineered reward functions. More
surprisingly, HEPO allows policy optimization to achieve good performance even
when heuristics are not well-engineered and designed by non-expert humans,
showcasing HEPO's ability to reduce human effort in reward design. % HEPO is a
plug-and-play optimization method for leveraging heuristics in reinforcement
learning. Code is available at https://github.com/Improbable-AI/hepo.

Conclusion: RFT是持续后训练的稳健范式，并提出改进RFT稳定性的算法。

Abstract: Continual post-training (CPT) is a popular and effective technique for
adapting foundation models like multimodal large language models to specific
and ever-evolving downstream tasks. While existing research has primarily
concentrated on methods like data replay, model expansion, or parameter
regularization, the fundamental role of the learning paradigm within CPT
remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a comparative analysis of two
core post-training paradigms: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT), investigating their respective impacts on knowledge
retention during CPT. Our experiments are conducted on a benchmark comprising
seven diverse multimodal tasks, utilizing Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct as the base
model for continual post-training. The investigation yields two significant
findings: (1) When continuously learning on downstream tasks, SFT leads to
catastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks. In contrast, RFT
inherently preserves prior knowledge and achieve performance comparable to
multi-task training. (2) RFT successfully protects and even enhances the
model's general knowledge on standard benchmarks (e.g., MMMU and MMLU-Pro).
Conversely, SFT degrades general model capabilities severely. Further analysis
shows that explicit mechanisms, such as KL penalty and chain-of-thought
reasoning, are not the primary factors. Instead, we find that the implicit
regularization inherent to RFT is a key factor in mitigating forgetting.
Finally, we propose a rollout-based instance filtering algorithm to improve the
stability and efficiency of RFT. Our comprehensive study demonstrates the
superiority of RFT as a robust paradigm for continual post-training.

Abstract: Reward hacking in Reinforcement Learning (RL) systems poses a critical threat
to the deployment of autonomous agents, where agents exploit flaws in reward
functions to achieve high scores without fulfilling intended objectives.
Despite growing awareness of this problem, systematic detection and mitigation
approaches remain limited. This paper presents a large-scale empirical study of
reward hacking across diverse RL environments and algorithms. We analyze 15,247
training episodes across 15 RL environments (Atari, MuJoCo, custom domains) and
5 algorithms (PPO, SAC, DQN, A3C, Rainbow), implementing automated detection
algorithms for six categories of reward hacking: specification gaming, reward
tampering, proxy optimization, objective misalignment, exploitation patterns,
and wireheading. Our detection framework achieves 78.4% precision and 81.7%
recall across environments, with computational overhead under 5%. Through
controlled experiments varying reward function properties, we demonstrate that
reward density and alignment with true objectives significantly impact hacking
frequency ($p < 0.001$, Cohen's $d = 1.24$). We validate our approach through
three simulated application studies representing recommendation systems,
competitive gaming, and robotic control scenarios. Our mitigation techniques
reduce hacking frequency by up to 54.6% in controlled scenarios, though we find
these trade-offs are more challenging in practice due to concept drift, false
positive costs, and adversarial adaptation. All detection algorithms, datasets,
and experimental protocols are publicly available to support reproducible
research in RL safety.

Abstract: While concept-based interpretability methods have traditionally focused on
local explanations of neural network predictions, we propose a novel framework
and interactive tool that extends these methods into the domain of mechanistic
interpretability. Our approach enables a global dissection of model behavior by
analyzing how high-level semantic attributes (referred to as concepts) emerge,
interact, and propagate through internal model components. Unlike prior work
that isolates individual neurons or predictions, our framework systematically
quantifies how semantic concepts are represented across layers, revealing
latent circuits and information flow that underlie model decision-making. A key
innovation is our visualization platform that we named BAGEL (for Bias Analysis
with a Graph for global Explanation Layers), which presents these insights in a
structured knowledge graph, allowing users to explore concept-class
relationships, identify spurious correlations, and enhance model
trustworthiness. Our framework is model-agnostic, scalable, and contributes to
a deeper understanding of how deep learning models generalize (or fail to) in
the presence of dataset biases. The demonstration is available at

Abstract: Structured State Space models (SSM) have recently emerged as a new class of
deep learning models, particularly well-suited for processing long sequences.
Their constant memory footprint, in contrast to the linearly scaling memory
demands of Transformers, makes them attractive candidates for deployment on
resource-constrained edge-computing devices. While recent works have explored
the effect of quantization-aware training (QAT) on SSMs, they typically do not
address its implications for specialized edge hardware, for example, analog
in-memory computing (AIMC) chips. In this work, we demonstrate that QAT can
significantly reduce the complexity of SSMs by up to two orders of magnitude
across various performance metrics. We analyze the relation between model size
and numerical precision, and show that QAT enhances robustness to analog noise
and enables structural pruning. Finally, we integrate these techniques to
deploy SSMs on a memristive analog in-memory computing substrate and highlight
the resulting benefits in terms of computational efficiency.

Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在推理过程中常出现过度思考（overthinking）现象，导致冗余推理步骤和效率低下。研究旨在探索如何让模型自主评估其推理轨迹的正确性，而无需外部标签。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试（GSM8K、MATH-500、AIME）中，CoRE-Eval将推理链长度减少13.7%至33.2%，同时提升答案准确性约10%，在AIME基准上达到70.0%的准确率。

Conclusion: CoRE方法通过无标签自评估显著提升了大型推理模型的效率和准确性，为减少冗余推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
domains like mathematics and program synthesis. Despite their strong
performance, LRMs often exhibit overthinking -- excessive and redundant
reasoning steps that introduce inefficiencies during inference. This phenomenon
raises an important question for LRM self-evaluation: How can a model
autonomously assess the correctness of its own reasoning trajectory without
external labels? To address this, we propose Chain-of-Reasoning Embedding
(CoRE), a series of hidden states in latent space to enable label-free
self-evaluation on intermediate reasoning steps of LRMs, so as to enhance
metacognition abilities for improved reasoning efficiency. By analyzing the
geometric properties of the CoRE trajectories, we reveal that redundant
reasoning usually presents cyclical fluctuations, which correspond to
repetitive and unconscious reflection/exploration. Leveraging this insight, we
further introduce a training-free, label-free self-evaluation framework,
CoRE-Eval, to detect such patterns and dynamically determine whether to
terminate reasoning early. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning
benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME) and across model sizes from 7B to 32B
demonstrate that CoRE-Eval reduces chain-of-thought length by 13.7% to 33.2%
while improving answer accuracy by around 10%, achieving 70.0% accuracy on the
challenging AIME benchmark with the 32B model.

Conclusion: 研究证明了差分设计在Mamba中的适用性，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Sequence models like Transformers and RNNs often overallocate attention to
irrelevant context, leading to noisy intermediate representations. This
degrades LLM capabilities by promoting hallucinations, weakening long-range and
retrieval abilities, and reducing robustness. Recent work has shown that
differential design can mitigate this issue in Transformers, improving their
effectiveness across various applications. In this paper, we explore whether
these techniques, originally developed for Transformers, can be applied to
Mamba, a recent architecture based on selective state-space layers that
achieves Transformer-level performance with greater efficiency. We show that a
naive adaptation of differential design to Mamba is insufficient and requires
careful architectural modifications. To address this, we introduce a novel
differential mechanism for Mamba, empirically validated on language modeling
benchmarks, demonstrating improved retrieval capabilities and superior
performance over vanilla Mamba. Finally, we conduct extensive ablation studies
and empirical analyses to justify our design choices and provide evidence that
our approach effectively mitigates the overallocation problem in Mamba-based
models. Our code is publicly available.

Result: 理论分析和实验表明，SBoN能有效缓解奖励过优化问题，尤其在代理奖励模型质量较低时表现更优。

Conclusion: SBoN是一种简单有效的改进方法，特别适用于代理奖励模型质量不高的情况。

Abstract: A simple yet effective method for inference-time alignment of generative
models is Best-of-$N$ (BoN), where $N$ outcomes are sampled from a reference
policy, evaluated using a proxy reward model, and the highest-scoring one is
selected. While prior work argues that BoN is almost optimal in reward vs KL
tradeoffs, the effectiveness of BoN depends critically on the quality of the
proxy reward model used for selection. For this purpose, we study BoN through a
smooth version known as Soft Best-of-N (SBoN) and develop a theoretical
framework to address this gap. We analyze the scaling behaviour of BoN by
providing bounds on the KL divergence between the SBoN policy and the reference
policy, offering insights into how performance varies with the number of
samples. We also study the regret gap, i.e., the gap between the expected true
reward under the optimal policy and the SBoN policy. Our theoretical and
empirical findings show that smoothing helps SBoN mitigate reward
overoptimization, especially when the quality of the proxy reward is low.

Abstract: Although most transformer-based time series forecasting models primarily
depend on endogenous inputs, recent state-of-the-art approaches have
significantly improved performance by incorporating external information
through exogenous inputs. However, these methods face challenges, such as
redundancy when endogenous and exogenous inputs originate from the same source
and limited ability to capture long-term dependencies due to fixed look-back
windows. In this paper, we propose a method that whitens the exogenous input to
reduce redundancy that may persist within the data based on global statistics.
Additionally, our approach helps the exogenous input to be more aware of
patterns and trends over extended periods. By introducing this refined,
globally context-aware exogenous input to the endogenous input without
increasing the lookback window length, our approach guides the model towards
improved forecasting. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in
four benchmark datasets, consistently outperforming 11 baseline models. These
results establish our method as a robust and effective alternative for using
exogenous inputs in time series forecasting.

Abstract: Delayed and sparse rewards present a fundamental obstacle for
reinforcement-learning (RL) agents, which struggle to assign credit for actions
whose benefits emerge many steps later. The sliding-tile game 2048 epitomizes
this challenge: although frequent small score changes yield immediate feedback,
they often mislead agents into locally optimal but globally suboptimal
strategies. In this work, we introduce a unified, distributional multi-step RL
framework designed to directly optimize long-horizon performance. Using the
open source Gym-2048 environment we develop and compare four agent variants:
standard DQN, PPO, QR-DQN (Quantile Regression DQN), and a novel Horizon-DQN
(H-DQN) that integrates distributional learning, dueling architectures, noisy
networks, prioritized replay, and more. Empirical evaluation reveals a clear
hierarchy in effectiveness: max episode scores improve from 3.988K (DQN) to
5.756K (PPO), 8.66K (QR-DQN), and 18.21K (H-DQN), with H-DQN reaching the 2048
tile. Upon scaling H-DQN it reaches a max score 41.828K and a 4096 tile. These
results demonstrate that distributional, multi-step targets substantially
enhance performance in sparse-reward domains, and they suggest promising
avenues for further gains through model-based planning and curriculum learning.

Abstract: Zero-shot reinforcement learning is necessary for extracting optimal policies
in absence of concrete rewards for fast adaptation to future problem settings.
Forward-backward representations (FB) have emerged as a promising method for
learning optimal policies in absence of rewards via a factorization of the
policy occupancy measure. However, up until now, FB and many similar zero-shot
reinforcement learning algorithms have been decoupled from the exploration
problem, generally relying on other exploration algorithms for data collection.
We argue that FB representations should fundamentally be used for exploration
in order to learn more efficiently. With this goal in mind, we design
exploration policies that arise naturally from the FB representation that
minimize the posterior variance of the FB representation, hence minimizing its
epistemic uncertainty. We empirically demonstrate that such principled
exploration strategies improve sample complexity of the FB algorithm
considerably in comparison to other exploration methods. Code is publicly

TL;DR: InterpoLated Learning (InterpoLL) mitigates shortcut reliance in models by interpolating representations of majority and minority examples, improving generalization without compromising majority accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Empirical risk minimization (ERM) models exploit spurious correlations (shortcuts), hindering generalization on minority examples. Existing methods are model-specific and inefficient.

Method: InterpoLL interpolates representations of majority examples with minority features to weaken shortcut influence, enabling better generalization.

Result: InterpoLL outperforms ERM and state-of-the-art methods in minority generalization across various architectures, maintaining majority accuracy.

Conclusion: InterpoLL is a broadly applicable, effective method for mitigating shortcuts and improving model generalization.

Abstract: Empirical risk minimization (ERM) incentivizes models to exploit shortcuts,
i.e., spurious correlations between input attributes and labels that are
prevalent in the majority of the training data but unrelated to the task at
hand. This reliance hinders generalization on minority examples, where such
correlations do not hold. Existing shortcut mitigation approaches are
model-specific, difficult to tune, computationally expensive, and fail to
improve learned representations. To address these issues, we propose
InterpoLated Learning (InterpoLL) which interpolates the representations of
majority examples to include features from intra-class minority examples with
shortcut-mitigating patterns. This weakens shortcut influence, enabling models
to acquire features predictive across both minority and majority examples.
Experimental results on multiple natural language understanding tasks
demonstrate that InterpoLL improves minority generalization over both ERM and
state-of-the-art shortcut mitigation methods, without compromising accuracy on
majority examples. Notably, these gains persist across encoder,
encoder-decoder, and decoder-only architectures, demonstrating the method's
broad applicability.

Conclusion: Soup-Adapter是一种有效的方法，能够同时解决超参数调优和模型鲁棒性问题，适用于CLIP和DINOv2等基础模型。

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle two fundamental problems in few-shot domain
adaptation of foundation models. First, hyperparameter tuning is often
impractical due to the lack of large validation datasets. Second, model
robustness under distribution shifts where test time data deviates slightly
from training distributions, remains a concern. We show that by training
multiple independent adapters and averaging their outputs, the new model has a
higher performance and is more robust to distribution shifts compared to any
individual adapter. This improvement holds even when the adapters are trained
with diverse hyperparameters sampled from a wide range, resulting in varied
individual performance. Consequently, our method addresses both of the problems
described above. The ensemble is also significantly less sensitive to the
residual ratio, a critical hyperparameter of CLIP-Adapter. Since the ensemble
can be reparameterized to a single adapter again using a principled
concatenation of the parameters, we refer to our method as Soup-Adapter. This
is also the first study to explore CLIP adapter-style techniques for DINOv2 and
to directly compare them with CLIP in this setting.

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) policies in real-world involves
significant challenges, including distribution shifts, safety concerns, and the
impracticality of direct interactions during policy refinement. Existing
methods, such as domain randomization (DR) and off-dynamics RL, enhance policy
robustness by direct interaction with the target domain, an inherently unsafe
practice. We propose Uncertainty-Aware RL (UARL), a novel framework that
prioritizes safety during training by addressing Out-Of-Distribution (OOD)
detection and policy adaptation without requiring direct interactions in target
domain. UARL employs an ensemble of critics to quantify policy uncertainty and
incorporates progressive environmental randomization to prepare the policy for
diverse real-world conditions. By iteratively refining over high-uncertainty
regions of the state space in simulated environments, UARL enhances robust
generalization to the target domain without explicitly training on it. We
evaluate UARL on MuJoCo benchmarks and a quadrupedal robot, demonstrating its
effectiveness in reliable OOD detection, improved performance, and enhanced
sample efficiency compared to baselines.

Abstract: Foundation models for structured time series data must contend with a
fundamental challenge: observations often conflate the true underlying physical
phenomena with systematic distortions introduced by measurement instruments.
This entanglement limits model generalization, especially in heterogeneous or
multi-instrument settings. We present a causally-motivated foundation model
that explicitly disentangles physical and instrumental factors using a
dual-encoder architecture trained with structured contrastive learning.
Leveraging naturally occurring observational triplets (i.e., where the same
target is measured under varying conditions, and distinct targets are measured
under shared conditions) our model learns separate latent representations for
the underlying physical signal and instrument effects. Evaluated on simulated
astronomical time series designed to resemble the complexity of variable stars
observed by missions like NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS),
our method significantly outperforms traditional single-latent space foundation
models on downstream prediction tasks, particularly in low-data regimes. These
results demonstrate that our model supports key capabilities of foundation

highlight the importance of encoding causal structure into representation

Abstract: We design and implement AXLearn, a production deep learning system that
facilitates scalable and high-performance training of large deep learning
models. Compared to other state-of-the-art deep learning systems, AXLearn has a
unique focus on modularity and support for heterogeneous hardware
infrastructure. AXLearn's internal interfaces between software components
follow strict encapsulation, allowing different components to be assembled to
facilitate rapid model development and experimentation on heterogeneous compute
infrastructure. We introduce a novel method of quantifying modularity via
Lines-of-Code (LoC)-complexity, which demonstrates how our system maintains
constant complexity as we scale the components in the system, compared to
linear or quadratic complexity in other systems. This allows integrating
features such as Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) into AXLearn across hundred
of modules with just 10 lines of code, compared to hundreds as required in
other systems. At the same time, AXLearn maintains equivalent performance
compared to state-of-the-art training systems. Finally, we share our experience
in the development and operation of AXLearn.

Conclusion: Multitask Preplay是一种可扩展的理论，能显著提升AI在多任务环境中的性能。

Abstract: Humans can pursue a near-infinite variety of tasks, but typically can only
pursue a small number at the same time. We hypothesize that humans leverage
experience on one task to preemptively learn solutions to other tasks that were
accessible but not pursued. We formalize this idea as Multitask Preplay, a
novel algorithm that replays experience on one task as the starting point for
"preplay" -- counterfactual simulation of an accessible but unpursued task.
Preplay is used to learn a predictive representation that can support fast,
adaptive task performance later on. We first show that, compared to traditional
planning and predictive representation methods, multitask preplay better
predicts how humans generalize to tasks that were accessible but not pursued in
a small grid-world, even when people didn't know they would need to generalize
to these tasks. We then show these predictions generalize to Craftax, a
partially observable 2D Minecraft environment. Finally, we show that Multitask
Preplay enables artificial agents to learn behaviors that transfer to novel
Craftax worlds sharing task co-occurrence structure. These findings demonstrate
that Multitask Preplay is a scalable theory of how humans counterfactually
learn and generalize across multiple tasks; endowing artificial agents with the
same capacity can significantly improve their performance in challenging
multitask environments.

Conclusion: PAFDG为领域泛化和公平性提供了统一的解决方案，并在实验中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) and algorithmic fairness are two critical
challenges in machine learning. However, most DG methods focus only on
minimizing expected risk in the unseen target domain without considering
algorithmic fairness. Conversely, fairness methods typically do not account for
domain shifts, so the fairness achieved during training may not generalize to
unseen test domains. In this work, we bridge these gaps by studying the problem
of Fair Domain Generalization (FairDG), which aims to minimize both expected
risk and fairness violations in unseen target domains. We derive novel mutual
information-based upper bounds for expected risk and fairness violations in
multi-class classification tasks with multi-group sensitive attributes. These
bounds provide key insights for algorithm design from an information-theoretic
perspective. Guided by these insights, we introduce PAFDG (Pareto-Optimal
Fairness for Domain Generalization), a practical framework that solves the
FairDG problem and models the utility-fairness trade-off through Pareto
optimization. Experiments on real-world vision and language datasets show that
PAFDG achieves superior utility-fairness trade-offs compared to existing
methods.

Conclusion: 通过整合序列变异，DNA语言模型能更好地捕捉生物功能，但当前评估基准仍需扩展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained on text demonstrated remarkable results
on natural language processing (NLP) tasks. These models have been adapted to
decipher the language of DNA, where sequences of nucleotides act as "words"
that encode genomic functions. However, the genome differs fundamentally from
natural language, as it lacks clearly defined words or a consistent grammar.
Although DNA language models (DNALMs) such as DNABERT, GENA-LM have achieved
high level of performance on genome-related biological tasks, these models do
not encode biological functions in the presence of sequence variations. To
address this problem, we pre-train foundation models that effectively integrate
sequence variations, in particular Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), as
they underlie important biological functions. Specifically, we use ModernBERT
to pre-train two different Biomedical Foundation Models (BMFM), namely,
BMFM-DNA-REF in which the model is trained with sequences of varying lengths
along with their reverse complements derived from the reference genome and
BMFM-DNA-SNP in which the model is trained with sequences created using a novel
representation scheme that encodes sequence variations. Our findings indicate
that integrating sequence variations into DNALMs helps capture the biological
functions as seen in improvements on all fine-tuning tasks. To explore the
model's practical utility, we experimented with various strategies for SNP
imputation on promoter detection task introduced in DNABERT-2. However, we
acknowledge that the current benchmarks are limited in their ability to fully
evaluate these models. To enable more comprehensive assessment in the future
and encourage community contributions, we release our models through

Conclusion: XAI驱动的压缩方法高效且对精度影响小，适用于资源受限场景。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in many
tasks but it often comes at a high computational cost and memory usage.
Compression techniques, such as pruning and quantization, are applied to reduce
the memory footprint of DNNs and make it possible to accommodate them on
resource-constrained edge devices. Recently, explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) methods have been introduced with the purpose of
understanding and explaining AI methods. XAI can be utilized to get to know the
inner functioning of DNNs, such as the importance of different neurons and
features in the overall performance of DNNs. In this paper, a novel DNN
compression approach using XAI is proposed to efficiently reduce the DNN model
size with negligible accuracy loss. In the proposed approach, the importance
score of DNN parameters (i.e. weights) are computed using a gradient-based XAI
technique called Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP). Then, the scores are
used to compress the DNN as follows: 1) the parameters with the negative or
zero importance scores are pruned and removed from the model, 2)
mixed-precision quantization is applied to quantize the weights with
higher/lower score with higher/lower number of bits. The experimental results
show that, the proposed compression approach reduces the model size by 64%
while the accuracy is improved by 42% compared to the state-of-the-art
XAI-based compression method.

NeVe, a dynamic training approach that adjusts the learning rate and defines
the stop criterion based on the novel notion of "neural velocity". The neural
velocity measures the rate of change of each neuron's transfer function and is
an indicator of model convergence: sampling neural velocity can be performed
even by forwarding noise in the network, reducing the need for a held-out
dataset. Our findings show the potential of neural velocity as a key metric for

Abstract: We consider the problem of learning robust discriminative representations of
causally-related latent variables. In addition to observational data, the
training dataset also includes interventional data obtained through targeted
interventions on some of these latent variables to learn representations robust
against the resulting interventional distribution shifts. Existing approaches
treat interventional data like observational data, even when the underlying
causal model is known, and ignore the independence relations that arise from
these interventions. Since these approaches do not fully exploit the causal
relational information resulting from interventions, they learn representations
that produce large disparities in predictive performance on observational and
interventional data, which worsens when the number of interventional training
samples is limited. In this paper, (1) we first identify a strong correlation
between this performance disparity and adherence of the representations to the
independence conditions induced by the interventional causal model. (2) For
linear models, we derive sufficient conditions on the proportion of
interventional data in the training dataset, for which enforcing interventional
independence between representations corresponding to the intervened node and
its non-descendants lowers the error on interventional data. Combining these
insights, (3) we propose RepLIn, a training algorithm to explicitly enforce
this statistical independence during interventions. We demonstrate the utility
of RepLIn on a synthetic dataset and on real image and text datasets on facial
attribute classification and toxicity detection, respectively. Our experiments
show that RepLIn is scalable with the number of nodes in the causal graph and
is suitable to improve the robust representations against interventional
distribution shifts of both continuous and discrete latent variables.

Burgers' equation. The results show that our spectral Transformer can achieve
highly accurate long term predictions even with limited training data, better
than traditional numerical methods and machine learning methods in forecasting

Conclusion: FACT为理解神经网络的特征学习提供了理论工具，FACT-RFM展示了其实际应用潜力。

Abstract: A central challenge in deep learning theory is to understand how neural
networks learn and represent features. To this end, we prove the Features at
Convergence Theorem (FACT), which gives a self-consistency equation that neural
network weights satisfy at convergence when trained with nonzero weight decay.
For each weight matrix $W$, this equation relates the "feature matrix" $W^\top
W$ to the set of input vectors passed into the matrix during forward
propagation and the loss gradients passed through it during backpropagation. We
validate this relation empirically, showing that neural features indeed satisfy
the FACT at convergence. Furthermore, by modifying the "Recursive Feature
Machines" of Radhakrishnan et al. 2024 so that they obey the FACT, we arrive at
a new learning algorithm, FACT-RFM. FACT-RFM achieves high performance on
tabular data and captures various feature learning behaviors that occur in
neural network training, including grokking in modular arithmetic and phase
transitions in learning sparse parities.

Abstract: The integration of Federated Learning (FL) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)

privacy. However, efficient federated training of these complex MoE-structured

managing the interplay between heterogeneous client resources and the
sophisticated coordination required for numerous specialized experts. This
article highlights a critical, yet underexplored concept: the absence of robust
quantitative strategies for dynamic client-expert alignment that holistically
considers varying client capacities and the imperative for system-wise load
balancing. Specifically, we propose a conceptual system design for intelligent
client-expert alignment that incorporates dynamic fitness scoring, global
expert load monitoring, and client capacity profiling. By tackling these
systemic issues, we can unlock more scalable, efficient, and robust training
mechanisms {with fewer communication rounds for convergence}, paving the way
for the widespread deployment of large-scale federated MoE-structured LAMs in

Abstract: Kernel development in deep learning requires optimizing computational units
across hardware while balancing memory management, parallelism, and
hardware-specific optimizations through extensive empirical tuning. Although
domain-specific languages like Triton simplify GPU programming by abstracting
low-level details, developers must still manually tune critical parameters such
as tile sizes and memory access patterns through iterative experimentation,
creating substantial barriers to optimal performance and wider adoption. In
this work, we introduce AutoTriton, the first model dedicated to Triton
programming powered by reinforcement learning (RL). AutoTriton performs
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to be equipped with essential Triton programming
expertise using a high-quality data gathering pipeline, and conducts RL with
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, combining a rule-based
reward and an execution-based reward to further improve Triton programming
ability, sequentially. Experiments across five evaluation channels of
TritonBench and KernelBench illustrate that our 8B model AutoTriton achieves
performance comparable to mainstream large models, including Claude-4-Sonnet
and DeepSeek-R1-0528. Further experimental analysis demonstrates the crucial
role of each module within AutoTriton, including the SFT stage, the RL stage,
and the reward design strategy. These findings underscore the promise of RL for
automatically generating high-performance kernels, and since high-performance
kernels are core components of AI systems, this breakthrough establishes an
important foundation for building more efficient AI systems. The model and code

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great potential in graph data
analysis due to their powerful representation capabilities. However, as the
network depth increases, the issue of over-smoothing becomes more severe,
causing node representations to lose their distinctiveness. This paper analyzes
the mechanism of over-smoothing through the analogy to Anderson localization
and introduces participation degree as a metric to quantify this phenomenon.
Specifically, as the depth of the GNN increases, node features homogenize after
multiple layers of message passing, leading to a loss of distinctiveness,
similar to the behavior of vibration modes in disordered systems. In this
context, over-smoothing in GNNs can be understood as the expansion of
low-frequency modes (increased participation degree) and the localization of
high-frequency modes (decreased participation degree). Based on this, we
systematically reviewed the potential connection between the Anderson
localization behavior in disordered systems and the over-smoothing behavior in
Graph Neural Networks. A theoretical analysis was conducted, and we proposed
the potential of alleviating over-smoothing by reducing the disorder in
information propagation.

Abstract: Dataless neural networks represent a paradigm shift in applying neural
architectures to combinatorial optimization problems, eliminating the need for
training datasets by encoding problem instances directly into network
parameters. Despite the pioneering work of Alkhouri et al. (2022) demonstrating
the viability of dataless approaches for the Maximum Independent Set problem,
our comprehensive literature review reveals that no published work has extended
these methods to the Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP).
This paper addresses this gap by presenting the first dataless neural network
approach for RCPSP, providing a complete mathematical framework that transforms
discrete scheduling constraints into differentiable objectives suitable for
gradient-based optimization. Our approach leverages smooth relaxations and
automatic differentiation to unlock GPU parallelization for project scheduling,
traditionally a domain of sequential algorithms. We detail the mathematical
formulation for both precedence and renewable resource constraints, including a
memory-efficient dense time-grid representation. Implementation and
comprehensive experiments on PSPLIB benchmark instances (J30, J60, and J120)
are currently underway, with empirical results to be reported in an updated

Abstract: Stochastic optimal control (SOC) has recently emerged as a principled
framework for fine-tuning diffusion models. However, its dependence on
computationally intensive simulations makes it impractical for fast sampling.
In parallel, a class of training-free approaches has been developed that guides
diffusion models using off-the-shelf classifiers on predicted clean samples,
bypassing the need to train classifiers on noisy data. These methods can be
interpreted as approximate SOC schemes, using Tweedie's formula to estimate
diffusion posteriors. In practice, however, such direct approximations can
introduce significant errors, leading to unreliable guidance. In this work, we
unify the strengths of both paradigms by proposing a novel training-free
diffusion guidance framework based on a surrogate stochastic optimal control
objective. We derive a new theoretical bound on the value function that reveals
the necessity of correcting the approximate posteriors to remain faithful to
the true diffusion posterior. To this end, we connect the problem with Stein
variational inference, which seeks the steepest descent direction that
minimizes the Kullback-Leibler discrepancy between the two posteriors. Our
method, which we refer to as Stein Diffusion Guidance (SDG), introduces a
principled correction mechanism and incorporates a novel running cost
functional to enable effective guidance in low-density regions. Experiments on
challenging molecular generation tasks demonstrate that SDG significantly
outperforms standard training-free guidance methods, highlighting its potential
for broader applications.

complex dataset remains a challenge. The article presents a novel approach
called Explainable Hierarchical Deep Learning Neural Networks or Ex-HiDeNN that
uses an accurate, frugal, fast, separable, and scalable neural architecture
with symbolic regression to discover closed-form expressions from limited
observation. The article presents the two-step Ex-HiDeNN algorithm with a
separability checker embedded in it. The accuracy and efficiency of Ex-HiDeNN
are tested on several benchmark problems, including discerning a dynamical
system from data, and the outcomes are reported. Ex-HiDeNN generally shows
outstanding approximation capability in these benchmarks, producing orders of
magnitude smaller errors compared to reference data and traditional symbolic
regression. Later, Ex-HiDeNN is applied to three engineering applications: a)
discovering a closed-form fatigue equation, b) identification of hardness from
micro-indentation test data, and c) discovering the expression for the yield
surface with data. In every case, Ex-HiDeNN outperformed the reference methods
used in the literature. The proposed method is built upon the foundation and
published works of the authors on Hierarchical Deep Learning Neural Network
(HiDeNN) and Convolutional HiDeNN. The article also provides a clear idea about
the current limitations and future extensions of Ex-HiDeNN.

Abstract: Distributed learning methods have gained substantial momentum in recent
years, with communication overhead often emerging as a critical bottleneck.
Gradient compression techniques alleviate communication costs but involve an
inherent trade-off between the empirical efficiency of biased compressors and
the theoretical guarantees of unbiased compressors. In this work, we introduce
a novel Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) compression scheme that leverages biased
compressors to construct statistically unbiased estimates. This approach
effectively bridges the gap between biased and unbiased methods, combining the
strengths of both. To showcase the versatility of our method, we apply it to
popular compressors, like Top-$k$ and bit-wise compressors, resulting in
enhanced variants. Furthermore, we derive an adaptive version of our approach
to further improve its performance. We validate our method empirically on
distributed deep learning tasks.

desired business metrics and demonstrates superior algorithmic flexibility in
handling complex business constraints. Comprehensive evaluations, including

Result: 在公共数据集上验证了方法的有效性，展示了性能提升。

Conclusion: 该方法为异质治疗政策的深度学习提供了一个通用框架。

Abstract: As estimation of Heterogeneous Treatment Effect (HTE) is increasingly adopted
across a wide range of scientific and industrial applications, the treatment
action space can naturally expand, from a binary treatment variable to a
structured treatment policy. This policy may include several policy factors
such as a continuous treatment intensity variable, or discrete treatment
assignments. From first principles, we derive the formulation for incorporating
multiple treatment policy variables into the functional forms of individual and
average treatment effects. Building on this, we develop a methodology to
directly rank subjects using aggregated HTE functions. In particular, we
construct a Neural-Augmented Naive Bayes layer within a deep learning framework
to incorporate an arbitrary number of factors that satisfies the Naive Bayes
assumption. The factored layer is then applied with continuous treatment
variables, treatment assignment, and direct ranking of aggregated treatment
effect functions. Together, these algorithms build towards a generic framework
for deep learning of heterogeneous treatment policies, and we show their power
to improve performance with public datasets.

Abstract: In scientific domains -- from biology to the social sciences -- many
questions boil down to \textit{What effect will we observe if we intervene on a
particular variable?} If the causal relationships (e.g.~a causal graph) are
known, it is possible to estimate the intervention distributions. In the
absence of this domain knowledge, the causal structure must be discovered from
the available observational data. However, observational data are often
compatible with multiple causal graphs, making methods that commit to a single
structure prone to overconfidence. A principled way to manage this structural
uncertainty is via Bayesian inference, which averages over a posterior
distribution on possible causal structures and functional mechanisms.
Unfortunately, the number of causal structures grows super-exponentially with
the number of nodes in the graph, making computations intractable. We propose
to circumvent these challenges by using meta-learning to create an end-to-end
model: the Model-Averaged Causal Estimation Transformer Neural Process
(MACE-TNP). The model is trained to predict the Bayesian model-averaged
interventional posterior distribution, and its end-to-end nature bypasses the
need for expensive calculations. Empirically, we demonstrate that MACE-TNP
outperforms strong Bayesian baselines. Our work establishes meta-learning as a
flexible and scalable paradigm for approximating complex Bayesian causal
inference, that can be scaled to increasingly challenging settings in the
future.

Abstract: Jumping connections enable Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to overcome
over-smoothing, while graph sparsification reduces computational demands by
selecting a sub-matrix of the graph adjacency matrix during neighborhood
aggregation. Learning GCNs with graph sparsification has shown empirical
success across various applications, but a theoretical understanding of the
generalization guarantees remains limited, with existing analyses ignoring
either graph sparsification or jumping connections. This paper presents the
first learning dynamics and generalization analysis of GCNs with jumping
connections using graph sparsification. Our analysis demonstrates that the
generalization accuracy of the learned model closely approximates the highest
achievable accuracy within a broad class of target functions dependent on the
proposed sparse effective adjacency matrix $A^*$. Thus, graph sparsification
maintains generalization performance when $A^*$ preserves the essential edges
that support meaningful message propagation. We reveal that jumping connections
lead to different sparsification requirements across layers. In a
two-hidden-layer GCN, the generalization is more affected by the sparsified
matrix deviations from $A^*$ of the first layer than the second layer. To the
best of our knowledge, this marks the first theoretical characterization of
jumping connections' role in sparsification requirements. We validate our
theoretical results on benchmark datasets in deep GCNs.

Latent Space Constrained Graph Neural Networks (LSC-GNN) to incorporate
external "clean" links and guide embeddings of a noisy target graph. We train
two encoders--one on the full graph (target plus external edges) and another on
a regularization graph excluding the target's potentially noisy links--then
penalize discrepancies between their latent representations. This constraint
steers the model away from overfitting spurious edges. Experiments on benchmark
datasets show LSC-GNN outperforms standard and noise-resilient GNNs in graphs
subjected to moderate noise. We extend LSC-GNN to heterogeneous graphs and
validate it on a small protein-metabolite network, where metabolite-protein
interactions reduce noise in protein co-occurrence data. Our results highlight
LSC-GNN's potential to boost predictive performance and interpretability in
settings with noisy relational structures.

Abstract: Optical computing holds promise for high-speed, energy-efficient information
processing, with diffractive optical networks emerging as a flexible platform
for implementing task-specific transformations. A challenge, however, is the
effective optimization and alignment of the diffractive layers, which is
hindered by the difficulty of accurately modeling physical systems with their
inherent hardware imperfections, noise, and misalignments. While existing in
situ optimization methods offer the advantage of direct training on the
physical system without explicit system modeling, they are often limited by
slow convergence and unstable performance due to inefficient use of limited
measurement data. Here, we introduce a model-free reinforcement learning
approach utilizing Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for the in situ training
of diffractive optical processors. PPO efficiently reuses in situ measurement
data and constrains policy updates to ensure more stable and faster
convergence. We experimentally validated our method across a range of in situ
learning tasks, including targeted energy focusing through a random diffuser,
holographic image generation, aberration correction, and optical image
classification, demonstrating in each task better convergence and performance.
Our strategy operates directly on the physical system and naturally accounts
for unknown real-world imperfections, eliminating the need for prior system
knowledge or modeling. By enabling faster and more accurate training under
realistic experimental constraints, this in situ reinforcement learning
approach could offer a scalable framework for various optical and physical
systems governed by complex, feedback-driven dynamics.

Abstract: Graph learning has rapidly evolved into a critical subfield of machine
learning and artificial intelligence (AI). Its development began with early
graph-theoretic methods, gaining significant momentum with the advent of graph
neural networks (GNNs). Over the past decade, progress in scalable
architectures, dynamic graph modeling, multimodal learning, generative AI,
explainable AI (XAI), and responsible AI has broadened the applicability of
graph learning to various challenging environments. Graph learning is
significant due to its ability to model complex, non-Euclidean relationships
that traditional machine learning struggles to capture, thus better supporting
real-world applications ranging from drug discovery and fraud detection to
recommender systems and scientific reasoning. However, challenges like
scalability, generalization, heterogeneity, interpretability, and
trustworthiness must be addressed to unlock its full potential. This survey
provides a comprehensive introduction to graph learning, focusing on key
dimensions including scalable, temporal, multimodal, generative, explainable,
and responsible graph learning. We review state-of-the-art techniques for
efficiently handling large-scale graphs, capturing dynamic temporal
dependencies, integrating heterogeneous data modalities, generating novel graph
samples, and enhancing interpretability to foster trust and transparency. We
also explore ethical considerations, such as privacy and fairness, to ensure
responsible deployment of graph learning models. Additionally, we identify and
discuss emerging topics, highlighting recent integration of graph learning and
other AI paradigms and offering insights into future directions. This survey

Abstract: Recently, there has been a surge of vision-based GUI agents designed to

screenshots and autonomously decide where to click, scroll, or type, which
bypasses handcrafted rules and app-specific APIs. However, most existing
methods trained GUI agent in the offline environment using pre-collected
trajectories. This approach limits scalability, causes overfitting to specific
UI templates, and leads to brittle policies when faced with unseen environment.
We present MobileGUI-RL, a scalable framework that trains GUI agent in online
environment. MobileGUI-RL contains two key components. It (i) synthesizes a
curriculum of learnable tasks through self-exploration and filtering, and (ii)
adapts GRPO to GUI navigation with trajectory-aware advantages and composite
rewards that balance task success and execution efficiency. Experiments on
three online mobile-agent benchmarks show consistent gains, validating the

Abstract: AI-based methods have revolutionized atmospheric forecasting, with recent
successes in medium-range forecasting spurring the development of climate

spatial resolutions and longer lead times requires large neural networks and
gigabyte-sized data samples, making accelerator memory and I/O-bandwidth the
bottlenecks for model training. We introduce WeatherMixer, a
multi-layer-perceptron-based architecture whose workload scales linearly with
input size, allowing the model to learn global weather phenomena at accuracies
similar to numerical weather prediction. To cope with the computational demand,
we propose Jigsaw, a novel model parallelization scheme that employs both
domain and tensor parallelism, eliminating memory redundancy. Jigsaw exceeds
state-of-the-art performance in strong scaling in compute-communication-limited
systems and achieves superscalar weak scaling in I/O-bandwidth-limited systems.
We scale training to 256 GPUs, reaching peak performances of 9 and 11 PFLOPs,
23% and 28% of theoretical peaks, achieving 68% and 72% scaling efficiency
versus 51% without model parallelism.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) provides a promising paradigm for collaboratively
training machine learning models across distributed data sources while
maintaining privacy. Nevertheless, real-world FL often faces major challenges
including communication overhead during the transfer of large model parameters
and statistical heterogeneity, arising from non-identical independent data
distributions across clients. In this work, we propose an FL framework that 1)
provides inherent interpretations using prototypes, and 2) tackles statistical
heterogeneity by utilising lightweight adapter modules to act as compressed
surrogates of local models and guide clients to achieve generalisation despite
varying client distribution. Each client locally refines its model by aligning
class embeddings toward prototype representations and simultaneously adjust the
lightweight adapter. Our approach replaces the need to communicate entire model
weights with prototypes and lightweight adapters. This design ensures that each
client's model aligns with a globally shared structure while minimising
communication load and providing inherent interpretations. Moreover, we
conducted our experiments on a real-world retinal fundus image dataset, which
provides clinical-site information. We demonstrate inherent interpretable
capabilities and perform a classification task, which shows improvements in
accuracy over baseline algorithms.

Abstract: This survey provides a comparative analysis of feature-based and GAN-based
approaches to learning from demonstrations, with a focus on the structure of
reward functions and their implications for policy learning. Feature-based
methods offer dense, interpretable rewards that excel at high-fidelity motion
imitation, yet often require sophisticated representations of references and
struggle with generalization in unstructured settings. GAN-based methods, in
contrast, use implicit, distributional supervision that enables scalability and
adaptation flexibility, but are prone to training instability and coarse reward
signals. Recent advancements in both paradigms converge on the importance of
structured motion representations, which enable smoother transitions,
controllable synthesis, and improved task integration. We argue that the
dichotomy between feature-based and GAN-based methods is increasingly nuanced:
rather than one paradigm dominating the other, the choice should be guided by
task-specific priorities such as fidelity, diversity, interpretability, and
adaptability. This work outlines the algorithmic trade-offs and design
considerations that underlie method selection, offering a framework for
principled decision-making in learning from demonstrations.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in various generative
tasks, but training them remains highly resource-intensive, often requiring
millions of images and many days of GPU computation. From a data-centric
perspective addressing this limitation, we study diffusion dataset condensation
as a new and challenging problem setting. The goal is to construct a
"synthetic" sub-dataset with significantly fewer samples than the original
dataset, enabling high-quality diffusion model training with greatly reduced
cost. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to formally investigate
dataset condensation for diffusion models, whereas prior work focused on
training discriminative models. To tackle this new challenge, we propose a
novel Diffusion Dataset Condensation (D2C) framework, which consists of two
phases: Select and Attach. The Select phase identifies a compact and diverse
subset using a diffusion difficulty score and interval sampling. The Attach
phase enhances the selected subset by attaching rich semantic and visual
representations to strengthen the conditional signals. Extensive experiments
across various dataset sizes, model architectures, and resolutions show that
our D2C framework enables significantly faster diffusion model training with
dramatically fewer data, while preserving high visual quality. Notably, for the
SiT-XL/2 architecture, D2C achieves a 100x training speed-up, reaching a FID
score of 4.3 in just 40k steps using only 0.8% of the training data.

predominantly interpret Adam as a preconditioned stochastic gradient descent
with momentum (SGDM), formulated as $\bm{x}_{t+1} = \bm{x}_t -
\frac{\gamma_t}{{\sqrt{\bm{v}_t}+\epsilon}} \circ \bm{m}_t$. This perspective
necessitates strong assumptions and intricate techniques, resulting in lengthy
and opaque convergence proofs that are difficult to verify and extend. In
contrast, we propose a novel interpretation by treating Adam as a sign-like
optimizer, expressed as $\bm{x}_{t+1} = \bm{x}_t - \gamma_t
\frac{|\bm{m}_t|}{{\sqrt{\bm{v}_t}+\epsilon}} \circ {\rm Sign}(\bm{m}_t)$. This
reformulation significantly simplifies the convergence analysis. For the first
time, with some mild conditions, we prove that Adam achieves the optimal rate
of ${\cal O}(\frac{1}{T^{\sfrac{1}{4}}})$ rather than the previous ${\cal O}
\left(\frac{\ln T}{T^{\sfrac{1}{4}}}\right)$ under weak assumptions of the
generalized $p$-affine variance and $(L_0, L_1, q)$-smoothness, without
dependence on the model dimensionality or the numerical stability parameter
$\epsilon$. Additionally, our theoretical analysis provides new insights into
the role of momentum as a key factor ensuring convergence and offers practical
guidelines for tuning learning rates in Adam, further bridging the gap between
theory and practice.

Abstract: Link prediction infers missing or future relations between graph nodes, based
on connection patterns. Scientific literature networks and knowledge graphs are
typically large, sparse, and noisy, and often contain missing links between
entities. We present an AI-driven hierarchical link prediction framework that
integrates matrix factorization to infer hidden associations and steer
discovery in complex material domains. Our method combines Hierarchical
Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (HNMFk) and Boolean matrix factorization
(BNMFk) with automatic model selection, as well as Logistic matrix
factorization (LMF), we use to construct a three-level topic tree from a
46,862-document corpus focused on 73 transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs).
These materials are studied in a variety of physics fields with many current
and potential applications.
  An ensemble BNMFk + LMF approach fuses discrete interpretability with
probabilistic scoring. The resulting HNMFk clusters map each material onto
coherent topics like superconductivity, energy storage, and tribology. Also,
missing or weakly connected links are highlight between topics and materials,
suggesting novel hypotheses for cross-disciplinary exploration. We validate our
method by removing publications about superconductivity in well-known
superconductors, and show the model predicts associations with the
superconducting TMD clusters. This shows the method finds hidden connections in
a graph of material to latent topic associations built from scientific
literature, especially useful when examining a diverse corpus of scientific
documents covering the same class of phenomena or materials but originating
from distinct communities and perspectives. The inferred links generating new
hypotheses, produced by our method, are exposed through an interactive
Streamlit dashboard, designed for human-in-the-loop scientific discovery.

Conclusion: 论文为卷积层中的混叠效应提供了理论分析和实用优化方法，揭示了初始化时的混叠行为。

Abstract: Using a stride in a convolutional layer inherently introduces aliasing, which
has implications for numerical stability and statistical generalization. While
techniques such as the parametrizations via paraunitary systems have been used
to promote orthogonal convolution and thus ensure Parseval stability, a general
analysis of aliasing and its effects on the stability has not been done in this
context. In this article, we adapt a frame-theoretic approach to describe
aliasing in convolutional layers with 1D kernels, leading to practical
estimates for stability bounds and characterizations of Parseval stability,
that are tailored to take short kernel sizes into account. From this, we derive
two computationally very efficient optimization objectives that promote
Parseval stability via systematically suppressing aliasing. Finally, for layers
with random kernels, we derive closed-form expressions for the expected value
and variance of the terms that describe the aliasing effects, revealing
fundamental insights into the aliasing behavior at initialization.

demonstrate that 8000 simple logic gates are sufficient to achieve over 98% on

Abstract: Predicting Quality of Service (QoS) data crucial for cloud service selection,
where user privacy is a critical concern. Federated Graph Neural Networks
(FGNNs) can perform QoS data prediction as well as maintaining user privacy.
However, existing FGNN-based QoS predictors commonly implement on-device
training on scattered explicit user-service graphs, thereby failing to utilize
the implicit user-user interactions. To address this issue, this study proposes
a high order collaboration-oriented federated graph neural network (HC-FGNN) to
obtain accurate QoS prediction with privacy preservation. Concretely, it
magnifies the explicit user-service graphs following the principle of attention
mechanism to obtain the high order collaboration, which reflects the implicit
user-user interactions. Moreover, it utilizes a lightweight-based message
aggregation way to improve the computational efficiency. The extensive
experiments on two QoS datasets from real application indicate that the
proposed HC-FGNN possesses the advantages of high prediction accurate and
privacy protection.

Abstract: Score-based diffusion generative models have recently emerged as a powerful
tool for modelling complex data distributions. These models aim at learning the
score function, which defines a map from a known probability distribution to
the target data distribution via deterministic or stochastic differential
equations (SDEs). The score function is typically estimated from data using a
variety of approximation techniques, such as denoising or sliced score
matching, Hyv\"arien's method, or Schr\"odinger bridges. In this paper, we
derive an exact, closed form, expression for the score function for a broad
class of nonlinear diffusion generative models. Our approach combines modern
stochastic analysis tools such as Malliavin derivatives and their adjoint
operators (Skorokhod integrals or Malliavin Divergence) with a new Bismut-type
formula. The resulting expression for the score function can be written
entirely in terms of the first and second variation processes, with all
Malliavin derivatives systematically eliminated, thereby enhancing its
practical applicability. The theoretical framework presented in this work
offers a principled foundation for advancing score estimation methods in
generative modelling, enabling the design of new sampling algorithms for
complex probability distributions. Our results can be extended to broader
classes of stochastic differential equations, opening new directions for the
development of score-based diffusion generative models.

Abstract: Accurate bandwidth estimation (BWE) is critical for real-time communication
(RTC) systems. Traditional heuristic approaches offer limited adaptability
under dynamic networks, while online reinforcement learning (RL) suffers from
high exploration costs and potential service disruptions. Offline RL, which
leverages high-quality data collected from real-world environments, offers a
promising alternative. However, challenges such as out-of-distribution (OOD)
actions, policy extraction from behaviorally diverse datasets, and reliable
deployment in production systems remain unsolved. We propose RBWE, a robust
bandwidth estimation framework based on offline RL that integrates Q-ensemble
(an ensemble of Q-functions) with a Gaussian mixture policy to mitigate OOD
risks and enhance policy learning. A fallback mechanism ensures deployment
stability by switching to heuristic methods under high uncertainty.
Experimental results show that RBWE reduces overestimation errors by 18% and
improves the 10th percentile Quality of Experience (QoE) by 18.6%,
demonstrating its practical effectiveness in real-world RTC applications.

Abstract: Manual annotation of medical images is a labor-intensive and time-consuming
process, posing a significant bottleneck in the development and deployment of
robust medical imaging AI systems. This paper introduces a novel Human-AI
collaborative framework for medical image segmentation that substantially
reduces the annotation burden by eliminating the need for explicit manual
pixel-level labeling. The core innovation lies in a preference learning
paradigm, where human experts provide minimal, intuitive feedback -- simply
indicating whether an AI-generated segmentation is better or worse than a
previous version. The framework comprises four key components: (1) an adaptable
foundation model (FM) for feature extraction, (2) label propagation based on
feature similarity, (3) a clicking agent that learns from human better-or-worse
feedback to decide where to click and with which label, and (4) a multi-round
segmentation learning procedure that trains a state-of-the-art segmentation
network using pseudo-labels generated by the clicking agent and FM-based label
propagation. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that the proposed
approach achieves competitive segmentation performance using only binary
preference feedback, without requiring experts to directly manually annotate
the images.

Abstract: Property elicitation studies which attributes of a probability distribution
can be determined by minimising a risk. We investigate a generalisation of
property elicitation to imprecise probabilities (IP). This investigation is
motivated by multi-distribution learning, which takes the classical machine
learning paradigm of minimising a single risk over a (precise) probability and
replaces it with $\Gamma$-maximin risk minimization over an IP. We provide
necessary conditions for elicitability of a IP-property. Furthermore, we
explain what an elicitable IP-property actually elicits through Bayes pairs --
the elicited IP-property is the corresponding standard property of the maximum
Bayes risk distribution.

Conclusion: 权重限制校准在伪熵特征中具有强大潜力，能够显著改进现有方法。

Abstract: Pseudoentropy characterizations provide a quantitatively precise
demonstration of the close relationship between computational hardness and
computational randomness. We prove a unified pseudoentropy characterization
that generalizes and strengthens previous results for both uniform and
non-uniform models of computation. Our characterization holds for a general
family of entropy notions that encompasses the common notions of Shannon
entropy and min entropy as special cases. Moreover, we show that the
characterizations for different entropy notions can be simultaneously achieved
by a single, universal function that simultaneously witnesses computational
hardness and computational randomness. A key technical insight of our work is
that the notion of weight-restricted calibration from the recent literature on
algorithm fairness, along with standard computational indistinguishability
(known as multiaccuracy in the fairness literature), suffices for proving
pseudoentropy characterizations for general entropy notions. This demonstrates
the power of weight-restricted calibration to enhance the classic
Complexity-Theoretic Regularity Lemma (Trevisan, Tulsiani, and Vadhan, 2009)
and Leakage Simulation Lemma (Jetchev and Pietrzak, 2014) and allows us to
achieve an exponential improvement in the complexity dependency on the alphabet
size compared to the pseudoentropy characterizations by Casacuberta, Dwork, and
Vadhan (2024) based on the much stronger notion of multicalibration. We show
that the exponential dependency on the alphabet size is inevitable for
multicalibration as well as for the weaker notion of calibrated multiaccuracy.

Abstract: Distances between probability distributions are a key component of many
statistical machine learning tasks, from two-sample testing to generative
modeling, among others. We introduce a novel distance between measures that
compares them through a Schatten norm of their kernel covariance operators. We
show that this new distance is an integral probability metric that can be
framed between a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and a Wasserstein distance. In
particular, we show that it avoids some pitfalls of MMD, by being more
discriminative and robust to the choice of hyperparameters. Moreover, it
benefits from some compelling properties of kernel methods, that can avoid the
curse of dimensionality for their sample complexity. We provide an algorithm to
compute the distance in practice by introducing an extension of kernel matrix
for difference of distributions that could be of independent interest. Those
advantages are illustrated by robust approximate Bayesian computation under
contamination as well as particle flow simulations.

Abstract: Unlike classification, whose goal is to estimate the class of each data point
in a dataset, prevalence estimation or quantification is a task that aims to
estimate the distribution of classes in a dataset. The two main tasks in
prevalence estimation are to adjust for bias, due to the prevalence in the
training dataset, and to quantify the uncertainty in the estimate. The standard
methods used to quantify uncertainty in prevalence estimates are bootstrapping
and Bayesian quantification methods. It is not clear which approach is ideal in
terms of precision (i.e. the width of confidence intervals) and coverage (i.e.
the confidence intervals being well-calibrated). Here, we propose Precise
Quantifier (PQ), a Bayesian quantifier that is more precise than existing
quantifiers and with well-calibrated coverage. We discuss the theory behind PQ
and present experiments based on simulated and real-world datasets. Through
these experiments, we establish the factors which influence quantification
precision: the discriminatory power of the underlying classifier; the size of
the labeled dataset used to train the quantifier; and the size of the unlabeled
dataset for which prevalence is estimated. Our analysis provides deep insights
into uncertainty quantification for quantification learning.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅理论上有优势，还能在实际中计算，展示了RKHS在动态遗憾问题中的潜力。

Abstract: We study dynamic regret in online convex optimization, where the objective is
to achieve low cumulative loss relative to an arbitrary benchmark sequence. By
observing that competing with an arbitrary sequence of comparators
$u_{1},\ldots,u_{T}$ in $\mathcal{W}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is equivalent to
competing with a fixed comparator function $u:[1,T]\to \mathcal{W}$, we frame
dynamic regret minimization as a static regret problem in a function space. By
carefully constructing a suitable function space in the form of a Reproducing
Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), our reduction enables us to recover the optimal
$R_{T}(u_{1},\ldots,u_{T}) = \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\sum_{t}\|u_{t}-u_{t-1}\|T})$
dynamic regret guarantee in the setting of linear losses, and yields new
scale-free and directionally-adaptive dynamic regret guarantees. Moreover,
unlike prior dynamic-to-static reductions -- which are valid only for linear
losses -- our reduction holds for any sequence of losses, allowing us to
recover $\mathcal{O}\big(\|u\|^2+d_{\mathrm{eff}}(\lambda)\ln T\big)$ bounds in
exp-concave and improper linear regression settings, where
$d_{\mathrm{eff}}(\lambda)$ is a measure of complexity of the RKHS. Despite
working in an infinite-dimensional space, the resulting reduction leads to
algorithms that are computable in practice, due to the reproducing property of
RKHSs.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful machine learning
method for graph-structured data. A plethora of hardware accelerators has been
introduced to meet the performance demands of GNNs in real-world applications.
However, security challenges of hardware-based attacks have been generally
overlooked. In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of GNN models to
hardware-based fault attack, wherein an attacker attempts to misclassify output
by modifying trained weight parameters through fault injection in a memory
device. Thus, we propose Gradual Bit-Flip Fault Attack (GBFA), a layer-aware
bit-flip fault attack, selecting a vulnerable bit in each selected weight
gradually to compromise the GNN's performance by flipping a minimal number of
bits. To achieve this, GBFA operates in two steps. First, a Markov model is
created to predict the execution sequence of layers based on features extracted
from memory access patterns, enabling the launch of the attack within a
specific layer. Subsequently, GBFA identifies vulnerable bits within the
selected weights using gradient ranking through an in-layer search. We evaluate
the effectiveness of the proposed GBFA attack on various GNN models for node
classification tasks using the Cora and PubMed datasets. Our findings show that
GBFA significantly degrades prediction accuracy, and the variation in its
impact across different layers highlights the importance of adopting a
layer-aware attack strategy in GNNs. For example, GBFA degrades GraphSAGE's
prediction accuracy by 17% on the Cora dataset with only a single bit flip in
the last layer.

Abstract: Machine learning methods are increasingly applied to ergonomic risk
assessment in manual material handling, particularly for estimating carried
load from gait motion data collected from wearable sensors. However, existing
approaches often rely on direct mappings from loaded gait to hand load,
limiting generalization and predictive accuracy. In this study, we propose an
enhanced load estimation framework that incorporates auxiliary information,
including baseline gait patterns during unloaded walking and carrying style.
While baseline gait can be automatically captured by wearable sensors and is
thus readily available at inference time, carrying style typically requires
manual labeling and is often unavailable during deployment. Our model
integrates deep latent variable modeling with temporal convolutional networks
and bi-directional cross-attention to capture gait dynamics and fuse loaded and
unloaded gait patterns. Guided by domain knowledge, the model is designed to
estimate load magnitude conditioned on carrying style, while eliminating the
need for carrying style labels at inference time. Experiments using real-world
data collected from inertial measurement units attached to participants
demonstrate substantial accuracy gains from incorporating auxiliary information
and highlight the importance of explicit fusion mechanisms over naive feature
concatenation.

Abstract: With the emergence of compute-intensive and delay-sensitive applications in
vehicular networks, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a promising
complement for vehicular edge computing due to the high mobility and flexible
deployment. However, the existing UAV-assisted offloading strategies are
insufficient in coordinating heterogeneous computing resources and adapting to
dynamic network conditions. Hence, this paper proposes a dual-layer
UAV-assisted edge computing architecture based on partial offloading, composed
of the relay capability of high-altitude UAVs and the computing support of
low-altitude UAVs. The proposed architecture enables efficient integration and
coordination of heterogeneous resources. A joint optimization problem is
formulated to minimize the system delay and energy consumption while ensuring
the task completion rate. To solve the high-dimensional decision problem, we
reformulate the problem as a Markov decision process and propose a hierarchical
offloading scheme based on the soft actor-critic algorithm. The method
decouples global and local decisions, where the global decisions integrate
offloading ratios and trajectory planning into continuous actions, while the
local scheduling is handled via designing a priority-based mechanism.
Simulations are conducted and demonstrate that the proposed approach
outperforms several baselines in task completion rate, system efficiency, and
convergence speed, showing strong robustness and applicability in dynamic
vehicular environments.

Abstract: Many dynamic processes such as telecommunication and transport networks can
be described through discrete time series of graphs. Modelling the dynamics of
such time series enables prediction of graph structure at future time steps,
which can be used in applications such as detection of anomalies. Existing
approaches for graph prediction have limitations such as assuming that the
vertices do not to change between consecutive graphs. To address this, we
propose to exploit time series prediction methods in combination with an
adapted form of flux balance analysis (FBA), a linear programming method
originating from biochemistry. FBA is adapted to incorporate various
constraints applicable to the scenario of growing graphs. Empirical evaluations
on synthetic datasets (constructed via Preferential Attachment model) and real
datasets (UCI Message, HePH, Facebook, Bitcoin) demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed approach.

Abstract: Tabular data in relational databases represents a significant portion of
industrial data. Hence, analyzing and interpreting tabular data is of utmost
importance. Application tasks on tabular data are manifold and are often not
specified when setting up an industrial database. To address this, we present a
novel framework for generating universal, i.e., task-independent embeddings of
tabular data for performing downstream tasks without predefined targets. Our
method transforms tabular data into a graph structure, leverages Graph
Auto-Encoders to create entity embeddings, which are subsequently aggregated to
obtain embeddings for each table row, i.e., each data sample. This two-step
approach has the advantage that unseen samples, consisting of similar entities,
can be embedded without additional training. Downstream tasks such as
regression, classification or outlier detection, can then be performed by
applying a distance-based similarity measure in the embedding space.
Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
superior performance compared to existing universal tabular data embedding
techniques.

Abstract: Noisy labels pose significant challenges for AI model training in veterinary
medicine. This study examines expert assessment ambiguity in canine
auscultation data, highlights the negative impact of label noise on
classification performance, and introduces methods for label noise reduction.
To evaluate whether label noise can be minimized by incorporating multiple
expert opinions, a dataset of 140 heart sound recordings (HSR) was annotated
regarding the intensity of holosystolic heart murmurs caused by Myxomatous
Mitral Valve Disease (MMVD). The expert opinions facilitated the selection of
70 high-quality HSR, resulting in a noise-reduced dataset. By leveraging
individual heart cycles, the training data was expanded and classification
robustness was enhanced. The investigation encompassed training and evaluating
three classification algorithms: AdaBoost, XGBoost, and Random Forest. While
AdaBoost and Random Forest exhibited reasonable performances, XGBoost
demonstrated notable improvements in classification accuracy. All algorithms
showed significant improvements in classification accuracy due to the applied
label noise reduction, most notably XGBoost. Specifically, for the detection of
mild heart murmurs, sensitivity increased from 37.71% to 90.98% and specificity
from 76.70% to 93.69%. For the moderate category, sensitivity rose from 30.23%

representing a different view. Extensive experimental validation across
model-types and learning tasks confirm the effectiveness and generalization of
the approach. We believe the work in this paper lays the foundation for further
research into the universal benefits of multi-view mid fusion learning.

Conclusion: LGCNN为复杂物理过程的建模提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Machine learning methods often struggle with real-world applications in
science and engineering due to limited or low-quality training data. In this
work, the example of groundwater flow with heat transport is considered; this
corresponds to an advection-diffusion process under heterogeneous flow
conditions, that is, spatially distributed material parameters and heat
sources. Classical numerical simulations are costly and challenging due to high
spatio-temporal resolution requirements and large domains. While often
computationally more efficient, purely data-driven surrogate models face
difficulties, particularly in predicting the advection process, which is highly
sensitive to input variations and involves long-range spatial interactions.
Therefore, in this work, a Local-Global Convolutional Neural Network (LGCNN)
approach is introduced. It combines a lightweight numerical surrogate for the
transport process (global) with convolutional neural networks for the
groundwater velocity and heat diffusion processes (local). With the LGCNN, a
city-wide subsurface temperature field is modeled, involving a heterogeneous
groundwater flow field and one hundred groundwater heat pump injection points
forming interacting heat plumes over long distances. The model is first
systematically analyzed based on random subsurface input fields. Then, the
model is trained on a handful of cut-outs from a real-world subsurface map of
the Munich region in Germany, and it scales to larger cut-outs without
retraining. All datasets, our code, and trained models are published for
reproducibility.

Conclusion: ZO-SAH通过高效估计Hessian矩阵，显著提升了零阶优化的实用性。

Abstract: Zeroth-order optimization addresses problems where gradient information is
inaccessible or impractical to compute. While most existing methods rely on
first-order approximations, incorporating second-order (curvature) information
can, in principle, significantly accelerate convergence. However, the high cost
of function evaluations required to estimate Hessian matrices often limits
practical applicability. We present the subspace-based approximate Hessian
(ZO-SAH) method, a zeroth-order optimization algorithm that mitigates these
costs by focusing on randomly selected two-dimensional subspaces. Within each
subspace, ZO-SAH estimates the Hessian by fitting a quadratic polynomial to the
objective function and extracting its second-order coefficients. To further
reduce function-query costs, ZO-SAH employs a periodic subspace-switching
strategy that reuses function evaluations across optimization steps.
Experiments on eight benchmark datasets, including logistic regression and deep
neural network training tasks, demonstrate that ZO-SAH achieves significantly
faster convergence than existing zeroth-order methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we establish a theoretical connection between complex-valued
neural networks (CVNNs) and fermionic quantum field theory (QFT), bridging a
fundamental gap in the emerging framework of neural network quantum field
theory (NN-QFT). While prior NN-QFT works have linked real-valued architectures
to bosonic fields, we demonstrate that CVNNs equipped with tensor-valued
weights intrinsically generate fermionic quantum fields. By promoting
hidden-to-output weights to Clifford algebra-valued tensors, we induce
anticommutation relations essential for fermionic statistics. Through
analytical study of the generating functional, we obtain the exact quantum
state in the infinite-width limit, revealing that the parameters between the
input layer and the last hidden layer correspond to the eigenvalues of the
quantum system, and the tensor weighting parameters in the hidden-to-output
layer map to dynamical fermionic fields. The continuum limit reproduces free
fermion correlators, with diagrammatic expansions confirming anticommutation.
The work provides the first explicit mapping from neural architectures to
fermionic QFT at the level of correlation functions and generating functional.
It extends NN-QFT beyond bosonic theories and opens avenues for encoding
fermionic symmetries into machine learning models, with potential applications
in quantum simulation and lattice field theory.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of mutational effects on protein-protein binding energies
is an open problem with applications in structural biology and therapeutic
design. Several deep learning predictors for this task have been proposed, but,
presumably due to the scarcity of binding data, these methods underperform
computationally expensive estimates based on empirical force fields. In
response, we propose a transfer-learning approach that leverages advances in
protein sequence modeling and folding stability prediction for this task. The
key idea is to parameterize the binding energy as the difference between the
folding energy of the protein complex and the sum of the folding energies of
its binding partners. We show that using a pre-trained inverse-folding model as
a proxy for folding energy provides strong zero-shot performance, and can be
fine-tuned with (1) copious folding energy measurements and (2) more limited
binding energy measurements. The resulting predictor, StaB-ddG, is the first
deep learning predictor to match the accuracy of the state-of-the-art empirical
force-field method FoldX, while offering an over 1,000x speed-up.

evolution to this compact subspace reduces the dynamical Lie-algebra dimension
from $\mathcal{O}(4^{n})$ to $\mathcal{O}(4^{k})$, ensuring only polynomial
suppression of gradient variance and circumventing barren plateaus that plague
hardware-efficient ans\"atze. Exact, hardware-compatible gradients are obtained
using a generalized parameter-shift rule, avoiding ancillary qubits and
finite-difference bias. Numerical experiments on quantum auto-encoding and
classification show that SUN-VQCs sustain order-of-magnitude larger gradient
signals, converge 2--3$\times$ faster, and reach higher final fidelities than

Abstract: Basis pursuit denoising (BPDN) is a cornerstone of compressive sensing,
statistics and machine learning. While various algorithms for BPDN have been
proposed, they invariably suffer from drawbacks and must either favor
efficiency at the expense of accuracy or vice versa. As such, state-of-the-art
algorithms remain ineffective for high-dimensional applications that require
accurate solutions within a reasonable amount of computational time. In this
work, we address this issue and propose an exact and efficient algorithm for
BPDN using differential inclusions. Specifically, we prove that a selection
principle from the theory of differential inclusions turns the dual problem of
BPDN into calculating the trajectory of an \emph{integrable} projected
dynamical system, that is, whose trajectory and asymptotic limit can be
computed exactly. Our analysis naturally yields an exact algorithm, numerically
up to machine precision, that is amenable to computing regularization paths and
very fast. Numerical experiments confirm that our algorithm outperforms the
state-of-the-art algorithms in both accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, we show
that the global continuation of solutions (in terms of the hyperparameter and
data) of the projected dynamical system yields a rigorous homotopy algorithm
for BPDN, as well as a novel greedy algorithm for computing feasible solutions
to basis pursuit in strongly polynomial time. Beyond this work, we expect that
our results and analysis can be adapted to compute exact or approximate
solutions to a broader class of polyhedral-constrained optimization problems.

Abstract: Differentially private zeroth-order optimization methods have recently gained
popularity in private fine tuning of machine learning models due to their
reduced memory requirements. Current approaches for privatizing zeroth-order
methods rely on adding Gaussian noise to the estimated zeroth-order gradients.
However, since the search direction in the zeroth-order methods is inherently
random, researchers including Tang et al. (2024) and Zhang et al. (2024a) have
raised an important question: is the inherent noise in zeroth-order estimators
sufficient to ensure the overall differential privacy of the algorithm? This
work settles this question for a class of oracle-based optimization algorithms
where the oracle returns zeroth-order gradient estimates. In particular, we
show that for a fixed initialization, there exist strongly convex objective
functions such that running (Projected) Zeroth-Order Gradient Descent (ZO-GD)
is not differentially private. Furthermore, we show that even with random
initialization and without revealing (initial and) intermediate iterates, the
privacy loss in ZO-GD can grow superlinearly with the number of iterations when
minimizing convex objective functions.

Abstract: In this paper, we describe a parameterized quantum circuit that can be
considered as convolutional and pooling layers for graph neural networks. The
circuit incorporates the parameterized quantum Fourier circuit where the qubit
connections for the controlled gates derived from the Laplacian operator.
Specifically, we show that the eigenspace of the Laplacian operator of a graph
can be approximated by using QFT based circuit whose connections are determined
from the adjacency matrix. For an $N\times N$ Laplacian, this approach yields
an approximate polynomial-depth circuit requiring only $n=log(N)$ qubits. These
types of circuits can eliminate the expensive classical computations for
approximating the learnable functions of the Laplacian through Chebyshev
polynomial or Taylor expansions.
  Using this circuit as a convolutional layer provides an $n-$ dimensional
probability vector that can be considered as the filtered and compressed graph
signal. Therefore, the circuit along with the measurement can be considered a
very efficient convolution plus pooling layer that transforms an
$N$-dimensional signal input into $n-$dimensional signal with an exponential
compression. We then apply a classical neural network prediction head to the
output of the circuit to construct a complete graph neural network. Since the
circuit incorporates geometric structure through its graph connection-based
approach, we present graph classification results for the benchmark datasets
listed in TUDataset library. Using only [1-100] learnable parameters for the
quantum circuit and minimal classical layers (1000-5000 parameters) in a
generic setting, the obtained results are comparable to and in some cases
better than many of the baseline results, particularly for the cases when
geometric structure plays a significant role.

Conclusion: HRRRCast为高效、数据驱动的区域天气预测提供了有竞争力的解决方案。

Abstract: The High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model is a convection-allowing model
used in operational weather forecasting across the contiguous United States
(CONUS). To provide a computationally efficient alternative, we introduce
HRRRCast, a data-driven emulator built with advanced machine learning
techniques. HRRRCast includes two architectures: a ResNet-based model (ResHRRR)
and a Graph Neural Network-based model (GraphHRRR). ResHRRR uses convolutional
neural networks enhanced with squeeze-and-excitation blocks and Feature-wise
Linear Modulation, and supports probabilistic forecasting via the Denoising
Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM). To better handle longer lead times, we train a
single model to predict multiple lead times (1h, 3h, and 6h), then use a greedy
rollout strategy during inference. When evaluated on composite reflectivity
over the full CONUS domain using ensembles of 3 to 10 members, ResHRRR
outperforms HRRR forecast at light rainfall threshold (20 dBZ) and achieves
competitive performance at moderate thresholds (30 dBZ). Our work advances the
StormCast model of Pathak et al. [21] by: a) training on the full CONUS domain,
b) using multiple lead times to improve long-range skill, c) training on
analysis data instead of the +1h post-analysis data inadvertently used in
StormCast, and d) incorporating future GFS states as inputs, enabling
downscaling that improves long-lead accuracy. Grid-, neighborhood-, and
object-based metrics confirm better storm placement, lower frequency bias, and
higher success ratios than HRRR. HRRRCast ensemble forecasts also maintain
sharper spatial detail, with power spectra more closely matching HRRR analysis.
While GraphHRRR underperforms in its current form, it lays groundwork for
future graph-based forecasting. HRRRCast represents a step toward efficient,
data-driven regional weather prediction with competitive accuracy and ensemble
capability.

Conclusion: PSAT为儿科分割提供了实用见解，强调持续学习策略的重要性。

Abstract: Pediatric medical imaging presents unique challenges due to significant
anatomical and developmental differences compared to adults. Direct application
of segmentation models trained on adult data often yields suboptimal
performance, particularly for small or rapidly evolving structures. To address
these challenges, several strategies leveraging the nnU-Net framework have been
proposed, differing along four key axes: (i) the fingerprint dataset (adult,
pediatric, or a combination thereof) from which the Training Plan -including
the network architecture-is derived; (ii) the Learning Set (adult, pediatric,
or mixed), (iii) Data Augmentation parameters, and (iv) the Transfer learning
method (finetuning versus continual learning). In this work, we introduce PSAT
(Pediatric Segmentation Approaches via Adult Augmentations and Transfer
learning), a systematic study that investigates the impact of these axes on
segmentation performance. We benchmark the derived strategies on two pediatric
CT datasets and compare them with state-of-theart methods, including a
commercial radiotherapy solution. PSAT highlights key pitfalls and provides
actionable insights for improving pediatric segmentation. Our experiments
reveal that a training plan based on an adult fingerprint dataset is misaligned
with pediatric anatomy-resulting in significant performance degradation,
especially when segmenting fine structures-and that continual learning
strategies mitigate institutional shifts, thus enhancing generalization across
diverse pediatric datasets. The code is available at

Abstract: Grasp pose detection (GPD) is a fundamental capability for robotic autonomy,
but its reliance on large, diverse datasets creates significant data privacy
and centralization challenges. Federated Learning (FL) offers a
privacy-preserving solution, but its application to GPD is hindered by the
substantial communication overhead of large models, a key issue for
resource-constrained robots. To address this, we propose a novel module-wise FL
framework that begins by analyzing the learning dynamics of the GPD model's
functional components. This analysis identifies slower-converging modules, to
which our framework then allocates additional communication effort. This is
realized through a two-phase process: a standard full-model training phase is
followed by a communication-efficient phase where only the identified subset of
slower-converging modules is trained and their partial updates are aggregated.
Extensive experiments on the GraspNet-1B dataset demonstrate that our method
outperforms standard FedAvg and other baselines, achieving higher accuracy for
a given communication budget. Furthermore, real-world experiments on a physical
robot validate our approach, showing a superior grasp success rate compared to
baseline methods in cluttered scenes. Our work presents a
communication-efficient framework for training robust, generalized GPD models
in a decentralized manner, effectively improving the trade-off between
communication cost and model performance.

Abstract: Demanding task environments (e.g., supervising a remotely piloted aircraft)
require performing tasks quickly and accurately; however, periods of low and
high operator workload can decrease task performance. Intelligent modulation of
the system's demands and interaction modality in response to changes in
operator workload state may increase performance by avoiding undesirable
workload states. This system requires real-time estimation of each workload
component (i.e., cognitive, physical, visual, speech, and auditory) to adapt
the correct modality. Existing workload systems estimate multiple workload
components post-hoc, but few estimate speech workload, or function in
real-time. An algorithm to estimate speech workload and mitigate undesirable
workload states in real-time is presented. An analysis of the algorithm's
accuracy is presented, along with the results demonstrating the algorithm's
generalizability across individuals and human-machine teaming paradigms.
Real-time speech workload estimation is a crucial element towards developing

Abstract: In the online portfolio optimization framework, existing learning algorithms
generate strategies that yield significantly poorer cumulative wealth compared
to the best constant rebalancing portfolio in hindsight, despite being
consistent in asymptotic growth rate. While this unappealing performance can be
improved by incorporating more side information, it raises difficulties in
feature selection and high-dimensional settings. Instead, the inherent serial
dependence of assets' returns, such as day-of-the-week and other calendar
effects, can be leveraged. Although latent serial dependence patterns are
commonly detected using large training datasets, this paper proposes an
algorithm that learns such dependence using only gradually revealed data,
without any assumption on their distribution, to form a strategy that
eventually exceeds the cumulative wealth of the best constant rebalancing
portfolio.
  Moreover, the classical Kelly criterion, which requires independent assets'
returns, is generalized to accommodate serial dependence in a market modeled as
an independent and identically distributed process of random matrices. In such
a stochastic market, where existing learning algorithms designed for stationary
processes fail to apply, the proposed learning algorithm still generates a
strategy that asymptotically grows to the highest rate among all strategies,
matching that of the optimal strategy constructed under the generalized Kelly
criterion. The experimental results with real market data demonstrate the
theoretical guarantees of the algorithm and its performance as expected, as
long as serial dependence is significant, regardless of the validity of the
generalized Kelly criterion in the experimental market. This further affirms
the broad applicability of the algorithm in general contexts.

Abstract: Building on our previous work introducing Fredholm Neural Networks (Fredholm
NNs/ FNNs) for solving integral equations, we extend the framework to tackle
forward and inverse problems for linear and semi-linear elliptic partial
differential equations. The proposed scheme consists of a deep neural network
(DNN) which is designed to represent the iterative process of fixed-point
iterations for the solution of elliptic PDEs using the boundary integral method
within the framework of potential theory. The number of layers, weights, biases
and hyperparameters are computed in an explainable manner based on the
iterative scheme, and we therefore refer to this as the Potential Fredholm
Neural Network (PFNN). We show that this approach ensures both accuracy and
explainability, achieving small errors in the interior of the domain, and near
machine-precision on the boundary. We provide a constructive proof for the
consistency of the scheme and provide explicit error bounds for both the
interior and boundary of the domain, reflected in the layers of the PFNN. These
error bounds depend on the approximation of the boundary function and the
integral discretization scheme, both of which directly correspond to components
of the Fredholm NN architecture. In this way, we provide an explainable scheme
that explicitly respects the boundary conditions. We assess the performance of
the proposed scheme for the solution of both the forward and inverse problem
for linear and semi-linear elliptic PDEs in two dimensions.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is widely used to model chaotic systems. Among ML
approaches, echo state networks (ESNs) have received considerable attention due
to their simple construction and fast training. However, ESN performance is
highly sensitive to hyperparameter choices and to its random initialization. In
this work, we demonstrate that ESNs constructed using deterministic rules and
simple topologies (MESNs) outperform standard ESNs in the task of chaotic
attractor reconstruction. We use a dataset of more than 90 chaotic systems to
benchmark 10 different minimal deterministic reservoir initializations. We find
that MESNs obtain up to a 41% reduction in error compared to standard ESNs.
Furthermore, we show that the MESNs are more robust, exhibiting less inter-run
variation, and have the ability to reuse hyperparameters across different
systems. Our results illustrate how structured simplicity in ESN design can
outperform stochastic complexity in learning chaotic dynamics.

Abstract: In this work, we present the feedforward neural network based on the
conservative approximation to the derivative from point values, for the
weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes in solving hyperbolic
conservation laws. The feedforward neural network, whose inputs are point
values from the three-point stencil and outputs are two nonlinear weights,
takes the place of the classical WENO weighting procedure. For the training
phase, we employ the supervised learning and create a new labeled dataset for
one-dimensional conservative approximation, where we construct a numerical flux
function from the given point values such that the flux difference approximates
the derivative to high-order accuracy. The symmetric-balancing term is
introduced for the loss function so that it propels the neural network to match
the conservative approximation to the derivative and satisfy the symmetric
property that WENO3-JS and WENO3-Z have in common. The consequent WENO schemes,
WENO3-CADNNs, demonstrate robust generalization across various benchmark
scenarios and resolutions, where they outperform WENO3-Z and achieve accuracy
comparable to WENO5-JS.

Abstract: We propose a physics-informed machine learning framework called P-DivGNN to

multi-scale simulation given a periodic micro-structure mesh and mean,
macro-scale, stress values. This method is based in representing a periodic
micro-structure as a graph, combined with a message passing graph neural
network. We are able to retrieve local stress field distributions, providing
average stress values produced by a mean field reduced order model (ROM) or
Finite Element (FE) simulation at the macro-scale. The prediction of local
stress fields are of utmost importance considering fracture analysis or the
definition of local fatigue criteria. Our model incorporates physical
constraints during training to constraint local stress field equilibrium state
and employs a periodic graph representation to enforce periodic boundary
conditions. The benefits of the proposed physics-informed GNN are evaluated
considering linear and non linear hyperelastic responses applied to varying
geometries. In the non-linear hyperelastic case, the proposed method achieves
significant computational speed-ups compared to FE simulation, making it
particularly attractive for large-scale applications.

Abstract: We consider the task of quantum state certification: given a description of a
hypothesis state $\sigma$ and multiple copies of an unknown state $\rho$, a
tester aims to determine whether the two states are equal or $\epsilon$-far in
trace distance. It is known that $\Theta(d/\epsilon^2)$ copies of $\rho$ are
necessary and sufficient for this task, assuming the tester can make entangled
measurements over all copies [CHW07,OW15,BOW19]. However, these bounds are for
a worst-case $\sigma$, and it is not known what the optimal copy complexity is
for this problem on an instance-by-instance basis. While such instance-optimal
bounds have previously been shown for quantum state certification when the
tester is limited to measurements unentangled across copies [CLO22,CLHL22],
they remained open when testers are unrestricted in the kind of measurements
they can perform.
  We address this open question by proving nearly instance-optimal bounds for
quantum state certification when the tester can perform fully entangled
measurements. Analogously to the unentangled setting, we show that the optimal
copy complexity for certifying $\sigma$ is given by the worst-case complexity
times the fidelity between $\sigma$ and the maximally mixed state. We prove our
lower bounds using a novel quantum analogue of the Ingster-Suslina method,
which is likely to be of independent interest. This method also allows us to
recover the $\Omega(d/\epsilon^2)$ lower bound for mixedness testing [OW15],
i.e., certification of the maximally mixed state, with a surprisingly simple
proof.

Abstract: Soft tissue simulation in virtual environments is becoming increasingly
important for medical applications. However, the high deformability of soft
tissue poses significant challenges. Existing methods rely on segmentation,
meshing and estimation of stiffness properties of tissues. In addition, the
integration of haptic feedback requires precise force estimation to enable a
more immersive experience. We introduce a novel data-driven model, a
conditional graph neural network (cGNN) to tackle this complexity. Our model
takes surface points and the location of applied forces, and is specifically
designed to predict the deformation of the points and the forces exerted on
them. We trained our model on experimentally collected surface tracking data of
a soft tissue phantom and used transfer learning to overcome the data scarcity
by initially training it with mass-spring simulations and fine-tuning it with
the experimental data. This approach improves the generalisation capability of
the model and enables accurate predictions of tissue deformations and
corresponding interaction forces. The results demonstrate that the model can
predict deformations with a distance error of 0.35$\pm$0.03 mm for deformations
up to 30 mm and the force with an absolute error of 0.37$\pm$0.05 N for forces
up to 7.5 N. Our data-driven approach presents a promising solution to the
intricate challenge of simulating soft tissues within virtual environments.
Beyond its applicability in medical simulations, this approach holds the
potential to benefit various fields where realistic soft tissue simulations are
required.

Motivation: 研究动机是针对财务报告中存在的操纵行为，尤其是处于困境的公司可能通过操纵财务数据隐藏问题并获取个人利益。现有方法无法满足攻击者的多目标需求。

Method: 提出了最大违反多目标（MVMO）攻击方法，通过调整攻击者的搜索方向，找到更有效的攻击方式。

Result: 实验结果显示，MVMO攻击在约50%的情况下能实现收益虚增100-200%，同时降低欺诈评分15%。

Conclusion: 通过与律师和专业会计师合作，验证了威胁模型的现实性，表明MVMO攻击在实际中具有可行性。

Abstract: Bad actors, primarily distressed firms, have the incentive and desire to
manipulate their financial reports to hide their distress and derive personal
gains. As attackers, these firms are motivated by potentially millions of
dollars and the availability of many publicly disclosed and used financial
modeling frameworks. Existing attack methods do not work on this data due to
anti-correlated objectives that must both be satisfied for the attacker to
succeed. We introduce Maximum Violated Multi-Objective (MVMO) attacks that
adapt the attacker's search direction to find $20\times$ more satisfying
attacks compared to standard attacks. The result is that in $\approx50\%$ of
cases, a company could inflate their earnings by 100-200%, while simultaneously
reducing their fraud scores by 15%. By working with lawyers and professional
accountants, we ensure our threat model is realistic to how such frauds are
performed in practice.

Abstract: Canine gait analysis using wearable inertial sensors is gaining attention in
veterinary clinical settings, as it provides valuable insights into a range of
mobility impairments. Neurological and orthopedic conditions cannot always be
easily distinguished even by experienced clinicians. The current study explored
and developed a deep learning approach using inertial sensor readings to assess
whether neurological and orthopedic gait could facilitate gait analysis. Our
investigation focused on optimizing both performance and generalizability in
distinguishing between these gait abnormalities. Variations in sensor
configurations, assessment protocols, and enhancements to deep learning model
architectures were further suggested. Using a dataset of 29 dogs, our proposed
approach achieved 96% accuracy in the multiclass classification task
(healthy/orthopedic/neurological) and 82% accuracy in the binary classification
task (healthy/non-healthy) when generalizing to unseen dogs. Our results
demonstrate the potential of inertial-based deep learning models to serve as a
practical and objective diagnostic and clinical aid to differentiate gait
assessment in orthopedic and neurological conditions.

Abstract: The evolution of wireless communication systems requires flexible,
energy-efficient, and cost-effective antenna technologies. Pinching antennas
(PAs), which can dynamically control electromagnetic wave propagation through
binary activation states, have recently emerged as a promising candidate. In
this work, we investigate the problem of optimally selecting a subset of
fixed-position PAs to activate in a waveguide, when the aim is to maximize the
communication rate at a user terminal. Due to the complex interplay between
antenna activation, waveguide-induced phase shifts, and power division, this
problem is formulated as a combinatorial fractional 0-1 quadratic program. To
efficiently solve this challenging problem, we use neural network architectures
of varying complexity to learn activation policies directly from data,
leveraging spatial features and signal structure. Furthermore, we incorporate
user location uncertainty into our training and evaluation pipeline to simulate
realistic deployment conditions. Simulation results demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed models.

Abstract: This study addresses the problem of stable acoustic relay assignment in an
underwater acoustic network. Unlike the objectives of most existing literature,
two distinct objectives, namely classical stable arrangement and ambiguous
stable arrangement, are considered. To achieve these stable arrangements, a
laser chaos-based multi-processing learning (LC-ML) method is introduced to
efficiently obtain high throughput and rapidly attain stability. In order to
sufficiently explore the relay's decision-making, this method uses random
numbers generated by laser chaos to learn the assignment of relays to multiple
source nodes. This study finds that the laser chaos-based random number and
multi-processing in the exchange process have a positive effect on higher
throughput and strong adaptability with environmental changing over time.
Meanwhile, ambiguous cognitions result in the stable configuration with less
volatility compared to accurate ones. This provides a practical and useful
method and can be the basis for relay selection in complex underwater
environments.
