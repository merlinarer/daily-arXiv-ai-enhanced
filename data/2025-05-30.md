### [1] [LoLA: Low-Rank Linear Attention With Sparse Caching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23666)
*Luke McDermott,Robert W. Heath Jr.,Rahul Parhi*

Main category: cs.CL

Relevance: 90.0

TL;DR: LoLA提出了一种低秩线性注意力方法，通过稀疏缓存和分层记忆机制，显著提升了长上下文任务中的性能，同时保持了高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer的长序列推理复杂度高，线性注意力方法虽高效但近似效果差，且无法处理长上下文中的信息召回问题。

Method: LoLA结合低秩线性注意力与稀疏缓存，将键值对分为局部滑动窗口、全局稀疏缓存和递归隐藏状态三层记忆。

Result: 在8K上下文长度任务中，LoLA将基础模型的准确率从0.6%提升至97.4%，缓存大小仅为Llama-3.1的1/4.6。

Conclusion: LoLA是一种轻量级方法，显著提升了线性注意力模型的性能，适用于长上下文任务。

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models suffer from quadratic complexity at
inference on long sequences. Linear attention methods are efficient
alternatives, however, they fail to provide an accurate approximation of
softmax attention. By additionally incorporating sliding window attention into
each linear attention head, this gap can be closed for short context-length
tasks. Unfortunately, these approaches cannot recall important information from
long contexts due to "memory collisions". In this paper , we propose LoLA:
Low-rank Linear Attention with sparse caching. LoLA separately stores
additional key-value pairs that would otherwise interfere with past associative
memories. Moreover, LoLA further closes the gap between linear attention models
and transformers by distributing past key-value pairs into three forms of
memory: (i) recent pairs in a local sliding window; (ii) difficult-to-memorize
pairs in a sparse, global cache; and (iii) generic pairs in the recurrent
hidden state of linear attention. As an inference-only strategy, LoLA enables
pass-key retrieval on up to 8K context lengths on needle-in-a-haystack tasks
from RULER. It boosts the accuracy of the base subquadratic model from 0.6% to
97.4% at 4K context lengths, with a 4.6x smaller cache than that of Llama-3.1
8B. LoLA demonstrates strong performance on zero-shot commonsense reasoning
tasks among 1B and 8B parameter subquadratic models. Finally, LoLA is an
extremely lightweight approach: Nearly all of our results can be reproduced on
a single consumer GPU.

### [2] [Pre-Training Curriculum for Multi-Token Prediction in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22757)
*Ansar Aynetdinov,Alan Akbik*

Main category: cs.CL

Relevance: 85.0

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对小型语言模型（SLMs）的多令牌预测（MTP）训练策略，通过课程学习（前向和反向）改善其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小型语言模型在多令牌预测目标上的困难，提升其下游性能和生成质量。

Method: 采用前向和反向课程学习策略，逐步调整预训练目标复杂度。

Result: 前向课程学习提升了SLMs的MTP性能，同时保留自推测解码优势；反向课程学习虽提升NTP性能，但失去自推测解码优势。

Conclusion: 课程学习策略能有效帮助SLMs适应MTP目标，前向策略在性能和效率上更优。

Abstract: Multi-token prediction (MTP) is a recently proposed pre-training objective
for language models. Rather than predicting only the next token (NTP), MTP
predicts the next $k$ tokens at each prediction step, using multiple prediction
heads. MTP has shown promise in improving downstream performance, inference
speed, and training efficiency, particularly for large models. However, prior
work has shown that smaller language models (SLMs) struggle with the MTP
objective. To address this, we propose a curriculum learning strategy for MTP
training, exploring two variants: a forward curriculum, which gradually
increases the complexity of the pre-training objective from NTP to MTP, and a
reverse curriculum, which does the opposite. Our experiments show that the
forward curriculum enables SLMs to better leverage the MTP objective during
pre-training, improving downstream NTP performance and generative output
quality, while retaining the benefits of self-speculative decoding. The reverse
curriculum achieves stronger NTP performance and output quality, but fails to
provide any self-speculative decoding benefits.

### [3] [MEDAL: A Framework for Benchmarking LLMs as Multilingual Open-Domain Chatbots and Dialogue Evaluators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22777)
*John Mendonça,Alon Lavie,Isabel Trancoso*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MEDAL是一个自动化多智能体框架，用于生成、评估和策划更具代表性和多样性的开放域对话评估基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准数据集多为静态、过时且缺乏多语言覆盖，无法捕捉细微的语言和文化差异，阻碍了聊天机器人及其底层LLM的进一步发展。

Method: 利用多个先进LLM生成多语言用户-聊天机器人对话，基于多样化种子上下文，并使用GPT-4.1进行多维性能分析。随后策划一个新的多语言元评估基准，并人工标注样本。

Result: 发现当前LLM在检测细微问题（如同理心和推理）方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: MEDAL框架为开放域对话评估提供了更全面的基准，揭示了LLM在评估任务中的局限性。

Abstract: As the capabilities of chatbots and their underlying LLMs continue to
dramatically improve, evaluating their performance has increasingly become a
major blocker to their further development. A major challenge is the available
benchmarking datasets, which are largely static, outdated, and lacking in
multilingual coverage, limiting their ability to capture subtle linguistic and
cultural variations. This paper introduces MEDAL, an automated multi-agent
framework for generating, evaluating, and curating more representative and
diverse open-domain dialogue evaluation benchmarks. Our approach leverages
several state-of-the-art LLMs to generate user-chatbot multilingual dialogues,
conditioned on varied seed contexts. A strong LLM (GPT-4.1) is then used for a
multidimensional analysis of the performance of the chatbots, uncovering
noticeable cross-lingual performance differences. Guided by this large-scale
evaluation, we curate a new meta-evaluation multilingual benchmark and
human-annotate samples with nuanced quality judgments. This benchmark is then
used to assess the ability of several reasoning and non-reasoning LLMs to act
as evaluators of open-domain dialogues. We find that current LLMs struggle to
detect nuanced issues, particularly those involving empathy and reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在自动化生成系统综述（SR）方面的能力，发现当前模型在批判性评估证据和多文档推理方面仍不及领域专家。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着科学文献的爆炸式增长，利用LLMs自动化生成SR的需求增加，但其能否达到专家水平尚不明确。

Method: 研究提出了MedEvidence基准，评估了24种LLMs在100个SR及其基础研究上的表现。

Result: 发现推理能力不必然提升性能，模型大小与性能无直接关系，知识微调反而降低准确性。模型普遍表现过度自信且缺乏科学怀疑。

Conclusion: LLMs在匹配专家SR结论方面仍需改进，当前部署可能存在问题。

Abstract: Systematic reviews (SR), in which experts summarize and analyze evidence
across individual studies to provide insights on a specialized topic, are a
cornerstone for evidence-based clinical decision-making, research, and policy.
Given the exponential growth of scientific articles, there is growing interest
in using large language models (LLMs) to automate SR generation. However, the
ability of LLMs to critically assess evidence and reason across multiple
documents to provide recommendations at the same proficiency as domain experts
remains poorly characterized. We therefore ask: Can LLMs match the conclusions
of systematic reviews written by clinical experts when given access to the same
studies? To explore this question, we present MedEvidence, a benchmark pairing
findings from 100 SRs with the studies they are based on. We benchmark 24 LLMs
on MedEvidence, including reasoning, non-reasoning, medical specialist, and
models across varying sizes (from 7B-700B). Through our systematic evaluation,
we find that reasoning does not necessarily improve performance, larger models
do not consistently yield greater gains, and knowledge-based fine-tuning
degrades accuracy on MedEvidence. Instead, most models exhibit similar
behavior: performance tends to degrade as token length increases, their
responses show overconfidence, and, contrary to human experts, all models show
a lack of scientific skepticism toward low-quality findings. These results
suggest that more work is still required before LLMs can reliably match the
observations from expert-conducted SRs, even though these systems are already
deployed and being used by clinicians. We release our codebase and benchmark to
the broader research community to further investigate LLM-based SR systems.

### [5] [Self-Critique and Refinement for Faithful Natural Language Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22823)

TL;DR: 论文提出SR-NLE框架，通过自我批判和迭代优化提升大语言模型（LLMs）生成的自然语言解释（NLEs）的忠实度，无需外部监督。实验表明，该方法显著降低了不忠实率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs生成的自然语言解释往往不能忠实反映模型的真实推理过程，而自我批判和优化的能力尚未用于提升解释的忠实度。

Method: 引入SR-NLE框架，通过自然语言自我反馈和基于特征归因的新反馈机制，迭代优化解释的忠实度。

Result: 在三个数据集和四种LLMs上，SR-NLE将平均不忠实率从54.81%降至36.02%，绝对降低18.79%。

Conclusion: LLMs可以通过适当的反馈机制优化其解释，更好地反映真实推理过程，无需额外训练或微调。

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), natural language
explanations (NLEs) have become increasingly important for understanding model
predictions. However, these explanations often fail to faithfully represent the
model's actual reasoning process. While existing work has demonstrated that
LLMs can self-critique and refine their initial outputs for various tasks, this
capability remains unexplored for improving explanation faithfulness. To
address this gap, we introduce Self-critique and Refinement for Natural
Language Explanations (SR-NLE), a framework that enables models to improve the
faithfulness of their own explanations -- specifically, post-hoc NLEs --
through an iterative critique and refinement process without external
supervision. Our framework leverages different feedback mechanisms to guide the
refinement process, including natural language self-feedback and, notably, a
novel feedback approach based on feature attribution that highlights important
input words. Our experiments across three datasets and four state-of-the-art
LLMs demonstrate that SR-NLE significantly reduces unfaithfulness rates, with
our best method achieving an average unfaithfulness rate of 36.02%, compared to
54.81% for baseline -- an absolute reduction of 18.79%. These findings reveal
that the investigated LLMs can indeed refine their explanations to better
reflect their actual reasoning process, requiring only appropriate guidance
through feedback without additional training or fine-tuning.

Motivation: 研究LLMs生成评估基准的能力，以低成本替代人工众包，同时确保基准的有效性和挑战性。

Method: 通过两个案例研究（CondaQA和DROP），比较LLM生成的基准与人工众包基准的有效性和难度。

Result: LLM生成的基准在有效性上接近人工基准，但挑战性较低。

Conclusion: 需重新评估LLMs生成基准的广泛使用，因其可能降低评估的严格性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for data generation.
However, creating evaluation benchmarks raises the bar for this emerging
paradigm. Benchmarks must target specific phenomena, penalize exploiting
shortcuts, and be challenging. Through two case studies, we investigate whether
LLMs can meet these demands by generating reasoning over-text benchmarks and
comparing them to those created through careful crowdsourcing. Specifically, we
evaluate both the validity and difficulty of LLM-generated versions of two
high-quality reading comprehension datasets: CondaQA, which evaluates reasoning
about negation, and DROP, which targets reasoning about quantities. We find
that prompting LLMs can produce variants of these datasets that are often valid
according to the annotation guidelines, at a fraction of the cost of the
original crowdsourcing effort. However, we show that they are less challenging
for LLMs than their human-authored counterparts. This finding sheds light on
what may have been lost by generating evaluation data with LLMs, and calls for
critically reassessing the immediate use of this increasingly prevalent
approach to benchmark creation.

Motivation: 现有位置编码方法缺乏理论清晰性，且评估指标有限，无法充分支持其外推能力。

Method: 提出BAM框架，将位置编码作为概率模型中的先验，并引入广义高斯位置先验。

Result: BAM在500倍训练上下文长度下仍能准确检索信息，优于现有方法，同时保持较低的困惑度和参数增量。

Conclusion: BAM为位置编码提供了理论支持，显著提升了长上下文泛化能力。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models rely on positional encoding (PE) to handle
token order and support context length extrapolation. However, existing PE
methods lack theoretical clarity and rely on limited evaluation metrics to
substantiate their extrapolation claims. We propose the Bayesian Attention
Mechanism (BAM), a theoretical framework that formulates positional encoding as
a prior within a probabilistic model. BAM unifies existing methods (e.g., NoPE
and ALiBi) and motivates a new Generalized Gaussian positional prior that
substantially improves long-context generalization. Empirically, BAM enables
accurate information retrieval at $500\times$ the training context length,
outperforming previous state-of-the-art context length generalization in long
context retrieval accuracy while maintaining comparable perplexity and
introducing minimal additional parameters.

Method: 方法包括在XReasoning基准上评估两种主流LRMs家族，并通过提示干预和少量示例的微调来改善多语言推理能力。

Conclusion: 结论指出当前LRMs的多语言推理能力有限，并提出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) with thinking traces have shown strong
performance on English reasoning tasks. However, their ability to think in
other languages is less studied. This capability is as important as answer
accuracy for real world applications because users may find the reasoning trace
useful for oversight only when it is expressed in their own language. We
comprehensively evaluate two leading families of LRMs on our XReasoning
benchmark and find that even the most advanced models often revert to English
or produce fragmented reasoning in other languages, revealing a substantial gap
in multilingual reasoning. Prompt based interventions that force models to
reason in the users language improve readability and oversight but reduce
answer accuracy, exposing an important trade off. We further show that targeted
post training on just 100 examples mitigates this mismatch, though some
accuracy loss remains. Our results highlight the limited multilingual reasoning
capabilities of current LRMs and outline directions for future work. Code and
data are available at https://github.com/Betswish/mCoT-XReasoning.

Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of large language models in
understanding long-term context. It proposes a model architecture equipped with
a long-term memory mechanism to improve the retention and retrieval of semantic
information across paragraphs and dialogue turns. The model integrates explicit
memory units, gated writing mechanisms, and attention-based reading modules. A
forgetting function is introduced to enable dynamic updates of memory content,
enhancing the model's ability to manage historical information. To further
improve the effectiveness of memory operations, the study designs a joint
training objective. This combines the main task loss with constraints on memory
writing and forgetting. It guides the model to learn better memory strategies
during task execution. Systematic evaluation across multiple subtasks shows
that the model achieves clear advantages in text generation consistency,
stability in multi-turn question answering, and accuracy in cross-context
reasoning. In particular, the model demonstrates strong semantic retention and
contextual coherence in long-text tasks and complex question answering
scenarios. It effectively mitigates the context loss and semantic drift
problems commonly faced by traditional language models when handling long-term
dependencies. The experiments also include analysis of different memory
structures, capacity sizes, and control strategies. These results further
confirm the critical role of memory mechanisms in language understanding. They
demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach in both
architectural design and performance outcomes.

Conclusion: 数据与参数的交互对模型合并至关重要，OSRM为LoRA模型合并提供了即插即用的解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LMs) for individual tasks yields strong
performance but is expensive for deployment and storage. Recent works explore
model merging to combine multiple task-specific models into a single multi-task
model without additional training. However, existing merging methods often fail
for models fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation (LoRA), due to significant
performance degradation. In this paper, we show that this issue arises from a
previously overlooked interplay between model parameters and data
distributions. We propose Orthogonal Subspaces for Robust model Merging (OSRM)
to constrain the LoRA subspace *prior* to fine-tuning, ensuring that updates
relevant to one task do not adversely shift outputs for others. Our approach
can seamlessly integrate with most existing merging algorithms, reducing the
unintended interference among tasks. Extensive experiments on eight datasets,
tested with three widely used LMs and two large LMs, demonstrate that our
method not only boosts merging performance but also preserves single-task
accuracy. Furthermore, our approach exhibits greater robustness to the
hyperparameters of merging. These results highlight the importance of
data-parameter interaction in model merging and offer a plug-and-play solution
for merging LoRA models.

R1-style reinforcement learning framework designed explicitly to enhance
single-step reasoning and planning for business-oriented web navigation tasks.
We employ a structured reward function that evaluates both adherence to output
formats and correctness of actions, enabling WorkForceAgent-R1 to implicitly

expert demonstrations. Extensive experiments on the WorkArena benchmark
demonstrate that WorkForceAgent-R1 substantially outperforms SFT baselines by

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to memorize and recall English text
from their pretraining data. However, the extent to which this ability
generalizes to non-English languages or transfers across languages remains
unclear. This paper investigates multilingual and cross-lingual memorization in
LLMs, probing if memorized content in one language (e.g., English) can be
recalled when presented in translation. To do so, we introduce OWL, a dataset
of 31.5K aligned excerpts from 20 books in ten languages, including English
originals, official translations (Vietnamese, Spanish, Turkish), and new
translations in six low-resource languages (Sesotho, Yoruba, Maithili,
Malagasy, Setswana, Tahitian). We evaluate memorization across model families
and sizes through three tasks: (1) direct probing, which asks the model to
identify a book's title and author; (2) name cloze, which requires predicting
masked character names; and (3) prefix probing, which involves generating
continuations. We find that LLMs consistently recall content across languages,
even for texts without direct translation in pretraining data. GPT-4o, for
example, identifies authors and titles 69% of the time and masked entities 6%
of the time in newly translated excerpts. Perturbations (e.g., masking
characters, shuffling words) modestly reduce direct probing accuracy (7% drop
for shuffled official translations). Our results highlight the extent of
cross-lingual memorization and provide insights on the differences between the
models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in zero-shot
summarization, but often struggle to model document structure and identify
salient information in long texts. In this work, we introduce StrucSum, a
training-free prompting framework that enhances LLM reasoning through
sentence-level graph structures. StrucSum injects structural signals into
prompts via three targeted strategies: Neighbor-Aware Prompting (NAP) for local
context, Centrality-Aware Prompting (CAP) for importance estimation, and
Centrality-Guided Masking (CGM) for efficient input reduction. Experiments on
ArXiv, PubMed, and Multi-News demonstrate that StrucSum consistently improves
both summary quality and factual consistency over unsupervised baselines and
vanilla prompting. Notably, on ArXiv, it boosts FactCC and SummaC by 19.2 and
9.7 points, indicating stronger alignment between summaries and source content.
These findings suggest that structure-aware prompting is a simple yet effective
approach for zero-shot extractive summarization with LLMs, without any training

Conclusion: ToMAP通过增强对手意识，显著提升了LLM在说服任务中的表现，适用于长对话和逻辑策略。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising potential in persuasion,
but existing works on training LLM persuaders are still preliminary. Notably,
while humans are skilled in modeling their opponent's thoughts and opinions
proactively and dynamically, current LLMs struggle with such Theory of Mind
(ToM) reasoning, resulting in limited diversity and opponent awareness. To
address this limitation, we introduce Theory of Mind Augmented Persuader
(ToMAP), a novel approach for building more flexible persuader agents by
incorporating two theory of mind modules that enhance the persuader's awareness
and analysis of the opponent's mental state. Specifically, we begin by
prompting the persuader to consider possible objections to the target central
claim, and then use a text encoder paired with a trained MLP classifier to
predict the opponent's current stance on these counterclaims. Our carefully
designed reinforcement learning schema enables the persuader learns how to
analyze opponent-related information and utilize it to generate more effective
arguments. Experiments show that the ToMAP persuader, while containing only 3B
parameters, outperforms much larger baselines, like GPT-4o, with a relative
gain of 39.4% across multiple persuadee models and diverse corpora. Notably,
ToMAP exhibits complex reasoning chains and reduced repetition during training,
which leads to more diverse and effective arguments. The opponent-aware feature
of ToMAP also makes it suitable for long conversations and enables it to employ
more logical and opponent-aware strategies. These results underscore our
method's effectiveness and highlight its potential for developing more
persuasive language agents. Code is available at:

Conclusion: DyePack提供了一种可靠且高效的方法来检测测试集污染。

Abstract: Open benchmarks are essential for evaluating and advancing large language
models, offering reproducibility and transparency. However, their accessibility
makes them likely targets of test set contamination. In this work, we introduce
DyePack, a framework that leverages backdoor attacks to identify models that
used benchmark test sets during training, without requiring access to the loss,
logits, or any internal details of the model. Like how banks mix dye packs with
their money to mark robbers, DyePack mixes backdoor samples with the test data
to flag models that trained on it. We propose a principled design incorporating
multiple backdoors with stochastic targets, enabling exact false positive rate
(FPR) computation when flagging every model. This provably prevents false
accusations while providing strong evidence for every detected case of
contamination. We evaluate DyePack on five models across three datasets,
covering both multiple-choice and open-ended generation tasks. For
multiple-choice questions, it successfully detects all contaminated models with
guaranteed FPRs as low as 0.000073% on MMLU-Pro and 0.000017% on Big-Bench-Hard
using eight backdoors. For open-ended generation tasks, it generalizes well and
identifies all contaminated models on Alpaca with a guaranteed false positive
rate of just 0.127% using six backdoors.

Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to significant
improvements in various service domains, including search, recommendation, and
chatbot applications. However, applying state-of-the-art (SOTA) research to
industrial settings presents challenges, as it requires maintaining flexible
conversational abilities while also strictly complying with service-specific

probabilistic nature of LLMs. In this paper, we propose our approach to
addressing this challenge and detail the strategies we employed to overcome
their inherent limitations in real-world applications. We conduct a practical
case study of a conversational agent designed for the e-commerce domain,
detailing our implementation workflow and optimizations. Our findings provide
insights into bridging the gap between academic research and real-world
application, introducing a framework for developing scalable, controllable, and
reliable AI-driven agents.

Abstract: Fine-tuning LLMs with datasets containing stealthy backdoors from publishers
poses security risks to downstream applications. Mainstream detection methods
either identify poisoned samples by analyzing the prediction probability of
poisoned classification models or rely on the rewriting model to eliminate the
stealthy triggers. However, the former cannot be applied to generation tasks,
while the latter may degrade generation performance and introduce new triggers.
Therefore, efficiently eliminating stealthy poisoned samples for LLMs remains
an urgent problem. We observe that after applying TF-IDF clustering to the
sample response, there are notable differences in the intra-class distances
between clean and poisoned samples. Poisoned samples tend to cluster closely
because of their specific malicious outputs, whereas clean samples are more
scattered due to their more varied responses. Thus, in this paper, we propose a
stealthy backdoor sample detection method based on Reference-Filtration and
Tfidf-Clustering mechanisms (RFTC). Specifically, we first compare the sample
response with the reference model's outputs and consider the sample suspicious
if there's a significant discrepancy. And then we perform TF-IDF clustering on
these suspicious samples to identify the true poisoned samples based on the
intra-class distance. Experiments on two machine translation datasets and one
QA dataset demonstrate that RFTC outperforms baselines in backdoor detection
and model performance. Further analysis of different reference models also
confirms the effectiveness of our Reference-Filtration.

Result: 实验表明，现有KE方法在上下文存在时容易失败，而CoRE显著提高了编辑成功率并保持模型能力。

Conclusion: 上下文对知识编辑的影响显著，CoRE方法有效提升了编辑的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Knowledge editing (KE) methods offer an efficient way to modify knowledge in
large language models. Current KE evaluations typically assess editing success
by considering only the edited knowledge without any preceding contexts. In
real-world applications, however, preceding contexts often trigger the
retrieval of the original knowledge and undermine the intended edit. To address
this issue, we develop CHED -- a benchmark designed to evaluate the context
robustness of KE methods. Evaluations on CHED show that they often fail when
preceding contexts are present. To mitigate this shortcoming, we introduce
CoRE, a KE method designed to strengthen context robustness by minimizing
context-sensitive variance in hidden states of the model for edited knowledge.
This method not only improves the editing success rate in situations where a
preceding context is present but also preserves the overall capabilities of the
model. We provide an in-depth analysis of the differing impacts of preceding
contexts when introduced as user utterances versus assistant responses, and we
dissect attention-score patterns to assess how specific tokens influence
editing success.

Conclusion: 证明了小参数LLM在ICL范式中的可行性和参数效率。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) technique based on Large Language Models (LLMs) has
gained prominence in Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks for its lower
computing resource consumption, less manual labeling overhead, and stronger
generalizability. Nevertheless, most ICL-based NER methods depend on
large-parameter LLMs: the open-source models demand substantial computational
resources for deployment and inference, while the closed-source ones incur high
API costs, raise data-privacy concerns, and hinder community collaboration. To
address this question, we propose an Ensemble Learning Method for Named Entity
Recognition (EL4NER), which aims at aggregating the ICL outputs of multiple
open-source, small-parameter LLMs to enhance overall performance in NER tasks
at less deployment and inference cost. Specifically, our method comprises three
key components. First, we design a task decomposition-based pipeline that
facilitates deep, multi-stage ensemble learning. Second, we introduce a novel
span-level sentence similarity algorithm to establish an ICL demonstration
retrieval mechanism better suited for NER tasks. Third, we incorporate a
self-validation mechanism to mitigate the noise introduced during the ensemble
process. We evaluated EL4NER on multiple widely adopted NER datasets from
diverse domains. Our experimental results indicate that EL4NER surpasses most
closed-source, large-parameter LLM-based methods at a lower parameter cost and
even attains state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among ICL-based methods on
certain datasets. These results show the parameter efficiency of EL4NER and
underscore the feasibility of employing open-source, small-parameter LLMs
within the ICL paradigm for NER tasks.

Conclusion: RAGRouter通过动态路由机制显著提升了RAG场景下的性能，并在低延迟约束下实现了性能与效率的平衡。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) significantly improves the performance
of Large Language Models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks. However, varying
response quality across LLMs under RAG necessitates intelligent routing
mechanisms, which select the most suitable model for each query from multiple
retrieval-augmented LLMs via a dedicated router model. We observe that external
documents dynamically affect LLMs' ability to answer queries, while existing
routing methods, which rely on static parametric knowledge representations,
exhibit suboptimal performance in RAG scenarios. To address this, we formally
define the new retrieval-augmented LLM routing problem, incorporating the
influence of retrieved documents into the routing framework. We propose
RAGRouter, a RAG-aware routing design, which leverages document embeddings and
RAG capability embeddings with contrastive learning to capture knowledge
representation shifts and enable informed routing decisions. Extensive
experiments on diverse knowledge-intensive tasks and retrieval settings show
that RAGRouter outperforms the best individual LLM by 3.61% on average and
existing routing methods by 3.29%-9.33%. With an extended score-threshold-based
mechanism, it also achieves strong performance-efficiency trade-offs under
low-latency constraints.

Conclusion: CoCoS有效提升了小语言模型的自我修正能力，为代码生成任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Self-correction has demonstrated potential in code generation by allowing
language models to revise and improve their outputs through successive
refinement. Recent studies have explored prompting-based strategies that
incorporate verification or feedback loops using proprietary models, as well as
training-based methods that leverage their strong reasoning capabilities.
However, whether smaller models possess the capacity to effectively guide their
outputs through self-reflection remains unexplored. Our findings reveal that
smaller models struggle to exhibit reflective revision behavior across both
self-correction paradigms. In response, we introduce CoCoS, an approach
designed to enhance the ability of small language models for multi-turn code
correction. Specifically, we propose an online reinforcement learning objective
that trains the model to confidently maintain correct outputs while
progressively correcting incorrect outputs as turns proceed. Our approach
features an accumulated reward function that aggregates rewards across the
entire trajectory and a fine-grained reward better suited to multi-turn
correction scenarios. This facilitates the model in enhancing initial response
quality while achieving substantial improvements through self-correction. With
1B-scale models, CoCoS achieves improvements of 35.8% on the MBPP and 27.7% on
HumanEval compared to the baselines.

Conclusion: 改进LLM生成数据的多样性和正确性有助于提升关系抽取任务的性能。

Abstract: Using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate training data can potentially
be a preferable way to improve zero or few-shot NLP tasks. However, many
problems remain to be investigated for this direction. For the task of Relation
Extraction (RE), we find that samples generated by directly prompting LLMs may
easily have high structural similarities with each other. They tend to use a
limited variety of phrasing while expressing the relation between a pair of
entities. Therefore, in this paper, we study how to effectively improve the
diversity of the training samples generated with LLMs for RE, while also
maintaining their correctness. We first try to make the LLMs produce dissimilar
samples by directly giving instructions in In-Context Learning (ICL) prompts.
Then, we propose an approach to fine-tune LLMs for diversity training sample
generation through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our experiments on
commonly used RE datasets show that both attempts can improve the quality of
the generated training data. We also find that comparing with directly
performing RE with an LLM, training a non-LLM RE model with its generated
samples may lead to better performance.

Abstract: Human preference data plays a critical role in aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human values. However, collecting such data is often expensive and
inefficient, posing a significant scalability challenge. To address this, we
introduce Alignment Data Map, a GPT-4o-assisted tool for analyzing and
diagnosing preference data. Using GPT-4o as a proxy for LLM alignment, we
compute alignment scores for LLM-generated responses to instructions from
existing preference datasets. These scores are then used to construct an
Alignment Data Map based on their mean and variance. Our experiments show that
using only 33 percent of the data, specifically samples in the high-mean,
low-variance region, achieves performance comparable to or better than using
the entire dataset. This finding suggests that the Alignment Data Map can
significantly improve data collection efficiency by identifying high-quality
samples for LLM alignment without requiring explicit annotations. Moreover, the
Alignment Data Map can diagnose existing preference datasets. Our analysis
shows that it effectively detects low-impact or potentially misannotated
samples. Source code is available online.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated exceptional performance across
multiple crosslingual NLP tasks, including machine translation (MT). However,
persistent challenges remain in addressing context-sensitive units (CSUs), such
as polysemous words. These CSUs not only affect the local translation accuracy
of LLMs, but also affect LLMs' understanding capability for sentences and
tasks, and even lead to translation failure. To address this problem, we
propose a simple but effective method to enhance LLMs' MT capabilities by
acquiring CSUs and applying semantic focus. Specifically, we dynamically
analyze and identify translation challenges, then incorporate them into LLMs in
a structured manner to mitigate mistranslations or misunderstandings of CSUs
caused by information flattening. Efficiently activate LLMs to identify and
apply relevant knowledge from its vast data pool in this way, ensuring more
accurate translations for translating difficult terms. On a benchmark dataset
of MT, our proposed method achieved competitive performance compared to
multiple existing open-sourced MT baseline models. It demonstrates
effectiveness and robustness across multiple language pairs, including both
similar language pairs and distant language pairs. Notably, the proposed method
requires no additional model training and enhances LLMs' performance across
multiple NLP tasks with minimal resource consumption.

Abstract: Large Language Model-based multi-agent systems (MAS) have shown remarkable
progress in solving complex tasks through collaborative reasoning and

across structurally similar tasks. To address this, we introduce multi-agent
cross-task experiential learning (MAEL), a novel framework that endows
LLM-driven agents with explicit cross-task learning and experience
accumulation. We model the task-solving workflow on a graph-structured
multi-agent collaboration network, where agents propagate information and
coordinate via explicit connectivity. During the experiential learning phase,
we quantify the quality for each step in the task-solving workflow and store
the resulting rewards along with the corresponding inputs and outputs into each
agent's individual experience pool. During inference, agents retrieve
high-reward, task-relevant experiences as few-shot examples to enhance the
effectiveness of each reasoning step, thereby enabling more accurate and
efficient multi-agent collaboration. Experimental results on diverse datasets
demonstrate that MAEL empowers agents to learn from prior task experiences
effectively-achieving faster convergence and producing higher-quality solutions
on current tasks.

newly encountered target tasks. This not only allows the acquisition of
experience without extensive costs of previous methods, but also offers a novel
path for the generalization of LLMs. Experimental results on 13 datasets

Abstract: In recent years, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made
significant progress but continue to face inherent challenges in multimodal
reasoning, which requires multi-level (e.g., perception, reasoning) and
multi-granular (e.g., multi-step reasoning chain) advanced inferencing. Prior
work on estimating model confidence tends to focus on the overall response for
training and calibration, but fails to assess confidence in each reasoning
step, leading to undesirable hallucination snowballing. In this work, we
present MMBoundary, a novel framework that advances the knowledge boundary
awareness of MLLMs through reasoning step confidence calibration. To achieve
this, we propose to incorporate complementary textual and cross-modal
self-rewarding signals to estimate confidence at each step of the MLLM
reasoning process. In addition to supervised fine-tuning MLLM on this set of
self-rewarded confidence estimation signal for initial confidence expression
warm-up, we introduce a reinforcement learning stage with multiple reward
functions for further aligning model knowledge and calibrating confidence at
each reasoning step, enhancing reasoning chain self-correction. Empirical
results show that MMBoundary significantly outperforms existing methods across
diverse domain datasets and metrics, achieving an average of 7.5% reduction in

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved unprecedented capabilities in
generating human-like text, posing subtle yet significant challenges for
information integrity across critical domains, including education, social
media, and academia, enabling sophisticated misinformation campaigns,
compromising healthcare guidance, and facilitating targeted propaganda. This
challenge becomes severe, particularly in under-explored and low-resource
languages like Arabic. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation of
Arabic machine-generated text, examining multiple generation strategies
(generation from the title only, content-aware generation, and text refinement)
across diverse model architectures (ALLaM, Jais, Llama, and GPT-4) in academic,
and social media domains. Our stylometric analysis reveals distinctive
linguistic patterns differentiating human-written from machine-generated Arabic
text across these varied contexts. Despite their human-like qualities, we
demonstrate that LLMs produce detectable signatures in their Arabic outputs,
with domain-specific characteristics that vary significantly between different
contexts. Based on these insights, we developed BERT-based detection models
that achieved exceptional performance in formal contexts (up to 99.9\%
F1-score) with strong precision across model architectures. Our cross-domain
analysis confirms generalization challenges previously reported in the
literature. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the most
comprehensive investigation of Arabic machine-generated text to date, uniquely
combining multiple prompt generation methods, diverse model architectures, and
in-depth stylometric analysis across varied textual domains, establishing a
foundation for developing robust, linguistically-informed detection systems
essential for preserving information integrity in Arabic-language contexts.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs)
with external context, but retrieved passages are often lengthy, noisy, or
exceed input limits. Existing compression methods typically require supervised
training of dedicated compression models, increasing cost and reducing
portability. We propose Sentinel, a lightweight sentence-level compression
framework that reframes context filtering as an attention-based understanding
task. Rather than training a compression model, Sentinel probes decoder
attention from an off-the-shelf 0.5B proxy LLM using a lightweight classifier
to identify sentence relevance. Empirically, we find that query-context
relevance estimation is consistent across model scales, with 0.5B proxies
closely matching the behaviors of larger models. On the LongBench benchmark,
Sentinel achieves up to 5$\times$ compression while matching the QA performance
of 7B-scale compression systems. Our results suggest that probing native
attention signals enables fast, effective, and question-aware context
compression. Code available at: https://github.com/yzhangchuck/Sentinel.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长文本生成中LLM的事实性错误影响可靠性，但响应长度对事实性的影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 引入自动双层长文本事实性评估框架，进行控制实验验证长度偏差，并检验三个假设（错误传播、长上下文、知识耗尽）。

Result: 发现响应越长事实性越低，主要原因是知识耗尽。

Conclusion: 知识耗尽是长文本生成中事实性下降的主要原因。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used for long-form text generation.
However, factual errors in the responses would undermine their reliability.
Despite growing attention to LLM factuality, the effect of response length on
factuality remains underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate
this relationship by first introducing an automatic and bi-level long-form
factuality evaluation framework, which achieves high agreement with human
annotations while being cost-effective. Using this framework, we conduct
controlled experiments and find that longer responses exhibit lower factual
precision, confirming the presence of length bias. To explain this phenomenon,
we empirically examine three hypotheses: error propagation, long context, and
facts exhaustion. Our results reveal that facts exhaustion, where the model
gradually exhausts more reliable knowledge, is the primary cause of factual
degradation, rather than the other two hypotheses.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems
are increasingly deployed in industry applications, yet their reliability
remains hampered by challenges in detecting hallucinations. While supervised
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods that leverage LLM hidden states -- such as
activation tracing and representation analysis -- show promise, their
dependence on extensively annotated datasets limits scalability in real-world
applications. This paper addresses the critical bottleneck of data annotation
by investigating the feasibility of reducing training data requirements for two
SOTA hallucination detection frameworks: Lookback Lens, which analyzes
attention head dynamics, and probing-based approaches, which decode internal
model representations. We propose a methodology combining efficient
classification algorithms with dimensionality reduction techniques to minimize
sample size demands while maintaining competitive performance. Evaluations on
standardized question-answering RAG benchmarks show that our approach achieves
performance comparable to strong proprietary LLM-based baselines with only 250
training samples. These results highlight the potential of lightweight,
data-efficient paradigms for industrial deployment, particularly in
annotation-constrained scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有直接对齐方法（如DPO）在优化大语言模型时，虽然能匹配相对偏好，但会降低绝对似然，导致输出偏离预期模式。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过重新分解DPO的损失函数，发现其隐含简化了一个正则项，恢复完整版本后解决了似然不确定性问题，并提出了PRO方法。

Result: PRO在成对、二元和标量反馈场景中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PRO是一种统一的对齐方法，能有效消除似然不确定性，适用于多种反馈类型。

Abstract: Direct alignment methods typically optimize large language models (LLMs) by
contrasting the likelihoods of preferred versus dispreferred responses. While
effective in steering LLMs to match relative preference, these methods are
frequently noted for decreasing the absolute likelihoods of example responses.
As a result, aligned models tend to generate outputs that deviate from the
expected patterns, exhibiting reward-hacking effect even without a reward
model. This undesired consequence exposes a fundamental limitation in
contrastive alignment, which we characterize as likelihood underdetermination.
In this work, we revisit direct preference optimization (DPO) -- the seminal
direct alignment method -- and demonstrate that its loss theoretically admits a
decomposed reformulation. The reformulated loss not only broadens applicability
to a wider range of feedback types, but also provides novel insights into the
underlying cause of likelihood underdetermination. Specifically, the standard
DPO implementation implicitly oversimplifies a regularizer in the reformulated
loss, and reinstating its complete version effectively resolves the
underdetermination issue. Leveraging these findings, we introduce PRoximalized
PReference Optimization (PRO), a unified method to align with diverse feeback
types, eliminating likelihood underdetermination through an efficient
approximation of the complete regularizer. Comprehensive experiments show the
superiority of PRO over existing methods in scenarios involving pairwise,
binary and scalar feedback.

Abstract: In this position paper we raise critical awareness of a realistic view of LLM
capabilities that eschews extreme alternative views that LLMs are either
"stochastic parrots" or in possession of "emergent" advanced reasoning
capabilities, which, due to their unpredictable emergence, constitute an
existential threat. Our middle-ground view is that LLMs extrapolate from priors
from their training data, and that a mechanism akin to in-context learning
enables the targeting of the appropriate information from which to extrapolate.
We call this "context-directed extrapolation." Under this view, substantiated
though existing literature, while reasoning capabilities go well beyond
stochastic parroting, such capabilities are predictable, controllable, not
indicative of advanced reasoning akin to high-level cognitive capabilities in
humans, and not infinitely scalable with additional training. As a result,
fears of uncontrollable emergence of agency are allayed, while research
advances are appropriately refocused on the processes of context-directed
extrapolation and how this interacts with training data to produce valuable
capabilities in LLMs. Future work can therefore explore alternative augmenting
techniques that do not rely on inherent advanced reasoning in LLMs.

Motivation: 传统的令牌级奖励模型（PRMs）在生成语言建模和奖励建模之间存在冲突，可能导致不稳定的训练和不准确的信用分配。本文旨在通过解耦这两种建模方式，提出更稳定的令牌级奖励模型。

Result: 实验表明，Q-RM在多个基准测试中均优于基线方法。例如，在数学推理任务中，Pass@1分数比ORM基线提高了5.85/4.70分，比令牌级PRM提高了4.56/5.73分。此外，Q-RM显著提升了训练效率，收敛速度比ORM快12倍，比步级PRM快11倍。

Conclusion: Q-RM通过解耦奖励建模和语言生成，提供了一种更稳定和高效的令牌级奖励模型，显著提升了LLM在复杂推理任务中的性能。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) provide more nuanced supervision compared to
outcome reward models (ORMs) for optimizing policy models, positioning them as
a promising approach to enhancing the capabilities of LLMs in complex reasoning
tasks. Recent efforts have advanced PRMs from step-level to token-level
granularity by integrating reward modeling into the training of generative
models, with reward scores derived from token generation probabilities.
However, the conflict between generative language modeling and reward modeling
may introduce instability and lead to inaccurate credit assignments. To address
this challenge, we revisit token-level reward assignment by decoupling reward
modeling from language generation and derive a token-level reward model through
the optimization of a discriminative policy, termed the Q-function Reward Model
(Q-RM). We theoretically demonstrate that Q-RM explicitly learns token-level
Q-functions from preference data without relying on fine-grained annotations.
In our experiments, Q-RM consistently outperforms all baseline methods across
various benchmarks. For example, when integrated into PPO/REINFORCE algorithms,
Q-RM enhances the average Pass@1 score by 5.85/4.70 points on mathematical
reasoning tasks compared to the ORM baseline, and by 4.56/5.73 points compared
to the token-level PRM counterpart. Moreover, reinforcement learning with Q-RM
significantly enhances training efficiency, achieving convergence 12 times
faster than ORM on GSM8K and 11 times faster than step-level PRM on MATH. Code

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了从CoTs中提取信息和对齐人类标签分布的能力。

Abstract: The recent rise of reasoning-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs)--which
generate chains of thought (CoTs) before giving the final answer--has attracted
significant attention and offers new opportunities for gaining insights into
human label variation, which refers to plausible differences in how multiple
annotators label the same data instance. Prior work has shown that
LLM-generated explanations can help align model predictions with human label
distributions, but typically adopt a reverse paradigm: producing explanations
based on given answers. In contrast, CoTs provide a forward reasoning path that
may implicitly embed rationales for each answer option, before generating the
answers. We thus propose a novel LLM-based pipeline enriched with
linguistically-grounded discourse segmenters to extract supporting and opposing
statements for each answer option from CoTs with improved accuracy. We also
propose a rank-based HLV evaluation framework that prioritizes the ranking of
answers over exact scores, which instead favor direct comparison of label
distributions. Our method outperforms a direct generation method as well as
baselines on three datasets, and shows better alignment of ranking methods with
humans, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs) via jailbreaking

Abstract: Factual knowledge extraction aims to explicitly extract knowledge
parameterized in pre-trained language models for application in downstream
tasks. While prior work has been investigating the impact of supervised
fine-tuning data on the factuality of large language models (LLMs), its
mechanism remains poorly understood. We revisit this impact through systematic
experiments, with a particular focus on the factuality gap that arises when
fine-tuning on known versus unknown knowledge. Our findings show that this gap
can be mitigated at the inference stage, either under out-of-distribution (OOD)
settings or by using appropriate in-context learning (ICL) prompts (i.e.,
few-shot learning and Chain of Thought (CoT)). We prove this phenomenon
theoretically from the perspective of knowledge graphs, showing that the
test-time prompt may diminish or even overshadow the impact of fine-tuning data
and play a dominant role in knowledge extraction. Ultimately, our results shed
light on the interaction between finetuning data and test-time prompt,
demonstrating that ICL can effectively compensate for shortcomings in
fine-tuning data, and highlighting the need to reconsider the use of ICL
prompting as a means to evaluate the effectiveness of fine-tuning data
selection methods.

Conclusion: UAQFact为评估LLMs在复杂场景下的能力提供了新基准，揭示了LLMs在知识利用方面的局限性。

Abstract: Handling unanswerable questions (UAQ) is crucial for LLMs, as it helps
prevent misleading responses in complex situations. While previous studies have
built several datasets to assess LLMs' performance on UAQ, these datasets lack
factual knowledge support, which limits the evaluation of LLMs' ability to
utilize their factual knowledge when handling UAQ. To address the limitation,
we introduce a new unanswerable question dataset UAQFact, a bilingual dataset
with auxiliary factual knowledge created from a Knowledge Graph. Based on
UAQFact, we further define two new tasks to measure LLMs' ability to utilize
internal and external factual knowledge, respectively. Our experimental results
across multiple LLM series show that UAQFact presents significant challenges,
as LLMs do not consistently perform well even when they have factual knowledge
stored. Additionally, we find that incorporating external knowledge may enhance
performance, but LLMs still cannot make full use of the knowledge which may
result in incorrect responses.

Conclusion: 通过定量分析自我怀疑，论文提出了一种有效减少RLLMs过度思考的方法，优化了推理效率。

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (RLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
performance on complex tasks, largely due to the adoption of Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) reasoning. However, they often exhibit overthinking
-- performing unnecessary reasoning steps even after arriving at the correct
answer. Prior work has largely focused on qualitative analyses of overthinking
through sample-based observations of long CoTs. In contrast, we present a
quantitative analysis of overthinking from the perspective of self-doubt,
characterized by excessive token usage devoted to re-verifying already-correct
answer. We find that self-doubt significantly contributes to overthinking. In
response, we introduce a simple and effective prompting method to reduce the
model's over-reliance on input questions, thereby avoiding self-doubt.
Specifically, we first prompt the model to question the validity of the input
question, and then respond concisely based on the outcome of that evaluation.
Experiments on three mathematical reasoning tasks and four datasets with
missing premises demonstrate that our method substantially reduces answer
length and yields significant improvements across nearly all datasets upon 4
widely-used RLLMs. Further analysis demonstrates that our method effectively
minimizes the number of reasoning steps and reduces self-doubt.

Motivation: To understand the source of LLMs' translation capabilities despite not being explicitly trained for translation tasks.

Method: Reflections based on recent studies and user experience, proposing a 'duality' hypothesis involving two types of pre-training data.

Result: LLMs' translation abilities may stem from internalized bilingual data and instruction tuning, suggesting a need for empirical testing.

Conclusion: The findings could reshape understanding of translation in the context of deep learning, with implications for both human and machine translation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in translation among other things,
demonstrating competitive performance for many language pairs in zero- and
few-shot settings. But unlike dedicated neural machine translation models, LLMs
are not trained on any translation-related objective. What explains their
remarkable translation abilities? Are these abilities grounded in "incidental
bilingualism" (Briakou et al. 2023) in training data? Does instruction tuning
contribute to it? Are LLMs capable of aligning and leveraging semantically
identical or similar monolingual contents from different corners of the
internet that are unlikely to fit in a single context window? I offer some
reflections on this topic, informed by recent studies and growing user
experience. My working hypothesis is that LLMs' translation abilities originate
in two different types of pre-training data that may be internalized by the
models in different ways. I discuss the prospects for testing the "duality"
hypothesis empirically and its implications for reconceptualizing translation,
human and machine, in the age of deep learning.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) perform well on standardized coding benchmarks but
struggle with real-world software engineering tasks such as resolving GitHub
issues in SWE-Bench, especially when model parameters are less than 100B. While
smaller models are preferable in practice due to their lower computational
cost, improving their performance remains challenging. Existing approaches
primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with high-quality data, which is
expensive to curate at scale. An alternative is test-time scaling: generating
multiple outputs, scoring them using a verifier, and selecting the best one.
Although effective, this strategy often requires excessive sampling and costly
scoring, limiting its practical application. We propose Evolutionary Test-Time
Scaling (EvoScale), a sample-efficient method that treats generation as an
evolutionary process. By iteratively refining outputs via selection and
mutation, EvoScale shifts the output distribution toward higher-scoring
regions, reducing the number of samples needed to find correct solutions. To
reduce the overhead from repeatedly sampling and selection, we train the model
to self-evolve using reinforcement learning (RL). Rather than relying on
external verifiers at inference time, the model learns to self-improve the
scores of its own generations across iterations. Evaluated on
SWE-Bench-Verified, EvoScale enables our 32B model, Satori-SWE-32B, to match or
exceed the performance of models with over 100B parameters while using a few
samples. Code, data, and models will be fully open-sourced.

Conclusion: 论文为Transformer的表达能力提供了一个统一的理论框架，并通过实验验证了理论结果。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models (LMs) have achieved widespread empirical
success, but their theoretical expressive power remains only partially
understood. Prior work often relies on idealized models with assumptions --
such as arbitrary numerical precision and hard attention -- that diverge from
real-world transformers. In this work, we provide an exact characterization of
fixed-precision transformers with strict future masking and soft attention, an
idealization that more closely mirrors practical implementations. We show that
these models are precisely as expressive as a specific fragment of linear
temporal logic that includes only a single temporal operator: the past
operator. We further relate this logic to established classes in formal
language theory, automata theory, and algebra, yielding a rich and unified
theoretical framework for understanding transformer expressivity. Finally, we
present empirical results that align closely with our theory: transformers
trained on languages within their theoretical capacity generalize perfectly
over lengths, while they consistently fail to generalize on languages beyond
it.

Method: 通过全面评估、行为分析和模型不确定性研究，分析LRMs的幻觉问题。

Conclusion: LRMs的幻觉与模型不确定性和事实准确性之间的错位有关，研究为理解LRMs的幻觉提供了初步见解。

Abstract: Recently evolved large reasoning models (LRMs) show powerful performance in
solving complex tasks with long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capability. As
these LRMs are mostly developed by post-training on formal reasoning tasks,
whether they generalize the reasoning capability to help reduce hallucination
in fact-seeking tasks remains unclear and debated. For instance, DeepSeek-R1
reports increased performance on SimpleQA, a fact-seeking benchmark, while
OpenAI-o3 observes even severer hallucination. This discrepancy naturally
raises the following research question: Are reasoning models more prone to
hallucination? This paper addresses the question from three perspectives. (1)
We first conduct a holistic evaluation for the hallucination in LRMs. Our
analysis reveals that LRMs undergo a full post-training pipeline with cold
start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and verifiable reward RL generally alleviate
their hallucination. In contrast, both distillation alone and RL training
without cold start fine-tuning introduce more nuanced hallucinations. (2) To
explore why different post-training pipelines alters the impact on
hallucination in LRMs, we conduct behavior analysis. We characterize two
critical cognitive behaviors that directly affect the factuality of a LRM: Flaw
Repetition, where the surface-level reasoning attempts repeatedly follow the
same underlying flawed logic, and Think-Answer Mismatch, where the final answer
fails to faithfully match the previous CoT process. (3) Further, we investigate
the mechanism behind the hallucination of LRMs from the perspective of model
uncertainty. We find that increased hallucination of LRMs is usually associated
with the misalignment between model uncertainty and factual accuracy. Our work
provides an initial understanding of the hallucination in LRMs.

Conclusion: ActLCD在多样化生成场景中显著提升事实性。

Abstract: Recent decoding methods improve the factuality of large language
models~(LLMs) by refining how the next token is selected during generation.
These methods typically operate at the token level, leveraging internal
representations to suppress superficial patterns. Nevertheless, LLMs remain
prone to hallucinations, especially over longer contexts. In this paper, we
propose Active Layer-Contrastive Decoding (ActLCD), a novel decoding strategy
that actively decides when to apply contrasting layers during generation. By
casting decoding as a sequential decision-making problem, ActLCD employs a
reinforcement learning policy guided by a reward-aware classifier to optimize
factuality beyond the token level. Our experiments demonstrate that ActLCD
surpasses state-of-the-art methods across five benchmarks, showcasing its
effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations in diverse generation scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in using
external tools to address user inquiries. However, most existing evaluations
assume tool use in short contexts, offering limited insight into model behavior
during realistic long-term interactions. To fill this gap, we introduce
ToolHaystack, a benchmark for testing the tool use capabilities in long-term
interactions. Each test instance in ToolHaystack includes multiple tasks
execution contexts and realistic noise within a continuous conversation,
enabling assessment of how well models maintain context and handle various
disruptions. By applying this benchmark to 14 state-of-the-art LLMs, we find
that while current models perform well in standard multi-turn settings, they
often significantly struggle in ToolHaystack, highlighting critical gaps in
their long-term robustness not revealed by previous tool benchmarks.

Conclusion: 解耦评估对准确评估LLM推理能力至关重要，未来改进应关注计算能力。

Abstract: Final-answer-based metrics are commonly used for evaluating large language
models (LLMs) on math word problems, often taken as proxies for reasoning
ability. However, such metrics conflate two distinct sub-skills: abstract
formulation (capturing mathematical relationships using expressions) and
arithmetic computation (executing the calculations). Through a disentangled
evaluation on GSM8K and SVAMP, we find that the final-answer accuracy of
Llama-3 and Qwen2.5 (1B-32B) without CoT is overwhelmingly bottlenecked by the
arithmetic computation step and not by the abstract formulation step. Contrary
to the common belief, we show that CoT primarily aids in computation, with
limited impact on abstract formulation. Mechanistically, we show that these two
skills are composed conjunctively even in a single forward pass without any
reasoning steps via an abstract-then-compute mechanism: models first capture
problem abstractions, then handle computation. Causal patching confirms these
abstractions are present, transferable, composable, and precede computation.
These behavioural and mechanistic findings highlight the need for disentangled
evaluation to accurately assess LLM reasoning and to guide future improvements.

Conclusion: SocialMaze为LLMs社会推理能力提供了系统性评估工具，并展示了改进方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to socially grounded
tasks, such as online community moderation, media content analysis, and social
reasoning games. Success in these contexts depends on a model's social
reasoning ability - the capacity to interpret social contexts, infer others'
mental states, and assess the truthfulness of presented information. However,
there is currently no systematic evaluation framework that comprehensively
assesses the social reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Existing efforts often
oversimplify real-world scenarios and consist of tasks that are too basic to
challenge advanced models. To address this gap, we introduce SocialMaze, a new
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate social reasoning. SocialMaze
systematically incorporates three core challenges: deep reasoning, dynamic
interaction, and information uncertainty. It provides six diverse tasks across
three key settings: social reasoning games, daily-life interactions, and
digital community platforms. Both automated and human validation are used to
ensure data quality. Our evaluation reveals several key insights: models vary
substantially in their ability to handle dynamic interactions and integrate
temporally evolving information; models with strong chain-of-thought reasoning
perform better on tasks requiring deeper inference beyond surface-level cues;
and model reasoning degrades significantly under uncertainty. Furthermore, we
show that targeted fine-tuning on curated reasoning examples can greatly
improve model performance in complex social scenarios. The dataset is publicly

Conclusion: 提升LLMs对输入有效性的主动评估能力是开发可靠系统的关键。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have witnessed rapid advancements, demonstrating
remarkable capabilities. However, a notable vulnerability persists: LLMs often
uncritically accept flawed or contradictory premises, leading to inefficient
reasoning and unreliable outputs. This emphasizes the significance of
possessing the \textbf{Premise Critique Ability} for LLMs, defined as the
capacity to proactively identify and articulate errors in input premises. Most
existing studies assess LLMs' reasoning ability in ideal settings, largely
ignoring their vulnerabilities when faced with flawed premises. Thus, we
introduce the \textbf{Premise Critique Bench (PCBench)}, designed by
incorporating four error types across three difficulty levels, paired with
multi-faceted evaluation metrics. We conducted systematic evaluations of 15
representative LLMs. Our findings reveal: (1) Most models rely heavily on
explicit prompts to detect errors, with limited autonomous critique; (2)
Premise critique ability depends on question difficulty and error type, with
direct contradictions being easier to detect than complex or procedural errors;
(3) Reasoning ability does not consistently correlate with the premise critique
ability; (4) Flawed premises trigger overthinking in reasoning models, markedly
lengthening responses due to repeated attempts at resolving conflicts. These
insights underscore the urgent need to enhance LLMs' proactive evaluation of
input validity, positioning premise critique as a foundational capability for
developing reliable, human-centric systems. The code is available at

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models (LLMs) to perform new
tasks using only a few demonstrations. In Named Entity Recognition (NER),
demonstrations are typically selected based on semantic similarity to the test
instance, ignoring training labels and resulting in suboptimal performance. We
introduce DEER, a new method that leverages training labels through token-level
statistics to improve ICL performance. DEER first enhances example selection
with a label-guided, token-based retriever that prioritizes tokens most
informative for entity recognition. It then prompts the LLM to revisit
error-prone tokens, which are also identified using label statistics, and make
targeted corrections. Evaluated on five NER datasets using four different LLMs,
DEER consistently outperforms existing ICL methods and approaches the
performance of supervised fine-tuning. Further analysis shows its effectiveness
on both seen and unseen entities and its robustness in low-resource settings.

Abstract: The emergence of large language model (LLM)-based agents has significantly
advanced the development of autonomous machine learning (ML) engineering.
However, most existing approaches rely heavily on manual prompt engineering,
failing to adapt and optimize based on diverse experimental experiences.
Focusing on this, for the first time, we explore the paradigm of learning-based
agentic ML, where an LLM agent learns through interactive experimentation on ML
tasks using online reinforcement learning (RL). To realize this, we propose a
novel agentic ML training framework with three key components: (1)
exploration-enriched fine-tuning, which enables LLM agents to generate diverse
actions for enhanced RL exploration; (2) step-wise RL, which enables training
on a single action step, accelerating experience collection and improving
training efficiency; (3) an agentic ML-specific reward module, which unifies
varied ML feedback signals into consistent rewards for RL optimization.
Leveraging this framework, we train ML-Agent, driven by a 7B-sized Qwen-2.5 LLM
for autonomous ML. Remarkably, despite being trained on merely 9 ML tasks, our
7B-sized ML-Agent outperforms the 671B-sized DeepSeek-R1 agent. Furthermore, it
achieves continuous performance improvements and demonstrates exceptional
cross-task generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Aligning large language models with humans is challenging due to the
inherently multifaceted nature of preference feedback. While existing
approaches typically frame this as a multi-objective optimization problem, they
often overlook how humans actually make decisions. Research on bounded
rationality suggests that human decision making follows satisficing
strategies-optimizing primary objectives while ensuring others meet acceptable
thresholds. To bridge this gap and operationalize the notion of satisficing
alignment, we propose SITAlign: an inference time framework that addresses the
multifaceted nature of alignment by maximizing a primary objective while
satisfying threshold-based constraints on secondary criteria. We provide
theoretical insights by deriving sub-optimality bounds of our satisficing based
inference alignment approach. We empirically validate SITAlign's performance
through extensive experimentation on multiple benchmarks. For instance, on the
PKU-SafeRLHF dataset with the primary objective of maximizing helpfulness while
ensuring a threshold on harmlessness, SITAlign outperforms the state-of-the-art
multi objective decoding strategy by a margin of 22.3% in terms of GPT-4
win-tie rate for helpfulness reward while adhering to the threshold on
harmlessness.

Abstract: Transformers have been established as the most popular backbones in sequence
modeling, mainly due to their effectiveness in in-context retrieval tasks and
the ability to learn at scale. Their quadratic memory and time complexity,
however, bound their applicability in longer sequences and so has motivated
researchers to explore effective alternative architectures such as modern
recurrent neural networks (a.k.a long-term recurrent memory module). Despite
their recent success in diverse downstream tasks, they struggle in tasks that
requires long context understanding and extrapolation to longer sequences. We
observe that these shortcomings come from three disjoint aspects in their
design: (1) limited memory capacity that is bounded by the architecture of
memory and feature mapping of the input; (2) online nature of update, i.e.,
optimizing the memory only with respect to the last input; and (3) less
expressive management of their fixed-size memory. To enhance all these three
aspects, we present ATLAS, a long-term memory module with high capacity that
learns to memorize the context by optimizing the memory based on the current
and past tokens, overcoming the online nature of long-term memory models.
Building on this insight, we present a new family of Transformer-like
architectures, called DeepTransformers, that are strict generalizations of the
original Transformer architecture. Our experimental results on language
modeling, common-sense reasoning, recall-intensive, and long-context
understanding tasks show that ATLAS surpasses the performance of Transformers
and recent linear recurrent models. ATLAS further improves the long context
performance of Titans, achieving +80\% accuracy in 10M context length of

analysis-guided feedback. Specifically, REAL integrates two automated signals:
(1) program analysis detecting security or maintainability defects and (2) unit
tests ensuring functional correctness. Unlike prior work, our framework is
prompt-agnostic and reference-free, enabling scalable supervision without
manual intervention. Experiments across multiple datasets and model scales

Abstract: There is increasing evidence of Human Label Variation (HLV) in Natural
Language Inference (NLI), where annotators assign different labels to the same
premise-hypothesis pair. However, within-label variation--cases where
annotators agree on the same label but provide divergent reasoning--poses an
additional and mostly overlooked challenge. Several NLI datasets contain
highlighted words in the NLI item as explanations, but the same spans on the
NLI item can be highlighted for different reasons, as evidenced by free-text
explanations, which offer a window into annotators' reasoning. To
systematically understand this problem and gain insight into the rationales
behind NLI labels, we introduce LITEX, a linguistically-informed taxonomy for
categorizing free-text explanations. Using this taxonomy, we annotate a subset
of the e-SNLI dataset, validate the taxonomy's reliability, and analyze how it
aligns with NLI labels, highlights, and explanations. We further assess the
taxonomy's usefulness in explanation generation, demonstrating that
conditioning generation on LITEX yields explanations that are linguistically
closer to human explanations than those generated using only labels or
highlights. Our approach thus not only captures within-label variation but also
shows how taxonomy-guided generation for reasoning can bridge the gap between
human and model explanations more effectively than existing strategies.

Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）的偏见研究较多，但视觉语言模型（VLMs）的偏见研究较少，且现有研究多局限于特定领域（如性别-职业关联）。本文旨在填补这一空白，通过更广泛的视角评估VLMs中的社会刻板印象及其潜在危害。

Method: 通过构建包含3000万+图像的VQA基准（VIGNETTE），从事实性、感知、刻板印象和决策四个方向评估VLMs的偏见。结合社会心理学理论，分析模型如何从视觉身份线索推断特质和能力。

Result: 研究发现VLMs中存在微妙、多面且令人惊讶的刻板印象模式，揭示了模型如何从输入中构建社会意义并表现出歧视性行为。

Conclusion: VIGNETTE为评估VLMs中的偏见提供了全面工具，揭示了模型在复杂社会情境中的表现，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: While bias in large language models (LLMs) is well-studied, similar concerns
in vision-language models (VLMs) have received comparatively less attention.
Existing VLM bias studies often focus on portrait-style images and
gender-occupation associations, overlooking broader and more complex social
stereotypes and their implied harm. This work introduces VIGNETTE, a
large-scale VQA benchmark with 30M+ images for evaluating bias in VLMs through
a question-answering framework spanning four directions: factuality,
perception, stereotyping, and decision making. Beyond narrowly-centered
studies, we assess how VLMs interpret identities in contextualized settings,
revealing how models make trait and capability assumptions and exhibit patterns
of discrimination. Drawing from social psychology, we examine how VLMs connect
visual identity cues to trait and role-based inferences, encoding social
hierarchies, through biased selections. Our findings uncover subtle,
multifaceted, and surprising stereotypical patterns, offering insights into how
VLMs construct social meaning from inputs.

Result: 评估显示，当前LLM在急诊室临床推理上与医生存在明显差距。

Conclusion: 未来研究需弥合LLM与临床医生在急诊决策推理上的差距。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been extensively evaluated on medical
question answering tasks based on licensing exams. However, real-world
evaluations often depend on costly human annotators, and existing benchmarks
tend to focus on isolated tasks that rarely capture the clinical reasoning or
full workflow underlying medical decisions. In this paper, we introduce
ER-Reason, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based clinical reasoning and
decision-making in the emergency room (ER)--a high-stakes setting where
clinicians make rapid, consequential decisions across diverse patient
presentations and medical specialties under time pressure. ER-Reason includes
data from 3,984 patients, encompassing 25,174 de-identified longitudinal
clinical notes spanning discharge summaries, progress notes, history and
physical exams, consults, echocardiography reports, imaging notes, and ER
provider documentation. The benchmark includes evaluation tasks that span key
stages of the ER workflow: triage intake, initial assessment, treatment
selection, disposition planning, and final diagnosis--each structured to
reflect core clinical reasoning processes such as differential diagnosis via
rule-out reasoning. We also collected 72 full physician-authored rationales
explaining reasoning processes that mimic the teaching process used in
residency training, and are typically absent from ER documentation. Evaluations
of state-of-the-art LLMs on ER-Reason reveal a gap between LLM-generated and
clinician-authored clinical reasoning for ER decisions, highlighting the need
for future research to bridge this divide.

Method: 提出MAC基准，利用LLMs生成欺骗性文本样本，评估多模态模型的脆弱性；采用自训练方法，结合拒绝采样微调和多样性过滤提升性能。

Result: 使用较小语言模型（如Llama-3.1-8B）的方法在多模态表示（图像、视频、音频）中展现出更高的攻击成功率和样本多样性。

Conclusion: MAC基准和自训练方法有效揭示了多模态模型的组合脆弱性，并提升了零样本方法的性能。

Abstract: While pre-trained multimodal representations (e.g., CLIP) have shown
impressive capabilities, they exhibit significant compositional vulnerabilities
leading to counterintuitive judgments. We introduce Multimodal Adversarial
Compositionality (MAC), a benchmark that leverages large language models (LLMs)
to generate deceptive text samples to exploit these vulnerabilities across
different modalities and evaluates them through both sample-wise attack success
rate and group-wise entropy-based diversity. To improve zero-shot methods, we
propose a self-training approach that leverages rejection-sampling fine-tuning
with diversity-promoting filtering, which enhances both attack success rate and
sample diversity. Using smaller language models like Llama-3.1-8B, our approach
demonstrates superior performance in revealing compositional vulnerabilities
across various multimodal representations, including images, videos, and
audios.

Conclusion: VeGraph通过结合LLM和图表示，有效解决了复杂声明的验证问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Claim verification is a long-standing and challenging task that demands not
only high accuracy but also explainability of the verification process. This
task becomes an emerging research issue in the era of large language models
(LLMs) since real-world claims are often complex, featuring intricate semantic
structures or obfuscated entities. Traditional approaches typically address
this by decomposing claims into sub-claims and querying a knowledge base to
resolve hidden or ambiguous entities. However, the absence of effective
disambiguation strategies for these entities can compromise the entire
verification process. To address these challenges, we propose
Verify-in-the-Graph (VeGraph), a novel framework leveraging the reasoning and
comprehension abilities of LLM agents. VeGraph operates in three phases: (1)
Graph Representation - an input claim is decomposed into structured triplets,
forming a graph-based representation that integrates both structured and
unstructured information; (2) Entity Disambiguation -VeGraph iteratively
interacts with the knowledge base to resolve ambiguous entities within the
graph for deeper sub-claim verification; and (3) Verification - remaining
triplets are verified to complete the fact-checking process. Experiments using
Meta-Llama-3-70B (instruct version) show that VeGraph achieves competitive
performance compared to baselines on two benchmarks HoVer and FEVEROUS,
effectively addressing claim verification challenges. Our source code and data
are available for further exploitation.

Programming by Examples. We develop a fully automated pipeline for dynamically
generating a benchmark for this task with controllable difficulty in order to
tackle scalability and contamination issues to which many reasoning benchmarks
are subject. Using our pipeline, we generate a test set with nearly 1k
instances that is challenging for all state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs, with the

Abstract: Traditional code instruction data synthesis methods suffer from limited
diversity and poor logic. We introduce Infinite-Instruct, an automated
framework for synthesizing high-quality question-answer pairs, designed to
enhance the code generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The
framework focuses on improving the internal logic of synthesized problems and
the quality of synthesized code. First, "Reverse Construction" transforms code
snippets into diverse programming problems. Then, through "Backfeeding
Construction," keywords in programming problems are structured into a knowledge
graph to reconstruct them into programming problems with stronger internal
logic. Finally, a cross-lingual static code analysis pipeline filters invalid
samples to ensure data quality. Experiments show that on mainstream code
generation benchmarks, our fine-tuned models achieve an average performance
improvement of 21.70% on 7B-parameter models and 36.95% on 32B-parameter
models. Using less than one-tenth of the instruction fine-tuning data, we
achieved performance comparable to the Qwen-2.5-Coder-Instruct.
Infinite-Instruct provides a scalable solution for LLM training in programming.

Conclusion: MCTSr-Zero有效解决了LLMs在复杂心理标准下的对话生成问题，适用于人本领域。

Abstract: The integration of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with Large Language Models
(LLMs) has demonstrated significant success in structured, problem-oriented
tasks. However, applying these methods to open-ended dialogues, such as those
in psychological counseling, presents unique challenges. Unlike tasks with
objective correctness, success in therapeutic conversations depends on
subjective factors like empathetic engagement, ethical adherence, and alignment
with human preferences, for which strict "correctness" criteria are
ill-defined. Existing result-oriented MCTS approaches can therefore produce
misaligned responses. To address this, we introduce MCTSr-Zero, an MCTS
framework designed for open-ended, human-centric dialogues. Its core innovation
is "domain alignment", which shifts the MCTS search objective from predefined
end-states towards conversational trajectories that conform to target domain
principles (e.g., empathy in counseling). Furthermore, MCTSr-Zero incorporates
"Regeneration" and "Meta-Prompt Adaptation" mechanisms to substantially broaden
exploration by allowing the MCTS to consider fundamentally different initial
dialogue strategies. We evaluate MCTSr-Zero in psychological counseling by
generating multi-turn dialogue data, which is used to fine-tune an LLM, PsyLLM.
We also introduce PsyEval, a benchmark for assessing multi-turn psychological
counseling dialogues. Experiments demonstrate that PsyLLM achieves
state-of-the-art performance on PsyEval and other relevant metrics, validating
MCTSr-Zero's effectiveness in generating high-quality, principle-aligned
conversational data for human-centric domains and addressing the LLM challenge
of consistently adhering to complex psychological standards.

Result: LLMs能部分覆盖关键论点，但关键信息常被遗漏，尤其是论点分散时。此外，LLMs的位置偏差和角色偏好影响论点覆盖。

Conclusion: 需要开发更具论点意识的摘要生成策略。

Abstract: Integrating structured information has long improved the quality of
abstractive summarization, particularly in retaining salient content. In this
work, we focus on a specific form of structure: argument roles, which are
crucial for summarizing documents in high-stakes domains such as law. We
investigate whether instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) adequately
preserve this information. To this end, we introduce Argument Representation
Coverage (ARC), a framework for measuring how well LLM-generated summaries
capture salient arguments. Using ARC, we analyze summaries produced by three
open-weight LLMs in two domains where argument roles are central: long legal
opinions and scientific articles. Our results show that while LLMs cover
salient argument roles to some extent, critical information is often omitted in
generated summaries, particularly when arguments are sparsely distributed
throughout the input. Further, we use ARC to uncover behavioral patterns --
specifically, how the positional bias of LLM context windows and role-specific
preferences impact the coverage of key arguments in generated summaries,
emphasizing the need for more argument-aware summarization strategies.

Abstract: Conversational agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are rapidly
becoming integral to our daily interactions, generating unprecedented amounts

a novel task requiring models to reason explicitly over thousands of
user-chatbot interactions to answer aggregative queries, such as identifying
emerging concerns among specific demographics. To enable research in this
direction, we construct a benchmark, WildChat-AQA, comprising 6,027 aggregative
questions derived from 182,330 real-world chatbot conversations. Experiments
show that existing methods either struggle to reason effectively or incur
prohibitive computational costs, underscoring the need for new approaches
capable of extracting collective insights from large-scale conversational data.

human-to-human conversations and perform background tasks or provide
suggestions to assist the user. In this work, we explore the overhearing agents
paradigm through the lens of Dungeons & Dragons gameplay. We present an
in-depth study using large multimodal audio-language models as overhearing
agents to assist a Dungeon Master. We perform a human evaluation to examine the
helpfulness of such agents and find that some large audio-language models have

Attribution Theory in social psychology explains how humans assign

internal (e.g., effort, ability) or external (e.g., task difficulty, luck)
factors. LLMs' attribution of event outcomes based on demographics carries
important fairness implications. Most works exploring social biases in LLMs
focus on surface-level associations or isolated stereotypes. This work proposes
a cognitively grounded bias evaluation framework to identify how models'
reasoning disparities channelize biases toward demographic groups.

Abstract: Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) compliance assessment demands dynamic
real-time decision-making under complicated regulations and complex
human-machine-environment interactions. While large language models (LLMs) hold
significant potential for decision intelligence and contextual dialogue, their
capacity for domain-specific knowledge in HSE and structured legal reasoning
remains underexplored. We introduce HSE-Bench, the first benchmark dataset
designed to evaluate the HSE compliance assessment capabilities of LLM.
HSE-Bench comprises over 1,000 manually curated questions drawn from
regulations, court cases, safety exams, and fieldwork videos, and integrates a
reasoning flow based on Issue spotting, rule Recall, rule Application, and rule
Conclusion (IRAC) to assess the holistic reasoning pipeline. We conduct
extensive evaluations on different prompting strategies and more than 10 LLMs,
including foundation models, reasoning models and multimodal vision models. The
results show that, although current LLMs achieve good performance, their
capabilities largely rely on semantic matching rather than principled reasoning
grounded in the underlying HSE compliance context. Moreover, their native
reasoning trace lacks the systematic legal reasoning required for rigorous HSE
compliance assessment. To alleviate these, we propose a new prompting
technique, Reasoning of Expert (RoE), which guides LLMs to simulate the
reasoning process of different experts for compliance assessment and reach a
more accurate unified decision. We hope our study highlights reasoning gaps in
LLMs for HSE compliance and inspires further research on related tasks.

Abstract: The emergence of scaling laws has profoundly shaped the development of large
language models (LLMs), enabling predictable performance gains through
systematic increases in model size, dataset volume, and compute. Yet, these
principles remain largely unexplored in the context of electronic health
records (EHRs) -- a rich, sequential, and globally abundant data source that
differs structurally from natural language. In this work, we present the first
empirical investigation of scaling laws for EHR foundation models. By training
transformer architectures on patient timeline data from the MIMIC-IV database
across varying model sizes and compute budgets, we identify consistent scaling
patterns, including parabolic IsoFLOPs curves and power-law relationships
between compute, model parameters, data size, and clinical utility. These
findings demonstrate that EHR models exhibit scaling behavior analogous to
LLMs, offering predictive insights into resource-efficient training strategies.
Our results lay the groundwork for developing powerful EHR foundation models
capable of transforming clinical prediction tasks and advancing personalized

TL;DR: 本文研究了将最小贝叶斯风险（MBR）解码应用于文档级文本生成任务，提出了一种基于Wasserstein距离的MBR-OT方法，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文档级文本生成任务因需要理解更长上下文而更具挑战性，现有MBR解码方法在文档级任务中表现有限。

Method: 提出MBR-OT，利用Wasserstein距离结合句子级效用函数计算文档效用。

Result: MBR-OT在文档级机器翻译、文本简化和密集图像描述任务中优于标准MBR。

Conclusion: MBR-OT为文档级文本生成任务提供了一种有效的解码方法。

Abstract: Document-level text generation tasks are known to be more difficult than
sentence-level text generation tasks as they require the understanding of
longer context to generate high-quality texts. In this paper, we investigate
the adaption of Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding for document-level text
generation tasks. MBR decoding makes use of a utility function to estimate the
output with the highest expected utility from a set of candidate outputs.
Although MBR decoding is shown to be effective in a wide range of
sentence-level text generation tasks, its performance on document-level text
generation tasks is limited as many of the utility functions are designed for
evaluating the utility of sentences. To this end, we propose MBR-OT, a variant
of MBR decoding using Wasserstein distance to compute the utility of a document
using a sentence-level utility function. The experimental result shows that the
performance of MBR-OT outperforms that of the standard MBR in document-level
machine translation, text simplification, and dense image captioning tasks. Our

Abstract: Knowledge Editing (KE) has gained increasing attention, yet current KE tasks
remain relatively simple. Under current evaluation frameworks, many editing
methods achieve exceptionally high scores, sometimes nearing perfection.
However, few studies integrate KE into real-world application scenarios (e.g.,
recent interest in LLM-as-agent). To support our analysis, we introduce a novel
script-based benchmark -- ScEdit (Script-based Knowledge Editing Benchmark) --
which encompasses both counterfactual and temporal edits. We integrate
token-level and text-level evaluation methods, comprehensively analyzing
existing KE techniques. The benchmark extends traditional fact-based
("What"-type question) evaluation to action-based ("How"-type question)
evaluation. We observe that all KE methods exhibit a drop in performance on
established metrics and face challenges on text-level metrics, indicating a
challenging task. Our benchmark is available at

Motivation: 大规模S2T训练中，传统学习率调整方法（如双线性预热）未与其他方案对比，且对最终性能的影响未被研究。本文填补这一空白。

Method: 通过实验比较不同学习率预热策略（如双线性预热与子指数预热）在大规模S2T训练中的效果。

Result: 子指数预热策略更适合大规模S2T训练；高初始学习率加速收敛但不提升最终性能。

Conclusion: 大规模S2T训练需采用子指数学习率预热策略，初始高学习率仅加速收敛。

Abstract: Training large-scale models presents challenges not only in terms of resource
requirements but also in terms of their convergence. For this reason, the
learning rate (LR) is often decreased when the size of a model is increased.
Such a simple solution is not enough in the case of speech-to-text (S2T)
trainings, where evolved and more complex variants of the Transformer
architecture -- e.g., Conformer or Branchformer -- are used in light of their
better performance. As a workaround, OWSM designed a double linear warmup of
the LR, increasing it to a very small value in the first phase before updating
it to a higher value in the second phase. While this solution worked well in
practice, it was not compared with alternative solutions, nor was the impact on
the final performance of different LR warmup schedules studied. This paper
fills this gap, revealing that i) large-scale S2T trainings demand a
sub-exponential LR warmup, and ii) a higher LR in the warmup phase accelerates
initial convergence, but it does not boost final performance.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) systems rely on high-quality
benchmarks to evaluate complex multi-hop reasoning. However, despite their
widespread use, popular datasets such as WebQSP and CWQ suffer from critical
quality issues, including inaccurate or incomplete ground-truth annotations,
poorly constructed questions that are ambiguous, trivial, or unanswerable, and
outdated or inconsistent knowledge. Through a manual audit of 16 popular KGQA
datasets, including WebQSP and CWQ, we find that the average factual
correctness rate is only 57 %. To address these issues, we introduce KGQAGen,
an LLM-in-the-loop framework that systematically resolves these pitfalls.
KGQAGen combines structured knowledge grounding, LLM-guided generation, and
symbolic verification to produce challenging and verifiable QA instances. Using
KGQAGen, we construct KGQAGen-10k, a ten-thousand scale benchmark grounded in
Wikidata, and evaluate a diverse set of KG-RAG models. Experimental results
demonstrate that even state-of-the-art systems struggle on this benchmark,
highlighting its ability to expose limitations of existing models. Our findings
advocate for more rigorous benchmark construction and position KGQAGen as a

Conclusion: 需要进一步研究以克服LLM在对话对齐上的限制。

Abstract: The development of sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) conversational
agents based on large language models raises important questions about the
relationship between human norms, values, and practices and AI design and
performance. This article explores what it means for AI agents to be
conversationally aligned to human communicative norms and practices for
handling context and common ground and proposes a new framework for evaluating
developers' design choices. We begin by drawing on the philosophical and
linguistic literature on conversational pragmatics to motivate a set of
desiderata, which we call the CONTEXT-ALIGN framework, for conversational
alignment with human communicative practices. We then suggest that current
large language model (LLM) architectures, constraints, and affordances may
impose fundamental limitations on achieving full conversational alignment.

Motivation: 现有NL2SQL技术未利用数据库历史查询负载中的隐含信息（如常见连接路径和表/列语义），而这些信息对准确翻译至关重要。

Method: 提出TailorSQL系统，通过分析历史查询负载（而非仅依赖数据库模式）来优化NL2SQL翻译。

Result: 在标准化基准测试中，TailorSQL的执行准确率提升高达2倍。

Conclusion: 利用历史查询负载可显著提升NL2SQL性能，为实际应用提供更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: NL2SQL (natural language to SQL) translates natural language questions into
SQL queries, thereby making structured data accessible to non-technical users,
serving as the foundation for intelligent data applications. State-of-the-art
NL2SQL techniques typically perform translation by retrieving database-specific
information, such as the database schema, and invoking a pre-trained large
language model (LLM) using the question and retrieved information to generate
the SQL query.
  However, existing NL2SQL techniques miss a key opportunity which is present
in real-world settings: NL2SQL is typically applied on existing databases which
have already served many SQL queries in the past. The past query workload
implicitly contains information which is helpful for accurate NL2SQL
translation and is not apparent from the database schema alone, such as common
join paths and the semantics of obscurely-named tables and columns. We
introduce TailorSQL, a NL2SQL system that takes advantage of information in the
past query workload to improve both the accuracy and latency of translating
natural language questions into SQL. By specializing to a given workload,
TailorSQL achieves up to 2$\times$ improvement in execution accuracy on
standardized benchmarks.

Result: 优化的StresSLM模型在句子重音推理和检测任务上显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 合成数据训练有效提升SLMs在句子重音任务上的性能。

Abstract: Sentence stress refers to emphasis, placed on specific words within a spoken
utterance to highlight or contrast an idea, or to introduce new information. It
is often used to imply an underlying intention that is not explicitly stated.
Recent advances in speech-aware language models (SLMs) have enabled direct
processing of audio, allowing models to bypass transcription and access the
full richness of the speech signal and perform audio reasoning tasks such as
spoken question answering. Despite the crucial role of sentence stress in
shaping meaning and speaker intent, it remains largely overlooked in evaluation
and development of such models. In this work, we address this gap by
introducing StressTest, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate a model's
ability to distinguish between interpretations of spoken sentences based on the
stress pattern. We assess the performance of several leading SLMs and find
that, despite their overall capabilities, they perform poorly on such tasks. To
overcome this limitation, we propose a novel synthetic data generation
pipeline, and create Stress17k, a training set that simulates change of meaning
implied by stress variation. Then, we empirically show that optimizing models
with this synthetic dataset aligns well with real-world recordings and enables
effective finetuning of SLMs. Results suggest, that our finetuned model,
StresSLM, significantly outperforms existing models on both sentence stress
reasoning and detection tasks. Code, models, data, and audio samples -

Abstract: Negation is a fundamental linguistic phenomenon that can entirely reverse the
meaning of a sentence. As vision language models (VLMs) continue to advance and
are deployed in high-stakes applications, assessing their ability to comprehend
negation becomes essential. To address this, we introduce NegVQA, a visual
question answering (VQA) benchmark consisting of 7,379 two-choice questions
covering diverse negation scenarios and image-question distributions. We
construct NegVQA by leveraging large language models to generate negated
versions of questions from existing VQA datasets. Evaluating 20
state-of-the-art VLMs across seven model families, we find that these models
struggle significantly with negation, exhibiting a substantial performance drop
compared to their responses to the original questions. Furthermore, we uncover
a U-shaped scaling trend, where increasing model size initially degrades
performance on NegVQA before leading to improvements. Our benchmark reveals
critical gaps in VLMs' negation understanding and offers insights into future
VLM development. Project page available at

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot

Furthermore, to facilitate further research, we carefully build a new
multi-turn multi-modal dialogue dataset (TMDialog) for pre-training,
instruction-tuning, and evaluation, which will be open-sourced lately. Compared
with other multi-modal dialogue datasets, TMDialog contains longer
conversations, which supports the research of multi-turn multi-modal dialogue.
In addition, ContextQFormer is compared with three baselines on TMDialog and
experimental results illustrate that ContextQFormer achieves an improvement of

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to classify both known and novel

Despite achieving strong performance on existing benchmarks, current textual
GCD methods lack sufficient validation in realistic settings. We introduce
Event-Centric GCD (EC-GCD), characterized by long, complex narratives and
highly imbalanced class distributions, posing two main challenges: (1)
divergent clustering versus classification groupings caused by subjective
criteria, and (2) Unfair alignment for minority classes. To tackle these, we
propose PaMA, a framework leveraging LLMs to extract and refine event patterns
for improved cluster-class alignment. Additionally, a ranking-filtering-mining
pipeline ensures balanced representation of prototypes across imbalanced
categories. Evaluations on two EC-GCD benchmarks, including a newly constructed
Scam Report dataset, demonstrate that PaMA outperforms prior methods with up to
12.58% H-score gains, while maintaining strong generalization on base GCD

Abstract: The Congress of Neurological Surgeons Self-Assessment for Neurological
Surgeons (CNS-SANS) questions are widely used by neurosurgical residents to
prepare for written board examinations. Recently, these questions have also
served as benchmarks for evaluating large language models' (LLMs) neurosurgical
knowledge. This study aims to assess the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs
on neurosurgery board-like questions and to evaluate their robustness to the
inclusion of distractor statements. A comprehensive evaluation was conducted
using 28 large language models. These models were tested on 2,904 neurosurgery
board examination questions derived from the CNS-SANS. Additionally, the study
introduced a distraction framework to assess the fragility of these models. The
framework incorporated simple, irrelevant distractor statements containing
polysemous words with clinical meanings used in non-clinical contexts to
determine the extent to which such distractions degrade model performance on
standard medical benchmarks. 6 of the 28 tested LLMs achieved board-passing
outcomes, with the top-performing models scoring over 15.7% above the passing
threshold. When exposed to distractions, accuracy across various model
architectures was significantly reduced-by as much as 20.4%-with one model
failing that had previously passed. Both general-purpose and medical
open-source models experienced greater performance declines compared to
proprietary variants when subjected to the added distractors. While current
LLMs demonstrate an impressive ability to answer neurosurgery board-like exam
questions, their performance is markedly vulnerable to extraneous, distracting
information. These findings underscore the critical need for developing novel
mitigation strategies aimed at bolstering LLM resilience against in-text
distractions, particularly for safe and effective clinical deployment.

Conclusion: 粗糙单元并非总是更好，但DPDP是一种简单高效的方法，可在需要时生成粗糙单元。

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) operate on acoustic units obtained by
discretizing self-supervised speech representations. Although the
characteristics of these units directly affect performance, the interaction
between codebook size and unit coarseness (i.e., duration) remains unexplored.
We investigate SLM performance as we vary codebook size and unit coarseness
using the simple duration-penalized dynamic programming (DPDP) method. New
analyses are performed across different linguistic levels. At the phone and
word levels, coarseness provides little benefit, as long as the codebook size
is chosen appropriately. However, when producing whole sentences in a
resynthesis task, SLMs perform better with coarser units. In lexical and
syntactic language modeling tasks, coarser units also give higher accuracies at
lower bitrates. We therefore show that coarser units aren't always better, but
that DPDP is a simple and efficient way to obtain coarser units for the tasks
where they are beneficial.

Abstract: As a leading online platform with a vast global audience, YouTube's extensive

identifying conspiracy theory videos shared on YouTube. Leveraging a labeled

show that text-based LLMs achieve high recall but lower precision, leading to
increased false positives. Multimodal models lag behind their text-only

assess real-world applicability, we evaluate the most accurate models on an

Result: CDL在多数情况下表现不如维基百科，未显示出更强的句法泛化能力。FIT-CLAMS方法能更平衡地比较训练数据。

Conclusion: CDL并非更优的训练数据，频率效应控制对评估句法能力至关重要。

Abstract: Seminal work by Huebner et al. (2021) showed that language models (LMs)
trained on English Child-Directed Language (CDL) can reach similar syntactic
abilities as LMs trained on much larger amounts of adult-directed written text,
suggesting that CDL could provide more effective LM training material than the
commonly used internet-crawled data. However, the generalizability of these
results across languages, model types, and evaluation settings remains unclear.
We test this by comparing models trained on CDL vs. Wikipedia across two LM
objectives (masked and causal), three languages (English, French, German), and
three syntactic minimal-pair benchmarks. Our results on these benchmarks show
inconsistent benefits of CDL, which in most cases is outperformed by Wikipedia
models. We then identify various shortcomings in previous benchmarks, and
introduce a novel testing methodology, FIT-CLAMS, which uses a
frequency-controlled design to enable balanced comparisons across training
corpora. Through minimal pair evaluations and regression analysis we show that
training on CDL does not yield stronger generalizations for acquiring syntax
and highlight the importance of controlling for frequency effects when
evaluating syntactic ability.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合音频特征和心理学知识的LLM方法，用于多模态抑郁症检测，并在DAIC-WOZ数据集上取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抑郁症检测在现实世界中效果有限，现有方法（如DNNs和LLMs）缺乏对非文本线索和心理知识的整合。

Method: 使用Wav2Vec提取音频特征，结合文本LLMs处理，并通过问答集引入心理学知识。

Result: 在MAE和RMSE指标上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 多模态和心理学知识的结合提升了LLMs在抑郁症检测中的性能。

Abstract: Depression is a growing concern gaining attention in both public discourse
and AI research. While deep neural networks (DNNs) have been used for
recognition, they still lack real-world effectiveness. Large language models
(LLMs) show strong potential but require domain-specific fine-tuning and
struggle with non-textual cues. Since depression is often expressed through
vocal tone and behaviour rather than explicit text, relying on language alone
is insufficient. Diagnostic accuracy also suffers without incorporating
psychological expertise. To address these limitations, we present, to the best
of our knowledge, the first application of LLMs to multimodal depression
detection using the DAIC-WOZ dataset. We extract the audio features using the
pre-trained model Wav2Vec, and mapped it to text-based LLMs for further
processing. We also propose a novel strategy for incorporating psychological
knowledge into LLMs to enhance diagnostic performance, specifically using a
question and answer set to grant authorised knowledge to LLMs. Our approach
yields a notable improvement in both Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean
Square Error (RMSE) compared to a base score proposed by the related original
paper. The codes are available at

Result: 方法在两项NLP任务中提升了社交媒体话语理解，并提供了一个多语言测试集（英语、中文、马来语、印尼语）。

Conclusion: 提出的CAT-G方法有效解决了社交媒体评论的多样性问题，并通过多语言测试集支持跨语言性能分析。

Abstract: The inherent nature of social media posts, characterized by the freedom of
language use with a disjointed array of diverse opinions and topics, poses
significant challenges to downstream NLP tasks such as comment clustering,
comment summarization, and social media opinion analysis. To address this, we
propose a granular level of identifying and generating aspect terms from
individual comments to guide model attention. Specifically, we leverage
multilingual large language models with supervised fine-tuning for comment
aspect term generation (CAT-G), further aligning the model's predictions with
human expectations through DPO. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
in enhancing the comprehension of social media discourse on two NLP tasks.
Moreover, this paper contributes the first multilingual CAT-G test set on
English, Chinese, Malay, and Bahasa Indonesian. As LLM capabilities vary among
languages, this test set allows for a comparative analysis of performance
across languages with varying levels of LLM proficiency.

Conclusion: FAMA及其开源工具推动了语音技术研究的开放性。

Abstract: The development of speech foundation models (SFMs) like Whisper and
SeamlessM4T has significantly advanced the field of speech processing. However,
their closed nature--with inaccessible training data and code--poses major
reproducibility and fair evaluation challenges. While other domains have made
substantial progress toward open science by developing fully transparent models
trained on open-source (OS) code and data, similar efforts in speech remain
limited. To fill this gap, we introduce FAMA, the first family of open science
SFMs for English and Italian, trained on 150k+ hours of OS speech data.
Moreover, we present a new dataset containing 16k hours of cleaned and
pseudo-labeled speech for both languages. Results show that FAMA achieves
competitive performance compared to existing SFMs while being up to 8 times
faster. All artifacts, including code, datasets, and models, are released under

model used for spell-correction and an encoder-based token classifier trained
to identify and mark argumentative elements. By incorporating annotations into
the scoring process, we demonstrate improvements in performance using
encoder-based large language models fine-tuned as classifiers.

Conclusion: MixORE推动了广义OpenRE研究和实际应用的发展。

Abstract: Open Relation Extraction (OpenRE) seeks to identify and extract novel
relational facts between named entities from unlabeled data without pre-defined
relation schemas. Traditional OpenRE methods typically assume that the
unlabeled data consists solely of novel relations or is pre-divided into known
and novel instances. However, in real-world scenarios, novel relations are
arbitrarily distributed. In this paper, we propose a generalized OpenRE setting
that considers unlabeled data as a mixture of both known and novel instances.
To address this, we propose MixORE, a two-phase framework that integrates
relation classification and clustering to jointly learn known and novel
relations. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that MixORE
consistently outperforms competitive baselines in known relation classification
and novel relation clustering. Our findings contribute to the advancement of
generalized OpenRE research and real-world applications.

Conclusion: 文本在语义空间中的邻域峰值可有效估计图像性和具体性，NSM是一种高效的无监督方法。

Abstract: Imageability (potential of text to evoke a mental image) and concreteness
(perceptibility of text) are two psycholinguistic properties that link visual
and semantic spaces. It is little surprise that computational methods that
estimate them do so using parallel visual and semantic spaces, such as
collections of image-caption pairs or multi-modal models. In this paper, we
work on the supposition that text itself in an image-caption dataset offers
sufficient signals to accurately estimate these properties. We hypothesize, in
particular, that the peakedness of the neighborhood of a word in the semantic
embedding space reflects its degree of imageability and concreteness. We then
propose an unsupervised, distribution-free measure, which we call Neighborhood
Stability Measure (NSM), that quantifies the sharpness of peaks. Extensive
experiments show that NSM correlates more strongly with ground-truth ratings
than existing unsupervised methods, and is a strong predictor of these
properties for classification. Our code and data are available on GitHub
(https://github.com/Artificial-Memory-Lab/imageability).

Abstract: Machine-Facing English (MFE) is an emergent register shaped by the adaptation
of everyday language to the expanding presence of AI interlocutors. Drawing on
register theory (Halliday 1985, 2006), enregisterment (Agha 2003), audience
design (Bell 1984), and interactional pragmatics (Giles & Ogay 2007), this
study traces how sustained human-AI interaction normalizes syntactic rigidity,
pragmatic simplification, and hyper-explicit phrasing - features that enhance
machine parseability at the expense of natural fluency. Our analysis is
grounded in qualitative observations from bilingual (Korean/English) voice- and
text-based product testing sessions, with reflexive drafting conducted using
Natural Language Declarative Prompting (NLD-P) under human curation. Thematic
analysis identifies five recurrent traits - redundant clarity, directive
syntax, controlled vocabulary, flattened prosody, and single-intent structuring
- that improve execution accuracy but compress expressive range. MFE's
evolution highlights a persistent tension between communicative efficiency and
linguistic richness, raising design challenges for conversational interfaces
and pedagogical considerations for multilingual users. We conclude by
underscoring the need for comprehensive methodological exposition and future
empirical validation.

Abstract: Effective clinical decision-making depends on iterative, multimodal reasoning
across diverse sources of evidence. The recent emergence of multimodal
reasoning models has significantly transformed the landscape of solving complex
tasks. Although such models have achieved notable success in mathematics and
science, their application to medical domains remains underexplored. In this
work, we propose \textit{MedE$^2$}, a two-stage post-training pipeline that
elicits and then enhances multimodal reasoning for medical domains. In Stage-I,
we fine-tune models using 2,000 text-only data samples containing precisely
orchestrated reasoning demonstrations to elicit reasoning behaviors. In
Stage-II, we further enhance the model's reasoning capabilities using 1,500
rigorously curated multimodal medical cases, aligning model reasoning outputs
with our proposed multimodal medical reasoning preference. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the efficacy and reliability of \textit{MedE$^2$} in
improving the reasoning performance of medical multimodal models. Notably,
models trained with \textit{MedE$^2$} consistently outperform baselines across
multiple medical multimodal benchmarks. Additional validation on larger models
and under inference-time scaling further confirms the robustness and practical
utility of our approach.

efficient BLI approach, Muse and Vecmap, perform much worse on the Medical

is relatively smaller compared to the generic domain data set generally, and
specialized words have a lower frequency, which will directly affect the
translation quality of bilingual dictionaries. On the other hand, static word
embeddings are widely used for BLI, however, in some specific fields, the
meaning of words is greatly influenced by context, in this case, using only
static word embeddings may lead to greater bias. ent strategies in different

Conclusion: Retell为文学文本的主题建模提供了一种简单有效的方法，适用于文化分析等领域。

Abstract: Conventional bag-of-words approaches for topic modeling, like latent
Dirichlet allocation (LDA), struggle with literary text. Literature challenges
lexical methods because narrative language focuses on immersive sensory details
instead of abstractive description or exposition: writers are advised to "show,
don't tell." We propose Retell, a simple, accessible topic modeling approach
for literature. Here, we prompt resource-efficient, generative language models
(LMs) to tell what passages show, thereby translating narratives' surface forms
into higher-level concepts and themes. By running LDA on LMs' retellings of
passages, we can obtain more precise and informative topics than by running LDA
alone or by directly asking LMs to list topics. To investigate the potential of
our method for cultural analytics, we compare our method's outputs to
expert-guided annotations in a case study on racial/cultural identity in high
school English language arts books.

Abstract: Transforming dense, detailed, unstructured text into an interpretable and
summarised table, also colloquially known as Text-to-Table generation, is an
essential task for information retrieval. Current methods, however, miss out on
how and what complex information to extract; they also lack the ability to
infer data from the text. In this paper, we introduce a versatile approach,
Map&Make, which "dissects" text into propositional atomic statements. This
facilitates granular decomposition to extract the latent schema. The schema is
then used to populate the tables that capture the qualitative nuances and the
quantitative facts in the original text. Our approach is tested against two
challenging datasets, Rotowire, renowned for its complex and multi-table
schema, and Livesum, which demands numerical aggregation. By carefully
identifying and correcting hallucination errors in Rotowire, we aim to achieve
a cleaner and more reliable benchmark. We evaluate our method rigorously on a
comprehensive suite of comparative and referenceless metrics. Our findings
demonstrate significant improvement results across both datasets with better
interpretability in Text-to-Table generation. Moreover, through detailed
ablation studies and analyses, we investigate the factors contributing to
superior performance and validate the practicality of our framework in
structured summarization tasks.

interpretability and uncertainty quantification to identify translation errors

Abstract: Chart question answering (CQA) has become a critical multimodal task for
evaluating the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models. While early
approaches have shown promising performance by focusing on visual features or
leveraging large-scale pre-training, most existing evaluations rely on rigid
output formats and objective metrics, thus ignoring the complex, real-world
demands of practical chart analysis. In this paper, we introduce ChartMind, a
new benchmark designed for complex CQA tasks in real-world settings. ChartMind
covers seven task categories, incorporates multilingual contexts, supports
open-domain textual outputs, and accommodates diverse chart formats, bridging
the gap between real-world applications and traditional academic benchmarks.
Furthermore, we propose a context-aware yet model-agnostic framework, ChartLLM,
that focuses on extracting key contextual elements, reducing noise, and
enhancing the reasoning accuracy of multimodal large language models. Extensive
evaluations on ChartMind and three representative public benchmarks with 14
mainstream multimodal models show our framework significantly outperforms the
previous three common CQA paradigms: instruction-following, OCR-enhanced, and
chain-of-thought, highlighting the importance of flexible chart understanding
for real-world CQA. These findings suggest new directions for developing more
robust chart reasoning in future research.

Conclusion: 多维方法空间为科学方法管理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Approaches form the foundation for conducting scientific research. Querying
approaches from a vast body of scientific papers is extremely time-consuming,
and without a well-organized management framework, researchers may face
significant challenges in querying and utilizing relevant approaches.
Constructing multiple dimensions on approaches and managing them from these
dimensions can provide an efficient solution. Firstly, this paper identifies
approach patterns using a top-down way, refining the patterns through four
distinct linguistic levels: semantic level, discourse level, syntactic level,
and lexical level. Approaches in scientific papers are extracted based on
approach patterns. Additionally, five dimensions for categorizing approaches
are identified using these patterns. This paper proposes using tree structure
to represent step and measuring the similarity between different steps with a
tree-structure-based similarity measure that focuses on syntactic-level
similarities. A collection similarity measure is proposed to compute the
similarity between approaches. A bottom-up clustering algorithm is proposed to
construct class trees for approach components within each dimension by merging
each approach component or class with its most similar approach component or
class in each iteration. The class labels generated during the clustering
process indicate the common semantics of the step components within the
approach components in each class and are used to manage the approaches within
the class. The class trees of the five dimensions collectively form a
multi-dimensional approach space. The application of approach queries on the
multi-dimensional approach space demonstrates that querying within this space
ensures strong relevance between user queries and results and rapidly reduces
search space through a class-based query mechanism.

Conclusion: 置信度建模显著提高了AES评分的可靠性。

Abstract: A key ethical challenge in Automated Essay Scoring (AES) is ensuring that
scores are only released when they meet high reliability standards. Confidence
modelling addresses this by assigning a reliability estimate measure, in the
form of a confidence score, to each automated score. In this study, we frame
confidence estimation as a classification task: predicting whether an
AES-generated score correctly places a candidate in the appropriate CEFR level.
While this is a binary decision, we leverage the inherent granularity of the
scoring domain in two ways. First, we reformulate the task as an n-ary
classification problem using score binning. Second, we introduce a set of novel
Kernel Weighted Ordinal Categorical Cross Entropy (KWOCCE) loss functions that
incorporate the ordinal structure of CEFR labels. Our best-performing model
achieves an F1 score of 0.97, and enables the system to release 47% of scores
with 100% CEFR agreement and 99% with at least 95% CEFR agreement -compared to
approximately 92% (approx.) CEFR agreement from the standalone AES model where
we release all AM predicted scores.

Conclusion: GeNRe推动了法语NLP中性别偏见缓解技术的发展。

Abstract: A significant portion of the textual data used in the field of Natural
Language Processing (NLP) exhibits gender biases, particularly due to the use
of masculine generics (masculine words that are supposed to refer to mixed
groups of men and women), which can perpetuate and amplify stereotypes. Gender
rewriting, an NLP task that involves automatically detecting and replacing
gendered forms with neutral or opposite forms (e.g., from masculine to
feminine), can be employed to mitigate these biases. While such systems have
been developed in a number of languages (English, Arabic, Portuguese, German,
French), automatic use of gender neutralization techniques (as opposed to
inclusive or gender-switching techniques) has only been studied for English.
This paper presents GeNRe, the very first French gender-neutral rewriting
system using collective nouns, which are gender-fixed in French. We introduce a
rule-based system (RBS) tailored for the French language alongside two
fine-tuned language models trained on data generated by our RBS. We also
explore the use of instruct-based models to enhance the performance of our
other systems and find that Claude 3 Opus combined with our dictionary achieves
results close to our RBS. Through this contribution, we hope to promote the
advancement of gender bias mitigation techniques in NLP for French.

Abstract: Modern phonetic research regularly makes use of automatic tools for the
annotation of speech data, however few tools exist for the annotation of many
variable phonetic phenomena. At the same time, pre-trained self-supervised
models, such as wav2vec2.0, have been shown to perform well at speech
classification tasks and latently encode fine-grained phonetic information. We
demonstrate that wav2vec2.0 models can be trained to automatically classify
stop burst presence with high accuracy in both English and Japanese, robust
across both finely-curated and unprepared speech corpora. Patterns of
variability in stop realisation are replicated with the automatic annotations,
and closely follow those of manual annotations. These results demonstrate the
potential of pre-trained speech models as tools for the automatic annotation
and processing of speech corpus data, enabling researchers to `scale-up' the
scope of phonetic research with relative ease.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical need for high-quality evaluation datasets
in low-resource languages to advance cross-lingual transfer. While
cross-lingual transfer offers a key strategy for leveraging multilingual
pretraining to expand language technologies to understudied and typologically
diverse languages, its effectiveness is dependent on quality and suitable
benchmarks. We release new sense-annotated datasets of sentences containing
polysemous words, spanning nine low-resource languages across diverse language
families and scripts. To facilitate dataset creation, the paper presents a
demonstrably beneficial semi-automatic annotation method. The utility of the
datasets is demonstrated through Word-in-Context (WiC) formatted experiments
that evaluate transfer on these low-resource languages. Results highlight the
importance of targeted dataset creation and evaluation for effective polysemy
disambiguation in low-resource settings and transfer studies. The released
datasets and code aim to support further research into fair, robust, and truly

Motivation: Rebus谜题对VLMs提出了独特挑战，需要多模态抽象、符号推理和文化语言双关的理解，而传统任务（如图像描述）无法涵盖这些能力。

Method: 构建了一个手工生成和标注的Rebus谜题基准，涵盖从简单图像替换到空间依赖提示的多样谜题，并分析了不同VLMs的表现。

Result: VLMs在解码简单视觉线索时表现尚可，但在需要抽象推理、横向思维和视觉隐喻理解的任务中表现显著不足。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在解决复杂多模态任务（如Rebus谜题）时仍有局限性，需进一步提升抽象推理和隐喻理解能力。

Abstract: Rebus puzzles, visual riddles that encode language through imagery, spatial
arrangement, and symbolic substitution, pose a unique challenge to current
vision-language models (VLMs). Unlike traditional image captioning or question
answering tasks, rebus solving requires multi-modal abstraction, symbolic
reasoning, and a grasp of cultural, phonetic and linguistic puns. In this
paper, we investigate the capacity of contemporary VLMs to interpret and solve
rebus puzzles by constructing a hand-generated and annotated benchmark of
diverse English-language rebus puzzles, ranging from simple pictographic
substitutions to spatially-dependent cues ("head" over "heels"). We analyze how
different VLMs perform, and our findings reveal that while VLMs exhibit some
surprising capabilities in decoding simple visual clues, they struggle
significantly with tasks requiring abstract reasoning, lateral thinking, and
understanding visual metaphors.

Abstract: Software is an essential component of research. However, little attention has
been paid to it compared with that paid to research data. Recently, there has
been an increase in efforts to acknowledge and highlight the importance of
software in research activities.
  Structured metadata from platforms like bio.tools, Bioconductor, and Galaxy
ToolShed offers valuable insights into research software in the Life Sciences.
Although originally intended to support discovery and integration, this
metadata can be repurposed for large-scale analysis of software practices.
However, its quality and completeness vary across platforms, reflecting diverse
documentation practices.
  To gain a comprehensive view of software development and sustainability,
consolidating this metadata is necessary, but requires robust mechanisms to
address its heterogeneity and scale.
  This article presents an evaluation of instruction-tuned large language
models for the task of software metadata identity resolution, a critical step
in assembling a cohesive collection of research software. Such a collection is
the reference component for the Software Observatory at OpenEBench, a platform
that aggregates metadata to monitor the FAIRness of research software in the
Life Sciences.
  We benchmarked multiple models against a human-annotated gold standard,
examined their behavior on ambiguous cases, and introduced an agreement-based
proxy for high-confidence automated decisions. The proxy achieved high
precision and statistical robustness, while also highlighting the limitations
of current models and the broader challenges of automating semantic judgment in
FAIR-aligned software metadata across registries and repositories.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel treebank-driven approach to comparing syntactic
structures in speech and writing using dependency-parsed corpora. Adopting a
fully inductive, bottom-up method, we define syntactic structures as
delexicalized dependency (sub)trees and extract them from spoken and written
Universal Dependencies (UD) treebanks in two syntactically distinct languages,
English and Slovenian. For each corpus, we analyze the size, diversity, and
distribution of syntactic inventories, their overlap across modalities, and the
structures most characteristic of speech. Results show that, across both
languages, spoken corpora contain fewer and less diverse syntactic structures
than their written counterparts, with consistent cross-linguistic preferences
for certain structural types across modalities. Strikingly, the overlap between
spoken and written syntactic inventories is very limited: most structures
attested in speech do not occur in writing, pointing to modality-specific
preferences in syntactic organization that reflect the distinct demands of
real-time interaction and elaborated writing. This contrast is further
supported by a keyness analysis of the most frequent speech-specific
structures, which highlights patterns associated with interactivity,
context-grounding, and economy of expression. We argue that this scalable,
language-independent framework offers a useful general method for
systematically studying syntactic variation across corpora, laying the
groundwork for more comprehensive data-driven theories of grammar in use.

assertion detection in pediatric CXR reports. Additionally, CheXpert and
CheXbert, two dedicated chest radiograph report labelers, were evaluated on the
same task using CheXpert-defined labels. We analyzed 95,008 pediatric CXR
reports from a large academic pediatric hospital. Entities and assertion
statuses (positive, negative, uncertain) from the findings and impression
sections were extracted by the NLP systems, with impression section entities
mapped to 12 disease categories and a No Findings category. CheXpert and
CheXbert extracted the same 13 categories. Outputs were compared using Fleiss

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant visual
understanding capabilities, yet their fine-grained visual perception in complex
real-world scenarios, such as densely crowded public areas, remains limited.
Inspired by the recent success of reinforcement learning (RL) in both LLMs and
MLLMs, in this paper, we explore how RL can enhance visual perception ability
of MLLMs. Then we develop a novel RL-based framework, Deep Inspection and
Perception with RL (DIP-R1) designed to enhance the visual perception
capabilities of MLLMs, by comprehending complex scenes and looking through
visual instances closely. DIP-R1 guides MLLMs through detailed inspection of
visual scene via three simply designed rule-based reward modelings. First, we
adopt a standard reasoning reward encouraging the model to include three
step-by-step processes: 1) reasoning for understanding visual scenes, 2)
observing for looking through interested but ambiguous regions, and 3)
decision-making for predicting answer. Second, a variance-guided looking reward
is designed to examine uncertain regions for the second observing process. It
explicitly enables the model to inspect ambiguous areas, improving its ability
to mitigate perceptual uncertainties. Third, we model a weighted
precision-recall accuracy reward enhancing accurate decision-making. We explore
its effectiveness across diverse fine-grained object detection data consisting
of challenging real-world environments, such as densely crowded scenes. Built
upon existing MLLMs, DIP-R1 achieves consistent and significant improvement
across various in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios. It also outperforms
various existing baseline models and supervised fine-tuning methods. Our
findings highlight the substantial potential of integrating RL into MLLMs for
enhancing capabilities in complex real-world perception tasks.

models. On the other hand, deploying all individual fine-tuned models incurs
high costs. We propose FlexMerge, a novel data-free model merging framework to
flexibly generate merged models of varying sizes, spanning the spectrum from a
single merged model to retaining all individual fine-tuned models. FlexMerge
treats fine-tuned models as collections of sequential blocks and progressively
merges them using any existing data-free merging method, halting at a desired
size. We systematically explore the accuracy-size trade-off exhibited by
different merging algorithms in combination with FlexMerge. Extensive
experiments on vision and NLP benchmarks, with up to 30 tasks, reveal that even
modestly larger merged models can provide substantial accuracy improvements
over a single model. By offering fine-grained control over fused model size,
FlexMerge provides a flexible, data-free, and high-performance solution for
diverse deployment scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出‘视觉房间’论点，质疑多模态大模型（MLMs）是否真正理解图像，并引入感知与认知两层次评估框架。实验表明MLMs在感知任务表现良好，但在理解讽刺时仍有显著差距。

Motivation: 探讨MLMs是否真正理解图像内容，挑战‘感知即理解’的假设。

Method: 提出两层次评估框架（感知与认知），并构建高质量多模态讽刺数据集。评估了8种SoTA MLMs。

Result: MLMs感知任务表现良好，但讽刺理解错误率约16.1%，揭示‘看’与‘理解’的差距。

Conclusion: 研究为‘视觉房间’论点提供实证支持，并提出MLMs新评估范式。

Abstract: Can multi-modal large models (MLMs) that can ``see'' an image be said to
``understand'' it? Drawing inspiration from Searle's Chinese Room, we propose
the \textbf{Visual Room} argument: a system may process and describe every
detail of visual inputs by following algorithmic rules, without genuinely
comprehending the underlying intention. This dilemma challenges the prevailing
assumption that perceptual mastery implies genuine understanding. In
implementation, we introduce a two-tier evaluation framework spanning
perception and cognition. The perception component evaluates whether MLMs can
accurately capture the surface-level details of visual contents, where the
cognitive component examines their ability to infer sarcasm polarity. To
support this framework, We further introduce a high-quality multi-modal sarcasm
dataset comprising both 924 static images and 100 dynamic videos. All sarcasm
labels are annotated by the original authors and verified by independent
reviewers to ensure clarity and consistency. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art
(SoTA) MLMs. Our results highlight three key findings: (1) MLMs perform well on
perception tasks; (2) even with correct perception, models exhibit an average
error rate of ~16.1\% in sarcasm understanding, revealing a significant gap
between seeing and understanding; (3) error analysis attributes this gap to
deficiencies in emotional reasoning, commonsense inference, and context
alignment. This work provides empirical grounding for the proposed Visual Room
argument and offers a new evaluation paradigm for MLMs.

Conclusion: RL微调对VAR模型高效且有效，尤其适合在线采样任务。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained generative models with Reinforcement Learning (RL)
has emerged as an effective approach for aligning outputs more closely with
nuanced human preferences. In this paper, we investigate the application of
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune next-scale visual
autoregressive (VAR) models. Our empirical results demonstrate that this
approach enables alignment to intricate reward signals derived from aesthetic
predictors and CLIP embeddings, significantly enhancing image quality and
enabling precise control over the generation style. Interestingly, by
leveraging CLIP, our method can help VAR models generalize beyond their initial
ImageNet distribution: through RL-driven exploration, these models can generate
images aligned with prompts referencing image styles that were absent during
pre-training. In summary, we show that RL-based fine-tuning is both efficient
and effective for VAR models, benefiting particularly from their fast inference
speeds, which are advantageous for online sampling, an aspect that poses
significant challenges for diffusion-based alternatives.

Conclusion: UniRL无需外部数据，提升任务性能并减少任务间不平衡，仅需少量额外训练步骤。

Abstract: Unified multimodal large language models such as Show-o and Janus have
achieved strong performance across both generation and understanding tasks.
However, these models typically rely on large-scale datasets and require
substantial computation during the pretraining stage. In addition, several
post-training methods have been proposed, but they often depend on external
data or are limited to task-specific customization. In this work, we introduce
UniRL, a self-improving post-training approach. Our approach enables the model
to generate images from prompts and use them as training data in each
iteration, without relying on any external image data. Moreover, it enables the
two tasks to enhance each other: the generated images are used for
understanding, and the understanding results are used to supervise generation.
We explore supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to optimize the models. UniRL offers three key advantages: (1) it
requires no external image data, as all training samples are generated by the
model itself during training; (2) it not only improves individual task
performance, but also reduces the imbalance between generation and
understanding; and (3) it requires only several additional training steps
during the post-training stage. We evaluate UniRL on top of Show-o and Janus,
achieving a GenEval score of 0.77 for Show-o and 0.65 for Janus. Code and

Abstract: The application of rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) to multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) introduces unique challenges and potential deviations
from findings in text-only domains, particularly for perception-heavy tasks.
This paper provides a comprehensive study of rule-based visual RL using jigsaw
puzzles as a structured experimental framework, revealing several key findings.
\textit{Firstly,} we find that MLLMs, initially performing near to random
guessing on simple puzzles, achieve near-perfect accuracy and generalize to
complex, unseen configurations through fine-tuning. \textit{Secondly,} training
on jigsaw puzzles can induce generalization to other visual tasks, with
effectiveness tied to specific task configurations. \textit{Thirdly,} MLLMs can
learn and generalize with or without explicit reasoning, though open-source
models often favor direct answering. Consequently, even when trained for
step-by-step reasoning, they can ignore the thinking process in deriving the
final answer. \textit{Fourthly,} we observe that complex reasoning patterns
appear to be pre-existing rather than emergent, with their frequency increasing
alongside training and task difficulty. \textit{Finally,} our results
demonstrate that RL exhibits more effective generalization than Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT), and an initial SFT cold start phase can hinder subsequent RL
optimization. Although these observations are based on jigsaw puzzles and may
vary across other visual tasks, this research contributes a valuable piece of
jigsaw to the larger puzzle of collective understanding rule-based visual RL
and its potential in multimodal learning. The code is available at:

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) over chains of thought has significantly
advanced language models in tasks such as mathematics and coding, visual
reasoning introduces added complexity by requiring models to direct visual
attention, interpret perceptual inputs, and ground abstract reasoning in
spatial evidence. We introduce ViGoRL (Visually Grounded Reinforcement
Learning), a vision-language model trained with RL to explicitly anchor each
reasoning step to specific visual coordinates. Inspired by human visual
decision-making, ViGoRL learns to produce spatially grounded reasoning traces,
guiding visual attention to task-relevant regions at each step. When
fine-grained exploration is required, our novel multi-turn RL framework enables
the model to dynamically zoom into predicted coordinates as reasoning unfolds.
Across a diverse set of visual reasoning benchmarks--including SAT-2 and BLINK
for spatial reasoning, V*bench for visual search, and ScreenSpot and
VisualWebArena for web-based grounding--ViGoRL consistently outperforms both
supervised fine-tuning and conventional RL baselines that lack explicit
grounding mechanisms. Incorporating multi-turn RL with zoomed-in visual
feedback significantly improves ViGoRL's performance on localizing small GUI
elements and visual search, achieving 86.4% on V*Bench. Additionally, we find
that grounding amplifies other visual behaviors such as region exploration,
grounded subgoal setting, and visual verification. Finally, human evaluations
show that the model's visual references are not only spatially accurate but
also helpful for understanding model reasoning steps. Our results show that
visually grounded RL is a strong paradigm for imbuing models with
general-purpose visual reasoning.

Conclusion: 该研究为高效且可解释的多模态理解提供了新视角。

Abstract: Existing reasoning segmentation approaches typically fine-tune multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) using image-text pairs and corresponding mask
labels. However, they exhibit limited generalization to out-of-distribution
scenarios without an explicit reasoning process. Although recent efforts
leverage reinforcement learning through group-relative policy optimization
(GRPO) to enhance reasoning ability, they often suffer from overthinking -
producing uniformly verbose reasoning chains irrespective of task complexity.
This results in elevated computational costs and limited control over reasoning
quality. To address this problem, we propose PixelThink, a simple yet effective
scheme that integrates externally estimated task difficulty and internally
measured model uncertainty to regulate reasoning generation within a
reinforcement learning paradigm. The model learns to compress reasoning length
in accordance with scene complexity and predictive confidence. To support
comprehensive evaluation, we introduce ReasonSeg-Diff, an extended benchmark
with annotated reasoning references and difficulty scores, along with a suite
of metrics designed to assess segmentation accuracy, reasoning quality, and
efficiency jointly. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach
improves both reasoning efficiency and overall segmentation performance. Our
work contributes novel perspectives towards efficient and interpretable
multimodal understanding. The code and model will be publicly available.

Conclusion: Re-ttention在高效视觉生成模型中具有显著优势，适用于高分辨率视频和图像生成。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have become the de-facto model for generating
high-quality visual content like videos and images. A huge bottleneck is the
attention mechanism where complexity scales quadratically with resolution and
video length. One logical way to lessen this burden is sparse attention, where
only a subset of tokens or patches are included in the calculation. However,
existing techniques fail to preserve visual quality at extremely high sparsity
levels and might even incur non-negligible compute overheads. % To address this
concern, we propose Re-ttention, which implements very high sparse attention
for visual generation models by leveraging the temporal redundancy of Diffusion
Models to overcome the probabilistic normalization shift within the attention
mechanism. Specifically, Re-ttention reshapes attention scores based on the
prior softmax distribution history in order to preserve the visual quality of
the full quadratic attention at very high sparsity levels. % Experimental
results on T2V/T2I models such as CogVideoX and the PixArt DiTs demonstrate
that Re-ttention requires as few as 3.1\% of the tokens during inference,
outperforming contemporary methods like FastDiTAttn, Sparse VideoGen and
MInference. Further, we measure latency to show that our method can attain over
45\% end-to-end % and over 92\% self-attention latency reduction on an H100 GPU
at negligible overhead cost.

Result: 评估了18个最先进的多模态LLM（MLLM），发现大多数在复杂视频推理上表现不佳，例如GPT-4o准确率仅6.9%，而Gemini-2.5-Pro以56.0%显著领先。

Conclusion: VideoReasonBench揭示了扩展思维预算对提升复杂视频推理性能的重要性，而现有视频基准测试中这一优势不明显。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning can
significantly enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) on
complex tasks. However, this benefit is yet to be demonstrated in the domain of
video understanding, since most existing benchmarks lack the reasoning depth
required to demonstrate the advantages of extended CoT chains. While recent
efforts have proposed benchmarks aimed at video reasoning, the tasks are often
knowledge-driven and do not rely heavily on visual content. To bridge this gap,
we introduce VideoReasonBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate vision-centric,
complex video reasoning. To ensure visual richness and high reasoning
complexity, each video in VideoReasonBench depicts a sequence of fine-grained
operations on a latent state that is only visible in part of the video. The
questions evaluate three escalating levels of video reasoning skills: recalling
observed visual information, inferring the content of latent states, and
predicting information beyond the video. Under such task setting, models have
to precisely recall multiple operations in the video, and perform step-by-step
reasoning to get correct final answers for these questions. Using
VideoReasonBench, we comprehensively evaluate 18 state-of-the-art multimodal
LLMs (MLLMs), finding that most perform poorly on complex video reasoning,
e.g., GPT-4o achieves only 6.9% accuracy, while the thinking-enhanced
Gemini-2.5-Pro significantly outperforms others with 56.0% accuracy. Our
investigations on "test-time scaling" further reveal that extended thinking
budget, while offering none or minimal benefits on existing video benchmarks,
is essential for improving the performance on VideoReasonBench.

Abstract: Inference time scaling drives extended reasoning to enhance the performance
of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), thus forming powerful Vision-Language
Reasoning Models (VLRMs). However, long reasoning dilutes visual tokens,
causing visual information to receive less attention and may trigger
hallucinations. Although introducing text-only reflection processes shows
promise in language models, we demonstrate that it is insufficient to suppress
hallucinations in VLMs. To address this issue, we introduce Qwen-LookAgain
(Qwen-LA), a novel VLRM designed to mitigate hallucinations by incorporating a
vision-text reflection process that guides the model to re-attention visual
information during reasoning. We first propose a reinforcement learning method
Balanced Reflective Policy Optimization (BRPO), which guides the model to
decide when to generate vision-text reflection on its own and balance the
number and length of reflections. Then, we formally prove that VLRMs lose
attention to visual tokens as reasoning progresses, and demonstrate that
supplementing visual information during reflection enhances visual attention.
Therefore, during training and inference, Visual Token COPY and Visual Token
ROUTE are introduced to force the model to re-attention visual information at
the visual level, addressing the limitations of text-only reflection.
Experiments on multiple visual QA datasets and hallucination metrics indicate
that Qwen-LA achieves leading accuracy performance while reducing
hallucinations. Our code is available at:

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
aligning visual and textual modalities, enabling a wide range of applications
in multimodal understanding and generation. While they excel in zero-shot and
transfer learning scenarios, VLMs remain susceptible to misclassification,

significant risk in safety-critical domains, where erroneous predictions can
lead to severe consequences. In this work, we introduce TrustVLM, a
training-free framework designed to address the critical challenge of
estimating when VLM's predictions can be trusted. Motivated by the observed
modality gap in VLMs and the insight that certain concepts are more distinctly
represented in the image embedding space, we propose a novel confidence-scoring
function that leverages this space to improve misclassification detection. We

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly enhanced performance on 2D visual tasks. However, improving their
spatial intelligence remains a challenge. Existing 3D MLLMs always rely on
additional 3D or 2.5D data to incorporate spatial awareness, restricting their
utility in scenarios with only 2D inputs, such as images or videos. In this
paper, we present Spatial-MLLM, a novel framework for visual-based spatial
reasoning from purely 2D observations. Unlike conventional video MLLMs which
rely on CLIP-based visual encoders optimized for semantic understanding, our
key insight is to unleash the strong structure prior from the feed-forward
visual geometry foundation model. Specifically, we propose a dual-encoder
architecture: a pretrained 2D visual encoder to extract semantic features, and
a spatial encoder-initialized from the backbone of the visual geometry model-to
extract 3D structure features. A connector then integrates both features into
unified visual tokens for enhanced spatial understanding. Furthermore, we
propose a space-aware frame sampling strategy at inference time, which selects
the spatially informative frames of a video sequence, ensuring that even under
limited token length, the model focuses on frames critical for spatial
reasoning. Beyond architecture improvements, we construct the Spatial-MLLM-120k
dataset and train the model on it using supervised fine-tuning and GRPO.
Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that our
spatial-MLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of
visual-based spatial understanding and reasoning tasks. Project page:

tool-interaction paradigms, ThinkGeo includes human-curated queries spanning a
wide range of real-world applications such as urban planning, disaster
assessment and change analysis, environmental monitoring, transportation

Qwen2.5) on 436 structured agentic tasks. The benchmark reports both step-wise
execution metrics and final answer correctness. Our analysis reveals notable

Abstract: CLIP is a discriminative model trained to align images and text in a shared
embedding space. Due to its multimodal structure, it serves as the backbone of
many generative pipelines, where a decoder is trained to map from the shared
space back to images. In this work, we show that image synthesis is
nevertheless possible using CLIP alone -- without any decoder, training, or
fine-tuning. Our approach optimizes a frequency-aware implicit neural
representation that encourages coarse-to-fine generation by stratifying
frequencies across network layers. To stabilize this inverse mapping, we
introduce adversarially robust initialization, a lightweight Orthogonal
Procrustes projection to align local text and image embeddings, and a blending
loss that anchors outputs to natural image statistics. Without altering CLIP's
weights, this framework unlocks capabilities such as text-to-image generation,
style transfer, and image reconstruction. These findings suggest that
discriminative models may hold untapped generative potential, hidden in plain

Motivation: 当前MLLMs在图像美学推理任务中表现不佳，尤其是医学图像筛选领域缺乏数据和模型能力不足。

Method: 构建了一个包含1500+样本的医学图像筛选数据集，并提出了一种基于强化学习的方法（DPA-GRPO）来增强MLLMs的图像美学推理能力。

Result: 实验表明，即使是GPT-4o等闭源模型在该任务中表现接近随机猜测，而提出的方法通过小模型超越了这些大模型的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为图像美学推理任务提供了一种可行的解决方案，并希望成为未来相关任务的基准配置。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are of great application across many
domains, such as multimodal understanding and generation. With the development
of diffusion models (DM) and unified MLLMs, the performance of image generation
has been significantly improved, however, the study of image screening is rare
and its performance with MLLMs is unsatisfactory due to the lack of data and
the week image aesthetic reasoning ability in MLLMs. In this work, we propose a
complete solution to address these problems in terms of data and methodology.
For data, we collect a comprehensive medical image screening dataset with 1500+
samples, each sample consists of a medical image, four generated images, and a
multiple-choice answer. The dataset evaluates the aesthetic reasoning ability
under four aspects: \textit{(1) Appearance Deformation, (2) Principles of
Physical Lighting and Shadow, (3) Placement Layout, (4) Extension Rationality}.
For methodology, we utilize long chains of thought (CoT) and Group Relative
Policy Optimization with Dynamic Proportional Accuracy reward, called DPA-GRPO,
to enhance the image aesthetic reasoning ability of MLLMs. Our experimental
results reveal that even state-of-the-art closed-source MLLMs, such as GPT-4o
and Qwen-VL-Max, exhibit performance akin to random guessing in image aesthetic
reasoning. In contrast, by leveraging the reinforcement learning approach, we
are able to surpass the score of both large-scale models and leading
closed-source models using a much smaller model. We hope our attempt on medical
image screening will serve as a regular configuration in image aesthetic
reasoning in the future.

Motivation: 当前的内窥镜基准测试覆盖范围有限，无法反映真实场景的多样性和临床需求的全面性，因此需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: 通过设计包含4种内窥镜场景、12项临床任务和5种视觉提示粒度的基准测试，生成6,832个验证问题，并评估23种先进模型。

Result: 专有MLLMs表现优于开源和医学专用模型，但仍不及人类专家；医学领域的监督微调显著提升任务准确性；模型性能受提示格式和任务复杂度影响。

Conclusion: EndoBench为内窥镜领域的MLLMs评估设立了新标准，揭示了当前模型与专家临床推理之间的差距。

Abstract: Endoscopic procedures are essential for diagnosing and treating internal
diseases, and multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly
applied to assist in endoscopy analysis. However, current benchmarks are
limited, as they typically cover specific endoscopic scenarios and a small set
of clinical tasks, failing to capture the real-world diversity of endoscopic
scenarios and the full range of skills needed in clinical workflows. To address
these issues, we introduce EndoBench, the first comprehensive benchmark
specifically designed to assess MLLMs across the full spectrum of endoscopic
practice with multi-dimensional capacities. EndoBench encompasses 4 distinct
endoscopic scenarios, 12 specialized clinical tasks with 12 secondary subtasks,
and 5 levels of visual prompting granularities, resulting in 6,832 rigorously
validated VQA pairs from 21 diverse datasets. Our multi-dimensional evaluation
framework mirrors the clinical workflow--spanning anatomical recognition,
lesion analysis, spatial localization, and surgical operations--to holistically
gauge the perceptual and diagnostic abilities of MLLMs in realistic scenarios.
We benchmark 23 state-of-the-art models, including general-purpose,
medical-specialized, and proprietary MLLMs, and establish human clinician
performance as a reference standard. Our extensive experiments reveal: (1)
proprietary MLLMs outperform open-source and medical-specialized models
overall, but still trail human experts; (2) medical-domain supervised
fine-tuning substantially boosts task-specific accuracy; and (3) model
performance remains sensitive to prompt format and clinical task complexity.
EndoBench establishes a new standard for evaluating and advancing MLLMs in
endoscopy, highlighting both progress and persistent gaps between current
models and expert clinical reasoning. We publicly release our benchmark and
code.

Method: 提出基于全景子对象轨迹的标记化方法TrajViT，通过对比学习训练，提取对象轨迹并转换为语义标记。

Result: TrajViT在视频理解任务中显著优于ViT3D，如视频-文本检索任务中Top-5召回率提升6%，且标记减少10倍。

Conclusion: TrajViT是首个在多样化视频分析任务中高效且一致优于ViT3D的编码器，具有鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Effective video tokenization is critical for scaling transformer models for
long videos. Current approaches tokenize videos using space-time patches,
leading to excessive tokens and computational inefficiencies. The best token
reduction strategies degrade performance and barely reduce the number of tokens
when the camera moves. We introduce grounded video tokenization, a paradigm
that organizes tokens based on panoptic sub-object trajectories rather than
fixed patches. Our method aligns with fundamental perceptual principles,
ensuring that tokenization reflects scene complexity rather than video
duration. We propose TrajViT, a video encoder that extracts object trajectories
and converts them into semantically meaningful tokens, significantly reducing
redundancy while maintaining temporal coherence. Trained with contrastive
learning, TrajViT significantly outperforms space-time ViT (ViT3D) across
multiple video understanding benchmarks, e.g., TrajViT outperforms ViT3D by a
large margin of 6% top-5 recall in average at video-text retrieval task with
10x token deduction. We also show TrajViT as a stronger model than ViT3D for
being the video encoder for modern VideoLLM, obtaining an average of 5.2%
performance improvement across 6 VideoQA benchmarks while having 4x faster
training time and 18x less inference FLOPs. TrajViT is the first efficient
encoder to consistently outperform ViT3D across diverse video analysis tasks,
making it a robust and scalable solution.

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) has become a promising solution for
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) approach for Vision Transformer (ViT)
models by partially fine-tuning learnable tokens while keeping most model
parameters frozen. Recent research has explored modifying the connection
structures of the prompts. However, the fundamental correlation and
distribution between the prompts and image tokens remain unexplored. In this
paper, we leverage metric learning techniques to investigate how the
distribution of prompts affects fine-tuning performance. Specifically, we
propose a novel framework, Distribution Aware Visual Prompt Tuning (DA-VPT), to
guide the distributions of the prompts by learning the distance metric from
their class-related semantic data. Our method demonstrates that the prompts can
serve as an effective bridge to share semantic information between image
patches and the class token. We extensively evaluated our approach on popular
benchmarks in both recognition and segmentation tasks. The results demonstrate
that our approach enables more effective and efficient fine-tuning of ViT
models by leveraging semantic information to guide the learning of the prompts,

Conclusion: Rhet2Pix有效提升了修辞语言图像生成的语义准确性，代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: Generating images from rhetorical languages remains a critical challenge for
text-to-image models. Even state-of-the-art (SOTA) multimodal large language
models (MLLM) fail to generate images based on the hidden meaning inherent in
rhetorical language--despite such content being readily mappable to visual
representations by humans. A key limitation is that current models emphasize
object-level word embedding alignment, causing metaphorical expressions to
steer image generation towards their literal visuals and overlook the intended
semantic meaning. To address this, we propose Rhet2Pix, a framework that
formulates rhetorical text-to-image generation as a multi-step policy
optimization problem, incorporating a two-layer MDP diffusion module. In the
outer layer, Rhet2Pix converts the input prompt into incrementally elaborated
sub-sentences and executes corresponding image-generation actions, constructing
semantically richer visuals. In the inner layer, Rhet2Pix mitigates reward
sparsity during image generation by discounting the final reward and optimizing
every adjacent action pair along the diffusion denoising trajectory. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Rhet2Pix in rhetorical
text-to-image generation. Our model outperforms SOTA MLLMs such as GPT-4o,
Grok-3 and leading academic baselines across both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations. The code and dataset used in this work are publicly available.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a central role in engineering and
manufacturing, making it possible to create precise and editable 3D models.
Using a variety of sensor or user-provided data as inputs for CAD
reconstruction can democratize access to design applications. However, existing
methods typically focus on a single input modality, such as point clouds,
images, or text, which limits their generalizability and robustness. Leveraging
recent advances in vision-language models (VLM), we propose a multi-modal CAD
reconstruction model that simultaneously processes all three input modalities.
Inspired by large language model (LLM) training paradigms, we adopt a two-stage
pipeline: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on large-scale procedurally generated
data, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning using online
feedback, obtained programatically. Furthermore, we are the first to explore RL
fine-tuning of LLMs for CAD tasks demonstrating that online RL algorithms such
as Group Relative Preference Optimization (GRPO) outperform offline
alternatives. In the DeepCAD benchmark, our SFT model outperforms existing
single-modal approaches in all three input modalities simultaneously. More
importantly, after RL fine-tuning, cadrille sets new state-of-the-art on three
challenging datasets, including a real-world one.

Conclusion: 该方法为多对象视频生成提供了一种高效且无需训练的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based text-to-video (T2V) models have
demonstrated remarkable progress, but these models still face challenges in
generating videos with multiple objects. Most models struggle with accurately
capturing complex object interactions, often treating some objects as static
background elements and limiting their movement. In addition, they often fail
to generate multiple distinct objects as specified in the prompt, resulting in
incorrect generations or mixed features across objects. In this paper, we
present a novel training-free approach for multi-object video generation that
leverages the open world knowledge of diffusion models and large language
models (LLMs). We use an LLM as the ``director'' of object trajectories, and
apply the trajectories through noise re-initialization to achieve precise
control of realistic movements. We further refine the generation process by
manipulating the attention mechanism to better capture object-specific features
and motion patterns, and prevent cross-object feature interference. Extensive
experiments validate the effectiveness of our training free approach in
significantly enhancing the multi-object generation capabilities of existing
video diffusion models, resulting in 42% absolute improvement in motion
dynamics and object generation accuracy, while also maintaining high fidelity
and motion smoothness.

Conclusion: 该方法成功整合了PnP和unrolling的优势，为SPI逆问题提供了高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep-unrolling and plug-and-play (PnP) approaches have become the de-facto
standard solvers for single-pixel imaging (SPI) inverse problem. PnP
approaches, a class of iterative algorithms where regularization is implicitly
performed by an off-the-shelf deep denoiser, are flexible for varying
compression ratios (CRs) but are limited in reconstruction accuracy and speed.
Conversely, unrolling approaches, a class of multi-stage neural networks where
a truncated iterative optimization process is transformed into an end-to-end
trainable network, typically achieve better accuracy with faster inference but
require fine-tuning or even retraining when CR changes. In this paper, we
address the challenge of integrating the strengths of both classes of solvers.
To this end, we design an efficient deep image restorer (DIR) for the unrolling
of HQS (half quadratic splitting) and ADMM (alternating direction method of
multipliers). More importantly, a general proximal trajectory (PT) loss
function is proposed to train HQS/ADMM-unrolling networks such that learned DIR
approximates the proximal operator of an ideal explicit restoration
regularizer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, the resulting proximal
unrolling networks can not only flexibly handle varying CRs with a single model
like PnP algorithms, but also outperform previous CR-specific unrolling
networks in both reconstruction accuracy and speed. Source codes and models are

Conclusion: LADA提供了一种高效且性能优越的持续学习解决方案。

Abstract: Continual learning with vision-language models like CLIP offers a pathway
toward scalable machine learning systems by leveraging its transferable
representations. Existing CLIP-based methods adapt the pre-trained image
encoder by adding multiple sets of learnable parameters, with each task using a
partial set of parameters. This requires selecting the expected parameters for
input images during inference, which is prone to error that degrades
performance. To address this problem, we introduce LADA (Label-specific
ADApter). Instead of partitioning parameters across tasks, LADA appends
lightweight, label-specific memory units to the frozen CLIP image encoder,
enabling discriminative feature generation by aggregating task-agnostic
knowledge. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, LADA employs feature
distillation for seen classes, preventing their features from being interfered
with by new classes. Positioned after the image encoder, LADA prevents gradient
flow to the frozen CLIP parameters, ensuring efficient training. Extensive
results show that LADA achieves state-of-the-art performance in continual
learning settings. The implementation code is available at

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have shown unprecedented generative
capability, but their ability to produce undesirable concepts
(e.g.~pornographic content, sensitive identities, copyrighted styles) poses
serious concerns for privacy, fairness, and safety. {Concept erasure} aims to
remove or suppress specific concept information in a generative model. In this
paper, we introduce \textbf{TRACE (Trajectory-Constrained Attentional Concept
Erasure)}, a novel method to erase targeted concepts from diffusion models
while preserving overall generative quality. Our approach combines a rigorous
theoretical framework, establishing formal conditions under which a concept can
be provably suppressed in the diffusion process, with an effective fine-tuning
procedure compatible with both conventional latent diffusion (Stable Diffusion)
and emerging rectified flow models (e.g.~FLUX). We first derive a closed-form
update to the model's cross-attention layers that removes hidden
representations of the target concept. We then introduce a trajectory-aware
finetuning objective that steers the denoising process away from the concept
only in the late sampling stages, thus maintaining the model's fidelity on
unrelated content. Empirically, we evaluate TRACE on multiple benchmarks used
in prior concept erasure studies (object classes, celebrity faces, artistic
styles, and explicit content from the I2P dataset). TRACE achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming recent methods such as ANT,
EraseAnything, and MACE in terms of removal efficacy and output quality.

Abstract: Video generative models can be regarded as world simulators due to their
ability to capture dynamic, continuous changes inherent in real-world
environments. These models integrate high-dimensional information across
visual, temporal, spatial, and causal dimensions, enabling predictions of
subjects in various status. A natural and valuable research direction is to
explore whether a fully trained video generative model in high-dimensional
space can effectively support lower-dimensional tasks such as controllable
image generation. In this work, we propose a paradigm for video-to-image
knowledge compression and task adaptation, termed \textit{Dimension-Reduction
Attack} (\texttt{DRA-Ctrl}), which utilizes the strengths of video models,
including long-range context modeling and flatten full-attention, to perform
various generation tasks. Specially, to address the challenging gap between
continuous video frames and discrete image generation, we introduce a
mixup-based transition strategy that ensures smooth adaptation. Moreover, we
redesign the attention structure with a tailored masking mechanism to better
align text prompts with image-level control. Experiments across diverse image
generation tasks, such as subject-driven and spatially conditioned generation,
show that repurposed video models outperform those trained directly on images.
These results highlight the untapped potential of large-scale video generators
for broader visual applications. \texttt{DRA-Ctrl} provides new insights into
reusing resource-intensive video models and lays foundation for future unified
generative models across visual modalities. The project page is

Conclusion: MAC是一种有效的方法，能够通过学习更优的耦合来改进生成任务。

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) is an effective framework for training a model to learn a
vector field that transports samples from a source distribution to a target
distribution. To train the model, early FM methods use random couplings, which
often result in crossing paths and lead the model to learn non-straight
trajectories that require many integration steps to generate high-quality
samples. To address this, recent methods adopt Optimal Transport (OT) to
construct couplings by minimizing geometric distances, which helps reduce path
crossings. However, we observe that such geometry-based couplings do not
necessarily align with the model's preferred trajectories, making it difficult
to learn the vector field induced by these couplings, which prevents the model
from learning straight trajectories. Motivated by this, we propose
Model-Aligned Coupling (MAC), an effective method that matches training
couplings based not only on geometric distance but also on alignment with the
model's preferred transport directions based on its prediction error. To avoid
the time-costly match process, MAC proposes to select the top-$k$ fraction of
couplings with the lowest error for training. Extensive experiments show that
MAC significantly improves generation quality and efficiency in few-step
settings compared to existing methods. Project page:

Motivation: 研究加权风险函数（如focal loss和AURC）与校准误差的关系，以改进模型校准。

Method: 提出正则化AURC方法，使用SoftRank技术实现梯度优化。

Result: AURC-based loss在多数据集和模型架构中表现出竞争性的校准性能。

Conclusion: 优化正则化AURC可提升校准性能，focal loss在追求校准时可能不够理想。

Abstract: Several variants of reweighted risk functionals, such as focal losss, inverse
focal loss, and the Area Under the Risk-Coverage Curve (AURC), have been
proposed in the literature and claims have been made in relation to their
calibration properties. However, focal loss and inverse focal loss propose
vastly different weighting schemes. In this paper, we revisit a broad class of
weighted risk functions commonly used in deep learning and establish a
principled connection between these reweighting schemes and calibration errors.
We show that minimizing calibration error is closely linked to the selective
classification paradigm and demonstrate that optimizing a regularized variant
of the AURC naturally leads to improved calibration. This regularized AURC
shares a similar reweighting strategy with inverse focal loss, lending support
to the idea that focal loss is less principled when calibration is a desired
outcome. Direct AURC optimization offers greater flexibility through the choice
of confidence score functions (CSFs). To enable gradient-based optimization, we
introduce a differentiable formulation of the regularized AURC using the
SoftRank technique. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our AURC-based loss
achieves competitive class-wise calibration performance across a range of
datasets and model architectures.

Motivation: 探索如何将图像扩散过程与自回归模型结合，以实现更高效的视觉合成方法。

Method: 设计图像令牌化器，将图像转换为离散令牌序列，利用扩散特性实现自回归建模，无需修改标准自回归训练/推理策略。

Conclusion: D-AR为视觉合成的统一自回归架构提供了新思路，尤其适用于大语言模型。

Abstract: This paper presents Diffusion via Autoregressive models (D-AR), a new
paradigm recasting the image diffusion process as a vanilla autoregressive
procedure in the standard next-token-prediction fashion. We start by designing
the tokenizer that converts images into sequences of discrete tokens, where
tokens in different positions can be decoded into different diffusion denoising
steps in the pixel space. Thanks to the diffusion properties, these tokens
naturally follow a coarse-to-fine order, which directly lends itself to
autoregressive modeling. Therefore, we apply standard next-token prediction on
these tokens, without modifying any underlying designs (either causal masks or
training/inference strategies), and such sequential autoregressive token
generation directly mirrors the diffusion procedure in image space. That is,
once the autoregressive model generates an increment of tokens, we can directly
decode these tokens into the corresponding diffusion denoising step in the
streaming manner. Our pipeline naturally reveals several intriguing properties,
for example, it supports consistent previews when generating only a subset of
tokens and enables zero-shot layout-controlled synthesis. On the standard
ImageNet benchmark, our method achieves 2.09 FID using a 775M Llama backbone
with 256 discrete tokens. We hope our work can inspire future research on
unified autoregressive architectures of visual synthesis, especially with large
language models. Code and models will be available at

Method: CF-DETR采用粗到细推理、选择性细推理和多级批量推理策略，结合NPFP**调度框架，动态调整补丁粒度和注意力范围。

Conclusion: CF-DETR通过结合Transformer特性和专用调度框架，有效解决了自动驾驶感知系统中的实时性和准确性挑战。

Abstract: Detection Transformers (DETR) are increasingly adopted in autonomous vehicle
(AV) perception systems due to their superior accuracy over convolutional
networks. However, concurrently executing multiple DETR tasks presents
significant challenges in meeting firm real-time deadlines (R1) and high
accuracy requirements (R2), particularly for safety-critical objects, while
navigating the inherent latency-accuracy trade-off under resource constraints.
Existing real-time DNN scheduling approaches often treat models generically,
failing to leverage Transformer-specific properties for efficient resource
allocation. To address these challenges, we propose CF-DETR, an integrated
system featuring a novel coarse-to-fine Transformer architecture and a
dedicated real-time scheduling framework NPFP**. CF-DETR employs three key
strategies (A1: coarse-to-fine inference, A2: selective fine inference, A3:
multi-level batch inference) that exploit Transformer properties to dynamically
adjust patch granularity and attention scope based on object criticality,
aiming to satisfy R2. The NPFP** scheduling framework (A4) orchestrates these
adaptive mechanisms A1-A3. It partitions each DETR task into a safety-critical
coarse subtask for guaranteed critical object detection within its deadline
(ensuring R1), and an optional fine subtask for enhanced overall accuracy (R2),
while managing individual and batched execution. Our extensive evaluations on
server, GPU-enabled embedded platforms, and actual AV platforms demonstrate
that CF-DETR, under an NPFP** policy, successfully meets strict timing
guarantees for critical operations and achieves significantly higher overall
and critical object detection accuracy compared to existing baselines across
diverse AV workloads.

Conclusion: ZeroSep展示了预训练扩散模型在判别性任务中的潜力，支持开放集场景。

Abstract: Audio source separation is fundamental for machines to understand complex
acoustic environments and underpins numerous audio applications. Current
supervised deep learning approaches, while powerful, are limited by the need
for extensive, task-specific labeled data and struggle to generalize to the
immense variability and open-set nature of real-world acoustic scenes. Inspired
by the success of generative foundation models, we investigate whether
pre-trained text-guided audio diffusion models can overcome these limitations.
We make a surprising discovery: zero-shot source separation can be achieved
purely through a pre-trained text-guided audio diffusion model under the right
configuration. Our method, named ZeroSep, works by inverting the mixed audio
into the diffusion model's latent space and then using text conditioning to
guide the denoising process to recover individual sources. Without any
task-specific training or fine-tuning, ZeroSep repurposes the generative
diffusion model for a discriminative separation task and inherently supports
open-set scenarios through its rich textual priors. ZeroSep is compatible with
a variety of pre-trained text-guided audio diffusion backbones and delivers
strong separation performance on multiple separation benchmarks, surpassing
even supervised methods.

models and adopts a strategy that focuses on training only the Bridging Gate.
This method significantly reduces resource demands and training time while

Abstract: MLLMs have been widely studied for video question answering recently.
However, most existing assessments focus on natural videos, overlooking
synthetic videos, such as AI-generated content (AIGC). Meanwhile, some works in
video generation rely on MLLMs to evaluate the quality of generated videos, but
the capabilities of MLLMs on interpreting AIGC videos remain largely
underexplored. To address this, we propose a new benchmark, VF-Eval, which
introduces four tasks-coherence validation, error awareness, error type
detection, and reasoning evaluation-to comprehensively evaluate the abilities
of MLLMs on AIGC videos. We evaluate 13 frontier MLLMs on VF-Eval and find that
even the best-performing model, GPT-4.1, struggles to achieve consistently good
performance across all tasks. This highlights the challenging nature of our
benchmark. Additionally, to investigate the practical applications of VF-Eval
in improving video generation, we conduct an experiment, RePrompt,
demonstrating that aligning MLLMs more closely with human feedback can benefit
video generation.

humans score 97%. These results underscore the challenging nature of MMSI-Bench

seconds. HiDream-I1 is constructed with a new sparse Diffusion Transformer
(DiT) structure. Specifically, it starts with a dual-stream decoupled design of
sparse DiT with dynamic Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, in which two
separate encoders are first involved to independently process image and text
tokens. Then, a single-stream sparse DiT structure with dynamic MoE
architecture is adopted to trigger multi-model interaction for image generation
in a cost-efficient manner. To support flexiable accessibility with varied
model capabilities, we provide HiDream-I1 in three variants: HiDream-I1-Full,
HiDream-I1-Dev, and HiDream-I1-Fast.
  Furthermore, we go beyond the typical text-to-image generation and remould
HiDream-I1 with additional image conditions to perform precise,
instruction-based editing on given images, yielding a new instruction-based
image editing model namely HiDream-E1. Ultimately, by integrating text-to-image
generation and instruction-based image editing, HiDream-I1 evolves to form a
comprehensive image agent (HiDream-A1) capable of fully interactive image
creation and refinement. To accelerate multi-modal AIGC research, we have

Abstract: Visual texts embedded in videos carry rich semantic information, which is
crucial for both holistic video understanding and fine-grained reasoning about
local human actions. However, existing video understanding benchmarks largely
overlook textual information, while OCR-specific benchmarks are constrained to
static images, limiting their ability to capture the interaction between text
and dynamic visual contexts. To address this gap, we propose VidText, a new
benchmark designed for comprehensive and in-depth evaluation of video text
understanding. VidText offers the following key features: 1) It covers a wide
range of real-world scenarios and supports multilingual content, encompassing
diverse settings where video text naturally appears. 2) It introduces a
hierarchical evaluation framework with video-level, clip-level, and
instance-level tasks, enabling assessment of both global summarization and
local retrieval capabilities. 3) The benchmark also introduces a set of paired
perception reasoning tasks, ranging from visual text perception to cross-modal
reasoning between textual and visual information. Extensive experiments on 18
state-of-the-art Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) reveal that current models
struggle across most tasks, with significant room for improvement. Further
analysis highlights the impact of both model-intrinsic factors, such as input
resolution and OCR capability, and external factors, including the use of
auxiliary information and Chain-of-Thought reasoning strategies. We hope
VidText will fill the current gap in video understanding benchmarks and serve
as a foundation for future research on multimodal reasoning with video text in

Conclusion: VIMTS通过结合视觉MAE和自监督学习，显著提升了IMTS预测的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Irregular Multivariate Time Series (IMTS) forecasting is challenging due to
the unaligned nature of multi-channel signals and the prevalence of extensive
missing data. Existing methods struggle to capture reliable temporal patterns
from such data due to significant missing values. While pre-trained foundation
models show potential for addressing these challenges, they are typically
designed for Regularly Sampled Time Series (RTS). Motivated by the visual Mask
AutoEncoder's (MAE) powerful capability for modeling sparse multi-channel
information and its success in RTS forecasting, we propose VIMTS, a framework
adapting Visual MAE for IMTS forecasting. To mitigate the effect of missing
values, VIMTS first processes IMTS along the timeline into feature patches at
equal intervals. These patches are then complemented using learned
cross-channel dependencies. Then it leverages visual MAE's capability in
handling sparse multichannel data for patch reconstruction, followed by a
coarse-to-fine technique to generate precise predictions from focused contexts.
In addition, we integrate self-supervised learning for improved IMTS modeling
by adapting the visual MAE to IMTS data. Extensive experiments demonstrate
VIMTS's superior performance and few-shot capability, advancing the application
of visual foundation models in more general time series tasks. Our code is

significant challenges, as it is often infeasible to obtain comprehensive
annotations for all potential objects, spanning from coarse structures (e.g.,
regions and unit objects) to fine structures (e.g., cells). This results in
temporally and partially annotated data, posing a major challenge in developing
a holistic segmentation framework. Moreover, an ideal segmentation model should
incorporate new phenotypes, unseen diseases, and diverse populations, making
this task even more complex. In this paper, we introduce a novel and unified
Incremental Relationship-guided Segmentation (IRS) learning scheme to address
temporally acquired, partially annotated data while maintaining
out-of-distribution (OOD) continual learning capacity in digital pathology. The
key innovation of IRS lies in its ability to realize a new spatial-temporal OOD
continual learning paradigm by mathematically modeling anatomical relationships
between existing and newly introduced classes through a simple incremental
universal proposition matrix. Experimental results demonstrate that the IRS
method effectively handles the multi-scale nature of pathological segmentation,
enabling precise kidney segmentation across various structures (regions, units,
and cells) as well as OOD disease lesions at multiple magnifications. This
capability significantly enhances domain generalization, making IRS a robust
approach for real-world digital pathology applications.

Conclusion: 提出了开放世界识别的分类法，明确了自我中心活动理解所需的挑战和方法进展。

Abstract: Open-world egocentric activity recognition poses a fundamental challenge due
to its unconstrained nature, requiring models to infer unseen activities from
an expansive, partially observed search space. We introduce ProbRes, a
Probabilistic Residual search framework based on jump-diffusion that
efficiently navigates this space by balancing prior-guided exploration with
likelihood-driven exploitation. Our approach integrates structured commonsense
priors to construct a semantically coherent search space, adaptively refines
predictions using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and employs a stochastic search
mechanism to locate high-likelihood activity labels while minimizing exhaustive
enumeration efficiently. We systematically evaluate ProbRes across multiple
openness levels (L0--L3), demonstrating its adaptability to increasing search
space complexity. In addition to achieving state-of-the-art performance on
benchmark datasets (GTEA Gaze, GTEA Gaze+, EPIC-Kitchens, and Charades-Ego), we
establish a clear taxonomy for open-world recognition, delineating the
challenges and methodological advancements necessary for egocentric activity
understanding.

Result: CFP-Gen能够高通量生成功能与天然蛋白质相当的新型蛋白质，并在设计多功能蛋白质时具有高成功率。

Conclusion: CFP-Gen为蛋白质设计提供了一种高效的多模态约束整合方法。

Abstract: Existing PLMs generate protein sequences based on a single-condition
constraint from a specific modality, struggling to simultaneously satisfy
multiple constraints across different modalities. In this work, we introduce
CFP-Gen, a novel diffusion language model for Combinatorial Functional Protein
GENeration. CFP-Gen facilitates the de novo protein design by integrating
multimodal conditions with functional, sequence, and structural constraints.
Specifically, an Annotation-Guided Feature Modulation (AGFM) module is
introduced to dynamically adjust the protein feature distribution based on
composable functional annotations, e.g., GO terms, IPR domains and EC numbers.
Meanwhile, the Residue-Controlled Functional Encoding (RCFE) module captures
residue-wise interaction to ensure more precise control. Additionally,
off-the-shelf 3D structure encoders can be seamlessly integrated to impose
geometric constraints. We demonstrate that CFP-Gen enables high-throughput
generation of novel proteins with functionality comparable to natural proteins,
while achieving a high success rate in designing multifunctional proteins. Code

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SHTC的端到端优化变换编码框架，用于3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）压缩，通过联合优化3DGS、变换和轻量级上下文模型，显著提升了率失真性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS因其快速高质量的渲染而流行，但内存占用大，现有压缩方法未采用端到端优化的分析-合成变换，导致性能不佳。

Method: SHTC框架包括使用KLT进行数据去相关的基础层和稀疏编码的增强层，通过联合优化实现高效压缩。

Result: SHTC显著提升了率失真性能，同时参数和计算开销最小。

Conclusion: SHTC为3DGS压缩提供了一种高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained popularity for its fast and
high-quality rendering, but it has a very large memory footprint incurring high
transmission and storage overhead. Recently, some neural compression methods,
such as Scaffold-GS, were proposed for 3DGS but they did not adopt the approach
of end-to-end optimized analysis-synthesis transforms which has been proven
highly effective in neural signal compression. Without an appropriate analysis
transform, signal correlations cannot be removed by sparse representation.
Without such transforms the only way to remove signal redundancies is through
entropy coding driven by a complex and expensive context modeling, which
results in slower speed and suboptimal rate-distortion (R-D) performance. To
overcome this weakness, we propose Sparsity-guided Hierarchical Transform
Coding (SHTC), the first end-to-end optimized transform coding framework for
3DGS compression. SHTC jointly optimizes the 3DGS, transforms and a lightweight
context model. This joint optimization enables the transform to produce
representations that approach the best R-D performance possible. The SHTC
framework consists of a base layer using KLT for data decorrelation, and a
sparsity-coded enhancement layer that compresses the KLT residuals to refine
the representation. The enhancement encoder learns a linear transform to
project high-dimensional inputs into a low-dimensional space, while the decoder
unfolds the Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) to reconstruct
the residuals. All components are designed to be interpretable, allowing the
incorporation of signal priors and fewer parameters than black-box transforms.
This novel design significantly improves R-D performance with minimal
additional parameters and computational overhead.

Specifically, we implement a simplified class-conditional denoising diffusion

Abstract: The ability to simulate the world in a spatially consistent manner is a
crucial requirements for effective world models. Such a model enables
high-quality visual generation, and also ensures the reliability of world
models for downstream tasks such as simulation and planning. Designing a memory
module is a crucial component for addressing spatial consistency: such a model
must not only retain long-horizon observational information, but also enables
the construction of explicit or implicit internal spatial representations.
However, there are no dataset designed to promote the development of memory
modules by explicitly enforcing spatial consistency constraints. Furthermore,
most existing benchmarks primarily emphasize visual coherence or generation
quality, neglecting the requirement of long-range spatial consistency. To
bridge this gap, we construct a dataset and corresponding benchmark by sampling
150 distinct locations within the open-world environment of Minecraft,
collecting about 250 hours (20 million frames) of loop-based navigation videos
with actions. Our dataset follows a curriculum design of sequence lengths,
allowing models to learn spatial consistency on increasingly complex navigation
trajectories. Furthermore, our data collection pipeline is easily extensible to
new Minecraft environments and modules. Four representative world model
baselines are evaluated on our benchmark. Dataset, benchmark, and code are
open-sourced to support future research.

Conclusion: LHFGLP为隐私保护细粒度分类提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) has achieved
impressive recognition accuracy, despite minimal inter-class variations.
However, existing methods heavily rely on instance-level labels, making them
impractical in privacy-sensitive scenarios such as medical image analysis. This
paper aims to enable accurate fine-grained recognition without direct access to
instance labels. To achieve this, we leverage the Learning from Label
Proportions (LLP) paradigm, which requires only bag-level labels for efficient
training. Unlike existing LLP-based methods, our framework explicitly exploits
the hierarchical nature of fine-grained datasets, enabling progressive feature
granularity refinement and improving classification accuracy. We propose
Learning from Hierarchical Fine-Grained Label Proportions (LHFGLP), a framework
that incorporates Unrolled Hierarchical Fine-Grained Sparse Dictionary
Learning, transforming handcrafted iterative approximation into learnable
network optimization. Additionally, our proposed Hierarchical Proportion Loss
provides hierarchical supervision, further enhancing classification
performance. Experiments on three widely-used fine-grained datasets, structured
in a bag-based manner, demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms
existing LLP-based methods. We will release our code and datasets to foster
further research in privacy-preserving fine-grained classification.

Abstract: Deep models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision
transformer (ViT), demonstrate remarkable performance in image classification.
However, those deep models require large data to fine-tune, which is
impractical in the medical domain due to the data privacy issue. Furthermore,
despite the feasible performance of contrastive language image pre-training
(CLIP) in the natural domain, the potential of CLIP has not been fully
investigated in the medical field. To face these challenges, we considered
three scenarios: 1) we introduce a novel CLIP variant using four CNNs and eight
ViTs as image encoders for the classification of brain cancer and skin cancer,
2) we combine 12 deep models with two federated learning techniques to protect
data privacy, and 3) we involve traditional machine learning (ML) methods to
improve the generalization ability of those deep models in unseen domain data.
The experimental results indicate that maxvit shows the highest averaged (AVG)

while convnext\_l demonstrates remarkable test with an F1-score of 83.98\%

Abstract: Recent advancements in unified vision-language models (VLMs), which integrate
both visual understanding and generation capabilities, have attracted
significant attention. The underlying hypothesis is that a unified architecture
with mixed training on both understanding and generation tasks can enable
mutual enhancement between understanding and generation. However, this
hypothesis remains underexplored in prior works on unified VLMs. To address
this gap, this paper systematically investigates the generalization across
understanding and generation tasks in unified VLMs. Specifically, we design a
dataset closely aligned with real-world scenarios to facilitate extensive
experiments and quantitative evaluations. We evaluate multiple unified VLM
architectures to validate our findings. Our key findings are as follows. First,
unified VLMs trained with mixed data exhibit mutual benefits in understanding
and generation tasks across various architectures, and this mutual benefits can
scale up with increased data. Second, better alignment between multimodal input
and output spaces will lead to better generalization. Third, the knowledge
acquired during generation tasks can transfer to understanding tasks, and this
cross-task generalization occurs within the base language model, beyond
modality adapters. Our findings underscore the critical necessity of unifying
understanding and generation in VLMs, offering valuable insights for the design
and optimization of unified VLMs.

Conclusion: 该研究填补了多源组合泛化领域的空白，为VQA模型提供了新的训练方法。

Abstract: Compositional generalization is the ability of generalizing novel
compositions from seen primitives, and has received much attention in
vision-and-language (V\&L) recently. Due to the multi-modal nature of V\&L
tasks, the primitives composing compositions source from different modalities,
resulting in multi-sourced novel compositions. However, the generalization
ability over multi-sourced novel compositions, \textit{i.e.}, multi-sourced
compositional generalization (MSCG) remains unexplored. In this paper, we
explore MSCG in the context of visual question answering (VQA), and propose a
retrieval-augmented training framework to enhance the MSCG ability of VQA
models by learning unified representations for primitives from different
modalities. Specifically, semantically equivalent primitives are retrieved for
each primitive in the training samples, and the retrieved features are
aggregated with the original primitive to refine the model. This process helps
the model learn consistent representations for the same semantic primitives
across different modalities. To evaluate the MSCG ability of VQA models, we
construct a new GQA-MSCG dataset based on the GQA dataset, in which samples
include three types of novel compositions composed of primitives from different
modalities. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework. We release GQA-MSCG at https://github.com/NeverMoreLCH/MSCG.

Abstract: Existing low-light image enhancement (LLIE) and joint LLIE and deblurring
(LLIE-deblur) models have made strides in addressing predefined degradations,
yet they are often constrained by dynamically coupled degradations. To address
these challenges, we introduce a Unified Receptance Weighted Key Value (URWKV)
model with multi-state perspective, enabling flexible and effective degradation
restoration for low-light images. Specifically, we customize the core URWKV
block to perceive and analyze complex degradations by leveraging multiple
intra- and inter-stage states. First, inspired by the pupil mechanism in the
human visual system, we propose Luminance-adaptive Normalization (LAN) that
adjusts normalization parameters based on rich inter-stage states, allowing for
adaptive, scene-aware luminance modulation. Second, we aggregate multiple
intra-stage states through exponential moving average approach, effectively
capturing subtle variations while mitigating information loss inherent in the
single-state mechanism. To reduce the degradation effects commonly associated
with conventional skip connections, we propose the State-aware Selective Fusion
(SSF) module, which dynamically aligns and integrates multi-state features
across encoder stages, selectively fusing contextual information. In comparison
to state-of-the-art models, our URWKV model achieves superior performance on
various benchmarks, while requiring significantly fewer parameters and
computational resources.

Abstract: While recent advancements in Image Super-Resolution (SR) using diffusion
models have shown promise in improving overall image quality, their application
to scene text images has revealed limitations. These models often struggle with
accurate text region localization and fail to effectively model image and
multilingual character-to-shape priors. This leads to inconsistencies, the
generation of hallucinated textures, and a decrease in the perceived quality of
the super-resolved text.
  To address these issues, we introduce TextSR, a multimodal diffusion model
specifically designed for Multilingual Scene Text Image Super-Resolution.
TextSR leverages a text detector to pinpoint text regions within an image and
then employs Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract multilingual text
from these areas. The extracted text characters are then transformed into
visual shapes using a UTF-8 based text encoder and cross-attention. Recognizing
that OCR may sometimes produce inaccurate results in real-world scenarios, we
have developed two innovative methods to enhance the robustness of our model.
By integrating text character priors with the low-resolution text images, our
model effectively guides the super-resolution process, enhancing fine details
within the text and improving overall legibility. The superior performance of
our model on both the TextZoom and TextVQA datasets sets a new benchmark for
STISR, underscoring the efficacy of our approach.

Conclusion: MMGT通过两阶段设计，显著提升了语音手势视频的生成质量，尤其在细节和大动作捕捉方面表现优异。

Abstract: Co-Speech Gesture Video Generation aims to generate vivid speech videos from
audio-driven still images, which is challenging due to the diversity of
different parts of the body in terms of amplitude of motion, audio relevance,
and detailed features. Relying solely on audio as the control signal often
fails to capture large gesture movements in video, leading to more pronounced
artifacts and distortions. Existing approaches typically address this issue by
introducing additional a priori information, but this can limit the practical
application of the task. Specifically, we propose a Motion Mask-Guided
Two-Stage Network (MMGT) that uses audio, as well as motion masks and motion
features generated from the audio signal to jointly drive the generation of
synchronized speech gesture videos. In the first stage, the Spatial Mask-Guided
Audio Pose Generation (SMGA) Network generates high-quality pose videos and
motion masks from audio, effectively capturing large movements in key regions
such as the face and gestures. In the second stage, we integrate the Motion
Masked Hierarchical Audio Attention (MM-HAA) into the Stabilized Diffusion
Video Generation model, overcoming limitations in fine-grained motion
generation and region-specific detail control found in traditional methods.
This guarantees high-quality, detailed upper-body video generation with
accurate texture and motion details. Evaluations show improved video quality,
lip-sync, and gesture. The model and code are available at

named {Zero-to-Hero}, which focuses on reference-based video editing that
disentangles the editing process into two distinct problems. It achieves this

leverage correspondence within the original frames to guide the attention
mechanism, which is more robust than previously proposed optical flow or
temporal modules in memory-friendly video generative models, especially when
dealing with objects exhibiting large motions. It offers a solid ZERO-shot
initialization that ensures both accuracy and temporal consistency. However,
intervention in the attention mechanism results in compounded imaging
degradation with over-saturated colors and unknown blurring issues. Starting
from Zero-Stage, our Hero-Stage Holistically learns a conditional generative
model for vidEo RestOration. To accurately evaluate the consistency of the
appearance, we construct a set of videos with multiple appearances using
Blender, enabling a fine-grained and deterministic evaluation. Our method
outperforms the best-performing baseline with a PSNR improvement of 2.6 dB. The

TL;DR: 论文提出了CXRTrek数据集和CXRTrekNet模型，用于模拟放射科医生的多阶段诊断推理过程，解决了现有医学AI模型缺乏上下文推理的问题。


<details>

Motivation: 现有医学AI模型通常采用简单的输入-输出范式，忽略了诊断推理的序列性，导致与临床场景不匹配、推理缺乏上下文等问题。

Method: 构建了CXRTrek数据集，包含8个诊断阶段的428,966个样本和1100万个Q&A对；提出了CXRTrekNet模型，将临床推理流程融入视觉语言大模型框架。

Result: CXRTrekNet在CXRTrek基准测试中优于现有医学VLLM，并在多个外部数据集上表现出卓越的泛化能力。

Conclusion: CXRTrek数据集和模型填补了医学AI中多阶段推理的空白，提升了模型的临床适用性和性能。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-based chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation
assistants have demonstrated significant progress and are increasingly being
applied in clinical settings. However, contemporary medical AI models often
adhere to a simplistic input-to-output paradigm, directly processing an image
and an instruction to generate a result, where the instructions may be integral
to the model's architecture. This approach overlooks the modeling of the
inherent diagnostic reasoning in chest X-ray interpretation. Such reasoning is
typically sequential, where each interpretive stage considers the images, the
current task, and the contextual information from previous stages. This
oversight leads to several shortcomings, including misalignment with clinical
scenarios, contextless reasoning, and untraceable errors. To fill this gap, we
construct CXRTrek, a new multi-stage visual question answering (VQA) dataset
for CXR interpretation. The dataset is designed to explicitly simulate the
diagnostic reasoning process employed by radiologists in real-world clinical
settings for the first time. CXRTrek covers 8 sequential diagnostic stages,
comprising 428,966 samples and over 11 million question-answer (Q&A) pairs,
with an average of 26.29 Q&A pairs per sample. Building on the CXRTrek dataset,
we propose a new vision-language large model (VLLM), CXRTrekNet, specifically
designed to incorporate the clinical reasoning flow into the VLLM framework.
CXRTrekNet effectively models the dependencies between diagnostic stages and
captures reasoning patterns within the radiological context. Trained on our
dataset, the model consistently outperforms existing medical VLLMs on the
CXRTrek benchmarks and demonstrates superior generalization across multiple
tasks on five diverse external datasets. The dataset and model can be found in
our repository (https://github.com/guanjinquan/CXRTrek).

Motivation: 解决现有基于流的图像编辑方法因缺乏精确潜在反转导致的编辑轨迹不稳定和源一致性差的问题。

Result: 实验表明FlowAlign在源保留和编辑可控性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FlowAlign通过可逆和一致的变换，提升了基于流的图像编辑效果。

Abstract: Recent inversion-free, flow-based image editing methods such as FlowEdit
leverages a pre-trained noise-to-image flow model such as Stable Diffusion 3,
enabling text-driven manipulation by solving an ordinary differential equation
(ODE). While the lack of exact latent inversion is a core advantage of these
methods, it often results in unstable editing trajectories and poor source
consistency. To address this limitation, we propose FlowAlign, a novel
inversion-free flow-based framework for consistent image editing with
principled trajectory control. FlowAlign introduces a flow-matching loss as a
regularization mechanism to promote smoother and more stable trajectories
during the editing process. Notably, the flow-matching loss is shown to
explicitly balance semantic alignment with the edit prompt and structural
consistency with the source image along the trajectory. Furthermore, FlowAlign
naturally supports reverse editing by simply reversing the ODE trajectory,
highlighting the reversible and consistent nature of the transformation.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlowAlign outperforms existing methods
in both source preservation and editing controllability.

Abstract: Audio-visual event parsing plays a crucial role in understanding multimodal
video content, but existing methods typically rely on offline processing of
entire videos with huge model sizes, limiting their real-time applicability. We
introduce Online Audio-Visual Event Parsing (On-AVEP), a novel paradigm for
parsing audio, visual, and audio-visual events by sequentially analyzing
incoming video streams. The On-AVEP task necessitates models with two key
capabilities: (1) Accurate online inference, to effectively distinguish events
with unclear and limited context in online settings, and (2) Real-time
efficiency, to balance high performance with computational constraints. To
cultivate these, we propose the Predictive Future Modeling (PreFM) framework
featured by (a) predictive multimodal future modeling to infer and integrate
beneficial future audio-visual cues, thereby enhancing contextual understanding
and (b) modality-agnostic robust representation along with focal temporal
prioritization to improve precision and generalization. Extensive experiments
on the UnAV-100 and LLP datasets show PreFM significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by a large margin with significantly fewer parameters,
offering an insightful approach for real-time multimodal video understanding.

Abstract: Imitation Learning has become a fundamental approach in robotic manipulation.
However, collecting large-scale real-world robot demonstrations is
prohibitively expensive. Simulators offer a cost-effective alternative, but the
sim-to-real gap make it extremely challenging to scale. Therefore, we introduce
RoboTransfer, a diffusion-based video generation framework for robotic data
synthesis. Unlike previous methods, RoboTransfer integrates multi-view geometry
with explicit control over scene components, such as background and object
attributes. By incorporating cross-view feature interactions and global
depth/normal conditions, RoboTransfer ensures geometry consistency across
views. This framework allows fine-grained control, including background edits
and object swaps. Experiments demonstrate that RoboTransfer is capable of
generating multi-view videos with enhanced geometric consistency and visual
fidelity. In addition, policies trained on the data generated by RoboTransfer
achieve a 33.3% relative improvement in the success rate in the DIFF-OBJ
setting and a substantial 251% relative improvement in the more challenging
DIFF-ALL scenario. Explore more demos on our project page:

Abstract: Video consumption is a key part of daily life, but watching entire videos can
be tedious. To address this, researchers have explored video summarization and
highlight detection to identify key video segments. While some works combine
video frames and transcripts, and others tackle video summarization and
highlight detection using Reinforcement Learning (RL), no existing work, to the
best of our knowledge, integrates both modalities within an RL framework. In
this paper, we propose a multimodal pipeline that leverages video frames and
their corresponding transcripts to generate a more condensed version of the
video and detect highlights using a modality fusion mechanism. The pipeline is
trained within an RL framework, which rewards the model for generating diverse
and representative summaries while ensuring the inclusion of video segments
with meaningful transcript content. The unsupervised nature of the training
allows for learning from large-scale unannotated datasets, overcoming the
challenge posed by the limited size of existing annotated datasets. Our
experiments show that using the transcript in video summarization and highlight
detection achieves superior results compared to relying solely on the visual
content of the video.

Abstract: With the advancement of generative AI, research on its application to 3D
model generation has gained traction, particularly in automating the creation
of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) files from images. GenCAD is a notable model in
this domain, leveraging an autoregressive transformer-based architecture with a
contrastive learning framework to generate CAD programs.
  However, a major limitation of GenCAD is its inability to consistently
produce feasible boundary representations (B-reps), with approximately 10% of
generated designs being infeasible. To address this, we propose
GenCAD-Self-Repairing, a framework that enhances the feasibility of generative
CAD models through diffusion guidance and a self-repairing pipeline. This
framework integrates a guided diffusion denoising process in the latent space
and a regression-based correction mechanism to refine infeasible CAD command
sequences while preserving geometric accuracy. Our approach successfully
converted two-thirds of infeasible designs in the baseline method into feasible
ones, significantly improving the feasibility rate while simultaneously
maintaining a reasonable level of geometric accuracy between the point clouds
of ground truth models and generated models.
  By significantly improving the feasibility rate of generating CAD models, our
approach helps expand the availability of high-quality training data and
enhances the applicability of AI-driven CAD generation in manufacturing,
architecture, and product design.

Conclusion: FUSS是首个实现无监督语义分割联邦学习的框架，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This work explores the application of Federated Learning (FL) in Unsupervised
Semantic image Segmentation (USS). Recent USS methods extract pixel-level
features using frozen visual foundation models and refine them through
self-supervised objectives that encourage semantic grouping. These features are
then grouped to semantic clusters to produce segmentation masks. Extending
these ideas to federated settings requires feature representation and cluster
centroid alignment across distributed clients -- an inherently difficult task
under heterogeneous data distributions in the absence of supervision. To
address this, we propose FUSS Federated Unsupervised image Semantic
Segmentation) which is, to our knowledge, the first framework to enable fully
decentralized, label-free semantic segmentation training. FUSS introduces novel
federation strategies that promote global consistency in feature and prototype
space, jointly optimizing local segmentation heads and shared semantic
centroids. Experiments on both benchmark and real-world datasets, including
binary and multi-class segmentation tasks, show that FUSS consistently
outperforms local-only client trainings as well as extensions of classical FL
algorithms under varying client data distributions. To support reproducibility,
full code will be released upon manuscript acceptance.

Conclusion: DSAGL通过双流设计和注意力机制有效解决了弱监督学习中的关键问题，为医学图像分类提供了新思路。

Abstract: Whole-slide images (WSIs) are critical for cancer diagnosis due to their
ultra-high resolution and rich semantic content. However, their massive size
and the limited availability of fine-grained annotations pose substantial
challenges for conventional supervised learning. We propose DSAGL (Dual-Stream
Attention-Guided Learning), a novel weakly supervised classification framework
that combines a teacher-student architecture with a dual-stream design. DSAGL
explicitly addresses instance-level ambiguity and bag-level semantic
consistency by generating multi-scale attention-based pseudo labels and guiding
instance-level learning. A shared lightweight encoder (VSSMamba) enables
efficient long-range dependency modeling, while a fusion-attentive module
(FASA) enhances focus on sparse but diagnostically relevant regions. We further
introduce a hybrid loss to enforce mutual consistency between the two streams.
Experiments on CIFAR-10, NCT-CRC, and TCGA-Lung datasets demonstrate that DSAGL
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MIL baselines, achieving superior
discriminative performance and robustness under weak supervision.

Method: 利用分类器自由引导（CFG）过程中样本分布高密度区域与ASD的强相关性，提出CFG-Rejection方法，在去噪早期阶段过滤低质量样本。

Result: 实验证明CFG-Rejection在图像生成中显著提升了人类偏好分数（HPSv2, PickScore）和基准测试（GenEval, DPG-Bench）表现。

Conclusion: CFG-Rejection是一种高效、即插即用的方法，适用于多种生成模态，有望推动高质量样本生成的效率与可靠性。

Abstract: Diffusion models often exhibit inconsistent sample quality due to stochastic
variations inherent in their sampling trajectories. Although training-based
fine-tuning (e.g. DDPO [1]) and inference-time alignment techniques[2] aim to
improve sample fidelity, they typically necessitate full denoising processes
and external reward signals. This incurs substantial computational costs,
hindering their broader applicability. In this work, we unveil an intriguing
phenomenon: a previously unobserved yet exploitable link between sample quality
and characteristics of the denoising trajectory during classifier-free guidance
(CFG). Specifically, we identify a strong correlation between high-density
regions of the sample distribution and the Accumulated Score Differences
(ASD)--the cumulative divergence between conditional and unconditional scores.
Leveraging this insight, we introduce CFG-Rejection, an efficient,
plug-and-play strategy that filters low-quality samples at an early stage of
the denoising process, crucially without requiring external reward signals or
model retraining. Importantly, our approach necessitates no modifications to
model architectures or sampling schedules and maintains full compatibility with
existing diffusion frameworks. We validate the effectiveness of CFG-Rejection
in image generation through extensive experiments, demonstrating marked
improvements on human preference scores (HPSv2, PickScore) and challenging
benchmarks (GenEval, DPG-Bench). We anticipate that CFG-Rejection will offer
significant advantages for diverse generative modalities beyond images, paving
the way for more efficient and reliable high-quality sample generation.

Abstract: Multimodal information processing has become increasingly important for

incorporates a regularized integrated fusion module that improves intra-modal
feature representation through modality-specific regularization strategies,
while facilitating precise semantic alignment via a hybrid attention mechanism.
Additionally, we introduce a multimodal decision classification module, which
jointly exploits inter-modal correlations and unimodal discriminative features
by integrating multiple loss functions within a weighted voting paradigm.
Extensive experiments and ablation studies on benchmark datasets demonstrate
that the proposed MCFNet framework achieves consistent improvements in
classification accuracy, confirming its effectiveness in modeling subtle

Abstract: Not Safe/Suitable for Work (NSFW) content is rampant on social networks and
poses serious harm to citizens, especially minors. Current detection methods
mainly rely on deep learning-based image recognition and classification.
However, NSFW images are now presented in increasingly sophisticated ways,
often using image details and complex semantics to obscure their true nature or
attract more views. Although still understandable to humans, these images often
evade existing detection methods, posing a significant threat. Further
complicating the issue, varying regulations across platforms and regions create
additional challenges for effective moderation, leading to detection bias and
reduced accuracy. To address this, we propose VModA, a general and effective
framework that adapts to diverse moderation rules and handles complex,
semantically rich NSFW content across categories. Experimental results show
that VModA significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving up to a 54.3%
accuracy improvement across NSFW types, including those with complex semantics.
Further experiments demonstrate that our method exhibits strong adaptability
across categories, scenarios, and base VLMs. We also identified inconsistent
and controversial label samples in public NSFW benchmark datasets, re-annotated
them, and submitted corrections to the original maintainers. Two datasets have
confirmed the updates so far. Additionally, we evaluate VModA in real-world

Conclusion: UrbanCraft通过分层语义几何表示和HSG-VSD技术，显著提升了EVS问题的性能。

Abstract: Existing neural rendering-based urban scene reconstruction methods mainly
focus on the Interpolated View Synthesis (IVS) setting that synthesizes from
views close to training camera trajectory. However, IVS can not guarantee the
on-par performance of the novel view outside the training camera distribution
(\textit{e.g.}, looking left, right, or downwards), which limits the
generalizability of the urban reconstruction application. Previous methods have
optimized it via image diffusion, but they fail to handle text-ambiguous or
large unseen view angles due to coarse-grained control of text-only diffusion.
In this paper, we design UrbanCraft, which surmounts the Extrapolated View
Synthesis (EVS) problem using hierarchical sem-geometric representations
serving as additional priors. Specifically, we leverage the partially
observable scene to reconstruct coarse semantic and geometric primitives,
establishing a coarse scene-level prior through an occupancy grid as the base
representation. Additionally, we incorporate fine instance-level priors from 3D
bounding boxes to enhance object-level details and spatial relationships.
Building on this, we propose the \textbf{H}ierarchical
\textbf{S}emantic-Geometric-\textbf{G}uided Variational Score Distillation
(HSG-VSD), which integrates semantic and geometric constraints from pretrained
UrbanCraft2D into the score distillation sampling process, forcing the
distribution to be consistent with the observable scene. Qualitative and
quantitative comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on EVS
problem.

Conclusion: RcSGG有效消除了SGG框架中的虚假相关性，解决了偏差问题。

Abstract: Existing two-stage Scene Graph Generation (SGG) frameworks typically
incorporate a detector to extract relationship features and a classifier to
categorize these relationships; therefore, the training paradigm follows a
causal chain structure, where the detector's inputs determine the classifier's
inputs, which in turn influence the final predictions. However, such a causal
chain structure can yield spurious correlations between the detector's inputs
and the final predictions, i.e., the prediction of a certain relationship may
be influenced by other relationships. This influence can induce at least two
observable biases: tail relationships are predicted as head ones, and
foreground relationships are predicted as background ones; notably, the latter
bias is seldom discussed in the literature. To address this issue, we propose
reconstructing the causal chain structure into a reverse causal structure,
wherein the classifier's inputs are treated as the confounder, and both the
detector's inputs and the final predictions are viewed as causal variables.
Specifically, we term the reconstructed causal paradigm as the Reverse causal
Framework for SGG (RcSGG). RcSGG initially employs the proposed Active Reverse
Estimation (ARE) to intervene on the confounder to estimate the reverse
causality, \ie the causality from final predictions to the classifier's inputs.
Then, the Maximum Information Sampling (MIS) is suggested to enhance the
reverse causality estimation further by considering the relationship
information. Theoretically, RcSGG can mitigate the spurious correlations
inherent in the SGG framework, subsequently eliminating the induced biases.
Comprehensive experiments on popular benchmarks and diverse SGG frameworks show
the state-of-the-art mean recall rate.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LAFR的潜在空间适配器，用于解决低质量（LQ）人脸图像恢复中的语义对齐问题，通过轻量级调整实现高质量（HQ）图像生成，同时减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型（如Stable Diffusion）的VAE模块仅在高质量数据上训练，导致低质量输入编码时语义不匹配，影响去噪效果。传统方法通过重新训练VAE编码器解决，但计算和内存成本高。

Method: 提出LAFR，一种基于码本的潜在空间适配器，对齐LQ和HQ图像的潜在分布；引入多级恢复损失结合身份嵌入和面部结构先验；轻量级微调扩散先验。

Result: 在合成和真实人脸恢复基准测试中，LAFR实现了高质量、身份保持的图像重建，训练时间减少70%。

Conclusion: LAFR通过轻量级适配器和多级损失设计，高效解决了低质量人脸图像恢复中的语义对齐问题。

Abstract: Blind face restoration from low-quality (LQ) images is a challenging task
that requires not only high-fidelity image reconstruction but also the
preservation of facial identity. While diffusion models like Stable Diffusion
have shown promise in generating high-quality (HQ) images, their VAE modules
are typically trained only on HQ data, resulting in semantic misalignment when
encoding LQ inputs. This mismatch significantly weakens the effectiveness of LQ
conditions during the denoising process. Existing approaches often tackle this
issue by retraining the VAE encoder, which is computationally expensive and
memory-intensive. To address this limitation efficiently, we propose LAFR
(Latent Alignment for Face Restoration), a novel codebook-based latent space
adapter that aligns the latent distribution of LQ images with that of HQ
counterparts, enabling semantically consistent diffusion sampling without
altering the original VAE. To further enhance identity preservation, we
introduce a multi-level restoration loss that combines constraints from
identity embeddings and facial structural priors. Additionally, by leveraging
the inherent structural regularity of facial images, we show that lightweight
finetuning of diffusion prior on just 0.9% of FFHQ dataset is sufficient to
achieve results comparable to state-of-the-art methods, reduce training time by
70%. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world face restoration
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of LAFR, achieving
high-quality, identity-preserving face reconstruction from severely degraded
inputs.

Result: VCapsBench提供了5,677视频和109,796 QA对，支持细粒度字幕优化。

Conclusion: 该基准可推动文本到视频模型的鲁棒性发展。

Abstract: Video captions play a crucial role in text-to-video generation tasks, as
their quality directly influences the semantic coherence and visual fidelity of
the generated videos. Although large vision-language models (VLMs) have
demonstrated significant potential in caption generation, existing benchmarks
inadequately address fine-grained evaluation, particularly in capturing
spatial-temporal details critical for video generation. To address this gap, we
introduce the Fine-grained Video Caption Evaluation Benchmark (VCapsBench), the
first large-scale fine-grained benchmark comprising 5,677 (5K+) videos and
109,796 (100K+) question-answer pairs. These QA-pairs are systematically
annotated across 21 fine-grained dimensions (e.g., camera movement, and shot
type) that are empirically proven critical for text-to-video generation. We
further introduce three metrics (Accuracy (AR), Inconsistency Rate (IR),
Coverage Rate (CR)), and an automated evaluation pipeline leveraging large
language model (LLM) to verify caption quality via contrastive QA-pairs
analysis. By providing actionable insights for caption optimization, our
benchmark can advance the development of robust text-to-video models. The

Result: 对16种T2I模型的实验显示其推理能力普遍不足。

Conclusion: 需要开发更具推理能力的下一代T2I系统架构。

Abstract: Reasoning is a fundamental capability often required in real-world
text-to-image (T2I) generation, e.g., generating ``a bitten apple that has been
left in the air for more than a week`` necessitates understanding temporal
decay and commonsense concepts. While recent T2I models have made impressive
progress in producing photorealistic images, their reasoning capability remains
underdeveloped and insufficiently evaluated. To bridge this gap, we introduce
R2I-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to rigorously assess
reasoning-driven T2I generation. R2I-Bench comprises meticulously curated data
instances, spanning core reasoning categories, including commonsense,
mathematical, logical, compositional, numerical, causal, and concept mixing. To
facilitate fine-grained evaluation, we design R2IScore, a QA-style metric based
on instance-specific, reasoning-oriented evaluation questions that assess three
critical dimensions: text-image alignment, reasoning accuracy, and image
quality. Extensive experiments with 16 representative T2I models, including a
strong pipeline-based framework that decouples reasoning and generation using
the state-of-the-art language and image generation models, demonstrate
consistently limited reasoning performance, highlighting the need for more
robust, reasoning-aware architectures in the next generation of T2I systems.

Conclusion: VAU-R1和VAU-Bench为可解释和推理感知的视频异常理解奠定了基础。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Understanding (VAU) is essential for applications such as smart
cities, security surveillance, and disaster alert systems, yet remains
challenging due to its demand for fine-grained spatio-temporal perception and
robust reasoning under ambiguity. Despite advances in anomaly detection,
existing methods often lack interpretability and struggle to capture the causal
and contextual aspects of abnormal events. This limitation is further
compounded by the absence of comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating reasoning
ability in anomaly scenarios. To address both challenges, we introduce VAU-R1,
a data-efficient framework built upon Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
which enhances anomaly reasoning through Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT).
Besides, we propose VAU-Bench, the first Chain-of-Thought benchmark tailored
for video anomaly reasoning, featuring multiple-choice QA, detailed rationales,
temporal annotations, and descriptive captions. Empirical results show that
VAU-R1 significantly improves question answering accuracy, temporal grounding,

Conclusion: 提出的方法在多视角感知增强和无监督时间动作定位中表现出色。

Abstract: Temporal Action Localization (TAL) has garnered significant attention in
information retrieval. Existing supervised or weakly supervised methods heavily
rely on labeled temporal boundaries and action categories, which are
labor-intensive and time-consuming. Consequently, unsupervised temporal action
localization (UTAL) has gained popularity. However, current methods face two
main challenges: 1) Classification pre-trained features overly focus on highly
discriminative regions; 2) Solely relying on visual modality information makes
it difficult to determine contextual boundaries. To address these issues, we
propose a CLIP-assisted cross-view audiovisual enhanced UTAL method.
Specifically, we introduce visual language pre-training (VLP) and
classification pre-training-based collaborative enhancement to avoid excessive
focus on highly discriminative regions; we also incorporate audio perception to
provide richer contextual boundary information. Finally, we introduce a
self-supervised cross-view learning paradigm to achieve multi-view perceptual
enhancement without additional annotations. Extensive experiments on two public
datasets demonstrate our model's superiority over several state-of-the-art
competitors.

Abstract: Generating highly dynamic and photorealistic portrait animations driven by
audio and skeletal motion remains challenging due to the need for precise lip
synchronization, natural facial expressions, and high-fidelity body motion
dynamics. We propose a human-preference-aligned diffusion framework that
addresses these challenges through two key innovations. First, we introduce
direct preference optimization tailored for human-centric animation, leveraging
a curated dataset of human preferences to align generated outputs with
perceptual metrics for portrait motion-video alignment and naturalness of
expression. Second, the proposed temporal motion modulation resolves
spatiotemporal resolution mismatches by reshaping motion conditions into
dimensionally aligned latent features through temporal channel redistribution
and proportional feature expansion, preserving the fidelity of high-frequency
motion details in diffusion-based synthesis. The proposed mechanism is
complementary to existing UNet and DiT-based portrait diffusion approaches, and
experiments demonstrate obvious improvements in lip-audio synchronization,
expression vividness, body motion coherence over baseline methods, alongside
notable gains in human preference metrics. Our model and source code can be

Abstract: The digitization of cultural heritage collections has opened new directions
for research, yet the lack of enriched metadata poses a substantial challenge
to accessibility, interoperability, and cross-institutional collaboration. In
several past years neural networks models such as YOLOv11 and Detectron2 have
revolutionized visual data analysis, but their application to domain-specific
cultural artifacts - such as manuscripts and incunabula - remains limited by
the absence of methodologies that address structural feature extraction and
semantic interoperability. In this position paper, we argue, that the
integration of neural networks with semantic technologies represents a paradigm
shift in cultural heritage digitization processes. We present the Metadata
Enrichment Model (MEM), a conceptual framework designed to enrich metadata for
digitized collections by combining fine-tuned computer vision models, large
language models (LLMs) and structured knowledge graphs. The Multilayer Vision
Mechanism (MVM) appears as the key innovation of MEM. This iterative process
improves visual analysis by dynamically detecting nested features, such as text
within seals or images within stamps. To expose MEM's potential, we apply it to
a dataset of digitized incunabula from the Jagiellonian Digital Library and
release a manually annotated dataset of 105 manuscript pages. We examine the
practical challenges of MEM's usage in real-world GLAM institutions, including
the need for domain-specific fine-tuning, the adjustment of enriched metadata
with Linked Data standards and computational costs. We present MEM as a
flexible and extensible methodology. This paper contributes to the discussion
on how artificial intelligence and semantic web technologies can advance
cultural heritage research, and also use these technologies in practice.

Abstract: Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition (HMER) remains a persistent
challenge in Optical Character Recognition (OCR) due to the inherent freedom of
symbol layout and variability in handwriting styles. Prior methods have faced
performance bottlenecks, proposing isolated architectural modifications that
are difficult to integrate coherently into a unified framework. Meanwhile,
recent advances in pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated
strong cross-task generalization, offering a promising foundation for
developing unified solutions. In this paper, we introduce Uni-MuMER, which
fully fine-tunes a VLM for the HMER task without modifying its architecture,
effectively injecting domain-specific knowledge into a generalist framework.
Our method integrates three data-driven tasks: Tree-Aware Chain-of-Thought
(Tree-CoT) for structured spatial reasoning, Error-Driven Learning (EDL) for
reducing confusion among visually similar characters, and Symbol Counting (SC)
for improving recognition consistency in long expressions. Experiments on the
CROHME and HME100K datasets show that Uni-MuMER achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, surpassing the best lightweight specialized model SSAN by 16.31%

Abstract: The explosive growth of digital images and the widespread availability of
image editing tools have made image manipulation detection an increasingly
critical challenge. Current deep learning-based manipulation detection methods
excel in achieving high image-level classification accuracy, they often fall
short in terms of interpretability and localization of manipulated regions.
Additionally, the absence of pixel-wise annotations in real-world scenarios
limits the existing fully-supervised manipulation localization techniques. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel weakly-supervised approach that
integrates activation maps generated by image-level manipulation detection
networks with segmentation maps from pre-trained models. Specifically, we build
on our previous image-level work named WCBnet to produce multi-view feature
maps which are subsequently fused for coarse localization. These coarse maps
are then refined using detailed segmented regional information provided by
pre-trained segmentation models (such as DeepLab, SegmentAnything and PSPnet),
with Bayesian inference employed to enhance the manipulation localization.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
highlighting the feasibility to localize image manipulations without relying on
pixel-level labels.

existing heuristic or gradient-based methods that often incur substantial

importance without requiring gradient access, thereby significantly reducing
memory usage and achieving a threefold increase in training speed. It can be

experiments on a large-scale CXR dataset demonstrate that DeepChest not only
outperforms state-of-the-art MTL methods by 7% in overall accuracy but also
yields substantial reductions in individual task losses, indicating improved
generalization and effective mitigation of negative transfer. The efficiency

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models have enabled
high-fidelity and realistic video synthesis. However, current T2V models often
struggle to generate physically plausible content due to their limited inherent
ability to accurately understand physics. We found that while the
representations within T2V models possess some capacity for physics
understanding, they lag significantly behind those from recent video
self-supervised learning methods. To this end, we propose a novel framework
called VideoREPA, which distills physics understanding capability from video
understanding foundation models into T2V models by aligning token-level
relations. This closes the physics understanding gap and enable more
physics-plausible generation. Specifically, we introduce the Token Relation
Distillation (TRD) loss, leveraging spatio-temporal alignment to provide soft
guidance suitable for finetuning powerful pre-trained T2V models, a critical
departure from prior representation alignment (REPA) methods. To our knowledge,
VideoREPA is the first REPA method designed for finetuning T2V models and
specifically for injecting physical knowledge. Empirical evaluations show that
VideoREPA substantially enhances the physics commonsense of baseline method,
CogVideoX, achieving significant improvement on relevant benchmarks and
demonstrating a strong capacity for generating videos consistent with intuitive

Abstract: VOT remains a fundamental yet challenging task in computer vision due to
dynamic appearance changes, occlusions, and background clutter. Traditional
trackers, relying primarily on visual cues, often struggle in such complex
scenarios. Recent advancements in VLMs have shown promise in semantic
understanding for tasks like open-vocabulary detection and image captioning,
suggesting their potential for VOT. However, the direct application of VLMs to
VOT is hindered by critical limitations: the absence of a rich and
comprehensive textual representation that semantically captures the target
object's nuances, limiting the effective use of language information;
inefficient fusion mechanisms that fail to optimally integrate visual and
textual features, preventing a holistic understanding of the target; and a lack
of temporal modeling of the target's evolving appearance in the language
domain, leading to a disconnect between the initial description and the
object's subsequent visual changes. To bridge these gaps and unlock the full
potential of VLMs for VOT, we propose CLDTracker, a novel Comprehensive
Language Description framework for robust visual Tracking. Our tracker
introduces a dual-branch architecture consisting of a textual and a visual
branch. In the textual branch, we construct a rich bag of textual descriptions
derived by harnessing the powerful VLMs such as CLIP and GPT-4V, enriched with
semantic and contextual cues to address the lack of rich textual
representation. Experiments on six standard VOT benchmarks demonstrate that
CLDTracker achieves SOTA performance, validating the effectiveness of
leveraging robust and temporally-adaptive vision-language representations for
tracking. Code and models are publicly available at:

Abstract: Collecting high quality data for object detection tasks is challenging due to
the inherent subjectivity in labeling the boundaries of an object. This makes
it difficult to not only collect consistent annotations across a dataset but
also to validate them, as no two annotators are likely to label the same object
using the exact same coordinates. These challenges are further compounded when
object boundaries are partially visible or blurred, which can be the case in
many domains. Training on noisy annotations significantly degrades detector
performance, rendering them unusable, particularly in few-shot settings, where
just a few corrupted annotations can impact model performance. In this work, we
propose FMG-Det, a simple, efficient methodology for training models with noisy
annotations. More specifically, we propose combining a multiple instance
learning (MIL) framework with a pre-processing pipeline that leverages powerful
foundation models to correct labels prior to training. This pre-processing
pipeline, along with slight modifications to the detector head, results in
state-of-the-art performance across a number of datasets, for both standard and
few-shot scenarios, while being much simpler and more efficient than other
approaches.

Motivation: 解决现有3D高斯溅射模型因编码器容量有限而导致的扩展性问题。

Conclusion: ZPressor为3D高斯溅射模型提供了一种高效的扩展解决方案。

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models have recently emerged as a
promising solution for novel view synthesis, enabling one-pass inference
without the need for per-scene 3DGS optimization. However, their scalability is
fundamentally constrained by the limited capacity of their encoders, leading to
degraded performance or excessive memory consumption as the number of input
views increases. In this work, we analyze feed-forward 3DGS frameworks through
the lens of the Information Bottleneck principle and introduce ZPressor, a
lightweight architecture-agnostic module that enables efficient compression of
multi-view inputs into a compact latent state $Z$ that retains essential scene
information while discarding redundancy. Concretely, ZPressor enables existing
feed-forward 3DGS models to scale to over 100 input views at 480P resolution on
an 80GB GPU, by partitioning the views into anchor and support sets and using
cross attention to compress the information from the support views into anchor
views, forming the compressed latent state $Z$. We show that integrating
ZPressor into several state-of-the-art feed-forward 3DGS models consistently
improves performance under moderate input views and enhances robustness under
dense view settings on two large-scale benchmarks DL3DV-10K and RealEstate10K.

Abstract: Video generation has made substantial strides with the emergence of deep
generative models, especially diffusion-based approaches. However, video
generation based on multiple reference subjects still faces significant
challenges in maintaining multi-subject consistency and ensuring high
generation quality. In this paper, we propose MAGREF, a unified framework for
any-reference video generation that introduces masked guidance to enable
coherent multi-subject video synthesis conditioned on diverse reference images
and a textual prompt. Specifically, we propose (1) a region-aware dynamic
masking mechanism that enables a single model to flexibly handle various
subject inference, including humans, objects, and backgrounds, without
architectural changes, and (2) a pixel-wise channel concatenation mechanism
that operates on the channel dimension to better preserve appearance features.
Our model delivers state-of-the-art video generation quality, generalizing from
single-subject training to complex multi-subject scenarios with coherent
synthesis and precise control over individual subjects, outperforming existing
open-source and commercial baselines. To facilitate evaluation, we also
introduce a comprehensive multi-subject video benchmark. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, paving the way for scalable,
controllable, and high-fidelity multi-subject video synthesis. Code and model

Abstract: We introduce LoRAShop, the first framework for multi-concept image editing
with LoRA models. LoRAShop builds on a key observation about the feature
interaction patterns inside Flux-style diffusion transformers: concept-specific
transformer features activate spatially coherent regions early in the denoising
process. We harness this observation to derive a disentangled latent mask for
each concept in a prior forward pass and blend the corresponding LoRA weights
only within regions bounding the concepts to be personalized. The resulting
edits seamlessly integrate multiple subjects or styles into the original scene
while preserving global context, lighting, and fine details. Our experiments
demonstrate that LoRAShop delivers better identity preservation compared to
baselines. By eliminating retraining and external constraints, LoRAShop turns
personalized diffusion models into a practical `photoshop-with-LoRAs' tool and
opens new avenues for compositional visual storytelling and rapid creative
iteration.

Abstract: We introduce Blind Plug-and-Play Diffusion Models (Blind-PnPDM) as a novel
framework for solving blind inverse problems where both the target image and
the measurement operator are unknown. Unlike conventional methods that rely on
explicit priors or separate parameter estimation, our approach performs
posterior sampling by recasting the problem into an alternating Gaussian
denoising scheme. We leverage two diffusion models as learned priors: one to
capture the distribution of the target image and another to characterize the
parameters of the measurement operator. This PnP integration of diffusion
models ensures flexibility and ease of adaptation. Our experiments on blind
image deblurring show that Blind-PnPDM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
terms of both quantitative metrics and visual fidelity. Our results highlight
the effectiveness of treating blind inverse problems as a sequence of denoising
subproblems while harnessing the expressive power of diffusion-based priors.

Abstract: Embodied visual tracking is a fundamental skill in Embodied AI, enabling an
agent to follow a specific target in dynamic environments using only egocentric
vision. This task is inherently challenging as it requires both accurate target
recognition and effective trajectory planning under conditions of severe
occlusion and high scene dynamics. Existing approaches typically address this
challenge through a modular separation of recognition and planning. In this
work, we propose TrackVLA, a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that learns the
synergy between object recognition and trajectory planning. Leveraging a shared
LLM backbone, we employ a language modeling head for recognition and an
anchor-based diffusion model for trajectory planning. To train TrackVLA, we
construct an Embodied Visual Tracking Benchmark (EVT-Bench) and collect diverse
difficulty levels of recognition samples, resulting in a dataset of 1.7 million
samples. Through extensive experiments in both synthetic and real-world
environments, TrackVLA demonstrates SOTA performance and strong
generalizability. It significantly outperforms existing methods on public
benchmarks in a zero-shot manner while remaining robust to high dynamics and
occlusion in real-world scenarios at 10 FPS inference speed. Our project page

Abstract: Recent advances in interactive technologies have highlighted the prominence
of audio signals for semantic encoding. This paper explores a new task, where
audio signals are used as conditioning inputs to generate motions that align
with the semantics of the audio. Unlike text-based interactions, audio provides
a more natural and intuitive communication method. However, existing methods
typically focus on matching motions with music or speech rhythms, which often
results in a weak connection between the semantics of the audio and generated
motions. We propose an end-to-end framework using a masked generative
transformer, enhanced by a memory-retrieval attention module to handle sparse
and lengthy audio inputs. Additionally, we enrich existing datasets by
converting descriptions into conversational style and generating corresponding
audio with varied speaker identities. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
and efficiency of the proposed framework, demonstrating that audio instructions
can convey semantics similar to text while providing more practical and
user-friendly interactions.

Conclusion: 该方法通过严格对齐元动作与轨迹段，简化了任务复杂性，同时提供了灵活性和模块化。

Abstract: Controllable trajectory generation guided by high-level semantic decisions,
termed meta-actions, is crucial for autonomous driving systems. A significant
limitation of existing frameworks is their reliance on invariant meta-actions
assigned over fixed future time intervals, causing temporal misalignment with
the actual behavior trajectories. This misalignment leads to irrelevant
associations between the prescribed meta-actions and the resulting
trajectories, disrupting task coherence and limiting model performance. To
address this challenge, we introduce Autoregressive Meta-Actions, an approach
integrated into autoregressive trajectory generation frameworks that provides a
unified and precise definition for meta-action-conditioned trajectory
prediction. Specifically, We decompose traditional long-interval meta-actions
into frame-level meta-actions, enabling a sequential interplay between
autoregressive meta-action prediction and meta-action-conditioned trajectory
generation. This decomposition ensures strict alignment between each trajectory
segment and its corresponding meta-action, achieving a consistent and unified
task formulation across the entire trajectory span and significantly reducing
complexity. Moreover, we propose a staged pre-training process to decouple the
learning of basic motion dynamics from the integration of high-level decision
control, which offers flexibility, stability, and modularity. Experimental
results validate our framework's effectiveness, demonstrating improved
trajectory adaptivity and responsiveness to dynamic decision-making scenarios.

Conclusion: 策略移动化问题是一个重要且可行的研究方向，Mobi-π框架为未来研究提供了基础。

Abstract: Learned visuomotor policies are capable of performing increasingly complex
manipulation tasks. However, most of these policies are trained on data
collected from limited robot positions and camera viewpoints. This leads to
poor generalization to novel robot positions, which limits the use of these
policies on mobile platforms, especially for precise tasks like pressing
buttons or turning faucets. In this work, we formulate the policy mobilization
problem: find a mobile robot base pose in a novel environment that is in
distribution with respect to a manipulation policy trained on a limited set of
camera viewpoints. Compared to retraining the policy itself to be more robust
to unseen robot base pose initializations, policy mobilization decouples
navigation from manipulation and thus does not require additional
demonstrations. Crucially, this problem formulation complements existing
efforts to improve manipulation policy robustness to novel viewpoints and
remains compatible with them. To study policy mobilization, we introduce the
Mobi-$\pi$ framework, which includes: (1) metrics that quantify the difficulty
of mobilizing a given policy, (2) a suite of simulated mobile manipulation
tasks based on RoboCasa to evaluate policy mobilization, (3) visualization
tools for analysis, and (4) several baseline methods. We also propose a novel
approach that bridges navigation and manipulation by optimizing the robot's
base pose to align with an in-distribution base pose for a learned policy. Our
approach utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting for novel view synthesis, a score
function to evaluate pose suitability, and sampling-based optimization to
identify optimal robot poses. We show that our approach outperforms baselines
in both simulation and real-world environments, demonstrating its effectiveness
for policy mobilization.

detection by bridging the gap between large and small detectors, capturing
high-frequency details at multiple scales during training, and using filters

Abstract: A major challenge in rare animal image classification is the scarcity of

  To address this challenge, we designed a hybrid deep-learning framework
comprising a novel adaptive DCT preprocessing module, ViT-B16 and ResNet50
backbones, and a Bayesian linear classification head. To our knowledge, we are
the first to introduce an adaptive frequency-domain selection mechanism that
learns optimal low-, mid-, and high-frequency boundaries suited to the
subsequent backbones.
  Our network first captures image frequency-domain cues via this adaptive DCT
partitioning. The adaptively filtered frequency features are then fed into
ViT-B16 to model global contextual relationships, while ResNet50 concurrently
extracts local, multi-scale spatial representations from the original image. A
cross-level fusion strategy seamlessly integrates these frequency- and
spatial-domain embeddings, and the fused features are passed through a Bayesian
linear classifier to output the final category predictions. On our self-built
50-class wildlife dataset, this approach outperforms conventional CNN and
fixed-band DCT pipelines, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy under extreme

Conclusion: C-REX通过改进对比学习框架，显著提升了REC任务的性能，并展示了其通用性。

Abstract: Object counting has progressed from class-specific models, which count only
known categories, to class-agnostic models that generalize to unseen
categories. The next challenge is Referring Expression Counting (REC), where
the goal is to count objects based on fine-grained attributes and contextual
differences. Existing methods struggle with distinguishing visually similar
objects that belong to the same category but correspond to different referring
expressions. To address this, we propose C-REX, a novel contrastive learning
framework, based on supervised contrastive learning, designed to enhance
discriminative representation learning. Unlike prior works, C-REX operates
entirely within the image space, avoiding the misalignment issues of image-text
contrastive learning, thus providing a more stable contrastive signal. It also
guarantees a significantly larger pool of negative samples, leading to improved
robustness in the learned representations. Moreover, we showcase that our
framework is versatile and generic enough to be applied to other similar tasks
like class-agnostic counting. To support our approach, we analyze the key
components of sota detection-based models and identify that detecting object
centroids instead of bounding boxes is the key common factor behind their
success in counting tasks. We use this insight to design a simple yet effective
detection-based baseline to build upon. Our experiments show that C-REX
achieves state-of-the-art results in REC, outperforming previous methods by
more than 22\% in MAE and more than 10\% in RMSE, while also demonstrating
strong performance in class-agnostic counting. Code is available at

Abstract: We propose the first 4D tracking and mapping method that jointly performs
camera localization and non-rigid surface reconstruction via differentiable
rendering. Our approach captures 4D scenes from an online stream of color
images with depth measurements or predictions by jointly optimizing scene
geometry, appearance, dynamics, and camera ego-motion. Although natural
environments exhibit complex non-rigid motions, 4D-SLAM remains relatively
underexplored due to its inherent challenges; even with 2.5D signals, the
problem is ill-posed because of the high dimensionality of the optimization
space. To overcome these challenges, we first introduce a SLAM method based on
Gaussian surface primitives that leverages depth signals more effectively than
3D Gaussians, thereby achieving accurate surface reconstruction. To further
model non-rigid deformations, we employ a warp-field represented by a
multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and introduce a novel camera pose estimation
technique along with surface regularization terms that facilitate
spatio-temporal reconstruction. In addition to these algorithmic challenges, a
significant hurdle in 4D SLAM research is the lack of reliable ground truth and
evaluation protocols, primarily due to the difficulty of 4D capture using
commodity sensors. To address this, we present a novel open synthetic dataset
of everyday objects with diverse motions, leveraging large-scale object models
and animation modeling. In summary, we open up the modern 4D-SLAM research by
introducing a novel method and evaluation protocols grounded in modern vision
and rendering techniques.

Abstract: We introduce a taxonomy of materials for hierarchical recognition from local
appearance. Our taxonomy is motivated by vision applications and is arranged
according to the physical traits of materials. We contribute a diverse,
in-the-wild dataset with images and depth maps of the taxonomy classes.
Utilizing the taxonomy and dataset, we present a method for hierarchical
material recognition based on graph attention networks. Our model leverages the
taxonomic proximity between classes and achieves state-of-the-art performance.
We demonstrate the model's potential to generalize to adverse, real-world
imaging conditions, and that novel views rendered using the depth maps can
enhance this capability. Finally, we show the model's capacity to rapidly learn
new materials in a few-shot learning setting.

Abstract: We propose a unified framework for motion control in video generation that
seamlessly integrates camera movement, object-level translation, and
fine-grained local motion using trajectory-based inputs. In contrast to prior
methods that address these motion types through separate modules or
task-specific designs, our approach offers a cohesive solution by projecting
user-defined trajectories into the latent space of pre-trained image-to-video
generation models via a lightweight motion injector. Users can specify
keypoints and their motion paths to control localized deformations, entire
object motion, virtual camera dynamics, or combinations of these. The injected
trajectory signals guide the generative process to produce temporally
consistent and semantically aligned motion sequences. Our framework
demonstrates superior performance across multiple video motion control tasks,
including stylized motion effects (e.g., motion brushes), dynamic viewpoint
changes, and precise local motion manipulation. Experiments show that our
method provides significantly better controllability and visual quality
compared to prior approaches and commercial solutions, while remaining broadly
compatible with various state-of-the-art video generation backbones. Project

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved conditional
video generation, particularly in the pose-guided human image animation task.
Although existing methods are capable of generating high-fidelity and
time-consistent animation sequences in regular motions and static scenes, there
are still obvious limitations when facing complex human body motions
(Hypermotion) that contain highly dynamic, non-standard motions, and the lack
of a high-quality benchmark for evaluation of complex human motion animations.
To address this challenge, we introduce the \textbf{Open-HyperMotionX Dataset}
and \textbf{HyperMotionX Bench}, which provide high-quality human pose
annotations and curated video clips for evaluating and improving pose-guided
human image animation models under complex human motion conditions.
Furthermore, we propose a simple yet powerful DiT-based video generation
baseline and design spatial low-frequency enhanced RoPE, a novel module that
selectively enhances low-frequency spatial feature modeling by introducing
learnable frequency scaling. Our method significantly improves structural
stability and appearance consistency in highly dynamic human motion sequences.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset and proposed
approach in advancing the generation quality of complex human motion image
animations. Code and dataset will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: SHARE为姿态不准确的场景提供了一种高效且鲁棒的高斯溅射解决方案。

Abstract: While generalizable 3D Gaussian splatting enables efficient, high-quality
rendering of unseen scenes, it heavily depends on precise camera poses for
accurate geometry. In real-world scenarios, obtaining accurate poses is
challenging, leading to noisy pose estimates and geometric misalignments. To
address this, we introduce SHARE, a pose-free, feed-forward Gaussian splatting
framework that overcomes these ambiguities by joint shape and camera rays
estimation. Instead of relying on explicit 3D transformations, SHARE builds a
pose-aware canonical volume representation that seamlessly integrates
multi-view information, reducing misalignment caused by inaccurate pose
estimates. Additionally, anchor-aligned Gaussian prediction enhances scene
reconstruction by refining local geometry around coarse anchors, allowing for
more precise Gaussian placement. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world
datasets show that our method achieves robust performance in pose-free
generalizable Gaussian splatting.

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) remote sensing imagery plays a vital role in a wide
range of applications, including urban planning and environmental monitoring.
However, due to limitations in sensors and data transmission links, the images
acquired in practice often suffer from resolution degradation. Remote Sensing
Image Super-Resolution (RSISR) aims to reconstruct HR images from
low-resolution (LR) inputs, providing a cost-effective and efficient
alternative to direct HR image acquisition. Existing RSISR methods primarily
focus on low-level characteristics in pixel space, while neglecting the
high-level understanding of remote sensing scenes. This may lead to
semantically inconsistent artifacts in the reconstructed results. Motivated by
this observation, our work aims to explore the role of high-level semantic
knowledge in improving RSISR performance. We propose a Semantic-Guided
Super-Resolution framework, SeG-SR, which leverages Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) to extract semantic knowledge from input images and uses it to guide the
super resolution (SR) process. Specifically, we first design a Semantic Feature
Extraction Module (SFEM) that utilizes a pretrained VLM to extract semantic
knowledge from remote sensing images. Next, we propose a Semantic Localization
Module (SLM), which derives a series of semantic guidance from the extracted
semantic knowledge. Finally, we develop a Learnable Modulation Module (LMM)
that uses semantic guidance to modulate the features extracted by the SR
network, effectively incorporating high-level scene understanding into the SR
pipeline. We validate the effectiveness and generalizability of SeG-SR through
extensive experiments: SeG-SR achieves state-of-the-art performance on two
datasets and consistently delivers performance improvements across various SR
architectures. Codes can be found at https://github.com/Mr-Bamboo/SeG-SR.

Conclusion: STJD方法有效利用了动态与静态关节的交互作用，显著提升了骨骼动作分类的性能。

Abstract: Traditional approaches in unsupervised or self supervised learning for
skeleton-based action classification have concentrated predominantly on the
dynamic aspects of skeletal sequences. Yet, the intricate interaction between
the moving and static elements of the skeleton presents a rarely tapped
discriminative potential for action classification. This paper introduces a
novel measurement, referred to as spatial-temporal joint density (STJD), to
quantify such interaction. Tracking the evolution of this density throughout an
action can effectively identify a subset of discriminative moving and/or static
joints termed "prime joints" to steer self-supervised learning. A new
contrastive learning strategy named STJD-CL is proposed to align the
representation of a skeleton sequence with that of its prime joints while
simultaneously contrasting the representations of prime and nonprime joints. In
addition, a method called STJD-MP is developed by integrating it with a
reconstruction-based framework for more effective learning. Experimental
evaluations on the NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and PKUMMD datasets in various
downstream tasks demonstrate that the proposed STJD-CL and STJD-MP improved
performance, particularly by 3.5 and 3.6 percentage points over the
state-of-the-art contrastive methods on the NTU RGB+D 120 dataset using X-sub

Result: 实验显示参数减少60%，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SpatialSplat以更紧凑的高斯表示实现高效语义3D重建。

Abstract: A major breakthrough in 3D reconstruction is the feedforward paradigm to
generate pixel-wise 3D points or Gaussian primitives from sparse, unposed
images. To further incorporate semantics while avoiding the significant memory
and storage costs of high-dimensional semantic features, existing methods
extend this paradigm by associating each primitive with a compressed semantic
feature vector. However, these methods have two major limitations: (a) the
naively compressed feature compromises expressiveness, affecting the model's
ability to capture fine-grained semantics, and (b) the pixel-wise primitive
prediction introduces redundancy in overlapping areas, causing unnecessary
memory overhead. To this end, we introduce \textbf{SpatialSplat}, a feedforward
framework that produces redundancy-aware Gaussians and capitalizes on a
dual-field semantic representation. Particularly, with the insight that
primitives within the same instance exhibit high semantic consistency, we
decompose the semantic representation into a coarse feature field that encodes
uncompressed semantics with minimal primitives, and a fine-grained yet
low-dimensional feature field that captures detailed inter-instance
relationships. Moreover, we propose a selective Gaussian mechanism, which
retains only essential Gaussians in the scene, effectively eliminating
redundant primitives. Our proposed Spatialsplat learns accurate semantic
information and detailed instances prior with more compact 3D Gaussians, making
semantic 3D reconstruction more applicable. We conduct extensive experiments to
evaluate our method, demonstrating a remarkable 60\% reduction in scene
representation parameters while achieving superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods. The code will be made available for future
investigation.

Abstract: Generative 3D reconstruction shows strong potential in incomplete
observations. While sparse-view and single-image reconstruction are
well-researched, partial observation remains underexplored. In this context,
dense views are accessible only from a specific angular range, with other
perspectives remaining inaccessible. This task presents two main challenges:
(i) limited View Range: observations confined to a narrow angular scope prevent
effective traditional interpolation techniques that require evenly distributed
perspectives. (ii) inconsistent Generation: views created for invisible regions
often lack coherence with both visible regions and each other, compromising
reconstruction consistency. To address these challenges, we propose \method, a
novel training-free approach that integrates the local dense observations and
multi-source priors for reconstruction. Our method introduces a fusion-based
strategy to effectively align these priors in DDIM sampling, thereby generating
multi-view consistent images to supervise invisible views. We further design an
iterative refinement strategy, which uses the geometric structures of the
object to enhance reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments on multiple
datasets show the superiority of our method over SOTAs, especially in invisible
regions.

Abstract: Estimating accurate and temporally consistent 3D human geometry from videos
is a challenging problem in computer vision. Existing methods, primarily
optimized for single images, often suffer from temporal inconsistencies and
fail to capture fine-grained dynamic details. To address these limitations, we
present GeoMan, a novel architecture designed to produce accurate and
temporally consistent depth and normal estimations from monocular human videos.
GeoMan addresses two key challenges: the scarcity of high-quality 4D training
data and the need for metric depth estimation to accurately model human size.
To overcome the first challenge, GeoMan employs an image-based model to
estimate depth and normals for the first frame of a video, which then
conditions a video diffusion model, reframing video geometry estimation task as
an image-to-video generation problem. This design offloads the heavy lifting of
geometric estimation to the image model and simplifies the video model's role
to focus on intricate details while using priors learned from large-scale video
datasets. Consequently, GeoMan improves temporal consistency and
generalizability while requiring minimal 4D training data. To address the
challenge of accurate human size estimation, we introduce a root-relative depth
representation that retains critical human-scale details and is easier to be
estimated from monocular inputs, overcoming the limitations of traditional
affine-invariant and metric depth representations. GeoMan achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations,
demonstrating its effectiveness in overcoming longstanding challenges in 3D
human geometry estimation from videos.

introduce an efficient paradigm by synergizing explicit and implicit modeling
to balance computational efficiency with representational fidelity. Our method
combines well-defined Cartesian directions with explicitly modeled views and
implicitly inferred intermediate representations, efficiently capturing global
dependencies through a nested attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on
challenging datasets, including ADE20K, CityScapes, Pascal Context, and
COCO-Stuff, demonstrate that LeMoRe strikes an effective balance between

Conclusion: EAD provides an effective and generalizable solution for EEG signal classification across diverse datasets.

Abstract: While electroencephalography (EEG) has been a popular modality for neural
decoding, it often involves task specific acquisition of the EEG data. This
poses challenges for the development of a unified pipeline to learn embeddings
for various EEG signal classification, which is often involved in various
decoding tasks. Traditionally, EEG classification involves the step of signal
preprocessing and the use of deep learning techniques, which are highly
dependent on the number of EEG channels in each sample. However, the same
pipeline cannot be applied even if the EEG data is collected for the same
experiment but with different acquisition devices. This necessitates the
development of a framework for learning EEG embeddings, which could be highly
beneficial for tasks involving multiple EEG samples for the same task but with
varying numbers of EEG channels. In this work, we propose EEG Adapter (EAD), a
flexible framework compatible with any signal acquisition device. More
specifically, we leverage a recent EEG foundational model with significant
adaptations to learn robust representations from the EEG data for the
classification task. We evaluate EAD on two publicly available datasets
achieving state-of-the-art accuracies 99.33% and 92.31% on EEG-ImageNet and
BrainLat respectively. This illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed
framework across diverse EEG datasets containing two different perception
tasks: stimulus and resting-state EEG signals. We also perform zero-shot EEG
classification on EEG-ImageNet task to demonstrate the generalization
capability of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Early detection of dementia is crucial to devise effective interventions.
Comprehensive cognitive tests, while being the most accurate means of
diagnosis, are long and tedious, thus limiting their applicability to a large
population, especially when periodic assessments are needed. The problem is
compounded by the fact that people have differing patterns of cognitive
impairment as they progress to different forms of dementia. This paper presents
a novel scheme by which individual-specific patterns of impairment can be
identified and used to devise personalized tests for periodic follow-up.
Patterns of cognitive impairment are initially learned from a population
cluster of combined normals and MCIs, using a set of standardized cognitive
tests. Impairment patterns in the population are identified using a 2-step
procedure involving an ensemble wrapper feature selection followed by cluster
identification and analysis. These patterns have been shown to correspond to
clinically accepted variants of MCI, a prodrome of dementia. The learned
clusters of patterns can subsequently be used to identify the most likely route
of cognitive impairment, even for pre-symptomatic and apparently normal people.
Baseline data of 24,000 subjects from the NACC database was used for the study.

Abstract: Accurately predicting 3D occupancy grids from visual inputs is critical for

stable candidate trajectories. A key innovation, our simulation-supervised
scorer module, then evaluates these proposals against critical metrics
including no at-fault collisions, drivable area compliance, comfortableness,

Abstract: Photo retouching is integral to photographic art, extending far beyond simple
technical fixes to heighten emotional expression and narrative depth. While
artists leverage expertise to create unique visual effects through deliberate
adjustments, non-professional users often rely on automated tools that produce
visually pleasing results but lack interpretative depth and interactive
transparency. In this paper, we introduce PhotoArtAgent, an intelligent system
that combines Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with advanced natural language
reasoning to emulate the creative process of a professional artist. The agent
performs explicit artistic analysis, plans retouching strategies, and outputs
precise parameters to Lightroom through an API. It then evaluates the resulting
images and iteratively refines them until the desired artistic vision is
achieved. Throughout this process, PhotoArtAgent provides transparent,
text-based explanations of its creative rationale, fostering meaningful
interaction and user control. Experimental results show that PhotoArtAgent not
only surpasses existing automated tools in user studies but also achieves
results comparable to those of professional human artists.

Abstract: In this work, we present a novel level-of-detail (LOD) method for 3D Gaussian
Splatting that enables real-time rendering of large-scale scenes on
memory-constrained devices. Our approach introduces a hierarchical LOD
representation that iteratively selects optimal subsets of Gaussians based on
camera distance, thus largely reducing both rendering time and GPU memory
usage. We construct each LOD level by applying a depth-aware 3D smoothing
filter, followed by importance-based pruning and fine-tuning to maintain visual
fidelity. To further reduce memory overhead, we partition the scene into
spatial chunks and dynamically load only relevant Gaussians during rendering,
employing an opacity-blending mechanism to avoid visual artifacts at chunk
boundaries. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both outdoor
(Hierarchical 3DGS) and indoor (Zip-NeRF) datasets, delivering high-quality
renderings with reduced latency and memory requirements.

Abstract: Diffusion-based garment synthesis tasks primarily focus on the design phase
in the fashion domain, while the garment production process remains largely
underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new task: Flat Sketch to
Realistic Garment Image (FS2RG), which generates realistic garment images by
integrating flat sketches and textual guidance. FS2RG presents two key
challenges: 1) fabric characteristics are solely guided by textual prompts,
providing insufficient visual supervision for diffusion-based models, which
limits their ability to capture fine-grained fabric details; 2) flat sketches
and textual guidance may provide conflicting information, requiring the model
to selectively preserve or modify garment attributes while maintaining
structural coherence. To tackle this task, we propose HiGarment, a novel
framework that comprises two core components: i) a multi-modal semantic
enhancement mechanism that enhances fabric representation across textual and
visual modalities, and ii) a harmonized cross-attention mechanism that
dynamically balances information from flat sketches and text prompts, allowing
controllable synthesis by generating either sketch-aligned (image-biased) or
text-guided (text-biased) outputs. Furthermore, we collect Multi-modal Detailed
Garment, the largest open-source dataset for garment generation. Experimental
results and user studies demonstrate the effectiveness of HiGarment in garment
synthesis. The code and dataset will be released.

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了检测性能。

Conclusion: LANGO框架有效缓解了航空图像中的场景和实例级变化问题。

Abstract: Despite recent advancements in computer vision research, object detection in
aerial images still suffers from several challenges. One primary challenge to
be mitigated is the presence of multiple types of variation in aerial images,
for example, illumination and viewpoint changes. These variations result in
highly diverse image scenes and drastic alterations in object appearance, so
that it becomes more complicated to localize objects from the whole image scene
and recognize their categories. To address this problem, in this paper, we
introduce a novel object detection framework in aerial images, named
LANGuage-guided Object detection (LANGO). Upon the proposed language-guided
learning, the proposed framework is designed to alleviate the impacts from both
scene and instance-level variations. First, we are motivated by the way humans
understand the semantics of scenes while perceiving environmental factors in
the scenes (e.g., weather). Therefore, we design a visual semantic reasoner
that comprehends visual semantics of image scenes by interpreting conditions
where the given images were captured. Second, we devise a training objective,
named relation learning loss, to deal with instance-level variations, such as
viewpoint angle and scale changes. This training objective aims to learn
relations in language representations of object categories, with the help of
the robust characteristics against such variations. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and our
method obtains noticeable detection performance improvements.

Abstract: Object detection is a cornerstone of environmental perception in advanced
driver assistance systems(ADAS). However, most existing methods rely on RGB
cameras, which suffer from significant performance degradation under low-light
conditions due to poor image quality. To address this challenge, we proposes
WTEFNet, a real-time object detection framework specifically designed for
low-light scenarios, with strong adaptability to mainstream detectors. WTEFNet
comprises three core modules: a Low-Light Enhancement (LLE) module, a
Wavelet-based Feature Extraction (WFE) module, and an Adaptive Fusion Detection
(AFFD) module. The LLE enhances dark regions while suppressing overexposed
areas; the WFE applies multi-level discrete wavelet transforms to isolate high-
and low-frequency components, enabling effective denoising and structural
feature retention; the AFFD fuses semantic and illumination features for robust
detection. To support training and evaluation, we introduce GSN, a manually
annotated dataset covering both clear and rainy night-time scenes. Extensive
experiments on BDD100K, SHIFT, nuScenes, and GSN demonstrate that WTEFNet
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy under low-light conditions. Furthermore,
deployment on a embedded platform (NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin) confirms the
framework's suitability for real-time ADAS applications.

Abstract: Multimodal remote sensing data, including spectral and lidar or
photogrammetry, is crucial for achieving satisfactory land-use / land-cover
classification results in urban scenes. So far, most studies have been
conducted in a 2D context. When 3D information is available in the dataset, it
is typically integrated with the 2D data by rasterizing the 3D data into 2D
formats. Although this method yields satisfactory classification results, it
falls short in fully exploiting the potential of 3D data by restricting the
model's ability to learn 3D spatial features directly from raw point clouds.
Additionally, it limits the generation of 3D predictions, as the dimensionality
of the input data has been reduced. In this study, we propose a fully 3D-based
method that fuses all modalities within the 3D point cloud and employs a
dedicated dual-branch Transformer model to simultaneously learn geometric and
spectral features. To enhance the fusion process, we introduce a
cross-attention-based mechanism that fully operates on 3D points, effectively
integrating features from various modalities across multiple scales. The
purpose of cross-attention is to allow one modality to assess the importance of
another by weighing the relevant features. We evaluated our method by comparing
it against both 3D and 2D methods using the 2018 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest
(DFC2018) dataset. Our findings indicate that 3D fusion delivers competitive
results compared to 2D methods and offers more flexibility by providing 3D
predictions. These predictions can be projected onto 2D maps, a capability that
is not feasible in reverse. Additionally, we evaluated our method on different
datasets, specifically the ISPRS Vaihingen 3D and the IEEE 2019 Data Fusion
Contest. Our code will be published here:

Conclusion: SAMamba通过域适应、细节保留和高效长程依赖建模，有效解决了红外小目标检测的核心挑战。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) is vital for long-range surveillance
in military, maritime, and early warning applications. ISTD is challenged by
targets occupying less than 0.15% of the image and low distinguishability from
complex backgrounds. Existing deep learning methods often suffer from
information loss during downsampling and inefficient global context modeling.
This paper presents SAMamba, a novel framework integrating SAM2's hierarchical
feature learning with Mamba's selective sequence modeling. Key innovations
include: (1) A Feature Selection Adapter (FS-Adapter) for efficient
natural-to-infrared domain adaptation via dual-stage selection (token-level
with a learnable task embedding and channel-wise adaptive transformations); (2)
A Cross-Channel State-Space Interaction (CSI) module for efficient global
context modeling with linear complexity using selective state space modeling;
and (3) A Detail-Preserving Contextual Fusion (DPCF) module that adaptively
combines multi-scale features with a gating mechanism to balance
high-resolution and low-resolution feature contributions. SAMamba addresses
core ISTD challenges by bridging the domain gap, maintaining fine-grained
details, and efficiently modeling long-range dependencies. Experiments on
NUAA-SIRST, IRSTD-1k, and NUDT-SIRST datasets show SAMamba significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in challenging scenarios with

Abstract: Remote sensing image super-resolution (RSISR) is a crucial task in remote

Notably, our analysis reveals significant limitations in existing methods,
particularly in preserving fine-grained textures and geometric structures under

Conclusion: UniTEX通过创新的3D功能空间和Transformer模型，解决了现有方法的局限性，为3D纹理生成提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: We present UniTEX, a novel two-stage 3D texture generation framework to
create high-quality, consistent textures for 3D assets. Existing approaches
predominantly rely on UV-based inpainting to refine textures after reprojecting
the generated multi-view images onto the 3D shapes, which introduces challenges
related to topological ambiguity. To address this, we propose to bypass the
limitations of UV mapping by operating directly in a unified 3D functional
space. Specifically, we first propose that lifts texture generation into 3D
space via Texture Functions (TFs)--a continuous, volumetric representation that
maps any 3D point to a texture value based solely on surface proximity,
independent of mesh topology. Then, we propose to predict these TFs directly
from images and geometry inputs using a transformer-based Large Texturing Model
(LTM). To further enhance texture quality and leverage powerful 2D priors, we
develop an advanced LoRA-based strategy for efficiently adapting large-scale
Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for high-quality multi-view texture synthesis as
our first stage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniTEX achieves
superior visual quality and texture integrity compared to existing approaches,
offering a generalizable and scalable solution for automated 3D texture
generation. Code will available in: https://github.com/YixunLiang/UniTEX.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting have shown remarkable potential for
novel view synthesis. However, most existing large-scale scene reconstruction

partitioning and local optimization. To address these limitations, we propose
MixGS, a novel holistic optimization framework for large-scale 3D scene
reconstruction. MixGS models the entire scene holistically by integrating
camera pose and Gaussian attributes into a view-aware representation, which is
decoded into fine-detailed Gaussians. Furthermore, a novel mixing operation
combines decoded and original Gaussians to jointly preserve global coherence
and local fidelity. Extensive experiments on large-scale scenes demonstrate
that MixGS achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and competitive speed,
while significantly reducing computational requirements, enabling large-scale
scene reconstruction training on a single 24GB VRAM GPU. The code will be

Abstract: Detecting forged remote sensing images is becoming increasingly critical, as
such imagery plays a vital role in environmental monitoring, urban planning,

paradigm for image generation, their impact on remote sensing forgery detection
remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks primarily target GAN-based forgeries
or focus on natural images, limiting progress in this critical domain. To
address this gap, we introduce RSFAKE-1M, a large-scale dataset of 500K forged
and 500K real remote sensing images. The fake images are generated by ten
diffusion models fine-tuned on remote sensing data, covering six generation
conditions such as text prompts, structural guidance, and inpainting. This
paper presents the construction of RSFAKE-1M along with a comprehensive
experimental evaluation using both existing detectors and unified baselines.
The results reveal that diffusion-based remote sensing forgeries remain
challenging for current methods, and that models trained on RSFAKE-1M exhibit
notably improved generalization and robustness. Our findings underscore the
importance of RSFAKE-1M as a foundation for developing and evaluating
next-generation forgery detection approaches in the remote sensing domain. The

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) is an indispensable task in
human-centered research and has made great progress in recent years with the
development of deep neural networks. However, the potential vulnerability and
anti-interference ability have still not been fully explored. To bridge this
gap, this paper proposes the first adversarial attack and defense framework for
pedestrian attribute recognition. Specifically, we exploit both global- and
patch-level attacks on the pedestrian images, based on the pre-trained
CLIP-based PAR framework. It first divides the input pedestrian image into
non-overlapping patches and embeds them into feature embeddings using a
projection layer. Meanwhile, the attribute set is expanded into sentences using
prompts and embedded into attribute features using a pre-trained CLIP text
encoder. A multi-modal Transformer is adopted to fuse the obtained vision and
text tokens, and a feed-forward network is utilized for attribute recognition.
Based on the aforementioned PAR framework, we adopt the adversarial semantic
and label-perturbation to generate the adversarial noise, termed ASL-PAR. We
also design a semantic offset defense strategy to suppress the influence of
adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments conducted on both digital domains
(i.e., PETA, PA100K, MSP60K, RAPv2) and physical domains fully validated the
effectiveness of our proposed adversarial attack and defense strategies for the
pedestrian attribute recognition. The source code of this paper will be

Abstract: We study the task of panoptic symbol spotting, which involves identifying
both individual instances of countable things and the semantic regions of
uncountable stuff in computer-aided design (CAD) drawings composed of vector
graphical primitives. Existing methods typically rely on image rasterization,
graph construction, or point-based representation, but these approaches often
suffer from high computational costs, limited generality, and loss of geometric
structural information. In this paper, we propose VecFormer, a novel method
that addresses these challenges through line-based representation of
primitives. This design preserves the geometric continuity of the original
primitive, enabling more accurate shape representation while maintaining a
computation-friendly structure, making it well-suited for vector graphic
understanding tasks. To further enhance prediction reliability, we introduce a
Branch Fusion Refinement module that effectively integrates instance and
semantic predictions, resolving their inconsistencies for more coherent
panoptic outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method establishes
a new state-of-the-art, achieving 91.1 PQ, with Stuff-PQ improved by 9.6 and
21.2 points over the second-best results under settings with and without prior

Abstract: Visual dubbing, the synchronization of facial movements with new speech, is
crucial for making content accessible across different languages, enabling
broader global reach. However, current methods face significant limitations.
Existing approaches often generate talking faces, hindering seamless
integration into original scenes, or employ inpainting techniques that discard
vital visual information like partial occlusions and lighting variations. This
work introduces EdiDub, a novel framework that reformulates visual dubbing as a
content-aware editing task. EdiDub preserves the original video context by
utilizing a specialized conditioning scheme to ensure faithful and accurate
modifications rather than mere copying. On multiple benchmarks, including a
challenging occluded-lip dataset, EdiDub significantly improves identity
preservation and synchronization. Human evaluations further confirm its
superiority, achieving higher synchronization and visual naturalness scores
compared to the leading methods. These results demonstrate that our
content-aware editing approach outperforms traditional generation or
inpainting, particularly in maintaining complex visual elements while ensuring
accurate lip synchronization.

crucial role in the weak-to-strong consistency regularization framework, as it
enhances diversity and improves model generalization. Recent strong
augmentation methods have primarily focused on intensity-based perturbations,
which have minimal impact on the semantic masks. In contrast, spatial
augmentations like translation and rotation have long been acknowledged for
their effectiveness in supervised semantic segmentation tasks, but they are
often ignored in SSSS. In this work, we demonstrate that spatial augmentation
can also contribute to model training in SSSS, despite generating inconsistent
masks between the weak and strong augmentations. Furthermore, recognizing the
variability among images, we propose an adaptive augmentation strategy that
dynamically adjusts the augmentation for each instance based on entropy.
Extensive experiments show that our proposed Adaptive Spatial Augmentation
(\textbf{ASAug}) can be integrated as a pluggable module, consistently
improving the performance of existing methods and achieving state-of-the-art
results on benchmark datasets such as PASCAL VOC 2012, Cityscapes, and COCO.

Abstract: Image-based virtual try-on aims to fit a target garment to a specific person
image and has attracted extensive research attention because of its huge
application potential in the e-commerce and fashion industries. To generate
high-quality try-on results, accurately warping the clothing item to fit the
human body plays a significant role, as slight misalignment may lead to
unrealistic artifacts in the fitting image. Most existing methods warp the
clothing by feature matching and thin-plate spline (TPS). However, it often
fails to preserve clothing details due to self-occlusion, severe misalignment
between poses, etc. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a detail
retention virtual try-on method via accurate non-rigid registration (VITON-DRR)
for diverse human poses. Specifically, we reconstruct a human semantic
segmentation using a dual-pyramid-structured feature extractor. Then, a novel
Deformation Module is designed for extracting the cloth key points and warping
them through an accurate non-rigid registration algorithm. Finally, the Image
Synthesis Module is designed to synthesize the deformed garment image and
generate the human pose information adaptively. {Compared with} traditional
methods, the proposed VITON-DRR can make the deformation of fitting images more
accurate and retain more garment details. The experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed method performs better than state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有方法主要针对封闭的物体级3D模型，而大规模非封闭3D场景的定向问题尚未充分研究，DACPO旨在填补这一空白。

Result: 实验表明DACPO在大规模非封闭场景中表现优异，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DACPO为解决大规模点云定向问题提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Orienting point clouds is a fundamental problem in computer graphics and 3D
vision, with applications in reconstruction, segmentation, and analysis. While
significant progress has been made, existing approaches mainly focus on
watertight, object-level 3D models. The orientation of large-scale,
non-watertight 3D scenes remains an underexplored challenge. To address this
gap, we propose DACPO (Divide-And-Conquer Point Orientation), a novel framework
that leverages a divide-and-conquer strategy for scalable and robust point
cloud orientation. Rather than attempting to orient an unbounded scene at once,
DACPO segments the input point cloud into smaller, manageable blocks, processes
each block independently, and integrates the results through a global
optimization stage. For each block, we introduce a two-step process: estimating
initial normal orientations by a randomized greedy method and refining them by
an adapted iterative Poisson surface reconstruction. To achieve consistency
across blocks, we model inter-block relationships using an an undirected graph,
where nodes represent blocks and edges connect spatially adjacent blocks. To
reliably evaluate orientation consistency between adjacent blocks, we introduce
the concept of the visible connected region, which defines the region over
which visibility-based assessments are performed. The global integration is
then formulated as a 0-1 integer-constrained optimization problem, with block
flip states as binary variables. Despite the combinatorial nature of the
problem, DACPO remains scalable by limiting the number of blocks (typically a
few hundred for 3D scenes) involved in the optimization. Experiments on
benchmark datasets demonstrate DACPO's strong performance, particularly in
challenging large-scale, non-watertight scenarios where existing methods often
fail. The source code is available at https://github.com/zd-lee/DACPO.

Conclusion: TimePoint为时间序列分析提供了一个高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Fast and scalable alignment of time series is a fundamental challenge in many
domains. The standard solution, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), struggles with poor
scalability and sensitivity to noise. We introduce TimePoint, a self-supervised
method that dramatically accelerates DTW-based alignment while typically
improving alignment accuracy by learning keypoints and descriptors from
synthetic data. Inspired by 2D keypoint detection but carefully adapted to the
unique challenges of 1D signals, TimePoint leverages efficient 1D
diffeomorphisms, which effectively model nonlinear time warping, to generate
realistic training data. This approach, along with fully convolutional and
wavelet convolutional architectures, enables the extraction of informative
keypoints and descriptors. Applying DTW to these sparse representations yield
major speedups and typically higher alignment accuracy than standard DTW
applied to the full signals. TimePoint demonstrates strong generalization to
real-world time series when trained solely on synthetic data, and further
improves with fine-tuning on real data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
TimePoint consistently achieves faster and more accurate alignments than
standard DTW, making it a scalable solution for time-series analysis. Our code

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, limited external validity remains a critical
obstacle when models are deployed across unseen datasets, an issue particularly
pronounced in the ultrasound image domain. Existing solutions-such as domain
adaptation and GAN-based style transfer-while promising, often fall short in
the medical domain where datasets are typically small and diverse. This paper
presents a novel application of principal component analysis (PCA) to address
this limitation. PCA preprocessing reduces noise and emphasizes essential
features by retaining approximately 90\% of the dataset variance. We evaluate
our approach across six diverse breast tumor ultrasound datasets comprising
3,983 B-mode images and corresponding expert tumor segmentation masks. For each
dataset, a corresponding dimensionality reduced PCA-dataset is created and
U-Net-based segmentation models are trained on each of the twelve datasets.
Each model trained on an original dataset was inferenced on the remaining five
out-of-domain original datasets (baseline results), while each model trained on
a PCA dataset was inferenced on five out-of-domain PCA datasets. Our
experimental results indicate that using PCA reconstructed datasets, instead of
original images, improves the model's recall and Dice scores, particularly for
model-dataset pairs where baseline performance was lowest, achieving
statistically significant gains in recall (0.57 $\pm$ 0.07 vs. 0.70 $\pm$ 0.05,
$p = 0.0004$) and Dice scores (0.50 $\pm$ 0.06 vs. 0.58 $\pm$ 0.06, $p =
0.03$). Our method reduced the decline in recall values due to external
validation by $33\%$. These findings underscore the potential of PCA
reconstruction as a safeguard to mitigate declines in segmentation performance,
especially in challenging cases, with implications for enhancing external
validity in real-world medical applications.

Abstract: The accurate semantic segmentation of tree crowns within remotely sensed data
is crucial for scientific endeavours such as forest management, biodiversity
studies, and carbon sequestration quantification. However, precise segmentation
remains challenging due to complexities in the forest canopy, including
shadows, intricate backgrounds, scale variations, and subtle spectral
differences among tree species. Compared to the traditional methods, Deep
Learning models improve accuracy by extracting informative and discriminative
features, but often fall short in capturing the aforementioned complexities.
  To address these challenges, we propose PerceptiveNet, a novel model
incorporating a Logarithmic Gabor-parameterised convolutional layer with
trainable filter parameters, alongside a backbone that extracts salient
features while capturing extensive context and spatial information through a
wider receptive field. We investigate the impact of Log-Gabor, Gabor, and
standard convolutional layers on semantic segmentation performance through
extensive experimentation. Additionally, we conduct an ablation study to assess
the contributions of individual layers and their combinations to overall model
performance, and we evaluate PerceptiveNet as a backbone within a novel hybrid
CNN-Transformer model. Our results outperform state-of-the-art models,
demonstrating significant performance improvements on a tree crown dataset
while generalising across domains, including two benchmark aerial scene
semantic segmentation datasets with varying complexities.

Abstract: In medical image analysis, feature engineering plays an important role in the
design and performance of machine learning models. Persistent homology (PH),
from the field of topological data analysis (TDA), demonstrates robustness and
stability to data perturbations and addresses the limitation from traditional
feature extraction approaches where a small change in input results in a large
change in feature representation. Using PH, we store persistent topological and
geometrical features in the form of the persistence barcode whereby large bars
represent global topological features and small bars encapsulate geometrical
information of the data. When multiple barcodes are computed from 2D or 3D
medical images, two approaches can be used to construct the final topological
feature vector in each dimension: aggregating persistence barcodes followed by
featurization or concatenating topological feature vectors derived from each
barcode. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis across diverse
medical imaging datasets to compare the effects of the two aforementioned
approaches on the performance of classification models. The results of this
analysis indicate that feature concatenation preserves detailed topological
information from individual barcodes, yields better classification performance
and is therefore a preferred approach when conducting similar experiments.

Abstract: We introduce SLIMP (Skin Lesion Image-Metadata Pre-training) for learning
rich representations of skin lesions through a novel nested contrastive
learning approach that captures complex relationships between images and
metadata. Melanoma detection and skin lesion classification based solely on
images, pose significant challenges due to large variations in imaging
conditions (lighting, color, resolution, distance, etc.) and lack of clinical
and phenotypical context. Clinicians typically follow a holistic approach for
assessing the risk level of the patient and for deciding which lesions may be
malignant and need to be excised, by considering the patient's medical history
as well as the appearance of other lesions of the patient. Inspired by this,
SLIMP combines the appearance and the metadata of individual skin lesions with
patient-level metadata relating to their medical record and other clinically
relevant information. By fully exploiting all available data modalities
throughout the learning process, the proposed pre-training strategy improves
performance compared to other pre-training strategies on downstream skin
lesions classification tasks highlighting the learned representations quality.

Abstract: We introduce AnySplat, a feed forward network for novel view synthesis from

corresponding camera intrinsics and extrinsics for each input image. This
unified design scales effortlessly to casually captured, multi view datasets
without any pose annotations. In extensive zero shot evaluations, AnySplat
matches the quality of pose aware baselines in both sparse and dense view
scenarios while surpassing existing pose free approaches. Moreover, it greatly
reduce rendering latency compared to optimization based neural fields, bringing

Abstract: Image vectorization is a powerful technique that converts raster images into
vector graphics, enabling enhanced flexibility and interactivity. However,
popular image vectorization tools struggle with occluded regions, producing
incomplete or fragmented shapes that hinder editability. While recent
advancements have explored rule-based and data-driven layer-wise image
vectorization, these methods face limitations in vectorization quality and
flexibility. In this paper, we introduce LayerPeeler, a novel layer-wise image
vectorization approach that addresses these challenges through a progressive
simplification paradigm. The key to LayerPeeler's success lies in its
autoregressive peeling strategy: by identifying and removing the topmost
non-occluded layers while recovering underlying content, we generate vector
graphics with complete paths and coherent layer structures. Our method
leverages vision-language models to construct a layer graph that captures
occlusion relationships among elements, enabling precise detection and
description for non-occluded layers. These descriptive captions are used as
editing instructions for a finetuned image diffusion model to remove the
identified layers. To ensure accurate removal, we employ localized attention
control that precisely guides the model to target regions while faithfully
preserving the surrounding content. To support this, we contribute a
large-scale dataset specifically designed for layer peeling tasks. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that LayerPeeler
significantly outperforms existing techniques, producing vectorization results
with superior path semantics, geometric regularity, and visual fidelity.

However, existing regression-based models often minimize pixel errors and
result in oversmoothing of low-light photos or deep shadows. Recent work has
attempted to address this limitation by training a diffusion model from
scratch, yet those models still struggle to recover sharp image details and
accurate colors. We introduce a novel framework to enhance low-light raw images
by retasking pre-trained generative diffusion models with the camera ISP.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art in perceptual quality across three challenging low-light raw
image benchmarks.

Abstract: We revisit scene-level 3D object detection as the output of an object-centric
framework capable of both localization and mapping using 3D oriented boxes as
the underlying geometric primitive. While existing 3D object detection
approaches operate globally and implicitly rely on the a priori existence of
metric camera poses, our method, Rooms from Motion (RfM) operates on a
collection of un-posed images. By replacing the standard 2D keypoint-based
matcher of structure-from-motion with an object-centric matcher based on
image-derived 3D boxes, we estimate metric camera poses, object tracks, and
finally produce a global, semantic 3D object map. When a priori pose is
available, we can significantly improve map quality through optimization of
global 3D boxes against individual observations. RfM shows strong localization
performance and subsequently produces maps of higher quality than leading
point-based and multi-view 3D object detection methods on CA-1M and ScanNet++,
despite these global methods relying on overparameterization through point
clouds or dense volumes. Rooms from Motion achieves a general, object-centric
representation which not only extends the work of Cubify Anything to full
scenes but also allows for inherently sparse localization and parametric
mapping proportional to the number of objects in a scene.

Abstract: As sketch research has collectively matured over time, its adaptation for
at-mass commercialisation emerges on the immediate horizon. Despite an already
mature research endeavour for photos, there is no research on the efficient
inference specifically designed for sketch data. In this paper, we first
demonstrate existing state-of-the-art efficient light-weight models designed
for photos do not work on sketches. We then propose two sketch-specific
components which work in a plug-n-play manner on any photo efficient network to
adapt them to work on sketch data. We specifically chose fine-grained
sketch-based image retrieval (FG-SBIR) as a demonstrator as the most recognised
sketch problem with immediate commercial value. Technically speaking, we first
propose a cross-modal knowledge distillation network to transfer existing photo
efficient networks to be compatible with sketch, which brings down number of
FLOPs and model parameters by 97.96% percent and 84.89% respectively. We then
exploit the abstract trait of sketch to introduce a RL-based canvas selector
that dynamically adjusts to the abstraction level which further cuts down
number of FLOPs by two thirds. The end result is an overall reduction of 99.37%
of FLOPs (from 40.18G to 0.254G) when compared with a full network, while
retaining the accuracy (33.03% vs 32.77%) -- finally making an efficient
network for the sparse sketch data that exhibit even fewer FLOPs than the best
photo counterpart.

fastMRI dataset and the 0.3T M4Raw dataset, with the goal of generating brain
T1, T2, and FLAIR images across different magnetic field strengths. The
performance of the fine-tuned model was evaluated using quantitative
metrics,including Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and Multi-Scale Structural
Similarity (MS-SSIM), showing improvements in image quality and semantic
consistency with the text prompts. To further evaluate the model's potential, a
simple classification task was carried out using a small 0.35T MRI dataset,
demonstrating that the synthetic images generated by the fine-tuned SD model
can effectively augment training datasets and improve the performance of MRI
constrast classification tasks. Overall, our findings suggest that
text-prompted MRI image generation is feasible and can serve as a useful tool
for medical AI applications.

TL;DR: MAC-Gaze提出了一种基于IMU传感器和持续学习技术的动态校准方法，显著提升了移动场景下的视线跟踪精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的一次性校准方法无法适应动态姿势变化，导致性能下降。MAC-Gaze旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 结合预训练视线估计器和IMU活动识别模型，采用聚类决策机制触发校准，并使用持续学习避免灾难性遗忘。

Result: 在RGBDGaze和MotionGaze数据集上，视线估计误差分别降低了19.9%和31.7%。

Conclusion: MAC-Gaze为移动场景下的视线跟踪提供了鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Mobile gaze tracking faces a fundamental challenge: maintaining accuracy as
users naturally change their postures and device orientations. Traditional
calibration approaches, like one-off, fail to adapt to these dynamic
conditions, leading to degraded performance over time. We present MAC-Gaze, a
Motion-Aware continual Calibration approach that leverages smartphone Inertial
measurement unit (IMU) sensors and continual learning techniques to
automatically detect changes in user motion states and update the gaze tracking
model accordingly. Our system integrates a pre-trained visual gaze estimator
and an IMU-based activity recognition model with a clustering-based hybrid
decision-making mechanism that triggers recalibration when motion patterns
deviate significantly from previously encountered states. To enable
accumulative learning of new motion conditions while mitigating catastrophic
forgetting, we employ replay-based continual learning, allowing the model to
maintain performance across previously encountered motion conditions. We
evaluate our system through extensive experiments on the publicly available
RGBDGaze dataset and our own 10-hour multimodal MotionGaze dataset (481K+
images, 800K+ IMU readings), encompassing a wide range of postures under
various motion conditions including sitting, standing, lying, and walking.
Results demonstrate that our method reduces gaze estimation error by 19.9% on
RGBDGaze (from 1.73 cm to 1.41 cm) and by 31.7% on MotionGaze (from 2.81 cm to
1.92 cm) compared to traditional calibration approaches. Our framework provides
a robust solution for maintaining gaze estimation accuracy in mobile scenarios.

Conclusion: 该方法为机器人导航提供了一种高效且无需额外训练的异常检测解决方案。

Abstract: In order to navigate safely and reliably in off-road and unstructured
environments, robots must detect anomalies that are out-of-distribution (OOD)
with respect to the training data. We present an analysis-by-synthesis approach
for pixel-wise anomaly detection without making any assumptions about the
nature of OOD data. Given an input image, we use a generative diffusion model
to synthesize an edited image that removes anomalies while keeping the
remaining image unchanged. Then, we formulate anomaly detection as analyzing
which image segments were modified by the diffusion model. We propose a novel
inference approach for guided diffusion by analyzing the ideal guidance
gradient and deriving a principled approximation that bootstraps the diffusion
model to predict guidance gradients. Our editing technique is purely test-time
that can be integrated into existing workflows without the need for retraining
or fine-tuning. Finally, we use a combination of vision-language foundation
models to compare pixels in a learned feature space and detect semantically
meaningful edits, enabling accurate anomaly detection for off-road navigation.

Motivation: 现有方法使用自监督音频模型作为编码器，但音素相似音节在特征空间中容易耦合，导致唇形生成的平均效应。

Method: 提出Wav2Sem模块，通过提取音频序列的语义特征来解耦音频编码，生成更具表现力的音频特征。

Result: 实验表明，Wav2Sem模块有效解耦音频特征，显著减轻了音素相似音节在唇形生成中的平均效应。

Conclusion: Wav2Sem模块提升了语音驱动面部动画的精确性和自然度。

Abstract: In 3D speech-driven facial animation generation, existing methods commonly
employ pre-trained self-supervised audio models as encoders. However, due to
the prevalence of phonetically similar syllables with distinct lip shapes in
language, these near-homophone syllables tend to exhibit significant coupling
in self-supervised audio feature spaces, leading to the averaging effect in
subsequent lip motion generation. To address this issue, this paper proposes a
plug-and-play semantic decorrelation module-Wav2Sem. This module extracts
semantic features corresponding to the entire audio sequence, leveraging the
added semantic information to decorrelate audio encodings within the feature
space, thereby achieving more expressive audio features. Extensive experiments
across multiple Speech-driven models indicate that the Wav2Sem module
effectively decouples audio features, significantly alleviating the averaging
effect of phonetically similar syllables in lip shape generation, thereby
enhancing the precision and naturalness of facial animations. Our source code

Abstract: Virtual human animations have a wide range of applications in virtual and

humans have been developed, assessing their quality remains challenging.
Recently, approaches introducing task-oriented evaluation metrics have been
proposed, leveraging neural network training. However, quality assessment
measures for animated virtual humans that are not generated with parametric
body models have yet to be developed. In this context, we introduce a first
such quality assessment measure leveraging a novel data-driven framework.
First, we generate a dataset of virtual human animations together with their
corresponding subjective realism evaluation scores collected with a user study.
Second, we use the resulting dataset to learn predicting perceptual evaluation
scores. Results indicate that training a linear regressor on our dataset

Method: 使用SAM编码器提取正常数据的图像特征并存储在记忆库中，推理时通过比较输入图像与记忆库的特征生成异常图，最后通过计算异常图的重心提示SAM解码器进行分割。

Conclusion: MIAS-SAM提供了一种无需阈值定义的自动化异常分割方法，在多种医学图像模态中表现优异。

Abstract: This paper presents MIAS-SAM, a novel approach for the segmentation of
anomalous regions in medical images. MIAS-SAM uses a patch-based memory bank to
store relevant image features, which are extracted from normal data using the
SAM encoder. At inference time, the embedding patches extracted from the SAM
encoder are compared with those in the memory bank to obtain the anomaly map.
Finally, MIAS-SAM computes the center of gravity of the anomaly map to prompt
the SAM decoder, obtaining an accurate segmentation from the previously
extracted features. Differently from prior works, MIAS-SAM does not require to
define a threshold value to obtain the segmentation from the anomaly map.
Experimental results conducted on three publicly available datasets, each with

Abstract: Median filtering is a cornerstone of computational image processing. It
provides an effective means of image smoothing, with minimal blurring or
softening of edges, invariance to monotonic transformations such as gamma
adjustment, and robustness to noise and outliers. However, known algorithms
have all suffered from practical limitations: the bit depth of the image data,
the size of the filter kernel, or the kernel shape itself. Square-kernel
implementations tend to produce streaky cross-hatching artifacts, and nearly
all known efficient algorithms are in practice limited to square kernels. We
present for the first time a method that overcomes all of these limitations.
Our method operates efficiently on arbitrary bit-depth data, arbitrary kernel
sizes, and arbitrary convex kernel shapes, including circular shapes.

Result: 实验表明，iHDR在灵活输入数量的情况下优于现有HDR去重影方法。

Conclusion: iHDR提供了一种灵活且高效的HDR成像解决方案。

Abstract: High dynamic range (HDR) imaging aims to obtain a high-quality HDR image by
fusing information from multiple low dynamic range (LDR) images. Numerous
learning-based HDR imaging methods have been proposed to achieve this for
static and dynamic scenes. However, their architectures are mostly tailored for
a fixed number (e.g., three) of inputs and, therefore, cannot apply directly to
situations beyond the pre-defined limited scope. To address this issue, we
propose a novel framework, iHDR, for iterative fusion, which comprises a
ghost-free Dual-input HDR fusion network (DiHDR) and a physics-based domain
mapping network (ToneNet). DiHDR leverages a pair of inputs to estimate an
intermediate HDR image, while ToneNet maps it back to the nonlinear domain and
serves as the reference input for the next pairwise fusion. This process is
iteratively executed until all input frames are utilized. Qualitative and
quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method
as compared to existing state-of-the-art HDR deghosting approaches given
flexible numbers of input frames.

Method: 提出PAN-Crafter框架，包括模态自适应重建（MARs）和跨模态对齐注意力机制（CM3A），联合重建HRMS和PAN图像。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，推理速度快50.11倍，内存占用减少0.63倍，且在不同卫星数据集上泛化能力强。

Conclusion: PAN-Crafter通过模态对齐和自适应重建，显著提升了图像融合的质量和效率。

Abstract: PAN-sharpening aims to fuse high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) images with
low-resolution multi-spectral (MS) images to generate high-resolution
multi-spectral (HRMS) outputs. However, cross-modality misalignment -- caused
by sensor placement, acquisition timing, and resolution disparity -- induces a
fundamental challenge. Conventional deep learning methods assume perfect
pixel-wise alignment and rely on per-pixel reconstruction losses, leading to
spectral distortion, double edges, and blurring when misalignment is present.
To address this, we propose PAN-Crafter, a modality-consistent alignment
framework that explicitly mitigates the misalignment gap between PAN and MS
modalities. At its core, Modality-Adaptive Reconstruction (MARs) enables a
single network to jointly reconstruct HRMS and PAN images, leveraging PAN's
high-frequency details as auxiliary self-supervision. Additionally, we
introduce Cross-Modality Alignment-Aware Attention (CM3A), a novel mechanism
that bidirectionally aligns MS texture to PAN structure and vice versa,
enabling adaptive feature refinement across modalities. Extensive experiments
on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our PAN-Crafter outperforms the
most recent state-of-the-art method in all metrics, even with 50.11$\times$
faster inference time and 0.63$\times$ the memory size. Furthermore, it
demonstrates strong generalization performance on unseen satellite datasets,
showing its robustness across different conditions.

Result: 在三个真实测试集上，平均IoU提升23个百分点，DESIGN-R尺寸估计准确率从71%提升至94%。

Conclusion: 该方法仅需少量标注即可实现高效泛化，为临床伤口评分自动化提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate wound segmentation is essential for automated DESIGN-R
scoring. However, existing models such as FUSegNet, which are trained primarily
on foot ulcer datasets, often fail to generalize to wounds on other body sites.
  Methods: We propose an annotation-efficient pipeline that combines a
lightweight YOLOv11n-based detector with the pre-trained FUSegNet segmentation
model. Instead of relying on pixel-level annotations or retraining for new
anatomical regions, our method achieves robust performance using only 500
manually labeled bounding boxes. This zero fine-tuning approach effectively
bridges the domain gap and enables direct deployment across diverse wound
types. This is an advance not previously demonstrated in the wound segmentation
literature.
  Results: Evaluated on three real-world test sets spanning foot, sacral, and
trochanter wounds, our YOLO plus FUSegNet pipeline improved mean IoU by 23
percentage points over vanilla FUSegNet and increased end-to-end DESIGN-R size
estimation accuracy from 71 percent to 94 percent (see Table 3 for details).
  Conclusion: Our pipeline generalizes effectively across body sites without
task-specific fine-tuning, demonstrating that minimal supervision, with 500
annotated ROIs, is sufficient for scalable, annotation-light wound
segmentation. This capability paves the way for real-world DESIGN-R automation,
reducing reliance on pixel-wise labeling, streamlining documentation workflows,
and supporting objective and consistent wound scoring in clinical practice. We
will publicly release the trained detector weights and configuration to promote
reproducibility and facilitate downstream deployment.

Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) offers near-atomic resolution imaging of
macromolecules, but developing robust models for downstream analysis is
hindered by the scarcity of high-quality annotated data. While synthetic data
generation has emerged as a potential solution, existing methods often fail to
capture both the structural diversity of biological specimens and the complex,
spatially varying noise inherent in cryo-EM imaging. To overcome these
limitations, we propose CryoCCD, a synthesis framework that integrates
biophysical modeling with generative techniques. Specifically, CryoCCD produces
multi-scale cryo-EM micrographs that reflect realistic biophysical variability
through compositional heterogeneity, cellular context, and physics-informed
imaging. To generate realistic noise, we employ a conditional diffusion model,
enhanced by cycle consistency to preserve structural fidelity and mask-aware
contrastive learning to capture spatially adaptive noise patterns. Extensive
experiments show that CryoCCD generates structurally accurate micrographs and
enhances performance in downstream tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art
baselines in both particle picking and reconstruction.

Human-activities sphere) and cross-spheres with one hundred expert-curated
evaluation dimensions. Leveraging observational data from satellite sensors and
in-situ measurements, OmniEarth-Bench integrates 29,779 annotations across four
tiers: perception, general reasoning, scientific knowledge reasoning and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. This involves the efforts of 2-5 experts per
sphere to establish authoritative evaluation dimensions and curate relevant
observational datasets, 40 crowd-sourcing annotators to assist experts for
annotations, and finally, OmniEarth-Bench is validated via hybrid expert-crowd
workflows to reduce label ambiguity. Experiments on 9 state-of-the-art MLLMs
reveal that even the most advanced models struggle with our benchmarks, where
none of them reach 35\% accuracy. Especially, in some cross-spheres tasks, the

practical applications in environmental monitoring and disaster prediction. The

benefit from a large algorithmic infrastructure for downstream tasks.
Triangles, unlike full-rank Gaussian kernels, naturally combine to form

optimization, encouraging explicit, but soft, surface continuity in 3D. We

Abstract: Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) is a promising tomographic technique for
visualizing the spatio-temporal distribution of superparamagnetic
nanoparticles, with applications ranging from cancer detection to real-time
cardiovascular monitoring. Traditional MPI reconstruction relies on either
time-consuming calibration (measured system matrix) or model-based simulation
of the forward operator. Recent developments have shown the applicability of
Chebyshev polynomials to multi-dimensional Lissajous Field-Free Point (FFP)
scans. This method is bound to the particular choice of sinusoidal scanning
trajectories. In this paper, we present the first reconstruction on real 2D MPI
data with a trajectory-independent model-based MPI reconstruction algorithm. We
further develop the zero-shot Plug-and-Play (PnP) algorithm of the authors --
with automatic noise level estimation -- to address the present deconvolution

without retraining on MPI-specific data. We evaluate our method on the publicly

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确预测非小细胞肺癌（NSCLC）的免疫治疗反应是一个关键需求，现有模型无法捕捉治疗引起的复杂形态变化。

Method: 提出ImmunoDiff模型，结合解剖先验和临床数据（如人口统计、生物标志物），通过cbi-Adapter模块实现多模态数据一致集成。

Result: 在NSCLC队列中，模型将反应预测的平衡准确率提高了21.24%，生存预测的c指数提高了0.03。

Conclusion: ImmunoDiff通过结合解剖和临床数据，显著提升了免疫治疗预测的准确性。

Abstract: Accurately predicting immunotherapy response in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
(NSCLC) remains a critical unmet need. Existing radiomics and deep
learning-based predictive models rely primarily on pre-treatment imaging to
predict categorical response outcomes, limiting their ability to capture the
complex morphological and textural transformations induced by immunotherapy.
This study introduces ImmunoDiff, an anatomy-aware diffusion model designed to
synthesize post-treatment CT scans from baseline imaging while incorporating
clinically relevant constraints. The proposed framework integrates anatomical
priors, specifically lobar and vascular structures, to enhance fidelity in CT
synthesis. Additionally, we introduce a novel cbi-Adapter, a conditioning
module that ensures pairwise-consistent multimodal integration of imaging and
clinical data embeddings, to refine the generative process. Additionally, a
clinical variable conditioning mechanism is introduced, leveraging demographic
data, blood-based biomarkers, and PD-L1 expression to refine the generative
process. Evaluations on an in-house NSCLC cohort treated with immune checkpoint
inhibitors demonstrate a 21.24% improvement in balanced accuracy for response
prediction and a 0.03 increase in c-index for survival prediction. Code will be
released soon.

Motivation: LLM因保守的安全对齐策略常对无害查询过度拒绝，影响用户体验，需有效方法生成多样化拒绝诱导指令。

Method: 采用进化算法，通过突变和重组策略优化种子指令，最大化LLM拒绝概率的证据下界。

Result: 创建了两个数据集：EVOREFUSE-TEST（性能优于现有基准）和EVOREFUSE-ALIGN（用于对齐训练），显著减少过度拒绝。

Conclusion: EVOREFUSE有效提升LLM拒绝指令的多样性和性能，同时揭示模型过度关注敏感关键词的问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently refuse to respond to pseudo-malicious
instructions: semantically harmless input queries triggering unnecessary LLM
refusals due to conservative safety alignment, significantly impairing user
experience. Collecting such instructions is crucial for evaluating and
mitigating over-refusals, but existing instruction curation methods, like
manual creation or instruction rewriting, either lack scalability or fail to
produce sufficiently diverse and effective refusal-inducing prompts. To address
these limitations, we introduce EVOREFUSE, a prompt optimization approach that
generates diverse pseudo-malicious instructions consistently eliciting
confident refusals across LLMs. EVOREFUSE employs an evolutionary algorithm
exploring the instruction space in more diverse directions than existing
methods via mutation strategies and recombination, and iteratively evolves seed
instructions to maximize evidence lower bound on LLM refusal probability. Using
EVOREFUSE, we create two novel datasets: EVOREFUSE-TEST, a benchmark of 582
pseudo-malicious instructions that outperforms the next-best benchmark with
140.41% higher average refusal triggering rate across 9 LLMs, 34.86% greater
lexical diversity, and 40.03% improved LLM response confidence scores; and
EVOREFUSE-ALIGN, which provides 3,000 pseudo-malicious instructions with
responses for supervised and preference-based alignment training.
LLAMA3.1-8B-INSTRUCT supervisedly fine-tuned on EVOREFUSE-ALIGN achieves up to
14.31% fewer over-refusals than models trained on the second-best alignment
dataset, without compromising safety. Our analysis with EVOREFUSE-TEST reveals
models trigger over-refusals by overly focusing on sensitive keywords while
ignoring broader context.

Motivation: 数学推理任务是评估LLM推理能力的重要基准，但现有方法（如GRPO）仅通过准确性指标难以细粒度评估能力。需要分解问题解决过程以更深入理解RL的作用和局限性。

Method: 将问题解决分解为规划（Plan）、执行（Execute）和验证（Verify）三个基本能力，并通过实验和合成任务分析RL对各能力的影响。

Result: RL主要提升执行能力（温度蒸馏现象），但对新问题的规划能力不足（覆盖墙）。合成任务验证了RL的局限性，并提出了改进探索和泛化的条件。

Conclusion: RL在提升LLM推理能力中作用有限，需改进探索和泛化以克服覆盖墙。研究为RL在LLM中的应用提供了新见解。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning tasks have become prominent benchmarks for assessing
the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, especially with reinforcement learning (RL)
methods such as GRPO showing significant performance gains. However, accuracy
metrics alone do not support fine-grained assessment of capabilities and fail
to reveal which problem-solving skills have been internalized. To better
understand these capabilities, we propose to decompose problem solving into
fundamental capabilities: Plan (mapping questions to sequences of steps),
Execute (correctly performing solution steps), and Verify (identifying the
correctness of a solution). Empirically, we find that GRPO mainly enhances the
execution skill-improving execution robustness on problems the model already
knows how to solve-a phenomenon we call temperature distillation. More
importantly, we show that RL-trained models struggle with fundamentally new
problems, hitting a 'coverage wall' due to insufficient planning skills. To
explore RL's impact more deeply, we construct a minimal, synthetic
solution-tree navigation task as an analogy for mathematical problem-solving.
This controlled setup replicates our empirical findings, confirming RL
primarily boosts execution robustness. Importantly, in this setting, we
identify conditions under which RL can potentially overcome the coverage wall
through improved exploration and generalization to new solution paths. Our
findings provide insights into the role of RL in enhancing LLM reasoning,
expose key limitations, and suggest a path toward overcoming these barriers.

Motivation: 当前AI系统无法自主持续改进，限制了AI发展速度。DGM旨在通过自我修改和实证验证实现自动化改进，加速AI发展。

Method: DGM通过迭代修改自身代码并验证每次改进，采用达尔文进化思想，利用基础模型生成多样化的编码代理，并行探索搜索空间。

Result: DGM在SWE-bench和Polyglot上的性能分别从20.0%提升至50.0%和14.2%提升至30.7%，显著优于无自我改进的基线。

Conclusion: DGM是迈向自我改进AI的重要一步，能够通过开放探索实现持续创新。

Abstract: Today's AI systems have human-designed, fixed architectures and cannot
autonomously and continuously improve themselves. The advance of AI could
itself be automated. If done safely, that would accelerate AI development and
allow us to reap its benefits much sooner. Meta-learning can automate the
discovery of novel algorithms, but is limited by first-order improvements and
the human design of a suitable search space. The G\"odel machine proposed a
theoretical alternative: a self-improving AI that repeatedly modifies itself in
a provably beneficial manner. Unfortunately, proving that most changes are net
beneficial is impossible in practice. We introduce the Darwin G\"odel Machine
(DGM), a self-improving system that iteratively modifies its own code (thereby
also improving its ability to modify its own codebase) and empirically
validates each change using coding benchmarks. Inspired by Darwinian evolution
and open-endedness research, the DGM maintains an archive of generated coding
agents. It grows the archive by sampling an agent from it and using a
foundation model to create a new, interesting, version of the sampled agent.
This open-ended exploration forms a growing tree of diverse, high-quality
agents and allows the parallel exploration of many different paths through the
search space. Empirically, the DGM automatically improves its coding
capabilities (e.g., better code editing tools, long-context window management,
peer-review mechanisms), increasing performance on SWE-bench from 20.0% to
50.0%, and on Polyglot from 14.2% to 30.7%. Furthermore, the DGM significantly
outperforms baselines without self-improvement or open-ended exploration. All
experiments were done with safety precautions (e.g., sandboxing, human
oversight). The DGM is a significant step toward self-improving AI, capable of
gathering its own stepping stones along paths that unfold into endless
innovation.

Abstract: The remarkable growth in large language model (LLM) capabilities has spurred
exploration into multi-agent systems, with debate frameworks emerging as a
promising avenue for enhanced problem-solving. These multi-agent debate (MAD)
approaches, where agents collaboratively present, critique, and refine
arguments, potentially offer improved reasoning, robustness, and diverse
perspectives over monolithic models. Despite prior studies leveraging MAD, a
systematic understanding of its effectiveness compared to self-agent methods,
particularly under varying conditions, remains elusive. This paper seeks to
fill this gap by conceptualizing MAD as a test-time computational scaling
technique, distinguished by collaborative refinement and diverse exploration
capabilities. We conduct a comprehensive empirical investigation comparing MAD
with strong self-agent test-time scaling baselines on mathematical reasoning
and safety-related tasks. Our study systematically examines the influence of
task difficulty, model scale, and agent diversity on MAD's performance. Key
findings reveal that, for mathematical reasoning, MAD offers limited advantages
over self-agent scaling but becomes more effective with increased problem
difficulty and decreased model capability, while agent diversity shows little
benefit. Conversely, for safety tasks, MAD's collaborative refinement can
increase vulnerability, but incorporating diverse agent configurations
facilitates a gradual reduction in attack success through the collaborative
refinement process. We believe our findings provide critical guidance for the
future development of more effective and strategically deployed MAD systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
substantial progress in reasoning capabilities, such as DeepSeek-R1, which
leverages rule-based reinforcement learning to enhance logical reasoning
significantly. However, extending these achievements to multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) presents critical challenges, which are frequently more
pronounced for Multimodal Small Language Models (MSLMs) given their typically
weaker foundational reasoning abilities: (1) the scarcity of high-quality
multimodal reasoning datasets, (2) the degradation of reasoning capabilities
due to the integration of visual processing, and (3) the risk that direct
application of reinforcement learning may produce complex yet incorrect
reasoning processes. To address these challenges, we design a novel framework
Infi-MMR to systematically unlock the reasoning potential of MSLMs through a
curriculum of three carefully structured phases and propose our multimodal
reasoning model Infi-MMR-3B. The first phase, Foundational Reasoning
Activation, leverages high-quality textual reasoning datasets to activate and
strengthen the model's logical reasoning capabilities. The second phase,
Cross-Modal Reasoning Adaptation, utilizes caption-augmented multimodal data to
facilitate the progressive transfer of reasoning skills to multimodal contexts.
The third phase, Multimodal Reasoning Enhancement, employs curated,
caption-free multimodal data to mitigate linguistic biases and promote robust
cross-modal reasoning. Infi-MMR-3B achieves both state-of-the-art multimodal
math reasoning ability (43.68% on MathVerse testmini, 27.04% on MathVision

Abstract: The rapid advancement of reasoning capabilities in large language models
(LLMs) has led to notable improvements on mathematical benchmarks. However,
many of the most commonly used evaluation datasets (e.g., AIME 2024) are widely
available online, making it difficult to disentangle genuine reasoning from
potential memorization. Furthermore, these benchmarks do not evaluate
proof-writing capabilities, which are crucial for many mathematical tasks. To
address this, we introduce MathArena, a new benchmark based on the following
key insight: recurring math competitions provide a stream of high-quality,
challenging problems that can be used for real-time evaluation of LLMs. By
evaluating models as soon as new problems are released, we effectively
eliminate the risk of contamination. Using this framework, we find strong signs
of contamination in AIME 2024. Nonetheless, evaluations on harder competitions,
such as SMT 2025 -- published well after model release dates -- demonstrate
impressive reasoning capabilities in top-performing models. MathArena is also
the first benchmark for proof-writing capabilities. On USAMO 2025, even top
models score below 25%, far behind their performance on final-answer tasks. So
far, we have evaluated 30 models across five competitions, totaling 149
problems. As an evolving benchmark, MathArena will continue to track the
progress of LLMs on newly released competitions, ensuring rigorous and
up-to-date evaluation of mathematical reasoning.

Conclusion: Socratic-PRMBench可作为系统性评估PRMs的测试平台，推动未来PRMs的发展。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) are crucial in complex reasoning and
problem-solving tasks (e.g., LLM agents with long-horizon decision-making) by
verifying the correctness of each intermediate reasoning step. In real-world
scenarios, LLMs may apply various reasoning patterns (e.g., decomposition) to
solve a problem, potentially suffering from errors under various reasoning
patterns. Therefore, PRMs are required to identify errors under various
reasoning patterns during the reasoning process. However, existing benchmarks
mainly focus on evaluating PRMs with stepwise correctness, ignoring a
systematic evaluation of PRMs under various reasoning patterns. To mitigate
this gap, we introduce Socratic-PRMBench, a new benchmark to evaluate PRMs
systematically under six reasoning patterns, including Transformation,
Decomposition, Regather, Deduction, Verification, and Integration.
Socratic-PRMBench}comprises 2995 reasoning paths with flaws within the
aforementioned six reasoning patterns. Through our experiments on both PRMs and
LLMs prompted as critic models, we identify notable deficiencies in existing
PRMs. These observations underscore the significant weakness of current PRMs in
conducting evaluations on reasoning steps under various reasoning patterns. We
hope Socratic-PRMBench can serve as a comprehensive testbed for systematic
evaluation of PRMs under diverse reasoning patterns and pave the way for future
development of PRMs.

Abstract: Autonomous agentic AI systems powered by vision-language models (VLMs) are
rapidly advancing toward real-world deployment, yet their cross-modal reasoning
capabilities introduce new attack surfaces for adversarial manipulation that
exploit semantic reasoning across modalities. Existing adversarial attacks
typically rely on visible pixel perturbations or require privileged model or
environment access, making them impractical for stealthy, real-world
exploitation. We introduce TRAP, a generative adversarial framework that
manipulates the agent's decision-making using diffusion-based semantic
injections. Our method combines negative prompt-based degradation with positive
semantic optimization, guided by a Siamese semantic network and layout-aware
spatial masking. Without requiring access to model internals, TRAP produces
visually natural images yet induces consistent selection biases in agentic AI
systems. We evaluate TRAP on the Microsoft Common Objects in Context (COCO)
dataset, building multi-candidate decision scenarios. Across these scenarios,
TRAP achieves a 100% attack success rate on leading models, including
LLaVA-34B, Gemma3, and Mistral-3.1, significantly outperforming baselines such
as SPSA, Bandit, and standard diffusion approaches. These results expose a
critical vulnerability: Autonomous agents can be consistently misled through
human-imperceptible cross-modal manipulations. These findings highlight the
need for defense strategies beyond pixel-level robustness to address semantic
vulnerabilities in cross-modal decision-making.

Abstract: As AI models are deployed with increasing autonomy, it is important to ensure
they do not take harmful actions unnoticed. As a potential mitigation, we
investigate Chain-of-Thought (CoT) monitoring, wherein a weaker trusted monitor
model continuously oversees the intermediate reasoning steps of a more powerful
but untrusted model. We compare CoT monitoring to action-only monitoring, where
only final outputs are reviewed, in a red-teaming setup where the untrusted
model is instructed to pursue harmful side tasks while completing a coding
problem. We find that CoT monitoring improves detection by up to 27 percentage
points in scenarios where action-only monitoring fails to reliably identify
sabotage. However, CoT traces can also contain misleading rationalizations that
deceive the monitor, reducing performance in more obvious sabotage cases. To
address this, we introduce a hybrid protocol that independently scores both
reasoning and final outputs and combines them using a weighted average. This
hybrid monitor consistently outperforms both CoT and action-only monitors
across all tested models and tasks, with detection rates over four times higher
than action-only monitoring for subtle deception scenarios.

Abstract: Tables are a fundamental structure for organizing and analyzing data, making

While large language models (LMs) demonstrate strong general reasoning

formulas provide a powerful and expressive medium for representing executable
symbolic operations, encoding rich reasoning patterns that remain largely
underutilized. In this paper, we propose Formula Tuning (Fortune), a
reinforcement learning (RL) framework that trains LMs to generate executable
spreadsheet formulas for question answering over general tabular data. Formula
Tuning reduces the reliance on supervised formula annotations by using binary
answer correctness as a reward signal, guiding the model to learn formula
derivation through reasoning. We provide a theoretical analysis of its
advantages and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments on
seven table reasoning benchmarks. Formula Tuning substantially enhances LM
performance, particularly on multi-step numerical and symbolic reasoning tasks,
enabling a 7B model to outperform O1 on table understanding. This highlights
the potential of formula-driven RL to advance symbolic table reasoning in LMs.

To bridge the NL and FL input format gap, we propose the *NL-FL Problem
Alignment* method, which reformulates the Question-Answering (QA) problems in
NL as existence theorems in FL. Subsequently, the *Mixed Problem Input*
technique we provide enables the FL reasoner to handle both QA and existence
problems concurrently. Lastly, we mitigate the NL and FL output format gap in
reasoning through an LLM-based *Answer Extraction* mechanism. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that the **HybridReasoning** framework achieves
**89.80%** and **84.34%** accuracy rates on the MATH-500 and the AMC
benchmarks, surpassing the NL baseline by 4.60% and 4.82%, respectively.
Notably, some problems resolved by our framework remain unsolved by the NL
baseline model even under a larger number of trials.

Motivation: 探索LLMs作为动态知识载体的新视角，结合神经科学和AI理论，研究对话模式、微调影响及人机认知协同增强。

Method: 理论分析与实验结合，基于与ChatGPT-4的持续互动，研究对话模式、微调效果及人机协同。

Result: 提出“协同增强”概念，为理解AI系统中的交互、表征和代理提供新视角。

Conclusion: LLMs作为动态知识实例的框架为AI研究提供了新的理解维度，尤其在交互和认知增强方面。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically analysed through architectural,
behavioural, or training-data lenses. This article offers a theoretical and
experiential re-framing: LLMs as dynamic instantiations of Collective human
Knowledge (CK), where intelligence is evoked through dialogue rather than
stored statically. Drawing on concepts from neuroscience and AI, and grounded
in sustained interaction with ChatGPT-4, I examine emergent dialogue patterns,
the implications of fine-tuning, and the notion of co-augmentation: mutual
enhancement between human and machine cognition. This perspective offers a new
lens for understanding interaction, representation, and agency in contemporary
AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业数据通常被隔离和保护，但LLM在微调后可能破坏访问控制。论文旨在解决这一问题，确保LLM生成响应时遵守组织的数据访问权限。

Method: 论文提出了PermLLM机制，基于参数高效微调，并引入了相关响应和访问优势（包括DDI和UGI）的形式化验证方法。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上的实验表明，PermLLM机制能有效实施访问控制，同时验证了DDI和UGI作为量化指标的合理性。

Conclusion: PermLLM为LLM在企业环境中的安全应用提供了可行的解决方案，同时提出了可验证的访问控制评估方法。

Abstract: In enterprise settings, organizational data is segregated, siloed and
carefully protected by elaborate access control frameworks. These access
control structures can completely break down if an LLM fine-tuned on the siloed
data serves requests, for downstream tasks, from individuals with disparate
access privileges. We propose Permissioned LLMs (PermLLM), a new class of LLMs
that superimpose the organizational data access control structures on query
responses they generate. We formalize abstractions underpinning the means to
determine whether access control enforcement happens correctly over LLM query
responses. Our formalism introduces the notion of a relevant response that can
be used to prove whether a PermLLM mechanism has been implemented correctly. We
also introduce a novel metric, called access advantage, to empirically evaluate
the efficacy of a PermLLM mechanism. We introduce three novel PermLLM
mechanisms that build on Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning to achieve the desired
access control. We furthermore present two instantiations of access
advantage--(i) Domain Distinguishability Index (DDI) based on Membership
Inference Attacks, and (ii) Utility Gap Index (UGI) based on LLM utility
evaluation. We demonstrate the efficacy of our PermLLM mechanisms through
extensive experiments on four public datasets (GPQA, RCV1, SimpleQA, and WMDP),
in addition to evaluating the validity of DDI and UGI metrics themselves for
quantifying access control in LLMs.

Motivation: LLM代理能力的扩展增加了恶意使用的风险，现有方法在安全对齐上存在不足。

Method: 利用抽象行为链在模拟环境中生成安全对齐数据，平衡安全性和实用性。

Result: 在AgentHarm基准上，安全性提升35.8%至79.5%，实用性影响极小甚至提升。

Conclusion: AgentAlign有效解决了LLM代理的安全对齐问题，且开源了数据和代码。

Abstract: The acquisition of agentic capabilities has transformed LLMs from "knowledge
providers" to "action executors", a trend that while expanding LLMs' capability
boundaries, significantly increases their susceptibility to malicious use.
Previous work has shown that current LLM-based agents execute numerous
malicious tasks even without being attacked, indicating a deficiency in agentic
use safety alignment during the post-training phase. To address this gap, we
propose AgentAlign, a novel framework that leverages abstract behavior chains
as a medium for safety alignment data synthesis. By instantiating these
behavior chains in simulated environments with diverse tool instances, our
framework enables the generation of highly authentic and executable
instructions while capturing complex multi-step dynamics. The framework further
ensures model utility by proportionally synthesizing benign instructions
through non-malicious interpretations of behavior chains, precisely calibrating
the boundary between helpfulness and harmlessness. Evaluation results on
AgentHarm demonstrate that fine-tuning three families of open-source models
using our method substantially improves their safety (35.8% to 79.5%
improvement) while minimally impacting or even positively enhancing their
helpfulness, outperforming various prompting methods. The dataset and code have
both been open-sourced.

Conclusion: SMR为传统CoT推理提供了实用替代方案，无需任务特定调优即可跨LLMs和检索器泛化。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enables complex reasoning in large language
models (LLMs), including applications in information retrieval (IR). However,
it often leads to overthinking, where models produce excessively long and
semantically redundant traces with little or no benefit. We identify two key
challenges in IR: redundant trajectories that revisit similar states and
misguided reasoning that diverges from user intent. To address these, we
propose State Machine Reasoning (SMR), a transition-based reasoning framework
composed of discrete actions (Refine, Rerank, Stop) that support early stopping
and fine-grained control. Experiments on the BEIR and BRIGHT benchmarks show
that SMR improves retrieval performance (nDCG@10) by 3.4% while reducing token
usage by 74.4%. It generalizes across LLMs and retrievers without requiring
task-specific tuning, offering a practical alternative to conventional CoT
reasoning. The code and details are available at https://github.com/ldilab/SMR.

Result: 评估显示，即使在受控条件下，现有LLMs和代理框架在动态基准上的表现显著低于静态基准。

Conclusion: SWE-bench-Live为动态、多样化的现实软件开发环境提供了抗污染的LLM评估工具。

Abstract: The issue-resolving task, where a model generates patches to fix real-world
bugs, has emerged as a critical benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of
large language models (LLMs). While SWE-bench and its variants have become
standard in this domain, they suffer from key limitations: they have not been
updated since their initial releases, cover a narrow set of repositories, and
depend heavily on manual effort for instance construction and environment
setup. These factors hinder scalability and introduce risks of overfitting and
data contamination. In this work, we present \textbf{SWE-bench-Live}, a
\textit{live-updatable} benchmark designed to overcome these challenges. Our
initial release consists of 1,319 tasks derived from real GitHub issues created
since 2024, spanning 93 repositories. Each task is accompanied by a dedicated
Docker image to ensure reproducible execution. Central to our benchmark is
\method, an automated curation pipeline that streamlines the entire process
from instance creation to environment setup, removing manual bottlenecks and
enabling scalability and continuous updates. We evaluate a range of
state-of-the-art agent frameworks and LLMs on SWE-bench-Live, revealing a
substantial performance gap compared to static benchmarks like SWE-bench, even
under controlled evaluation conditions. To better understand this discrepancy,
we perform detailed analyses across repository origin, issue recency, and task
difficulty. By providing a fresh, diverse, and executable benchmark grounded in
live repository activity, SWE-bench-Live facilitates rigorous,
contamination-resistant evaluation of LLMs and agents in dynamic, real-world
software development settings.

Conclusion: RL在优化LLM代码效率方面表现出色，展示了LLM自我改进的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) generate functionally correct solutions but
often fall short in code efficiency, a critical bottleneck for real-world
deployment. In this paper, we introduce a novel test-time iterative
optimization framework to address this, employing a closed-loop system where
LLMs iteratively refine code based on empirical performance feedback from an
execution sandbox. We explore three training strategies: Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Group Relative Policy
Optimization~(GRPO). Experiments on our Venus dataset and the APPS benchmark
show that SFT and DPO rapidly saturate in efficiency gains. In contrast, GRPO,
using reinforcement learning (RL) with execution feedback, continuously
optimizes code performance, significantly boosting both pass@1 (from 47% to
62%) and the likelihood of outperforming human submissions in efficiency (from
31% to 45%). Our work demonstrates effective test-time code efficiency
improvement and critically reveals the power of RL in teaching LLMs to truly

Result: SLIT框架能有效降低LLM推理阶段的碳足迹、水耗和能源成本，同时保持服务质量。

Conclusion: SLIT框架为LLM的可持续发展提供了重要解决方案，未来将愈发关键。

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLM) such as ChatGPT, CoPilot, and
Gemini have been widely adopted in different areas. As the use of LLMs
continues to grow, many efforts have focused on reducing the massive training
overheads of these models. But it is the environmental impact of handling user
requests to LLMs that is increasingly becoming a concern. Recent studies
estimate that the costs of operating LLMs in their inference phase can exceed
training costs by 25x per year. As LLMs are queried incessantly, the cumulative
carbon footprint for the operational phase has been shown to far exceed the
footprint during the training phase. Further, estimates indicate that 500 ml of
fresh water is expended for every 20-50 requests to LLMs during inference. To
address these important sustainability issues with LLMs, we propose a novel
framework called SLIT to co-optimize LLM quality of service (time-to-first
token), carbon emissions, water usage, and energy costs. The framework utilizes
a machine learning (ML) based metaheuristic to enhance the sustainability of
LLM hosting across geo-distributed cloud datacenters. Such a framework will
become increasingly vital as LLMs proliferate.

Abstract: CaMeL (Capabilities for Machine Learning) introduces a capability-based
sandbox to mitigate prompt injection attacks in large language model (LLM)
agents. While effective, CaMeL assumes a trusted user prompt, omits
side-channel concerns, and incurs performance tradeoffs due to its dual-LLM
design. This response identifies these issues and proposes engineering
improvements to expand CaMeL's threat coverage and operational usability. We
introduce: (1) prompt screening for initial inputs, (2) output auditing to
detect instruction leakage, (3) a tiered-risk access model to balance usability
and control, and (4) a verified intermediate language for formal guarantees.
Together, these upgrades align CaMeL with best practices in enterprise security

Abstract: Despite the growing clinical adoption of large language models (LLMs),
current approaches heavily rely on single model architectures. To overcome
risks of obsolescence and rigid dependence on single model systems, we present
a novel framework, termed the Consensus Mechanism. Mimicking clinical triage
and multidisciplinary clinical decision-making, the Consensus Mechanism
implements an ensemble of specialized medical expert agents enabling improved
clinical decision making while maintaining robust adaptability. This
architecture enables the Consensus Mechanism to be optimized for cost, latency,
or performance, purely based on its interior model configuration.
  To rigorously evaluate the Consensus Mechanism, we employed three medical
evaluation benchmarks: MedMCQA, MedQA, and MedXpertQA Text, and the
differential diagnosis dataset, DDX+. On MedXpertQA, the Consensus Mechanism
achieved an accuracy of 61.0% compared to 53.5% and 45.9% for OpenAI's O3 and
Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro. Improvement was consistent across benchmarks with an
increase in accuracy on MedQA

($\Delta\mathrm{Accuracy}_{\mathrm{consensus\text{-}O3}} = 9.1\%$). These
accuracy gains extended to differential diagnosis generation, where our system
demonstrated improved recall and precision (F1$_\mathrm{consensus}$ = 0.326 vs.
F1$_{\mathrm{O3\text{-}high}}$ = 0.2886) and a higher top-1 accuracy for DDX

Abstract: Advanced reasoning models with agentic capabilities (AI agents) are deployed
to interact with humans and to solve sequential decision-making problems under
(approximate) utility functions and internal models. When such problems have
resource or failure constraints where action sequences may be forcibly
terminated once resources are exhausted, agents face implicit trade-offs that
reshape their utility-driven (rational) behaviour. Additionally, since these
agents are typically commissioned by a human principal to act on their behalf,
asymmetries in constraint exposure can give rise to previously unanticipated
misalignment between human objectives and agent incentives. We formalise this
setting through a survival bandit framework, provide theoretical and empirical
results that quantify the impact of survival-driven preference shifts, identify
conditions under which misalignment emerges and propose mechanisms to mitigate
the emergence of risk-seeking or risk-averse behaviours. As a result, this work
aims to increase understanding and interpretability of emergent behaviours of
AI agents operating under such survival pressure, and offer guidelines for
safely deploying such AI systems in critical resource-limited environments.

we propose CBR-DDI, a novel framework that distills pharmacological principles

constructs a knowledge repository by leveraging LLMs to extract pharmacological

Conclusion: 结构化状态建模对移动GUI代理的任务执行至关重要，FSM可作为轻量级、模型无关的内存层集成到未来架构中。

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents aim to autonomously complete user-instructed tasks across
mobile apps. Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) enable
these agents to interpret UI screens, identify actionable elements, and perform
interactions such as tapping or typing. However, existing agents remain
reactive: they reason only over the current screen and lack a structured model
of app navigation flow, limiting their ability to understand context, detect
unexpected outcomes, and recover from errors. We present MAPLE, a state-aware
multi-agent framework that abstracts app interactions as a Finite State Machine
(FSM). We computationally model each UI screen as a discrete state and user
actions as transitions, allowing the FSM to provide a structured representation
of the app execution. MAPLE consists of specialized agents responsible for four
phases of task execution: planning, execution, verification, error recovery,
and knowledge retention. These agents collaborate to dynamically construct FSMs
in real time based on perception data extracted from the UI screen, allowing
the GUI agents to track navigation progress and flow, validate action outcomes
through pre- and post-conditions of the states, and recover from errors by
rolling back to previously stable states. Our evaluation results on two
challenging cross-app benchmarks, Mobile-Eval-E and SPA-Bench, show that MAPLE
outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline, improving task success rate by up to
12%, recovery success by 13.8%, and action accuracy by 6.5%. Our results
highlight the importance of structured state modeling in guiding mobile GUI
agents during task execution. Moreover, our FSM representation can be
integrated into future GUI agent architectures as a lightweight, model-agnostic
memory layer to support structured planning, execution verification, and error
recovery.

Motivation: 现有AI编程工具可能导致用户过度依赖系统，忽略关键决策，尤其在软件安全领域带来风险。

Method: 提出Human-in-the-loop Decoding技术，并在HiLDe代码补全助手中实现，允许用户干预LLM决策并提供本地替代方案。

Result: 在安全相关任务中，HiLDe显著减少了漏洞生成，并更好地满足了用户目标。

Conclusion: Human-in-the-loop Decoding技术能有效提升LLM在代码生成中的用户控制和安全性。

Abstract: While AI programming tools hold the promise of increasing programmers'
capabilities and productivity to a remarkable degree, they often exclude users
from essential decision-making processes, causing many to effectively "turn off
their brains" and over-rely on solutions provided by these systems. These
behaviors can have severe consequences in critical domains, like software
security. We propose Human-in-the-loop Decoding, a novel interaction technique
that allows users to observe and directly influence LLM decisions during code
generation, in order to align the model's output with their personal
requirements. We implement this technique in HiLDe, a code completion assistant
that highlights critical decisions made by the LLM and provides local
alternatives for the user to explore. In a within-subjects study (N=18) on
security-related tasks, we found that HiLDe led participants to generate
significantly fewer vulnerabilities and better align code generation with their
goals compared to a traditional code completion assistant.

Abstract: Developing high-performance software is a complex task that requires

models' capabilities in developing high-performance software. We develop an
automated pipeline that generates and executes performance tests to analyze
repository commit histories to identify 102 challenging optimization tasks
across 10 codebases, spanning diverse domains and programming languages. An
agent is provided with a codebase and performance test as a precise
specification, and tasked to improve the runtime efficiency, which is measured
against the expert developer optimization. Our quantitative evaluation reveals
that leading SWE-Agents struggle significantly, achieving less than 5% success
rate, with limited improvements even with inference-time scaling. Our
qualitative analysis identifies key failure modes, including difficulties with
low-level languages, practicing lazy optimization strategies, and challenges in
accurately localizing bottlenecks. We release the code and artifacts of our
benchmark along with agent trajectories to enable future research.

Abstract: The communication topology in large language model-based multi-agent systems
fundamentally governs inter-agent collaboration patterns, critically shaping
both the efficiency and effectiveness of collective decision-making. While
recent studies for communication topology automated design tend to construct
sparse structures for efficiency, they often overlook why and when sparse and
dense topologies help or hinder collaboration. In this paper, we present a
causal framework to analyze how agent outputs, whether correct or erroneous,
propagate under topologies with varying sparsity. Our empirical studies reveal
that moderately sparse topologies, which effectively suppress error propagation
while preserving beneficial information diffusion, typically achieve optimal
task performance. Guided by this insight, we propose a novel topology design
approach, EIB-leanrner, that balances error suppression and beneficial
information propagation by fusing connectivity patterns from both dense and
sparse graphs. Extensive experiments show the superior effectiveness,
communication cost, and robustness of EIB-leanrner.

Abstract: We propose GAM-Agent, a game-theoretic multi-agent framework for enhancing
vision-language reasoning. Unlike prior single-agent or monolithic models,
GAM-Agent formulates the reasoning process as a non-zero-sum game between base
agents--each specializing in visual perception subtasks--and a critical agent
that verifies logic consistency and factual correctness. Agents communicate via
structured claims, evidence, and uncertainty estimates. The framework
introduces an uncertainty-aware controller to dynamically adjust agent
collaboration, triggering multi-round debates when disagreement or ambiguity is
detected. This process yields more robust and interpretable predictions.
Experiments on four challenging benchmarks--MMMU, MMBench, MVBench, and
V*Bench--demonstrate that GAM-Agent significantly improves performance across
various VLM backbones. Notably, GAM-Agent boosts the accuracy of small-to-mid
scale models (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-7B, InternVL3-14B) by 5--6\%, and still enhances
strong models like GPT-4o by up to 2--3\%. Our approach is modular, scalable,

Conclusion: ROTATE为鲁棒且可泛化的团队协作设定了新标准。

Abstract: Developing AI agents capable of collaborating with previously unseen partners
is a fundamental generalization challenge in multi-agent learning, known as Ad
Hoc Teamwork (AHT). Existing AHT approaches typically adopt a two-stage
pipeline, where first, a fixed population of teammates is generated with the
idea that they should be representative of the teammates that will be seen at
deployment time, and second, an AHT agent is trained to collaborate well with
agents in the population. To date, the research community has focused on
designing separate algorithms for each stage. This separation has led to
algorithms that generate teammate pools with limited coverage of possible
behaviors, and that ignore whether the generated teammates are easy to learn
from for the AHT agent. Furthermore, algorithms for training AHT agents
typically treat the set of training teammates as static, thus attempting to
generalize to previously unseen partner agents without assuming any control
over the distribution of training teammates. In this paper, we present a
unified framework for AHT by reformulating the problem as an open-ended
learning process between an ad hoc agent and an adversarial teammate generator.
We introduce ROTATE, a regret-driven, open-ended training algorithm that
alternates between improving the AHT agent and generating teammates that probe
its deficiencies. Extensive experiments across diverse AHT environments
demonstrate that ROTATE significantly outperforms baselines at generalizing to
an unseen set of evaluation teammates, thus establishing a new standard for
robust and generalizable teamwork.

Result: 标签有助于识别AI生成图像，但用户可能过度依赖标签，导致对真实信息的信任下降，甚至误判人类制作虚假信息的可信度。

Conclusion: AI标签虽有一定效果，但需谨慎设计以避免副作用。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence is developing rapidly, impacting humans'
interaction with information and digital media. It is increasingly used to
create deceptively realistic misinformation, so lawmakers have imposed
regulations requiring the disclosure of AI-generated content. However, only
little is known about whether these labels reduce the risks of AI-generated
misinformation.
  Our work addresses this research gap. Focusing on AI-generated images, we
study the implications of labels, including the possibility of mislabeling.
Assuming that simplicity, transparency, and trust are likely to impact the
successful adoption of such labels, we first qualitatively explore users'
opinions and expectations of AI labeling using five focus groups. Second, we
conduct a pre-registered online survey with over 1300 U.S. and EU participants
to quantitatively assess the effect of AI labels on users' ability to recognize
misinformation containing either human-made or AI-generated images. Our focus
groups illustrate that, while participants have concerns about the practical
implementation of labeling, they consider it helpful in identifying
AI-generated images and avoiding deception. However, considering security
benefits, our survey revealed an ambiguous picture, suggesting that users might
over-rely on labels. While inaccurate claims supported by labeled AI-generated
images were rated less credible than those with unlabeled AI-images, the belief
in accurate claims also decreased when accompanied by a labeled AI-generated
image. Moreover, we find the undesired side effect that human-made images
conveying inaccurate claims were perceived as more credible in the presence of
labels.

Abstract: Assessing the quality of public transportation services requires the analysis
of large quantities of data on the scheduled and actual trips and documents
listing the quality constraints each service needs to meet. Interrogating such
datasets with SQL queries, organizing and visualizing the data can be quite
complex for most users. This paper presents a chatbot offering a user-friendly
tool to interact with these datasets and support decision making. It is based
on an agent architecture, which expands the capabilities of the core Large
Language Model (LLM) by allowing it to interact with a series of tools that can
execute several tasks, like performing SQL queries, plotting data and creating
maps from the coordinates of a trip and its stops. This paper also tackles one
of the main open problems of such Generative AI projects: collecting data to
measure the system's performance. Our chatbot has been extensively tested with
a workflow that asks several questions and stores the generated query, the
retrieved data and the natural language response for each of them. Such
questions are drawn from a set of base examples which are then completed with
actual data from the database. This procedure yields a dataset for the
evaluation of the chatbot's performance, especially the consistency of its
answers and the correctness of the generated queries.

Conclusion: 研究表明，基于推理的方法在自动化系统证据合成中具有潜力。

Abstract: Systematic reviews in medicine play a critical role in evidence-based
decision-making by aggregating findings from multiple studies. A central
bottleneck in automating this process is extracting numeric evidence and
determining study-level conclusions for specific outcomes and comparisons.
Prior work has framed this problem as a textual inference task by retrieving
relevant content fragments and inferring conclusions from them. However, such
approaches often rely on shallow textual cues and fail to capture the
underlying numeric reasoning behind expert assessments.
  In this work, we conceptualise the problem as one of quantitative reasoning.
Rather than inferring conclusions from surface text, we extract structured
numerical evidence (e.g., event counts or standard deviations) and apply domain
knowledge informed logic to derive outcome-specific conclusions. We develop a
numeric reasoning system composed of a numeric data extraction model and an
effect estimate component, enabling more accurate and interpretable inference
aligned with the domain expert principles. We train the numeric data extraction
model using different strategies, including supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
reinforcement learning (RL) with a new value reward model.
  When evaluated on the CochraneForest benchmark, our best-performing approach
-- using RL to train a small-scale number extraction model -- yields up to a
21% absolute improvement in F1 score over retrieval-based systems and
outperforms general-purpose LLMs of over 400B parameters by up to 9%. Our
results demonstrate the promise of reasoning-driven approaches for automating
systematic evidence synthesis.

Abstract: Recent data-efficient molecular generation approaches exploit graph grammars
to introduce interpretability into the generative models. However, grammar
learning therein relies on expert annotation or unreliable heuristics for
algorithmic inference. We propose Foundation Molecular Grammar (FMG), which
leverages multi-modal foundation models (MMFMs) to induce an interpretable
molecular language. By exploiting the chemical knowledge of an MMFM, FMG
renders molecules as images, describes them as text, and aligns information
across modalities using prompt learning. FMG can be used as a drop-in
replacement for the prior grammar learning approaches in molecular generation
and property prediction. We show that FMG not only excels in synthesizability,
diversity, and data efficiency but also offers built-in chemical
interpretability for automated molecular discovery workflows. Code is available

Conclusion: Strategic Reflectivism为智能系统设计提供了新的视角，强调直觉与反思的动态平衡。

Abstract: By late 20th century, the rationality wars had launched debates about the
nature and norms of intuitive and reflective thinking. Those debates drew from
mid-20th century ideas such as bounded rationality, which challenged more
idealized notions of rationality observed since the 19th century. Now that 21st
century cognitive scientists are applying the resulting dual process theories
to artificial intelligence, it is time to dust off some lessons from this
history. So this paper synthesizes old ideas with recent results from
experiments on humans and machines. The result is Strategic Reflectivism, which
takes the position that one key to intelligent systems (human or artificial) is
pragmatic switching between intuitive and reflective inference to optimally
fulfill competing goals. Strategic Reflectivism builds on American Pragmatism,
transcends superficial indicators of reflective thinking such as model size or
chains of thought, and becomes increasingly actionable as we learn more about
the value of intuition and reflection.

Abstract: Geometry problem solving presents distinctive challenges in artificial
intelligence, requiring exceptional multimodal comprehension and rigorous
mathematical reasoning capabilities. Existing approaches typically fall into
two categories: neural-based and symbolic-based methods, both of which exhibit
limitations in reliability and interpretability. To address this challenge, we
propose AutoGPS, a neuro-symbolic collaborative framework that solves geometry
problems with concise, reliable, and human-interpretable reasoning processes.
Specifically, AutoGPS employs a Multimodal Problem Formalizer (MPF) and a
Deductive Symbolic Reasoner (DSR). The MPF utilizes neural cross-modal
comprehension to translate geometry problems into structured formal language
representations, with feedback from DSR collaboratively. The DSR takes the
formalization as input and formulates geometry problem solving as a hypergraph
expansion task, executing mathematically rigorous and reliable derivation to
produce minimal and human-readable stepwise solutions. Extensive experimental
evaluations demonstrate that AutoGPS achieves state-of-the-art performance on
benchmark datasets. Furthermore, human stepwise-reasoning evaluation confirms
AutoGPS's impressive reliability and interpretability, with 99\% stepwise
logical coherence. The project homepage is at

Abstract: This article presents a structured framework for Human-AI collaboration in
Security Operations Centers (SOCs), integrating AI autonomy, trust calibration,
and Human-in-the-loop decision making. Existing frameworks in SOCs often focus
narrowly on automation, lacking systematic structures to manage human
oversight, trust calibration, and scalable autonomy with AI. Many assume static
or binary autonomy settings, failing to account for the varied complexity,
criticality, and risk across SOC tasks considering Humans and AI collaboration.
To address these limitations, we propose a novel autonomy tiered framework
grounded in five levels of AI autonomy from manual to fully autonomous, mapped
to Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) roles and task-specific trust thresholds. This
enables adaptive and explainable AI integration across core SOC functions,
including monitoring, protection, threat detection, alert triage, and incident
response. The proposed framework differentiates itself from previous research
by creating formal connections between autonomy, trust, and HITL across various
SOC levels, which allows for adaptive task distribution according to
operational complexity and associated risks. The framework is exemplified
through a simulated cyber range that features the cybersecurity AI-Avatar, a
fine-tuned LLM-based SOC assistant. The AI-Avatar case study illustrates
human-AI collaboration for SOC tasks, reducing alert fatigue, enhancing
response coordination, and strategically calibrating trust. This research
systematically presents both the theoretical and practical aspects and
feasibility of designing next-generation cognitive SOCs that leverage AI not to
replace but to enhance human decision-making.

Result: 发现互补性子技能组合能显著提升工作成功率，并解释了GenAI辅助对低技能工人效果更显著的现象。

Conclusion: GenAI更多是辅助而非替代人类技能，尤其在子技能互补的情况下。

Abstract: The rapid rise of Generative AI (GenAI) tools has sparked debate over their
role in complementing or replacing human workers across job contexts. We
present a mathematical framework that models jobs, workers, and worker-job fit,
introducing a novel decomposition of skills into decision-level and
action-level subskills to reflect the complementary strengths of humans and
GenAI. We analyze how changes in subskill abilities affect job success,
identifying conditions for sharp transitions in success probability. We also
establish sufficient conditions under which combining workers with
complementary subskills significantly outperforms relying on a single worker.
This explains phenomena such as productivity compression, where GenAI
assistance yields larger gains for lower-skilled workers. We demonstrate the
framework' s practicality using data from O*NET and Big-Bench Lite, aligning
real-world data with our model via subskill-division methods. Our results
highlight when and how GenAI complements human skills, rather than replacing
them.

Method: 引入元认知伪奖励、主观努力评估和终止审议机制，分析其对策略发现的影响。

Result: 这些机制促进了策略发现，但未完全弥合模型与人类的差距。

Conclusion: 需进一步探索其他可能影响策略发现的认知因素。

Abstract: People employ efficient planning strategies. But how are these strategies
acquired? Previous research suggests that people can discover new planning
strategies through learning from reinforcements, a process known as
metacognitive reinforcement learning (MCRL). While prior work has shown that
MCRL models can learn new planning strategies and explain more participants'
experience-driven discovery better than alternative mechanisms, it also
revealed significant individual differences in metacognitive learning.
Furthermore, when fitted to human data, these models exhibit a slower rate of
strategy discovery than humans. In this study, we investigate whether
incorporating cognitive mechanisms that might facilitate human strategy
discovery can bring models of MCRL closer to human performance. Specifically,
we consider intrinsically generated metacognitive pseudo-rewards, subjective
effort valuation, and termination deliberation. Analysis of planning task data
shows that a larger proportion of participants used at least one of these
mechanisms, with significant individual differences in their usage and varying
impacts on strategy discovery. Metacognitive pseudo-rewards, subjective effort
valuation, and learning the value of acting without further planning were found
to facilitate strategy discovery. While these enhancements provided valuable
insights into individual differences and the effect of these mechanisms on
strategy discovery, they did not fully close the gap between model and human
performance, prompting further exploration of additional factors that people
might use to discover new planning strategies.

Conclusion: ZeroGUI为GUI代理训练提供了一种高效、零人工成本的方法。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has propelled
the development of pure-vision-based GUI Agents, capable of perceiving and
operating Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) to autonomously fulfill user
instructions. However, existing approaches usually adopt an offline learning
framework, which faces two core limitations: (1) heavy reliance on high-quality
manual annotations for element grounding and action supervision, and (2)
limited adaptability to dynamic and interactive environments. To address these
limitations, we propose ZeroGUI, a scalable, online learning framework for
automating GUI Agent training at Zero human cost. Specifically, ZeroGUI
integrates (i) VLM-based automatic task generation to produce diverse training
goals from the current environment state, (ii) VLM-based automatic reward
estimation to assess task success without hand-crafted evaluation functions,
and (iii) two-stage online reinforcement learning to continuously interact with
and learn from GUI environments. Experiments on two advanced GUI Agents
(UI-TARS and Aguvis) demonstrate that ZeroGUI significantly boosts performance
across OSWorld and AndroidLab environments. The code is available at

Conclusion: PSBench是推动蛋白质复合物建模EMA研究的重要资源。

Abstract: Predicting protein complex structures is essential for protein function
analysis, protein design, and drug discovery. While AI methods like AlphaFold
can predict accurate structural models for many protein complexes, reliably
estimating the quality of these predicted models (estimation of model accuracy,
or EMA) for model ranking and selection remains a major challenge. A key
barrier to developing effective machine learning-based EMA methods is the lack
of large, diverse, and well-annotated datasets for training and evaluation. To
address this gap, we introduce PSBench, a benchmark suite comprising four
large-scale, labeled datasets generated during the 15th and 16th community-wide
Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction (CASP15 and CASP16).
PSBench includes over one million structural models covering a wide range of
protein sequence lengths, complex stoichiometries, functional classes, and
modeling difficulties. Each model is annotated with multiple complementary
quality scores at the global, local, and interface levels. PSBench also
provides multiple evaluation metrics and baseline EMA methods to facilitate
rigorous comparisons. To demonstrate PSBench's utility, we trained and
evaluated GATE, a graph transformer-based EMA method, on the CASP15 data. GATE
was blindly tested in CASP16 (2024), where it ranked among the top-performing
EMA methods. These results highlight PSBench as a valuable resource for
advancing EMA research in protein complex modeling. PSBench is publicly

Conclusion: 提供了一种自组织吸引子网络的统一理论，对AI和神经科学有重要意义。

Abstract: Attractor dynamics are a hallmark of many complex systems, including the
brain. Understanding how such self-organizing dynamics emerge from first
principles is crucial for advancing our understanding of neuronal computations
and the design of artificial intelligence systems. Here we formalize how
attractor networks emerge from the free energy principle applied to a universal
partitioning of random dynamical systems. Our approach obviates the need for
explicitly imposed learning and inference rules and identifies emergent, but
efficient and biologically plausible inference and learning dynamics for such
self-organizing systems. These result in a collective, multi-level Bayesian
active inference process. Attractors on the free energy landscape encode prior
beliefs; inference integrates sensory data into posterior beliefs; and learning
fine-tunes couplings to minimize long-term surprise. Analytically and via
simulations, we establish that the proposed networks favor approximately
orthogonalized attractor representations, a consequence of simultaneously
optimizing predictive accuracy and model complexity. These attractors
efficiently span the input subspace, enhancing generalization and the mutual
information between hidden causes and observable effects. Furthermore, while
random data presentation leads to symmetric and sparse couplings, sequential
data fosters asymmetric couplings and non-equilibrium steady-state dynamics,
offering a natural extension to conventional Boltzmann Machines. Our findings
offer a unifying theory of self-organizing attractor networks, providing novel
insights for AI and neuroscience.

Abstract: Manufacturing environments are becoming more complex and unpredictable due to
factors such as demand variations and shorter product lifespans. This
complexity requires real-time decision-making and adaptation to disruptions.
Traditional control approaches highlight the need for advanced control
strategies capable of overcoming unforeseen challenges, as they demonstrate
limitations in responsiveness within dynamic industrial settings. Multi-agent
systems address these challenges through decentralization of decision-making,
enabling systems to respond dynamically to operational changes. However,
current multi-agent systems encounter challenges related to real-time
adaptation, context-aware decision-making, and the dynamic exploration of
resource capabilities. Large language models provide the possibility to
overcome these limitations through context-aware decision-making capabilities.
This paper introduces a large language model-enabled control architecture for
multi-agent manufacturing systems to dynamically explore resource capabilities
in response to real-time disruptions. A simulation-based case study
demonstrates that the proposed architecture improves system resilience and
flexibility. The case study findings show improved throughput and efficient
resource utilization compared to existing approaches.

Result: 评估显示Orca提升了用户的信息获取欲望、控制力和灵活性。

Conclusion: AI可以有效地增强用户在多网页间的交互能力，同时保持用户控制。

Abstract: Web-based activities are fundamentally distributed across webpages. However,
conventional browsers with stacks of tabs fail to support operating and
synthesizing large volumes of information across pages. While recent AI systems
enable fully automated web browsing and information synthesis, they often
diminish user agency and hinder contextual understanding. Therefore, we explore
how AI could instead augment users' interactions with content across webpages
and mitigate cognitive and manual efforts. Through literature on information
tasks and web browsing challenges, and an iterative design process, we present
a rich set of novel interactions with our prototype web browser, Orca.
Leveraging AI, Orca supports user-driven exploration, operation, organization,
and synthesis of web content at scale. To enable browsing at scale, webpages
are treated as malleable materials that humans and AI can collaboratively
manipulate and compose into a malleable, dynamic, and browser-level workspace.
Our evaluation revealed an increased "appetite" for information foraging,
enhanced user control, and more flexibility in sensemaking across a broader

Abstract: The current landscape of system-on-chips (SoCs) security verification faces

bug detection at the Register-Transfer Level (RTL) difficult. This paper

the LLM's hardware security knowledge and leveraging its capabilities for text
inference and knowledge transfer, this approach automates and improves the
adaptability and reusability of the verification process. We introduce an
open-source, fine-tuned LLM specifically designed for detecting security
vulnerabilities in SoC designs. Our findings demonstrate that this tailored LLM

verification process. Additionally, we introduce a comprehensive hardware

Conclusion: 学习行为可以通过天真合谋、冷酷触发策略或递增策略支持，但天真合谋仅在特定条件下构成SPE。

Abstract: There is growing experimental evidence that $Q$-learning agents may learn to
charge supracompetitive prices. We provide the first theoretical explanation
for this behavior in infinite repeated games. Firms update their pricing
policies based solely on observed profits, without computing equilibrium
strategies. We show that when the game admits both a one-stage Nash equilibrium
price and a collusive-enabling price, and when the $Q$-function satisfies
certain inequalities at the end of experimentation, firms learn to consistently
charge supracompetitive prices. We introduce a new class of one-memory subgame
perfect equilibria (SPEs) and provide conditions under which learned behavior
is supported by naive collusion, grim trigger policies, or increasing
strategies. Naive collusion does not constitute an SPE unless the
collusive-enabling price is a one-stage Nash equilibrium, whereas grim trigger
policies can.

Abstract: A key task in certain democratic processes is to produce a concise slate of

This task is similar to committee elections, but unlike traditional settings,
the candidate set comprises all possible statements of varying lengths, and so
it can only be accessed through specific queries. Combining social choice and
large language models, prior work has approached this challenge through a
framework of generative social choice. We extend the framework in two
fundamental ways, providing theoretical guarantees even in the face of
approximately optimal queries and a budget limit on the overall length of the
slate. Using GPT-4o to implement queries, we showcase our approach on datasets

the top 30 candidates, and semantic search yields 100 candidates, which are

  Our approach achieves a mean reciprocal rank at 5 (MRR@5) of 76.46% on the

the development leaderboard and ranking 3rd on the test leaderboard (out of 31

Abstract: We present Adversarial Object Fusion (AdvOF), a novel attack framework
targeting vision-and-language navigation (VLN) agents in service-oriented
environments by generating adversarial 3D objects. While foundational models
like Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) have
enhanced service-oriented navigation systems through improved perception and
decision-making, their integration introduces vulnerabilities in
mission-critical service workflows. Existing adversarial attacks fail to
address service computing contexts, where reliability and quality-of-service
(QoS) are paramount. We utilize AdvOF to investigate and explore the impact of
adversarial environments on the VLM-based perception module of VLN agents. In
particular, AdvOF first precisely aggregates and aligns the victim object
positions in both 2D and 3D space, defining and rendering adversarial objects.
Then, we collaboratively optimize the adversarial object with regularization
between the adversarial and victim object across physical properties and VLM
perceptions. Through assigning importance weights to varying views, the
optimization is processed stably and multi-viewedly by iterative fusions from
local updates and justifications. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate AdvOF
can effectively degrade agent performance under adversarial conditions while
maintaining minimal interference with normal navigation tasks. This work
advances the understanding of service security in VLM-powered navigation
systems, providing computational foundations for robust service composition in
physical-world deployments.

multi-modal model has textual, visual, and spoken inputs and can answer spoken
questions on images.
  Training and evaluating SVQA models requires a dataset for all three
modalities, but no such dataset currently exists. We address this problem by
synthesizing VQA datasets using two zero-shot TTS models. Our initial findings
indicate that a model trained only with synthesized speech nearly reaches the
performance of the upper-bounding model trained on textual QAs. In addition, we
show that the choice of the TTS model has a minor impact on accuracy.

Conclusion: 研究整合了AI治理的关键方向，并指出了实证验证和包容性方面的不足，为学术研究和实践应用提供了参考。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) governance is the practice of establishing
frameworks, policies, and procedures to ensure the responsible, ethical, and
safe development and deployment of AI systems. Although AI governance is a core
pillar of Responsible AI, current literature still lacks synthesis across such
governance frameworks and practices. Objective: To identify which frameworks,
principles, mechanisms, and stakeholder roles are emphasized in secondary
literature on AI governance. Method: We conducted a rapid tertiary review of
nine peer-reviewed secondary studies from IEEE and ACM (20202024), using
structured inclusion criteria and thematic semantic synthesis. Results: The
most cited frameworks include the EU AI Act and NIST RMF; transparency and
accountability are the most common principles. Few reviews detail actionable
governance mechanisms or stakeholder strategies. Conclusion: The review
consolidates key directions in AI governance and highlights gaps in empirical
validation and inclusivity. Findings inform both academic inquiry and practical
adoption in organizations.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CTIM-Rover是一个基于AutoCodeRover的AI代理，通过引入跨任务实例记忆（CTIM）扩展了代理推理框架，但未能在任何配置中超越AutoCodeRover。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源SE代理在任务实例后丢弃长期记忆，而CTIM可能提升存储库级理解，尤其是在修复错误时。

Method: 基于Experiential Learning（EL）方法ExpeL，采用混合专家（MoEs）方法构建通用和存储库级CTIM。

Result: CTIM-Rover未在任何配置中超越AutoCodeRover，性能下降可能源于CTIM项或示例轨迹的干扰噪声。

Conclusion: ExpeL和DoT-Bank未能扩展到实际SE问题。

Abstract: We introduce CTIM-Rover, an AI agent for Software Engineering (SE) built on
top of AutoCodeRover (Zhang et al., 2024) that extends agentic reasoning
frameworks with an episodic memory, more specifically, a general and
repository-level Cross-Task-Instance Memory (CTIM). While existing open-source
SE agents mostly rely on ReAct (Yao et al., 2023b), Reflexion (Shinn et al.,
2023), or Code-Act (Wang et al., 2024), all of these reasoning and planning
frameworks inefficiently discard their long-term memory after a single task
instance. As repository-level understanding is pivotal for identifying all
locations requiring a patch for fixing a bug, we hypothesize that SE is
particularly well positioned to benefit from CTIM. For this, we build on the
Experiential Learning (EL) approach ExpeL (Zhao et al., 2024), proposing a
Mixture-Of-Experts (MoEs) inspired approach to create both a general-purpose
and repository-level CTIM. We find that CTIM-Rover does not outperform
AutoCodeRover in any configuration and thus conclude that neither ExpeL nor
DoT-Bank (Lingam et al., 2024) scale to real-world SE problems. Our analysis
indicates noise introduced by distracting CTIM items or exemplar trajectories
as the likely source of the performance degradation.

Abstract: Small Uncrewed Aerial Systems (sUAS) are increasingly deployed as autonomous
swarms in search-and-rescue and other disaster-response scenarios. In these
settings, they use computer vision (CV) to detect objects of interest and
autonomously adapt their missions. However, traditional CV systems often
struggle to recognize unfamiliar objects in open-world environments or to infer
their relevance for mission planning. To address this, we incorporate large
language models (LLMs) to reason about detected objects and their implications.
While LLMs can offer valuable insights, they are also prone to hallucinations
and may produce incorrect, misleading, or unsafe recommendations. To ensure
safe and sensible decision-making under uncertainty, high-level decisions must
be governed by cognitive guardrails. This article presents the design,
simulation, and real-world integration of these guardrails for sUAS swarms in
search-and-rescue missions.

Abstract: A restaurant dinner or a hotel stay may lead to memorable experiences when
guests encounter unexpected aspects that also match their interests. For
example, an origami-making station in the waiting area of a restaurant may be
both surprising and enjoyable for a customer who is passionate about paper
crafts. Similarly, an exhibit of 18th century harpsichords would be atypical
for a hotel lobby and likely pique the interest of a guest who has a passion
for Baroque music. Motivated by this insight, in this paper we introduce the
new task of engineering serendipity through recommendations of items with
atypical aspects. We describe an LLM-based system pipeline that extracts
atypical aspects from item reviews, then estimates and aggregates their
user-specific utility in a measure of serendipity potential that is used to
rerank a list of items recommended to the user. To facilitate system
development and evaluation, we introduce a dataset of Yelp reviews that are
manually annotated with atypical aspects and a dataset of artificially
generated user profiles, together with crowdsourced annotations of user-aspect
utility values. Furthermore, we introduce a custom procedure for dynamic
selection of in-context learning examples, which is shown to improve LLM-based
judgments of atypicality and utility. Experimental evaluations show that
serendipity-based rankings generated by the system are highly correlated with
ground truth rankings for which serendipity scores are computed from manual
annotations of atypical aspects and their user-dependent utility. Overall, we
hope that the new recommendation task and the associated system presented in
this paper catalyze further research into recommendation approaches that go
beyond accuracy in their pursuit of enhanced user satisfaction.

Conclusion: DFL在车联网中具有潜力，但需更鲁棒的策略应对多域攻击（如无线干扰和数据投毒）。

Abstract: In connected and autonomous vehicles, machine learning for safety message
classification has become critical for detecting malicious or anomalous
behavior. However, conventional approaches that rely on centralized data
collection or purely local training face limitations due to the large scale,
high mobility, and heterogeneous data distributions inherent in inter-vehicle
networks. To overcome these challenges, this paper explores Distributed
Federated Learning (DFL), whereby vehicles collaboratively train deep learning
models by exchanging model updates among one-hop neighbors and propagating
models over multiple hops. Using the Vehicular Reference Misbehavior (VeReMi)
Extension Dataset, we show that DFL can significantly improve classification
accuracy across all vehicles compared to learning strictly with local data.
Notably, vehicles with low individual accuracy see substantial accuracy gains
through DFL, illustrating the benefit of knowledge sharing across the network.
We further show that local training data size and time-varying network
connectivity correlate strongly with the model's overall accuracy. We
investigate DFL's resilience and vulnerabilities under attacks in multiple
domains, namely wireless jamming and training data poisoning attacks. Our
results reveal important insights into the vulnerabilities of DFL when
confronted with multi-domain attacks, underlining the need for more robust
strategies to secure DFL in vehicular networks.

Abstract: Mental disorders including depression, anxiety, and other neurological
disorders pose a significant global challenge, particularly among individuals
exhibiting social avoidance tendencies. This study proposes a hybrid approach
by leveraging smartphone sensor data measuring daily physical activities and
analyzing their social media (Twitter) interactions for evaluating an
individual's depression level. Using CNN-based deep learning models and Naive
Bayes classification, we identify human physical activities accurately and also
classify the user sentiments. A total of 33 participants were recruited for
data acquisition, and nine relevant features were extracted from the physical
activities and analyzed with their weekly depression scores, evaluated using
the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) questionnaire. Of the nine features, six
are derived from physical activities, achieving an activity recognition
accuracy of 95%, while three features stem from sentiment analysis of Twitter
activities, yielding a sentiment analysis accuracy of 95.6%. Notably, several
physical activity features exhibited significant correlations with the severity
of depression symptoms. For classifying the depression severity, a support
vector machine (SVM)-based algorithm is employed that demonstrated a very high
accuracy of 94%, outperforming alternative models, e.g., the multilayer
perceptron (MLP) and k-nearest neighbor. It is a simple approach yet highly
effective in the long run for monitoring depression without breaching personal

Abstract: Causal reasoning is essential for business process interventions and

handling missing values and expressing the alternating conditions among log
splits when blending traces with varying activities.
  We propose a novel method to unify multiple causal process variants into a

while explicitly representing their causal-flow alternations. The method is
formally defined, proved, evaluated on three open and two proprietary datasets,

Abstract: RF/Analog design is essential for bridging digital technologies with
real-world signals, ensuring the functionality and reliability of a wide range

time-consuming and reliant on expert intuition, and hinder the time and cost
efficiency of circuit development. To overcome the limitations of the manual

end-to-end analog design framework. By employing multiple specialized AI agents
that collaboratively address different aspects of the design process, such as
specification understanding, circuit optimization, and test bench validation,
MenTeR reduces the dependency on frequent trial-and-error-style intervention.
MenTeR not only accelerates the design cycle time but also facilitates a

Abstract: Model abstraction (MA) and event abstraction (EA) are means to reduce
complexity of (discovered) models and event data. Imagine a process
intelligence project that aims to analyze a model discovered from event data
which is further abstracted, possibly multiple times, to reach optimality
goals, e.g., reducing model size. So far, after discovering the model, there is
no technique that enables the synchronized abstraction of the underlying event
log. This results in loosing the grounding in the real-world behavior contained
in the log and, in turn, restricts analysis insights. Hence, in this work, we
provide the formal basis for synchronized model and event abstraction, i.e., we
prove that abstracting a process model by MA and discovering a process model
from an abstracted event log yields an equivalent process model. We prove the
feasibility of our approach based on behavioral profile abstraction as
non-order preserving MA technique, resulting in a novel EA technique.

Abstract: Brain network analysis plays a crucial role in diagnosing and monitoring
neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Existing
approaches for constructing structural brain networks from diffusion tensor
imaging (DTI) often rely on specialized toolkits that suffer from inherent
limitations: operator subjectivity, labor-intensive workflows, and restricted
capacity to capture complex topological features and disease-specific
biomarkers. To overcome these challenges and advance computational neuroimaging
instrumentation, ConnectomeDiffuser is proposed as a novel diffusion-based
framework for automated end-to-end brain network construction from DTI. The
proposed model combines three key components: (1) a Template Network that
extracts topological features from 3D DTI scans using Riemannian geometric
principles, (2) a diffusion model that generates comprehensive brain networks
with enhanced topological fidelity, and (3) a Graph Convolutional Network
classifier that incorporates disease-specific markers to improve diagnostic
accuracy. ConnectomeDiffuser demonstrates superior performance by capturing a
broader range of structural connectivity and pathology-related information,
enabling more sensitive analysis of individual variations in brain networks.
Experimental validation on datasets representing two distinct neurodegenerative
conditions demonstrates significant performance improvements over other brain
network methods. This work contributes to the advancement of instrumentation in
the context of neurological disorders, providing clinicians and researchers
with a robust, generalizable measurement framework that facilitates more
accurate diagnosis, deeper mechanistic understanding, and improved therapeutic
monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.

Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography enables in vivo mapping of brain structural
connections, but traditional connectome generation is time-consuming and
requires gray matter parcellation, posing challenges for large-scale studies.
We introduce DeepMultiConnectome, a deep-learning model that predicts
structural connectomes directly from tractography, bypassing the need for gray
matter parcellation while supporting multiple parcellation schemes. Using a
point-cloud-based neural network with multi-task learning, the model classifies
streamlines according to their connected regions across two parcellation
schemes, sharing a learned representation. We train and validate
DeepMultiConnectome on tractography from the Human Connectome Project Young
Adult dataset ($n = 1000$), labeled with an 84 and 164 region gray matter
parcellation scheme. DeepMultiConnectome predicts multiple structural
connectomes from a whole-brain tractogram containing 3 million streamlines in
approximately 40 seconds. DeepMultiConnectome is evaluated by comparing
predicted connectomes with traditional connectomes generated using the
conventional method of labeling streamlines using a gray matter parcellation.
The predicted connectomes are highly correlated with traditionally generated
connectomes ($r = 0.992$ for an 84-region scheme; $r = 0.986$ for a 164-region
scheme) and largely preserve network properties. A test-retest analysis of
DeepMultiConnectome demonstrates reproducibility comparable to traditionally
generated connectomes. The predicted connectomes perform similarly to
traditionally generated connectomes in predicting age and cognitive function.
Overall, DeepMultiConnectome provides a scalable, fast model for generating
subject-specific connectomes across multiple parcellation schemes.

standardization to gain wider popularity. Through this survey, we present a
comprehensive overview of PINNs approaches exploring various aspects related to
their architecture, variants, areas of application, real-world use cases,
challenges, and so on. Even though existing surveys can be identified, they
fail to provide a comprehensive view as they primarily focus on either
different application scenarios or limit their study to a superficial level.
This survey attempts to bridge the gap in the existing literature by presenting
a detailed analysis of all these factors combined with recent advancements and
state-of-the-art research in PINNs. Additionally, we discuss prevalent
challenges in PINNs implementation and present some of the future research
directions as well. The overall contributions of the survey can be summarised
into three sections: A detailed overview of PINNs architecture and variants, a
performance analysis of PINNs on different equations and application domains
highlighting their features. Finally, we present a detailed discussion of
current issues and future research directions.

TL;DR: 论文提出AURORA框架，用于评估恶意软件分类器在分布偏移下的置信度质量和操作稳定性，指出现有方法在置信度对齐和操作稳定性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有恶意软件分类器评估范式过于关注基线性能指标，忽略了置信度误差对齐和操作稳定性，导致实际应用中的可靠性问题。

Method: 提出AURORA框架，通过验证模型的置信度分布来评估其可靠性，并设计了一组超越即时性能的指标。

Result: 实验表明，现有最先进框架在不同漂移严重程度的数据集上表现脆弱，需要重新设计。

Conclusion: AURORA为恶意软件分类器的置信度质量和操作稳定性提供了更全面的评估方法，揭示了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: The performance figures of modern drift-adaptive malware classifiers appear
promising, but does this translate to genuine operational reliability? The
standard evaluation paradigm primarily focuses on baseline performance metrics,
neglecting confidence-error alignment and operational stability. While
TESSERACT established the importance of temporal evaluation, we take a
complementary direction by investigating whether malware classifiers maintain
reliable confidence estimates under distribution shifts and exploring the
tensions between scientific advancement and practical impacts when they do not.
We propose AURORA, a framework to evaluate malware classifiers based on their
confidence quality and operational resilience. AURORA subjects the confidence
profile of a given model to verification to assess the reliability of its
estimates. Unreliable confidence estimates erode operational trust, waste
valuable annotation budget on non-informative samples for active learning, and
leave error-prone instances undetected in selective classification. AURORA is
further complemented by a set of metrics designed to go beyond point-in-time
performance, striving towards a more holistic assessment of operational
stability throughout temporal evaluation periods. The fragility we observe in
state-of-the-art frameworks across datasets of varying drift severity suggests
the need for a return to the whiteboard.

Motivation: 现有统计n-gram语言模型在ASR任务中因并行化不足导致计算效率低下，限制了工业应用。

Method: 重新设计数据结构和引入自定义贪婪解码方法（NGPU-LM），支持多种ASR模型（如transducers、attention encoder-decoder、CTC），计算开销低于7%。

Result: 在域外场景下，NGPU-LM将贪婪解码与束搜索的准确性差距缩小50%以上，同时避免了束搜索的显著减速。

Conclusion: NGPU-LM通过高效并行化和低计算开销，显著提升了统计n-gram语言模型在ASR任务中的实用性。

Abstract: Statistical n-gram language models are widely used for context-biasing tasks
in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). However, existing implementations lack
computational efficiency due to poor parallelization, making context-biasing
less appealing for industrial use. This work rethinks data structures for
statistical n-gram language models to enable fast and parallel operations for
GPU-optimized inference. Our approach, named NGPU-LM, introduces customizable
greedy decoding for all major ASR model types - including transducers,
attention encoder-decoder models, and CTC - with less than 7% computational
overhead. The proposed approach can eliminate more than 50% of the accuracy gap
between greedy and beam search for out-of-domain scenarios while avoiding
significant slowdown caused by beam search. The implementation of the proposed
NGPU-LM is open-sourced.

Abstract: This paper presents a system for autonomous semantic exploration and dense
semantic target mapping of a complex unknown environment using a ground robot
equipped with a LiDAR-panoramic camera suite. Existing approaches often
struggle to balance collecting high-quality observations from multiple view
angles and avoiding unnecessary repetitive traversal. To fill this gap, we
propose a complete system combining mapping and planning. We first redefine the
task as completing both geometric coverage and semantic viewpoint observation.
We then manage semantic and geometric viewpoints separately and propose a novel
Priority-driven Decoupled Local Sampler to generate local viewpoint sets. This
enables explicit multi-view semantic inspection and voxel coverage without
unnecessary repetition. Building on this, we develop a hierarchical planner to
ensure efficient global coverage. In addition, we propose a Safe Aggressive
Exploration State Machine, which allows aggressive exploration behavior while
ensuring the robot's safety. Our system includes a plug-and-play semantic
target mapping module that integrates seamlessly with state-of-the-art SLAM
algorithms for pointcloud-level dense semantic target mapping. We validate our
approach through extensive experiments in both realistic simulations and
complex real-world environments. Simulation results show that our planner
achieves faster exploration and shorter travel distances while guaranteeing a
specified number of multi-view inspections. Real-world experiments further
confirm the system's effectiveness in achieving accurate dense semantic object
mapping of unstructured environments.

Abstract: We study the local stability of nonlinear systems in the Lur'e form with
static nonlinear feedback realized by feedforward neural networks (FFNNs). By
leveraging positivity system constraints, we employ a localized variant of the
Aizerman conjecture, which provides sufficient conditions for exponential
stability of trajectories confined to a compact set. Using this foundation, we
develop two distinct methods for estimating the Region of Attraction (ROA): (i)
a less conservative Lyapunov-based approach that constructs invariant sublevel
sets of a quadratic function satisfying a linear matrix inequality (LMI), and
(ii) a novel technique for computing tight local sector bounds for FFNNs via
layer-wise propagation of linear relaxations. These bounds are integrated into
the localized Aizerman framework to certify local exponential stability.
Numerical results demonstrate substantial improvements over existing integral
quadratic constraint-based approaches in both ROA size and scalability.

Abstract: High time complexity is one of the biggest challenges faced by $k$-Nearest
Neighbors ($k$NN). Although current classical and quantum $k$NN algorithms have
made some improvements, they still have a speed bottleneck when facing large
amounts of data. To address this issue, we propose an innovative algorithm
called Granular-Ball based Quantum $k$NN(GB-Q$k$NN). This approach achieves
higher efficiency by first employing granular-balls, which reduces the data
size needed to processed. The search process is then accelerated by adopting a
Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) method. Moreover, we optimize the
time-consuming steps, such as distance calculation, of the HNSW via
quantization, further reducing the time complexity of the construct and search
process. By combining the use of granular-balls and quantization of the HNSW
method, our approach manages to take advantage of these treatments and
significantly reduces the time complexity of the $k$NN-like algorithms, as
revealed by a comprehensive complexity analysis.

To overcome these issues, advancements in digital stethoscopes and artificial

Abstract: Path planning is a fundamental capability of autonomous Unmanned Aerial

or explore complex environments while avoiding obstacles. Traditional
pathplanning methods, such as Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT), have proven
effective but often encounter significant challenges. These include high search
space complexity, suboptimal path quality, and slow convergence, issues that
are particularly problematic in high-stakes applications like disaster
response, where rapid and efficient planning is critical. To address these
limitations and enhance path-planning efficiency, we propose Vision Language
Model RRT (VLM-RRT), a hybrid approach that integrates the pattern recognition
capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) with the path-planning strengths
of RRT. By leveraging VLMs to provide initial directional guidance based on
environmental snapshots, our method biases sampling toward regions more likely
to contain feasible paths, significantly improving sampling efficiency and path
quality. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments with various
state-of-the-art VLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of this proposed approach.

Abstract: Assessing student depression in sensitive environments like special education

this paper introduces Human Empathy as Encoder (HEAE), a novel, human-centered
AI framework for transparent and socially responsible depression severity
assessment. Our approach uniquely integrates student narrative text with a
teacher-derived, 9-dimensional "Empathy Vector" (EV), its dimensions guided by
the PHQ-9 framework,to explicitly translate tacit empathetic insight into a
structured AI input enhancing rather than replacing human judgment. Rigorous
experiments optimized the multimodal fusion, text representation, and
classification architecture, achieving 82.74% accuracy for 7-level severity
classification. This work demonstrates a path toward more responsible and
ethical affective computing by structurally embedding human empathy

Abstract: Quantitative susceptibility maps from magnetic resonance images can provide
both prognostic and diagnostic information in multiple sclerosis, a
neurodegenerative disease characterized by the formation of lesions in white
matter brain tissue. In particular, susceptibility maps provide adequate
contrast to distinguish between "rim" lesions, surrounded by deposited
paramagnetic iron, and "non-rim" lesion types. These paramagnetic rim lesions
(PRLs) are an emerging biomarker in multiple sclerosis. Much effort has been
devoted to both detection and segmentation of such lesions to monitor
longitudinal change. As paramagnetic rim lesions are rare, addressing this
problem requires confronting the class imbalance between rim and non-rim
lesions. We produce synthetic quantitative susceptibility maps of paramagnetic
rim lesions and show that inclusion of such synthetic data improves classifier
performance and provide a multi-channel extension to generate accompanying
contrasts and probabilistic segmentation maps. We exploit the projection
capability of our trained generative network to demonstrate a novel denoising
approach that allows us to train on ambiguous rim cases and substantially
increase the minority class. We show that both synthetic lesion synthesis and
our proposed rim lesion label denoising method best approximate the unseen rim
lesion distribution and improve detection in a clinically interpretable manner.
We release our code and generated data at https://github.com/agr78/PRLx-GAN

Abstract: Binaural rendering aims to synthesize binaural audio that mimics natural
hearing based on a mono audio and the locations of the speaker and listener.
Although many methods have been proposed to solve this problem, they struggle
with rendering quality and streamable inference. Synthesizing high-quality
binaural audio that is indistinguishable from real-world recordings requires
precise modeling of binaural cues, room reverb, and ambient sounds.
Additionally, real-world applications demand streaming inference. To address
these challenges, we propose a flow matching based streaming binaural speech
synthesis framework called BinauralFlow. We consider binaural rendering to be a
generation problem rather than a regression problem and design a conditional
flow matching model to render high-quality audio. Moreover, we design a causal
U-Net architecture that estimates the current audio frame solely based on past
information to tailor generative models for streaming inference. Finally, we
introduce a continuous inference pipeline incorporating streaming STFT/ISTFT
operations, a buffer bank, a midpoint solver, and an early skip schedule to
improve rendering continuity and speed. Quantitative and qualitative
evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our method over SOTA approaches. A
perceptual study further reveals that our model is nearly indistinguishable
from real-world recordings, with a $42\%$ confusion rate.

Abstract: The local structure of a protein strongly impacts its function and
interactions with other molecules. Therefore, a concise, informative
representation of a local protein environment is essential for modeling and
designing proteins and biomolecular interactions. However, these environments'
extensive structural and chemical variability makes them challenging to model,
and such representations remain under-explored. In this work, we propose a
novel representation for a local protein environment derived from the
intermediate features of atomistic foundation models (AFMs). We demonstrate
that this embedding effectively captures both local structure (e.g., secondary
motifs), and chemical features (e.g., amino-acid identity and protonation
state). We further show that the AFM-derived representation space exhibits
meaningful structure, enabling the construction of data-driven priors over the
distribution of biomolecular environments. Finally, in the context of
biomolecular NMR spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the proposed representations
enable a first-of-its-kind physics-informed chemical shift predictor that
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. Our results demonstrate the surprising
effectiveness of atomistic foundation models and their emergent representations
for protein modeling beyond traditional molecular simulations. We believe this
will open new lines of work in constructing effective functional
representations for protein environments.

Abstract: Perfusion imaging is extensively utilized to assess hemodynamic status and
tissue perfusion in various organs. Computed tomography perfusion (CTP) imaging
plays a key role in the early assessment and planning of stroke treatment.
While CTP provides essential perfusion parameters to identify abnormal blood
flow in the brain, the use of contrast agents in CTP can lead to allergic
reactions and adverse side effects, along with costing USD 4.9 billion
worldwide in 2022. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep
learning framework called Multitask Automated Generation of Intermodal CT
perfusion maps (MAGIC). This framework combines generative artificial
intelligence and physiological information to map non-contrast computed
tomography (CT) imaging to multiple contrast-free CTP imaging maps. We
demonstrate enhanced image fidelity by incorporating physiological
characteristics into the loss terms. Our network was trained and validated
using CT image data from patients referred for stroke at UF Health and
demonstrated robustness to abnormalities in brain perfusion activity. A
double-blinded study was conducted involving seven experienced
neuroradiologists and vascular neurologists. This study validated MAGIC's
visual quality and diagnostic accuracy showing favorable performance compared
to clinical perfusion imaging with intravenous contrast injection. Overall,
MAGIC holds great promise in revolutionizing healthcare by offering
contrast-free, cost-effective, and rapid perfusion imaging.

Abstract: The rapid growth of e-commerce and the increasing demand for timely,
cost-effective last-mile delivery have increased interest in collaborative
logistics. This research introduces a novel collaborative synchronized
multi-platform vehicle routing problem with drones and robots (VRP-DR), where a
fleet of $\mathcal{M}$ trucks, $\mathcal{N}$ drones and $\mathcal{K}$ robots,
cooperatively delivers parcels. Trucks serve as mobile platforms, enabling the
launching, retrieving, and en-route charging of drones and robots, thereby
addressing critical limitations such as restricted payload capacities, limited
range, and battery constraints. The VRP-DR incorporates five realistic
features: (1) multi-visit service per trip, (2) multi-trip operations, (3)
flexible docking, allowing returns to the same or different trucks (4) cyclic
and acyclic operations, enabling return to the same or different nodes; and (5)
en-route charging, enabling drones and robots to recharge while being
transported on the truck, maximizing operational efficiency by utilizing idle
transit time. The VRP-DR is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP)
to minimize both operational costs and makespan. To overcome the computational
challenges of solving large-scale instances, a scalable heuristic algorithm,
FINDER (Flexible INtegrated Delivery with Energy Recharge), is developed, to
provide efficient, near-optimal solutions. Numerical experiments across various
instance sizes evaluate the performance of the MILP and heuristic approaches in
terms of solution quality and computation time. The results demonstrate
significant time savings of the combined delivery mode over the truck-only mode
and substantial cost reductions from enabling multi-visits. The study also
provides insights into the effects of en-route charging, docking flexibility,
drone count, speed, and payload capacity on system performance.

Abstract: Fueled by their remarkable ability to tackle diverse tasks across multiple
domains, large language models (LLMs) have grown at an unprecedented rate, with
some recent models containing trillions of parameters. This growth is
accompanied by substantial computational challenges, particularly regarding the
memory and compute resources required for training and fine-tuning. Numerous
approaches have been explored to address these issues, such as LoRA. While
these methods are effective for fine-tuning, their application to pre-training
is significantly more challenging due to the need to learn vast datasets.
Motivated by this issue, we aim to address the following questions: Can
parameter- or memory-efficient methods enhance pre-training efficiency while
achieving performance comparable to full-model training? How can the
performance gap be narrowed? To this end, the contributions of this work are
the following. (1) We begin by conducting a comprehensive survey that
summarizes state-of-the-art methods for efficient pre-training. (2) We perform
a benchmark evaluation of several representative memory efficient pre-training
approaches to comprehensively evaluate their performance across model sizes. We
observe that with a proper choice of optimizer and hyperparameters, full-rank
training delivers the best performance, as expected. We also notice that
incorporating high-rank updates in low-rank approaches is the key to improving
their performance. (3) Finally, we propose two practical techniques, namely
weight refactorization and momentum reset, to enhance the performance of
efficient pre-training methods. We observe that applying these techniques to
the low-rank method (on a 1B model) can achieve a lower perplexity than popular
memory efficient algorithms such as GaLore and Fira, while simultaneously using
about 25% less memory.

Abstract: The reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) has been rapidly
advancing in recent years, attracting interest in more fundamental approaches
that can reliably enhance their generalizability. This work demonstrates that
model complexity control, conveniently implementable by adjusting the
initialization rate and weight decay coefficient, improves the scaling law of
LLMs consistently over varying model sizes and data sizes. This gain is further
illustrated by comparing the benchmark performance of 2.4B models pretrained on
1T tokens with different complexity hyperparameters. Instead of fixing the
initialization std, we found that a constant initialization rate (the exponent
of std) enables the scaling law to descend faster in both model and data sizes.
These results indicate that complexity control is a promising direction for the
continual advancement of LLMs.

Result: GRPOVI算法显著提高了RLHF训练效率。

Conclusion: 奖励调整模型和GRPOVI算法为RLHF训练提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is an essential technique
for ensuring that large language models (LLMs) are aligned with human values
and preferences during the post-training phase. As an effective RLHF approach,
group relative policy optimization (GRPO) has demonstrated success in many
LLM-based applications. However, efficient GRPO-based RLHF training remains a
challenge. Recent studies reveal that a higher reward variance of the initial
policy model leads to faster RLHF training. Inspired by this finding, we
propose a practical reward adjustment model to accelerate RLHF training by
provably increasing the reward variance and preserving the relative preferences
and reward expectation. Our reward adjustment method inherently poses a
nonconvex optimization problem, which is NP-hard to solve in general. To
overcome the computational challenges, we design a novel $O(n \log n)$
algorithm to find a global solution of the nonconvex reward adjustment model by
explicitly characterizing the extreme points of the feasible set. As an
important application, we naturally integrate this reward adjustment model into
the GRPO algorithm, leading to a more efficient GRPO with reward variance
increase (GRPOVI) algorithm for RLHF training. As an interesting byproduct, we
provide an indirect explanation for the empirical effectiveness of GRPO with
rule-based reward for RLHF training, as demonstrated in DeepSeek-R1. Experiment
results demonstrate that the GRPOVI algorithm can significantly improve the
RLHF training efficiency compared to the original GRPO algorithm.

Conclusion: AnchorAttention通过更细粒度的稀疏策略，显著提升了长上下文LLM的计算效率和准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with extended context lengths face significant
computational challenges during the pre-filling phase, primarily due to the
quadratic complexity of self-attention. Existing methods typically employ
dynamic pattern matching and block-sparse low-level implementations. However,
their reliance on local information for pattern identification fails to capture
global contexts, and the coarse granularity of blocks leads to persistent
internal sparsity, resulting in suboptimal accuracy and efficiency. To address
these limitations, we propose \textbf{AnchorAttention}, a difference-aware,
dynamic sparse attention mechanism that efficiently identifies critical
attention regions at a finer stripe granularity while adapting to global
contextual information, achieving superior speed and accuracy. AnchorAttention
comprises three key components: (1) \textbf{Pattern-based Anchor Computation},
leveraging the commonalities present across all inputs to rapidly compute a set
of near-maximum scores as the anchor; (2) \textbf{Difference-aware Stripe
Sparsity Identification}, performing difference-aware comparisons with the
anchor to quickly obtain discrete coordinates of significant regions in a
stripe-like sparsity pattern; (3) \textbf{Fine-grained Sparse Computation},
replacing the traditional contiguous KV block loading approach with
simultaneous discrete KV position loading to maximize sparsity rates while
preserving full hardware computational potential. With its finer-grained
sparsity strategy, \textbf{AnchorAttention} achieves higher sparsity rates at
the same recall level, significantly reducing computation time. Compared to
previous state-of-the-art methods, at a text length of 128k, it achieves a
speedup of 1.44$\times$ while maintaining higher recall rates.

Abstract: Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models effectively
using reinforcement learning (RL) remains a crucial challenge. Existing
approaches primarily adopt two contrasting advantage estimation granularities:
Token-level methods (e.g., PPO) aim to provide the fine-grained advantage
signals but suffer from inaccurate estimation due to difficulties in training
an accurate critic model. On the other extreme, trajectory-level methods (e.g.,
GRPO) solely rely on a coarse-grained advantage signal from the final reward,
leading to imprecise credit assignment. To address these limitations, we
propose Segment Policy Optimization (SPO), a novel RL framework that leverages
segment-level advantage estimation at an intermediate granularity, achieving a
better balance by offering more precise credit assignment than trajectory-level
methods and requiring fewer estimation points than token-level methods,
enabling accurate advantage estimation based on Monte Carlo (MC) without a
critic model. SPO features three components with novel strategies: (1) flexible
segment partition; (2) accurate segment advantage estimation; and (3) policy
optimization using segment advantages, including a novel probability-mask
strategy. We further instantiate SPO for two specific scenarios: (1) SPO-chain
for short chain-of-thought (CoT), featuring novel cutpoint-based partition and
chain-based advantage estimation, achieving $6$-$12$ percentage point
improvements in accuracy over PPO and GRPO on GSM8K. (2) SPO-tree for long CoT,
featuring novel tree-based advantage estimation, which significantly reduces
the cost of MC estimation, achieving $7$-$11$ percentage point improvements
over GRPO on MATH500 under 2K and 4K context evaluation. We make our code
publicly available at https://github.com/AIFrameResearch/SPO.

Abstract: Large language models(LLMs) have garnered significant attention and
demonstrated impressive capabilities in a wide range of applications. However,
due to their enormous computational costs, the deployment and application of
LLMs are often severely limited. To address this issue, structured pruning is
an effective solution to compress the parameters of LLMs. Determining the
importance of each sub-module in LLMs and minimizing performance loss are
critical issues that need to be carefully addressed in structured pruning. In
this paper, we propose an effective and fast structured pruning method named
SlimLLM for large language models. For channel and attention head pruning, we
evaluate the importance based on the entire channel or head, rather than merely
aggregating the importance of individual elements within a sub-module. This
approach enables a more holistic consideration of the interdependence among
elements within the sub-module. In addition, we design a simple linear
regression strategy for the output matrix to quickly recover performance. We
also propose layer-based importance ratio to determine the pruning ratio for
each layer. Based on the LLaMA benchmark results, our SlimLLM outperforms other
methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs),
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have gained significant
attention, which aims to achieve efficient fine-tuning of LLMs with fewer
parameters. As a representative PEFT method, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
introduces low-rank matrices to approximate the incremental tuning parameters
and achieves impressive performance over multiple scenarios. After that, plenty
of improvements have been proposed for further improvement. However, these
methods either focus on single-task scenarios or separately train multiple LoRA
modules for multi-task scenarios, limiting the efficiency and effectiveness of
LoRA in multi-task scenarios. To better adapt to multi-task fine-tuning, in
this paper, we propose a novel Mixture of Low-Rank Experts (MoRE) for
multi-task PEFT. Specifically, instead of using an individual LoRA for each
task, we align different ranks of LoRA module with different tasks, which we
named low-rank experts. Moreover, we design a novel adaptive rank selector to
select the appropriate expert for each task. By jointly training low-rank
experts, MoRE can enhance the adaptability and efficiency of LoRA in multi-task
scenarios. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments over multiple multi-task
benchmarks along with different LLMs to verify model performance. Experimental
results demonstrate that compared to traditional LoRA and its variants, MoRE
significantly improves the performance of LLMs in multi-task scenarios and
incurs no additional inference cost. We also release the model and code to
facilitate the community.

Abstract: Foundation models serve as the backbone for numerous specialized models
developed through fine-tuning. However, when the underlying pretrained model is
updated or retrained (e.g., on larger and more curated datasets), the
fine-tuned model becomes obsolete, losing its utility and requiring retraining.
This raises the question: is it possible to transfer fine-tuning to a new
release of the model? In this work, we investigate how to transfer fine-tuning
to a new checkpoint without having to re-train, in a data-free manner. To do
so, we draw principles from model re-basin and provide a recipe based on weight
permutations to re-base the modifications made to the original base model,
often called task vector. In particular, our approach tailors model re-basin
for Transformer models, taking into account the challenges of residual
connections and multi-head attention layers. Specifically, we propose a
two-level method rooted in spectral theory, initially permuting the attention
heads and subsequently adjusting parameters within select pairs of heads.
Through extensive experiments on visual and textual tasks, we achieve the
seamless transfer of fine-tuned knowledge to new pre-trained backbones without
relying on a single training step or datapoint. Code is available at

Abstract: Many problems in trustworthy ML can be formulated as minimization of the
model error under constraints on the prediction rates of the model for
suitably-chosen marginals, including most group fairness constraints
(demographic parity, equality of odds, etc.). In this work, we study such
constrained minimization problems under differential privacy (DP). Standard DP
optimization techniques like DP-SGD rely on the loss function's decomposability
into per-sample contributions. However, rate constraints introduce inter-sample
dependencies, violating the decomposability requirement. To address this, we
develop RaCO-DP, a DP variant of the Stochastic Gradient Descent-Ascent (SGDA)
algorithm which solves the Lagrangian formulation of rate constraint problems.
We demonstrate that the additional privacy cost of incorporating these
constraints reduces to privately estimating a histogram over the mini-batch at
each optimization step. We prove the convergence of our algorithm through a
novel analysis of SGDA that leverages the linear structure of the dual
parameter. Finally, empirical results on learning under group fairness
constraints demonstrate that our method Pareto-dominates existing private
learning approaches in fairness-utility trade-offs.

Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of response time data into human
preference learning frameworks for more effective reward model elicitation.
While binary preference data has become fundamental in fine-tuning foundation
models, generative AI systems, and other large-scale models, the valuable
temporal information inherent in user decision-making remains largely
unexploited. We propose novel methodologies to incorporate response time
information alongside binary choice data, leveraging the Evidence Accumulation
Drift Diffusion (EZ) model, under which response time is informative of the
preference strength. We develop Neyman-orthogonal loss functions that achieve
oracle convergence rates for reward model learning, matching the theoretical
optimal rates that would be attained if the expected response times for each
query were known a priori. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that for
linear reward functions, conventional preference learning suffers from error
rates that scale exponentially with reward magnitude. In contrast, our response
time-augmented approach reduces this to polynomial scaling, representing a
significant improvement in sample efficiency. We extend these guarantees to
non-parametric reward function spaces, establishing convergence properties for
more complex, realistic reward models. Our extensive experiments validate our
theoretical findings in the context of preference learning over images.

Abstract: We demonstrate that unstructured sparsity significantly improves KV cache
compression for LLMs, enabling sparsity levels up to 70% without compromising
accuracy or requiring fine-tuning. We conduct a systematic exploration of
pruning strategies and find per-token magnitude-based pruning as highly
effective for both Key and Value caches under unstructured sparsity, surpassing
prior structured pruning schemes. The Key cache benefits from prominent outlier
elements, while the Value cache surprisingly benefits from a simple
magnitude-based pruning despite its uniform distribution. KV cache size is the
major bottleneck in decode performance due to high memory overhead for large
context lengths. To address this, we use a bitmap-based sparse format and a
custom attention kernel capable of compressing and directly computing over
compressed caches pruned to arbitrary sparsity patterns, significantly

Abstract: Despite the promise of autonomous agentic reasoning, existing workflow
generation methods frequently produce fragile, unexecutable plans due to
unconstrained LLM-driven construction. We introduce MermaidFlow, a framework
that redefines the agentic search space through safety-constrained graph
evolution. At its core, MermaidFlow represent workflows as a verifiable
intermediate representation using Mermaid, a structured and human-interpretable
graph language. We formulate domain-aware evolutionary operators, i.e.,
crossover, mutation, insertion, and deletion, to preserve semantic correctness
while promoting structural diversity, enabling efficient exploration of a
high-quality, statically verifiable workflow space. Without modifying task
settings or evaluation protocols, MermaidFlow achieves consistent improvements
in success rates and faster convergence to executable plans on the agent
reasoning benchmark. The experimental results demonstrate that
safety-constrained graph evolution offers a scalable, modular foundation for
robust and interpretable agentic reasoning systems.

Result: 实验表明，YAQA将KL散度降低约30%，并在下游任务中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: YAQA通过全局优化量化误差，显著提升了量化模型的性能。

Abstract: The main goal of post-training quantization (PTQ) is to produced a compressed
model whose output distribution is as close to the original model's as
possible. To do this tractably, almost all LLM PTQ algorithms quantize linear
layers by independently minimizing the immediate activation error. However,
this localized objective ignores the effect of subsequent layers, so reducing
it does not necessarily give a closer model. In this work, we introduce Yet
Another Quantization Algorithm (YAQA), an adaptive rounding algorithm that uses
Kronecker-factored approximations of each linear layer's Hessian with respect
to the \textit{full model} KL divergence. YAQA consists of two components:
Kronecker-factored sketches of the full layerwise Hessian that can be tractably
computed for hundred-billion parameter LLMs, and a quantizer-independent
rounding algorithm that uses these sketches and comes with theoretical
guarantees. Across a wide range of models and quantizers, YAQA empirically
reduces the KL divergence to the original model by $\approx 30\%$ while
achieving state of the art performance on downstream tasks.

Abstract: Bargaining, a critical aspect of real-world interactions, presents challenges
for large language models (LLMs) due to limitations in strategic depth and
adaptation to complex human factors. Existing benchmarks often fail to capture
this real-world complexity. To address this and enhance LLM capabilities in
realistic bargaining, we introduce a comprehensive framework centered on
utility-based feedback. Our contributions are threefold: (1) BargainArena, a
novel benchmark dataset with six intricate scenarios (e.g., deceptive
practices, monopolies) to facilitate diverse strategy modeling; (2)
human-aligned, economically-grounded evaluation metrics inspired by utility
theory, incorporating agent utility and negotiation power, which implicitly
reflect and promote opponent-aware reasoning (OAR); and (3) a structured
feedback mechanism enabling LLMs to iteratively refine their bargaining
strategies. This mechanism can positively collaborate with in-context learning
(ICL) prompts, including those explicitly designed to foster OAR. Experimental
results show that LLMs often exhibit negotiation strategies misaligned with
human preferences, and that our structured feedback mechanism significantly
improves their performance, yielding deeper strategic and opponent-aware
reasoning.

Abstract: Robust reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn policies that remain
effective despite uncertainties in its environment, which frequently arise in
real-world applications due to variations in environment dynamics. The robust
RL methods learn a robust policy by maximizing value under the worst-case
models within a predefined uncertainty set. Offline robust RL algorithms are
particularly promising in scenarios where only a fixed dataset is available and
new data cannot be collected. However, these approaches often require extensive
offline data, and gathering such datasets for specific tasks in specific
environments can be both costly and time-consuming. Using an imperfect
simulator offers a faster, cheaper, and safer way to collect data for training,
but it can suffer from dynamics mismatch. In this paper, we introduce HYDRO,
the first Hybrid Cross-Domain Robust RL framework designed to address these
challenges. HYDRO utilizes an online simulator to complement the limited amount
of offline datasets in the non-trivial context of robust RL. By measuring and
minimizing performance gaps between the simulator and the worst-case models in
the uncertainty set, HYDRO employs novel uncertainty filtering and prioritized
sampling to select the most relevant and reliable simulator samples. Our
extensive experiments demonstrate HYDRO's superior performance over existing
methods across various tasks, underscoring its potential to improve sample
efficiency in offline robust RL.

Result: QLIP显著提升了LLaVA v1.5系列模型的视觉问答准确率，在V*基准上详细理解性能提升13.6%。

Conclusion: QLIP是一种高效、无需重新训练的CLIP替代方案，适用于现有MLLMs。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) encode images into visual tokens,
aligning visual and textual signals within a shared latent space to facilitate
crossmodal representation learning. The CLIP model is a widely adopted
foundational vision language model whose vision encoder has played a critical
role in the development of MLLMs such as LLaVA. However, the CLIP vision
encoder suffers from notable limitations including being constrained to only
handling fixed input resolutions and a failure to produce separated embeddings
for dissimilar images. Replacing the vision encoder of an existing model
typically incurs substantial computational costs because such a change often
necessitates retraining the entire model pipeline.
  In this work, we identify two factors which underlie the limitations of the
CLIP vision encoder: mesoscopic bias and interpolation bias. To address these
issues, we propose QLIP, a drop-in replacement for CLIP that can be seamlessly
integrated with existing MLLMs with only a few lines of code and can enhance
both coarse-grained and fine-grained visual understanding, without re-training.
QLIP is designed around an image quadtree which replaces the standard uniform
grid patches with a novel content aware patchification. Our experimental
results demonstrate that QLIP improves the general visual question answering
accuracy of the LLaVA v1.5 model series across various model sizes--without
requiring retraining or fine-tuning of the full MLLM. Notably, QLIP boosts
detailed understanding performance on the challenging $V^{\ast}$ benchmark by
up to 13.6 percent.

Abstract: Existing Large Language Model (LLM) serving systems prioritize maximum

a VBS-based admission control and a novel credit-based batching mechanism. Both

Abstract: Scaling has been a major driver of recent advancements in deep learning.
Numerous empirical studies have found that scaling laws often follow the
power-law and proposed several variants of power-law functions to predict the
scaling behavior at larger scales. However, existing methods mostly rely on
point estimation and do not quantify uncertainty, which is crucial for
real-world applications involving decision-making problems such as determining
the expected performance improvements achievable by investing additional
computational resources. In this work, we explore a Bayesian framework based on
Prior-data Fitted Networks (PFNs) for neural scaling law extrapolation.
Specifically, we design a prior distribution that enables the sampling of
infinitely many synthetic functions resembling real-world neural scaling laws,
allowing our PFN to meta-learn the extrapolation. We validate the effectiveness
of our approach on real-world neural scaling laws, comparing it against both
the existing point estimation methods and Bayesian approaches. Our method
demonstrates superior performance, particularly in data-limited scenarios such
as Bayesian active learning, underscoring its potential for reliable,
uncertainty-aware extrapolation in practical applications.

Abstract: Pruning is a widely used technique to compress large language models (LLMs)
by removing unimportant weights, but it often suffers from significant
performance degradation - especially under semi-structured sparsity
constraints. Existing pruning methods primarily focus on estimating the
importance of individual weights, which limits their ability to preserve
critical capabilities of the model. In this work, we propose a new perspective:
rather than merely selecting which weights to prune, we first redistribute
parameter importance to make the model inherently more amenable to pruning. By
minimizing the information entropy of normalized importance scores, our
approach concentrates importance onto a smaller subset of weights, thereby
enhancing pruning robustness. We instantiate this idea through DenoiseRotator,
which applies learnable orthogonal transformations to the model's weight
matrices. Our method is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated with
existing pruning techniques such as Magnitude, SparseGPT, and Wanda. Evaluated
on LLaMA3, Qwen2.5, and Mistral models under 50% unstructured and 2:4
semi-structured sparsity, DenoiseRotator consistently improves perplexity and
zero-shot accuracy. For instance, on LLaMA3-70B pruned with SparseGPT at 2:4
semi-structured sparsity, DenoiseRotator reduces the perplexity gap to the
dense model by 58%, narrowing the degradation from 8.1 to 3.4 points. Codes are

Result: 在符号数学和JSON生成基准测试中，DINGO比无约束推理提高了68个百分点。

Conclusion: DINGO为扩散LLMs提供了一种高效且分布保留的约束解码方案。

Abstract: Diffusion LLMs have emerged as a promising alternative to conventional
autoregressive LLMs, offering significant potential for improved runtime
efficiency. However, existing diffusion models lack the ability to provably
enforce user-specified formal constraints, such as regular expressions, which
makes them unreliable for tasks that require structured outputs, such as
fixed-schema JSON generation. Unlike autoregressive models that generate tokens
sequentially, diffusion LLMs predict a block of tokens in parallel. This
parallelism makes traditional constrained decoding algorithms, which are
designed for sequential token prediction, ineffective at preserving the true
output distribution. To address this limitation, we propose DINGO, a dynamic
programming-based constrained decoding strategy that is both efficient and
provably distribution-preserving. DINGO enables sampling of output strings with
the highest probability under the model's predicted distribution, while
strictly satisfying any user-specified regular expression. On standard symbolic
math and JSON generation benchmarks, DINGO achieves up to a 68 percentage point
improvement over unconstrained inference

Conclusion: CompFlow通过理论支持的动态差距估计和主动探索策略，显著提升了强化学习在动态差异环境中的性能。

Abstract: Incorporating pre-collected offline data from a source environment can
significantly improve the sample efficiency of reinforcement learning (RL), but
this benefit is often challenged by discrepancies between the transition
dynamics of the source and target environments. Existing methods typically
address this issue by penalizing or filtering out source transitions in high
dynamics-gap regions. However, their estimation of the dynamics gap often
relies on KL divergence or mutual information, which can be ill-defined when
the source and target dynamics have disjoint support. To overcome these
limitations, we propose CompFlow, a method grounded in the theoretical
connection between flow matching and optimal transport. Specifically, we model
the target dynamics as a conditional flow built upon the output distribution of
the source-domain flow, rather than learning it directly from a Gaussian prior.
This composite structure offers two key advantages: (1) improved generalization
for learning target dynamics, and (2) a principled estimation of the dynamics
gap via the Wasserstein distance between source and target transitions.
Leveraging our principled estimation of the dynamics gap, we further introduce
an optimistic active data collection strategy that prioritizes exploration in
regions of high dynamics gap, and theoretically prove that it reduces the
performance disparity with the optimal policy. Empirically, CompFlow
outperforms strong baselines across several RL benchmarks with shifted
dynamics.

Abstract: The rapid development of large language models has revolutionized natural
language processing, but their fine-tuning remains computationally expensive,
hindering broad deployment. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods,
such as LoRA, have emerged as solutions. Recent work like DoRA attempts to
further decompose weight adaptation into direction and magnitude components.
However, existing formulations often define direction heuristically at the
column level, lacking a principled geometric foundation. In this paper, we
propose MAP, a novel framework that reformulates weight matrices as
high-dimensional vectors and decouples their adaptation into direction and
magnitude in a rigorous manner. MAP normalizes the pre-trained weights, learns
a directional update, and introduces two scalar coefficients to independently
scale the magnitude of the base and update vectors. This design enables more
interpretable and flexible adaptation, and can be seamlessly integrated into
existing PEFT methods. Extensive experiments show that MAP significantly
improves performance when coupling with existing methods, offering a simple yet
powerful enhancement to existing PEFT methods. Given the universality and
simplicity of MAP, we hope it can serve as a default setting for designing
future PEFT methods.

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models have demonstrated remarkable versatility across
a wide range of downstream tasks. However, fully fine-tuning these models
incurs prohibitive computational costs, motivating the development of
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA, which introduces
low-rank updates to pre-trained weights. Despite their empirical success, the
underlying mechanisms by which PEFT modifies model parameters remain
underexplored. In this work, we present a systematic investigation into the
structural changes of weight matrices during fully fine-tuning. Through
singular value decomposition (SVD), we reveal that fine-tuning predominantly
amplifies the top singular values while leaving the remainder largely intact,
suggesting that task-specific knowledge is injected into a low-dimensional
subspace. Furthermore, we find that the dominant singular vectors are
reoriented in task-specific directions, whereas the non-dominant subspace
remains stable. Building on these insights, we propose a novel method that
leverages learnable rescaling of top singular directions, enabling precise
modulation of the most influential components without disrupting the global
structure. Our approach achieves consistent improvements over strong baselines
across multiple tasks, highlighting the efficacy of structurally informed
fine-tuning.

Abstract: In the era of large-scale training, model merging has evolved into a tool for
creating multitasking models efficiently. It enables the knowledge of models to
be fused, without the need for heavy computation as required in traditional
multitask learning. Existing merging methods often assume that entries at
identical positions in weight matrices serve the same function, enabling
straightforward entry-wise comparison and merging. However, this assumption
overlooks the complexity of finetuned neural networks, where neurons may
develop distinct feature compositions, making direct entry-wise merging
problematic. We present Decom-Renorm-Merge (DRM), a simple yet effective
approach that leverages Singular Value Decomposition to decompose and
coordinate weight matrices into an aligned joint space, where entry-wise
merging becomes possible. We showcase the effectiveness of DRM across various
settings ranging from smaller encoder-based such as ViT and DeBERTa,
encoder-decoder-based such as T5, and larger decoder-based such as Llama3.1-8B.
Our experimental results show that DRM outperforms several state-of-the-art
merging techniques across full finetuning and low-rank adaptation settings.
Moreover, our analysis reveals renormalization as the crucial component for
creating a robust and even joint space for merging, significantly contributing
to the method's performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated in software

and often requires costly manual review. Verifiable code generation -- jointly
generating code, specifications, and proofs of code-specification alignment --
offers a promising path to address this limitation and further unleash LLMs'

benchmarks often lack support for end-to-end verifiable code generation. In
this paper, we introduce Verina (Verifiable Code Generation Arena), a
high-quality benchmark enabling a comprehensive and modular evaluation of code,
specification, and proof generation as well as their compositions. Verina
consists of 189 manually curated coding tasks in Lean, with detailed problem
descriptions, reference implementations, formal specifications, and extensive

verification domains. The best model, OpenAI o4-mini, generates only 61.4%
correct code, 51.0% sound and complete specifications, and 3.6% successful

Abstract: Recent advances in language modeling and vision stem from training large
models on diverse, multi-task data. This paradigm has had limited impact in
value-based reinforcement learning (RL), where improvements are often driven by
small models trained in a single-task context. This is because in multi-task RL
sparse rewards and gradient conflicts make optimization of temporal difference
brittle. Practical workflows for generalist policies therefore avoid online
training, instead cloning expert trajectories or distilling collections of
single-task policies into one agent. In this work, we show that the use of
high-capacity value models trained via cross-entropy and conditioned on
learnable task embeddings addresses the problem of task interference in online
RL, allowing for robust and scalable multi-task training. We test our approach
on 7 multi-task benchmarks with over 280 unique tasks, spanning high
degree-of-freedom humanoid control and discrete vision-based RL. We find that,
despite its simplicity, the proposed approach leads to state-of-the-art single
and multi-task performance, as well as sample-efficient transfer to new tasks.

Conclusion: RadarGate通过几何旋转操作显著提升了LoRA-based MoE的可扩展性和表达能力。

Abstract: Scaling Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) facilitates
large language models (LLMs) to efficiently adapt to diverse tasks. However,
traditional gating mechanisms that route inputs to the best experts may
fundamentally hinder LLMs' scalability, leading to poor generalization and
underfitting issues. We identify that the root cause lies in the restricted
expressiveness of existing weighted-sum mechanisms, both within and outside the
convex cone of LoRA representations. This motivates us to propose RadarGate, a
novel geometrically inspired gating method that introduces rotational
operations of LoRAs representations to boost the expressiveness and facilitate
richer feature interactions among multiple LoRAs for scalable LLMs.
Specifically, we first fuse each LoRA representation to other LoRAs using a
learnable component and then feed the output to a rotation matrix. This matrix
involves learnable parameters that define the relative angular relationship
between LoRA representations. Such a simple yet effective mechanism provides an
extra degree of freedom, facilitating the learning of cross-LoRA synergies and
properly tracking the challenging poor generalization and underfitting issues
as the number of LoRA grows. Extensive experiments on 6 public benchmarks
across 21 tasks show the effectiveness of our RadarGate for scaling LoRAs. We
also provide valuable insights, revealing that the rotations to each pair of
representations are contrastive, encouraging closer alignment of semantically
similar representations during geometrical transformation while pushing
distance ones further apart. We will release our code to the community.

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used parameter-efficient fine-tuning
method. In standard LoRA layers, one of the matrices, $A$ or $B$, is
initialized to zero, ensuring that fine-tuning starts from the pretrained
model. However, there is no theoretical support for this practice. In this
paper, we investigate the impact of non-zero initialization on LoRA's
fine-tuning dynamics from an infinite-width perspective. Our analysis reveals
that, compared to zero initialization, simultaneously initializing $A$ and $B$
to non-zero values improves LoRA's robustness to suboptimal learning rates,
particularly smaller ones. Further analysis indicates that although the
non-zero initialization of $AB$ introduces random noise into the pretrained
weight, it generally does not affect fine-tuning performance. In other words,
fine-tuning does not need to strictly start from the pretrained model. The
validity of our findings is confirmed through extensive experiments across
various models and datasets. The code is available at

Result: Daunce在视觉任务和LLM微调任务中表现优异，并首次在OpenAI的GPT模型上实现了数据归因。

Conclusion: Daunce为数据归因提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案，特别适用于大规模LLMs。

Abstract: Training data attribution (TDA) methods aim to identify which training
examples influence a model's predictions on specific test data most. By
quantifying these influences, TDA supports critical applications such as data
debugging, curation, and valuation. Gradient-based TDA methods rely on
gradients and second-order information, limiting their applicability at scale.
While recent random projection-based methods improve scalability, they often
suffer from degraded attribution accuracy. Motivated by connections between
uncertainty and influence functions, we introduce Daunce - a simple yet
effective data attribution approach through uncertainty estimation. Our method
operates by fine-tuning a collection of perturbed models and computing the
covariance of per-example losses across these models as the attribution score.
Daunce is scalable to large language models (LLMs) and achieves more accurate
attribution compared to existing TDA methods. We validate Daunce on tasks
ranging from vision tasks to LLM fine-tuning, and further demonstrate its
compatibility with black-box model access. Applied to OpenAI's GPT models, our
method achieves, to our knowledge, the first instance of data attribution on
proprietary LLMs.

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
advancements, drawing significant attention from the research community. Their
capabilities are largely attributed to large-scale architectures, which require
extensive training on massive datasets. However, such datasets often contain
sensitive or copyrighted content sourced from the public internet, raising
concerns about data privacy and ownership. Regulatory frameworks, such as the
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), grant individuals the right to
request the removal of such sensitive information. This has motivated the
development of machine unlearning algorithms that aim to remove specific
knowledge from models without the need for costly retraining. Despite these
advancements, evaluating the efficacy of unlearning algorithms remains a
challenge due to the inherent complexity and generative nature of LLMs. In this
work, we introduce a comprehensive auditing framework for unlearning
evaluation, comprising three benchmark datasets, six unlearning algorithms, and
five prompt-based auditing methods. By using various auditing algorithms, we
evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of different unlearning strategies.
To explore alternatives beyond prompt-based auditing, we propose a novel
technique that leverages intermediate activation perturbations, addressing the
limitations of auditing methods that rely solely on model inputs and outputs.

Abstract: Rewards serve as proxies for human preferences and play a crucial role in
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). However, if these rewards
are inherently imperfect, exhibiting various biases, they can adversely affect
the alignment of large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we collectively
define the various biases present in rewards as the problem of reward
unfairness. We propose a bias-agnostic method to address the issue of reward
fairness from a resource allocation perspective, without specifically designing
for each type of bias, yet effectively mitigating them. Specifically, we model
preference learning as a resource allocation problem, treating rewards as
resources to be allocated while considering the trade-off between utility and
fairness in their distribution. We propose two methods, Fairness Regularization
and Fairness Coefficient, to achieve fairness in rewards. We apply our methods
in both verification and reinforcement learning scenarios to obtain a fairness
reward model and a policy model, respectively. Experiments conducted in these
scenarios demonstrate that our approach aligns LLMs with human preferences in a
more fair manner.

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have advanced
rapidly, particularly following the release of DeepSeek R1, which has inspired
a surge of research into data quality and reinforcement learning (RL)
algorithms. Despite the pivotal role diversity plays in RL, its influence on
LLM reasoning remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, this work
presents a systematic investigation into the impact of diversity in RL-based
training for LLM reasoning, and proposes a novel diversity-aware policy
optimization method. Across evaluations on 12 LLMs, we observe a strong
positive correlation between the solution diversity and Potential at k (a novel
metric quantifying an LLM's reasoning potential) in high-performing models.
This finding motivates our method to explicitly promote diversity during RL
training. Specifically, we design a token-level diversity and reformulate it
into a practical objective, then we selectively apply it to positive samples.
Integrated into the R1-zero training framework, our method achieves a 3.5
percent average improvement across four mathematical reasoning benchmarks,
while generating more diverse and robust solutions.

Abstract: At the core of reinforcement learning is the idea of learning beyond the
performance in the data. However, scaling such systems has proven notoriously
tricky. In contrast, techniques from generative modeling have proven remarkably
scalable and are simple to train. In this work, we combine these strengths, by
deriving a direct relation between policy improvement and guidance of diffusion
models. The resulting framework, CFGRL, is trained with the simplicity of
supervised learning, yet can further improve on the policies in the data. On
offline RL tasks, we observe a reliable trend -- increased guidance weighting
leads to increased performance. Of particular importance, CFGRL can operate
without explicitly learning a value function, allowing us to generalize simple
supervised methods (e.g., goal-conditioned behavioral cloning) to further
prioritize optimality, gaining performance for "free" across the board.

Abstract: Modern reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have found success by using
powerful probabilistic models, such as transformers, energy-based models, and
diffusion/flow-based models. To this end, RL researchers often choose to pay
the price of accommodating these models into their algorithms -- diffusion
models are expressive, but are computationally intensive due to their reliance
on solving differential equations, while autoregressive transformer models are
scalable but typically require learning discrete representations. Normalizing
flows (NFs), by contrast, seem to provide an appealing alternative, as they
enable likelihoods and sampling without solving differential equations or
autoregressive architectures. However, their potential in RL has received
limited attention, partly due to the prevailing belief that normalizing flows
lack sufficient expressivity. We show that this is not the case. Building on
recent work in NFs, we propose a single NF architecture which integrates
seamlessly into RL algorithms, serving as a policy, Q-function, and occupancy
measure. Our approach leads to much simpler algorithms, and achieves higher
performance in imitation learning, offline, goal conditioned RL and
unsupervised RL.

Abstract: Federated LoRA has emerged as a promising technique for efficiently
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on distributed devices by reducing the
number of trainable parameters. However, existing approaches often inadequately
overlook the theoretical and practical implications of system and data
heterogeneity, thereby failing to optimize the overall training efficiency,
particularly in terms of wall-clock time. In this paper, we propose an adaptive
federated LoRA strategy with independent client sampling to minimize the
convergence wall-clock time of federated fine-tuning under both computation and
communication heterogeneity. We first derive a new convergence bound for
federated LoRA with arbitrary and independent client sampling, notably without
requiring the stringent bounded gradient assumption. Then, we introduce an
adaptive bandwidth allocation scheme that accounts for heterogeneous client
resources and system bandwidth constraints. Based on the derived theory, we
formulate and solve a non-convex optimization problem to jointly determine the
LoRA sketching ratios and sampling probabilities, aiming to minimize wall-clock
convergence time. An efficient and low-complexity algorithm is developed to
approximate the solution. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach significantly reduces wall-clock training time compared to
state-of-the-art methods across various models and datasets.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms are fundamental to align large language

However, current reinforcement learning algorithms often suffer from training

due to auxiliary models. In this work, we propose On-Policy RL with Optimal

designed to address these challenges. OPO emphasizes the importance of exact
on-policy training, which empirically stabilizes the training process and
enhances exploration. Moreover, OPO introduces the optimal reward baseline that
theoretically minimizes gradient variance. We evaluate OPO on mathematical
reasoning benchmarks. The results demonstrate its superior performance and
training stability without additional models or regularization terms.
Furthermore, OPO achieves lower policy shifts and higher output entropy,
encouraging more diverse and less repetitive responses. These results highlight
OPO as a promising direction for stable and effective reinforcement learning in
large language model alignment and reasoning tasks. The implementation is

obfuscated to a level where the text would be unintelligible to human readers,
and does not contain key pieces of instruction or context. We introduce the
concept of eager pattern matching to describe this behaviour, which is not
observed in tasks published after the models' knowledge cutoff date, indicating
strong memorisation or overfitting to training data, rather than legitimate
reasoning about the presented problem. We report empirical evidence of distinct
performance decay patterns between contaminated and unseen datasets. We discuss
the implications for benchmarking and evaluations of model behaviour, arguing
for caution when designing experiments using standard datasets. We also propose
measuring the decay of performance under obfuscation as a possible strategy for

Abstract: Unified generation models aim to handle diverse tasks across modalities --
such as text generation, image generation, and vision-language reasoning --
within a single architecture and decoding paradigm. Autoregressive unified
models suffer from slow inference due to sequential decoding, and
non-autoregressive unified models suffer from weak generalization due to
limited pretrained backbones. We introduce Muddit, a unified discrete diffusion
transformer that enables fast and parallel generation across both text and
image modalities. Unlike prior unified diffusion models trained from scratch,
Muddit integrates strong visual priors from a pretrained text-to-image backbone
with a lightweight text decoder, enabling flexible and high-quality multimodal
generation under a unified architecture. Empirical results show that Muddit
achieves competitive or superior performance compared to significantly larger
autoregressive models in both quality and efficiency. The work highlights the
potential of purely discrete diffusion, when equipped with strong visual
priors, as a scalable and effective backbone for unified generation.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a standard technique for
aligning language models with human preferences in a supervised manner. Despite
its empirical success, the theoretical justification behind its log-ratio
reward parameterization remains incomplete. In this work, we address this gap
by utilizing the Differential Information Distribution (DID): a distribution
over token sequences that captures the information gained during policy
updates. First, we show that when preference labels encode the differential
information required to transform a reference policy into a target policy, the
log-ratio reward in DPO emerges as the uniquely optimal form for learning the
target policy via preference optimization. This result naturally yields a
closed-form expression for the optimal sampling distribution over rejected
responses. Second, we find that the condition for preferences to encode
differential information is fundamentally linked to an implicit assumption
regarding log-margin ordered policies-an inductive bias widely used in
preference optimization yet previously unrecognized. Finally, by analyzing the
entropy of the DID, we characterize how learning low-entropy differential
information reinforces the policy distribution, while high-entropy differential
information induces a smoothing effect, which explains the log-likelihood
displacement phenomenon. We validate our theoretical findings in synthetic
experiments and extend them to real-world instruction-following datasets. Our
results suggest that learning high-entropy differential information is crucial
for general instruction-following, while learning low-entropy differential
information benefits knowledge-intensive question answering. Overall, our work
presents a unifying perspective on the DPO objective, the structure of
preference data, and resulting policy behaviors through the lens of
differential information.

Conclusion: RAG-Pref结合DPO能有效提升LLMs对MCP攻击的防御能力。

Abstract: The model context protocol (MCP) has been widely adapted as an open standard
enabling the seamless integration of generative AI agents. However, recent work
has shown the MCP is susceptible to retrieval-based "falsely benign" attacks
(FBAs), allowing malicious system access and credential theft, but requiring
that users download compromised files directly to their systems. Herein, we
show that the threat model of MCP-based attacks is significantly broader than
previously thought, i.e., attackers need only post malicious content online to
deceive MCP agents into carrying out their attacks on unsuspecting victims'
systems.
  To improve alignment guardrails against such attacks, we introduce a new MCP
dataset of FBAs and (truly) benign samples to explore the effectiveness of
direct preference optimization (DPO) for the refusal training of large language
models (LLMs). While DPO improves model guardrails against such attacks, we
show that the efficacy of refusal learning varies drastically depending on the
model's original post-training alignment scheme--e.g., GRPO-based LLMs learn to
refuse extremely poorly. Thus, to further improve FBA refusals, we introduce
Retrieval Augmented Generation for Preference alignment (RAG-Pref), a novel
preference alignment strategy based on RAG. We show that RAG-Pref significantly
improves the ability of LLMs to refuse FBAs, particularly when combined with
DPO alignment, thus drastically improving guardrails against MCP-based attacks.

achieved remarkable success, conducting chain-of-thought with
continuously-valued tokens (CoT2) offers a richer and more expressive
alternative. Our work examines the benefits of CoT2 through logical reasoning
tasks that inherently require search capabilities and provide optimization and
exploration methods for CoT2. Theoretically, we show that CoT2 allows the model
to track multiple traces in parallel and quantify its benefits for inference
efficiency. Notably, one layer transformer equipped with CoT2 can provably
solve the combinatorial "subset sum problem" given sufficient embedding
dimension. These insights lead to a novel and effective supervision strategy
where we match the softmax outputs to the empirical token distributions of a
set of target traces. Complementing this, we introduce sampling strategies that
unlock policy optimization and self-improvement for CoT2. Our first strategy
samples and composes $K$ discrete tokens at each decoding step to control the
level of parallelism, and reduces to standard CoT when $K=1$. Our second
strategy relies on continuous exploration over the probability simplex.
Experiments confirm that policy optimization with CoT2 indeed improves the
performance of the model beyond its initial discrete or continuous supervision.

Abstract: Recent work suggests that large language models (LLMs) can perform multi-hop
reasoning implicitly -- producing correct answers without explicitly
verbalizing intermediate steps -- but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly
understood. In this paper, we study how such implicit reasoning emerges by
training transformers from scratch in a controlled symbolic environment. Our
analysis reveals a three-stage developmental trajectory: early memorization,
followed by in-distribution generalization, and eventually cross-distribution
generalization. We find that training with atomic triples is not necessary but
accelerates learning, and that second-hop generalization relies on query-level
exposure to specific compositional structures. To interpret these behaviors, we
introduce two diagnostic tools: cross-query semantic patching, which identifies
semantically reusable intermediate representations, and a cosine-based
representational lens, which reveals that successful reasoning correlates with
the cosine-base clustering in hidden space. This clustering phenomenon in turn
provides a coherent explanation for the behavioral dynamics observed across
training, linking representational structure to reasoning capability. These
findings provide new insights into the interpretability of implicit multi-hop
reasoning in LLMs, helping to clarify how complex reasoning processes unfold
internally and offering pathways to enhance the transparency of such models.

Abstract: Transformer-based language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities
across a range of complex reasoning tasks. Prior theoretical work exploring the
expressive power of transformers has shown that they can efficiently perform
multi-step reasoning tasks involving parallelizable computations. However, the
learnability of such constructions, particularly the conditions on the data
distribution that enable efficient learning via gradient-based optimization,
remains an open question. Towards answering this question, in this work we
study the learnability of the $k$-fold composition task, which requires
computing an interleaved composition of $k$ input permutations and $k$ hidden
permutations, and can be expressed by a transformer with $O(\log k)$ layers. On
the negative front, we prove a Statistical Query (SQ) lower bound showing that
any SQ learner that makes only polynomially-many queries to an SQ oracle for
the $k$-fold composition task distribution must have sample size exponential in
$k$, thus establishing a statistical-computational gap. On the other hand, we
show that this function class can be efficiently learned, with runtime and
sample complexity polynomial in $k$, by gradient descent on an $O(\log
k)$-depth transformer via two different curriculum learning strategies: one in
which data consists of $k'$-fold composition functions with $k' \le k$
presented in increasing difficulty, and another in which all such data is
presented simultaneously. Our work sheds light on the necessity and sufficiency
of having both easy and hard examples in the data distribution for transformers
to learn complex compositional tasks.

Conclusion: SC-LoRA有效解决了LoRA的收敛与知识保留问题，为LLM的高效微调提供了新思路。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, particularly Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA), are indispensable for efficiently customizing Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, vanilla LoRA suffers from slow convergence speed and
knowledge forgetting problems. Recent studies have leveraged the power of
designed LoRA initialization, to enhance the fine-tuning efficiency, or to
preserve knowledge in the pre-trained LLM. However, none of these works can
address the two cases at the same time. To this end, we introduce
Subspace-Constrained LoRA (SC-LoRA), a novel LoRA initialization framework
engineered to navigate the trade-off between efficient fine-tuning and
knowledge preservation. We achieve this by constraining the output of trainable
LoRA adapters in a low-rank subspace, where the context information of
fine-tuning data is most preserved while the context information of preserved
knowledge is least retained, in a balanced way. Such constraint enables the
trainable weights to primarily focus on the main features of fine-tuning data
while avoiding damaging the preserved knowledge features. We provide
theoretical analysis on our method, and conduct extensive experiments including
safety preservation and world knowledge preservation, on various downstream
tasks. In our experiments, SC-LoRA succeeds in delivering superior fine-tuning
performance while markedly diminishing knowledge forgetting, surpassing
contemporary LoRA initialization methods.

Abstract: DiLoCo is a powerful framework for training large language models (LLMs)
under networking constraints with advantages for increasing parallelism and
accelerator utilization in data center settings. Despite significantly reducing
communication frequency, however, DiLoCo's communication steps still involve
all-reducing a complete copy of the model's parameters. While existing works
have explored ways to reduce communication in DiLoCo, the role of error
feedback accumulators and the effect of the inner-optimizer on compressibility
remain under-explored. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of
standard compression methods including Top-k sparsification and quantization
for reducing the communication overhead of DiLoCo when paired with two local
optimizers (AdamW and Muon). Our experiments pre-training decoder-only
transformer language models (LMs) reveal that leveraging Muon as the inner
optimizer for DiLoCo along with an error-feedback accumulator allows to
aggressively compress the communicated delta to 2-bits with next to no
performance degradation. Crucially, MuLoCo (Muon inner optimizer DiLoCo)
significantly outperforms DiLoCo while communicating 8X less and having
identical memory complexity.

Result: Nash方法在最小化失真方面表现最优，而RLHF和DPO在不同条件下失真显著。

Conclusion: Nash方法在多样化偏好对齐中具有鲁棒性和最优性，优于传统方法。

Abstract: After pre-training, large language models are aligned with human preferences
based on pairwise comparisons. State-of-the-art alignment methods (such as
PPO-based RLHF and DPO) are built on the assumption of aligning with a single
preference model, despite being deployed in settings where users have diverse
preferences. As a result, it is not even clear that these alignment methods
produce models that satisfy users on average -- a minimal requirement for
pluralistic alignment. Drawing on social choice theory and modeling users'
comparisons through individual Bradley-Terry (BT) models, we introduce an
alignment method's distortion: the worst-case ratio between the optimal
achievable average utility, and the average utility of the learned policy.
  The notion of distortion helps draw sharp distinctions between alignment
methods: Nash Learning from Human Feedback achieves the minimax optimal
distortion of $(\frac{1}{2} + o(1)) \cdot \beta$ (for the BT temperature
$\beta$), robustly across utility distributions, distributions of comparison
pairs, and permissible KL divergences from the reference policy. RLHF and DPO,
by contrast, suffer $\geq (1 - o(1)) \cdot \beta$ distortion already without a
KL constraint, and $e^{\Omega(\beta)}$ or even unbounded distortion in the full
setting, depending on how comparison pairs are sampled.

Conclusion: REOrder能有效发现任务最优排列顺序，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Sequence models such as transformers require inputs to be represented as
one-dimensional sequences. In vision, this typically involves flattening images
using a fixed row-major (raster-scan) order. While full self-attention is
permutation-equivariant, modern long-sequence transformers increasingly rely on
architectural approximations that break this invariance and introduce
sensitivity to patch ordering. We show that patch order significantly affects
model performance in such settings, with simple alternatives like column-major
or Hilbert curves yielding notable accuracy shifts. Motivated by this, we
propose REOrder, a two-stage framework for discovering task-optimal patch
orderings. First, we derive an information-theoretic prior by evaluating the
compressibility of various patch sequences. Then, we learn a policy over
permutations by optimizing a Plackett-Luce policy using REINFORCE. This
approach enables efficient learning in a combinatorial permutation space.
REOrder improves top-1 accuracy over row-major ordering on ImageNet-1K by up to
3.01% and Functional Map of the World by 13.35%.

Abstract: Weight binarization has emerged as a promising strategy to drastically reduce
the complexity of large language models (LLMs). It is mainly classified into
two approaches: post-training binarization and finetuning with training-aware
binarization methods. The first approach, while having low complexity, leads to
significant loss of information from the original LLMs, resulting in poor
performance. The second approach, on the other hand, relies heavily on
full-precision latent weights for gradient approximation of binary weights,
which not only remains suboptimal but also introduces substantial complexity.
In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that effectively transforms LLMs
into multi-kernel Boolean parameters, for the first time, finetunes them
directly in the Boolean domain, eliminating the need for expensive latent
weights. This significantly reduces complexity during both finetuning and
inference. Through extensive and insightful experiments across a wide range of
LLMs, we demonstrate that our method outperforms recent ultra low-bit
quantization and binarization methods.

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) cache context as key-value

leading to substantial memory overhead and increased attention latency. This
paper introduces KVzip, a query-agnostic KV cache eviction method enabling
effective reuse of compressed KV caches across diverse queries. KVzip
quantifies the importance of a KV pair using the underlying LLM to reconstruct
original contexts from cached KV pairs, subsequently evicting pairs with lower
importance. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that KVzip reduces KV
cache size by 3-4$\times$ and FlashAttention decoding latency by approximately
2$\times$, with negligible performance loss in question-answering, retrieval,
reasoning, and code comprehension tasks. Evaluations include various models
such as LLaMA3.1-8B, Qwen2.5-14B, and Gemma3-12B, with context lengths reaching
up to 170K tokens. KVzip significantly outperforms existing query-aware KV

Abstract: The idea of value-aware model learning, that models should produce accurate
value estimates, has gained prominence in model-based reinforcement learning.
The MuZero loss, which penalizes a model's value function prediction compared
to the ground-truth value function, has been utilized in several prominent
empirical works in the literature. However, theoretical investigation into its
strengths and weaknesses is limited. In this paper, we analyze the family of
value-aware model learning losses, which includes the popular MuZero loss. We
show that these losses, as normally used, are uncalibrated surrogate losses,
which means that they do not always recover the correct model and value
function. Building on this insight, we propose corrections to solve this issue.
Furthermore, we investigate the interplay between the loss calibration, latent
model architectures, and auxiliary losses that are commonly employed when
training MuZero-style agents. We show that while deterministic models can be
sufficient to predict accurate values, learning calibrated stochastic models is
still advantageous.

Abstract: One frequently wishes to learn a range of similar tasks as efficiently as
possible, re-using knowledge across tasks. In artificial neural networks, this
is typically accomplished by conditioning a network upon task context by
injecting context as input. Brains have a different strategy: the parameters
themselves are modulated as a function of various neuromodulators such as
serotonin. Here, we take inspiration from neuromodulation and propose to learn
weights which are smoothly parameterized functions of task context variables.
Rather than optimize a weight vector, i.e. a single point in weight space, we
optimize a smooth manifold in weight space with a predefined topology. To
accomplish this, we derive a formal treatment of optimization of manifolds as
the minimization of a loss functional subject to a constraint on volumetric
movement, analogous to gradient descent. During inference, conditioning selects
a single point on this manifold which serves as the effective weight matrix for
a particular sub-task. This strategy for conditioning has two main advantages.
First, the topology of the manifold (whether a line, circle, or torus) is a
convenient lever for inductive biases about the relationship between tasks.
Second, learning in one state smoothly affects the entire manifold, encouraging
generalization across states. To verify this, we train manifolds with several
topologies, including straight lines in weight space (for conditioning on e.g.
noise level in input data) and ellipses (for rotated images). Despite their
simplicity, these parameterizations outperform conditioning identical networks
by input concatenation and better generalize to out-of-distribution samples.
These results suggest that modulating weights over low-dimensional manifolds
offers a principled and effective alternative to traditional conditioning.

Abstract: Scaling laws motivate the development of Time Series Foundation Models
(TSFMs) that pre-train vast parameters and achieve remarkable zero-shot
forecasting performance. Surprisingly, even after fine-tuning, TSFMs cannot
consistently outperform smaller, specialized models trained on full-shot
downstream data. A key question is how to realize effective adaptation of TSFMs
for a target forecasting task. Through empirical studies on various TSFMs, the
pre-trained models often exhibit inherent sparsity and redundancy in
computation, suggesting that TSFMs have learned to activate task-relevant
network substructures to accommodate diverse forecasting tasks. To preserve
this valuable prior knowledge, we propose a structured pruning method to
regularize the subsequent fine-tuning process by focusing it on a more relevant
and compact parameter space. Extensive experiments on seven TSFMs and six
benchmarks demonstrate that fine-tuning a smaller, pruned TSFM significantly
improves forecasting performance compared to fine-tuning original models. This
"prune-then-finetune" paradigm often enables TSFMs to achieve state-of-the-art
performance and surpass strong specialized baselines.

Abstract: Neural networks transform high-dimensional data into compact, structured
representations, often modeled as elements of a lower dimensional latent space.
In this paper, we present an alternative interpretation of neural models as
dynamical systems acting on the latent manifold. Specifically, we show that
autoencoder models implicitly define a latent vector field on the manifold,
derived by iteratively applying the encoding-decoding map, without any
additional training. We observe that standard training procedures introduce
inductive biases that lead to the emergence of attractor points within this
vector field. Drawing on this insight, we propose to leverage the vector field
as a representation for the network, providing a novel tool to analyze the
properties of the model and the data. This representation enables to: (i)
analyze the generalization and memorization regimes of neural models, even
throughout training; (ii) extract prior knowledge encoded in the network's
parameters from the attractors, without requiring any input data; (iii)
identify out-of-distribution samples from their trajectories in the vector
field. We further validate our approach on vision foundation models, showcasing
the applicability and effectiveness of our method in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty estimation is critical for deploying neural networks

limited in scalability, differentiability, and generalization across domains.
In this work, we introduce CLUE (Calibration via Learning Uncertainty-Error
Alignment), a novel approach that explicitly aligns predicted uncertainty with
observed error during training, grounded in the principle that well-calibrated
models should produce uncertainty estimates that match their empirical loss.
CLUE adopts a novel loss function that jointly optimizes predictive performance
and calibration, using summary statistics of uncertainty and loss as proxies.
The proposed method is fully differentiable, domain-agnostic, and compatible
with standard training pipelines. Through extensive experiments on vision,
regression, and language modeling tasks, including out-of-distribution and

quality and competitive predictive performance with respect to state-of-the-art

models to offline reinforcement learning (RL) remains challenging due to the
iterative nature of their noise sampling processes, making policy optimization
difficult. In this paper, we introduce Scalable Offline Reinforcement Learning
(SORL), a new offline RL algorithm that leverages shortcut models - a novel
class of generative models - to scale both training and inference. SORL's
policy can capture complex data distributions and can be trained simply and
efficiently in a one-stage training procedure. At test time, SORL introduces
both sequential and parallel inference scaling by using the learned Q-function
as a verifier. We demonstrate that SORL achieves strong performance across a
range of offline RL tasks and exhibits positive scaling behavior with increased
test-time compute. We release the code at
nico-espinosadice.github.io/projects/sorl.

Abstract: Industry-grade ML models are carefully designed to meet rapidly evolving
serving constraints, which requires significant resources for model
development. In this paper, we propose MatTA, a framework for training multiple
accurate Student models using a novel Teacher-TA-Student recipe. TA models are
larger versions of the Student models with higher capacity, and thus allow
Student models to better relate to the Teacher model and also bring in more
domain-specific expertise. Furthermore, multiple accurate Student models can be
extracted from the TA model. Therefore, despite only one training run, our
methodology provides multiple servable options to trade off accuracy for lower
serving cost. We demonstrate the proposed method, MatTA, on proprietary
datasets and models. Its practical efficacy is underscored by live A/B tests
within a production ML system, demonstrating 20% improvement on a key metric.
We also demonstrate our method on GPT-2 Medium, a public model, and achieve
relative improvements of over 24% on SAT Math and over 10% on the LAMBADA
benchmark.

Conclusion: b-RS-FedPG在异构联邦强化学习中表现出色，为高效联邦学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Ensuring convergence of policy gradient methods in federated reinforcement
learning (FRL) under environment heterogeneity remains a major challenge. In
this work, we first establish that heterogeneity, perhaps counter-intuitively,
can necessitate optimal policies to be non-deterministic or even time-varying,
even in tabular environments. Subsequently, we prove global convergence results
for federated policy gradient (FedPG) algorithms employing local updates, under
a {\L}ojasiewicz condition that holds only for each individual agent, in both
entropy-regularized and non-regularized scenarios. Crucially, our theoretical
analysis shows that FedPG attains linear speed-up with respect to the number of
agents, a property central to efficient federated learning. Leveraging insights
from our theoretical findings, we introduce b-RS-FedPG, a novel policy gradient
method that employs a carefully constructed softmax-inspired parameterization
coupled with an appropriate regularization scheme. We further demonstrate
explicit convergence rates for b-RS-FedPG toward near-optimal stationary
policies. Finally, we demonstrate that empirically both FedPG and b-RS-FedPG
consistently outperform federated Q-learning on heterogeneous settings.

Conclusion: tnLLM结合LLM的推理能力和领域信息，高效且透明地解决了TN-SS问题。

Abstract: Tensor networks (TNs) provide efficient representations of high-dimensional
data, yet identification of the optimal TN structures, the so called tensor
network structure search (TN-SS) problem, remains a challenge. Current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms are computationally expensive as they
require extensive function evaluations, which is prohibitive for real-world
applications. In addition, existing methods ignore valuable domain information
inherent in real-world tensor data and lack transparency in their identified TN
structures. To this end, we propose a novel TN-SS framework, termed the tnLLM,
which incorporates domain information about the data and harnesses the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to directly predict
suitable TN structures. The proposed framework involves a domain-aware
prompting pipeline which instructs the LLM to infer suitable TN structures
based on the real-world relationships between tensor modes. In this way, our
approach is capable of not only iteratively optimizing the objective function,
but also generating domain-aware explanations for the identified structures.
Experimental results demonstrate that tnLLM achieves comparable TN-SS objective
function values with much fewer function evaluations compared to SOTA
algorithms. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the LLM-enabled domain information
can be used to find good initializations in the search space for sampling-based
SOTA methods to accelerate their convergence while preserving theoretical
performance guarantees.

Conclusion: RP-GSSM为多种下游任务提供了有用的基础模型。

Abstract: We introduce a novel unsupervised learning method for time series data with
latent dynamical structure: the recognition-parametrized Gaussian state space
model (RP-GSSM). The RP-GSSM is a probabilistic model that learns Markovian
Gaussian latents explaining statistical dependence between observations at
different time steps, combining the intuition of contrastive methods with the
flexible tools of probabilistic generative models. Unlike contrastive
approaches, the RP-GSSM is a valid probabilistic model learned via maximum
likelihood. Unlike generative approaches, the RP-GSSM has no need for an
explicit network mapping from latents to observations, allowing it to focus
model capacity on inference of latents. The model is both tractable and
expressive: it admits exact inference thanks to its jointly Gaussian latent
prior, while maintaining expressivity with an arbitrarily nonlinear neural
network link between observations and latents. These qualities allow the
RP-GSSM to learn task-relevant latents without ad-hoc regularization, auxiliary
losses, or optimizer scheduling. We show how this approach outperforms
alternatives on problems that include learning nonlinear stochastic dynamics
from video, with or without background distractors. Our results position the
RP-GSSM as a useful foundation model for a variety of downstream applications.

Abstract: Post-training of foundation language models has emerged as a promising
research domain in federated learning (FL) with the goal to enable
privacy-preserving model improvements and adaptations to user's downstream
tasks. Recent advances in this area adopt centralized post-training approaches
that build upon black-box foundation language models where there is no access
to model weights and architecture details. Although the use of black-box models
has been successful in centralized post-training, their blind replication in FL
raises several concerns. Our position is that using black-box models in FL
contradicts the core principles of federation such as data privacy and
autonomy. In this position paper, we critically analyze the usage of black-box
models in federated post-training, and provide a detailed account of various
aspects of openness and their implications for FL.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a powerful technique for combining task-specific
weights, achieving superior performance in multi-target domain adaptation.
However, when applied to practical scenarios, such as quantized models, new
challenges arise. In practical scenarios, quantization is often applied to
target-specific data, but this process restricts the domain of interest and
introduces discretization effects, making model merging highly non-trivial. In
this study, we analyze the impact of quantization on model merging through the
lens of error barriers. Leveraging these insights, we propose a novel
post-training quantization, HDRQ - Hessian and distant regularizing
quantization - that is designed to consider model merging for multi-target
domain adaptation. Our approach ensures that the quantization process incurs
minimal deviation from the source pre-trained model while flattening the loss
surface to facilitate smooth model merging. To our knowledge, this is the first
study on this challenge, and extensive experiments confirm its effectiveness.

Abstract: Neural network minima are often connected by curves along which train and
test loss remain nearly constant, a phenomenon known as mode connectivity.
While this property has enabled applications such as model merging and
fine-tuning, its theoretical explanation remains unclear. We propose a new
approach to exploring the connectedness of minima using parameter space
symmetry. By linking the topology of symmetry groups to that of the minima, we
derive the number of connected components of the minima of linear networks and
show that skip connections reduce this number. We then examine when mode
connectivity and linear mode connectivity hold or fail, using parameter
symmetries which account for a significant part of the minimum. Finally, we
provide explicit expressions for connecting curves in the minima induced by
symmetry. Using the curvature of these curves, we derive conditions under which
linear mode connectivity approximately holds. Our findings highlight the role
of continuous symmetries in understanding the neural network loss landscape.

Abstract: In-context learning, the ability of large language models to perform tasks
using only examples provided in the prompt, has recently been adapted for time
series forecasting. This paradigm enables zero-shot prediction, where past
values serve as context for forecasting future values, making powerful
forecasting tools accessible to non-experts and increasing the performance when
training data are scarce. Most existing zero-shot forecasting approaches rely
on transformer architectures, which, despite their success in language, often
fall short of expectations in time series forecasting, where recurrent models
like LSTMs frequently have the edge. Conversely, while LSTMs are well-suited
for time series modeling due to their state-tracking capabilities, they lack
strong in-context learning abilities. We introduce TiRex that closes this gap
by leveraging xLSTM, an enhanced LSTM with competitive in-context learning
skills. Unlike transformers, state-space models, or parallelizable RNNs such as
RWKV, TiRex retains state-tracking, a critical property for long-horizon
forecasting. To further facilitate its state-tracking ability, we propose a
training-time masking strategy called CPM. TiRex sets a new state of the art in
zero-shot time series forecasting on the HuggingFace benchmarks GiftEval and
Chronos-ZS, outperforming significantly larger models including TabPFN-TS
(Prior Labs), Chronos Bolt (Amazon), TimesFM (Google), and Moirai (Salesforce)

Abstract: Powerful machine learning (ML) models are now readily available online, which
creates exciting possibilities for users who lack the deep technical expertise

this type of open ecosystem comes with many risks. In this paper, we argue that
the current ecosystem for open ML models contains significant supply-chain
risks, some of which have been exploited already in real attacks. These include
an attacker replacing a model with something malicious (e.g., malware), or a
model being trained using a vulnerable version of a framework or on restricted

transparency to open-source software supply chains, can be used to bring
transparency to open ML models, in terms of enabling model publishers to sign
their models and prove properties about the datasets they use.

Abstract: Ride-hailing platforms face significant challenges in optimizing order
dispatching and driver repositioning operations in dynamic urban environments.
Traditional approaches based on combinatorial optimization, rule-based
heuristics, and reinforcement learning often overlook driver income fairness,
interpretability, and adaptability to real-world dynamics. To address these
gaps, we propose LLM-ODDR, a novel framework leveraging Large Language Models
(LLMs) for joint Order Dispatching and Driver Repositioning (ODDR) in
ride-hailing services. LLM-ODDR framework comprises three key components: (1)
Multi-objective-guided Order Value Refinement, which evaluates orders by
considering multiple objectives to determine their overall value; (2)
Fairness-aware Order Dispatching, which balances platform revenue with driver
income fairness; and (3) Spatiotemporal Demand-Aware Driver Repositioning,
which optimizes idle vehicle placement based on historical patterns and
projected supply. We also develop JointDR-GPT, a fine-tuned model optimized for
ODDR tasks with domain knowledge. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
from Manhattan taxi operations demonstrate that our framework significantly
outperforms traditional methods in terms of effectiveness, adaptability to
anomalous conditions, and decision interpretability. To our knowledge, this is
the first exploration of LLMs as decision-making agents in ride-hailing ODDR
tasks, establishing foundational insights for integrating advanced language

Abstract: The ability to continuously and efficiently transfer skills across tasks is a
hallmark of biological intelligence and a long-standing goal in artificial
systems. Reinforcement learning (RL), a dominant paradigm for learning in
high-dimensional control tasks, is known to suffer from brittleness to task
variations and catastrophic forgetting. Neuroevolution (NE) has recently gained
attention for its robustness, scalability, and capacity to escape local optima.
In this paper, we investigate an understudied dimension of NE: its transfer
learning capabilities. To this end, we introduce two benchmarks: a) in stepping
gates, neural networks are tasked with emulating logic circuits, with designs
that emphasize modular repetition and variation b) ecorobot extends the Brax
physics engine with objects such as walls and obstacles and the ability to
easily switch between different robotic morphologies. Crucial in both
benchmarks is the presence of a curriculum that enables evaluating skill
transfer across tasks of increasing complexity. Our empirical analysis shows
that NE methods vary in their transfer abilities and frequently outperform RL
baselines. Our findings support the potential of NE as a foundation for
building more adaptable agents and highlight future challenges for scaling NE
to complex, real-world problems.

Conclusion: 核平滑经验分数方法通过双重正则化机制（初始高斯核和分数空间核）减少记忆化并提升泛化能力。

Abstract: Diffusion models now set the benchmark in high-fidelity generative sampling,
yet they can, in principle, be prone to memorization. In this case, their
learned score overfits the finite dataset so that the reverse-time SDE samples
are mostly training points. In this paper, we interpret the empirical score as
a noisy version of the true score and show that its covariance matrix is
asymptotically a re-weighted data PCA. In large dimension, the small time limit
makes the noise variance blow up while simultaneously reducing spatial
correlation. To reduce this variance, we introduce a kernel-smoothed empirical
score and analyze its bias-variance trade-off. We derive asymptotic bounds on
the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true distribution and the one
generated by the modified reverse SDE. Regularization on the score has the same
effect as increasing the size of the training dataset, and thus helps prevent
memorization. A spectral decomposition of the forward diffusion suggests better
variance control under some regularity conditions of the true data
distribution. Reverse diffusion with kernel-smoothed empirical score can be
reformulated as a gradient descent drifted toward a Log-Exponential
Double-Kernel Density Estimator (LED-KDE). This perspective highlights two
regularization mechanisms taking place in denoising diffusions: an initial
Gaussian kernel first diffuses mass isotropically in the ambient space, while a
second kernel applied in score space concentrates and spreads that mass along
the data manifold. Hence, even a straightforward regularization-without any
learning-already mitigates memorization and enhances generalization.
Numerically, we illustrate our results with several experiments on synthetic
and MNIST datasets.

in the environment. For these type of tasks, we propose Causal-PIK, a method
that leverages Bayesian optimization to reason about causal interactions via a
Physics-Informed Kernel to help guide efficient search for the best next
action. Experimental results on Virtual Tools and PHYRE physical reasoning
benchmarks show that Causal-PIK outperforms state-of-the-art results, requiring
fewer actions to reach the goal. We also compare Causal-PIK to human studies,
including results from a new user study we conducted on the PHYRE benchmark. We

Abstract: The Vision Language Model (VLM) excels in aligning vision and language
representations, and prompt learning has emerged as a key technique for
adapting such models to downstream tasks. However, the application of prompt
learning with VLM in federated learning (\fl{}) scenarios remains
underexplored. This paper systematically investigates the behavioral
differences between language prompt learning (LPT) and vision prompt learning
(VPT) under data heterogeneity challenges, including label skew and domain
shift. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the impact of various \fl{}
and prompt configurations, such as client scale, aggregation strategies, and
prompt length, to assess the robustness of Federated Prompt Learning (FPL).
Furthermore, we explore strategies for enhancing prompt learning in complex
scenarios where label skew and domain shift coexist, including leveraging both
prompt types when computational resources allow. Our findings offer practical
insights into optimizing prompt learning in federated settings, contributing to
the broader deployment of VLMs in privacy-preserving environments.

Abstract: The subpopulationtion shift, characterized by a disparity in subpopulation
distributibetween theween the training and target datasets, can significantly
degrade the performance of machine learning models. Current solutions to
subpopulation shift involve modifying empirical risk minimization with
re-weighting strategies to improve generalization. This strategy relies on
assumptions about the number and nature of subpopulations and annotations on
group membership, which are unavailable for many real-world datasets. Instead,
we propose using an ensemble of diverse classifiers to adaptively capture risk
associated with subpopulations. Given a feature extractor network, we replace
its standard linear classification layer with a mixture of prototypical
classifiers, where each member is trained to classify the data while focusing
on different features and samples from other members. In empirical evaluation
on nine real-world datasets, covering diverse domains and kinds of
subpopulation shift, our method of Diverse Prototypical Ensembles (DPEs) often
outperforms the prior state-of-the-art in worst-group accuracy. The code is

Abstract: Attention mechanisms have emerged as transformative tools in core AI domains
such as natural language processing and computer vision. Yet, their largely
untapped potential for modeling intricate physical systems presents a
compelling frontier. Learning such systems often entails discovering operators
that map between functional spaces using limited instances of function pairs --
a task commonly framed as a severely ill-posed inverse PDE problem. In this
work, we introduce Neural Interpretable PDEs (NIPS), a novel neural operator
architecture that builds upon and enhances Nonlocal Attention Operators (NAO)
in both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. NIPS employs a linear
attention mechanism to enable scalable learning and integrates a learnable
kernel network that acts as a channel-independent convolution in Fourier space.
As a consequence, NIPS eliminates the need to explicitly compute and store
large pairwise interactions, effectively amortizing the cost of handling
spatial interactions into the Fourier transform. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that NIPS consistently surpasses NAO and other baselines across
diverse benchmarks, heralding a substantial leap in scalable, interpretable,
and efficient physics learning. Our code and data accompanying this paper are

notion of $\varepsilon$-valid counterfactual probability ($\varepsilon$-VCP) --
the probability of finding perturbations of a data point within its
$\varepsilon$-neighborhood that result in a label change. We provide a
theoretical analysis of $\varepsilon$-VCP in relation to the geometry of the
model's decision boundary, showing that $\varepsilon$-VCP tends to increase
with model overfitting. Our findings establish a rigorous connection between
poor generalization and the ease of counterfactual generation, revealing an
inherent trade-off between generalization and counterfactual explainability.
Empirical results validate our theory, suggesting $\varepsilon$-VCP as a
practical proxy for quantitatively characterizing overfitting.

Abstract: Climate control is crucial for greenhouse production as it directly affects
crop growth and resource use. Reinforcement learning (RL) has received
increasing attention in this field, but still faces challenges, including
limited training efficiency and high reliance on initial learning conditions.
Interactive RL, which combines human (grower) input with the RL agent's
learning, offers a potential solution to overcome these challenges. However,
interactive RL has not yet been applied to greenhouse climate control and may
face challenges related to imperfect inputs. Therefore, this paper aims to
explore the possibility and performance of applying interactive RL with
imperfect inputs into greenhouse climate control, by: (1) developing three
representative interactive RL algorithms tailored for greenhouse climate
control (reward shaping, policy shaping and control sharing); (2) analyzing how
input characteristics are often contradicting, and how the trade-offs between
them make grower's inputs difficult to perfect; (3) proposing a neural
network-based approach to enhance the robustness of interactive RL agents under
limited input availability; (4) conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the
three interactive RL algorithms with imperfect inputs in a simulated greenhouse
environment. The demonstration shows that interactive RL incorporating
imperfect grower inputs has the potential to improve the performance of the RL
agent. RL algorithms that influence action selection, such as policy shaping
and control sharing, perform better when dealing with imperfect inputs,
achieving 8.4% and 6.8% improvement in profit, respectively. In contrast,
reward shaping, an algorithm that manipulates the reward function, is sensitive
to imperfect inputs and leads to a 9.4% decrease in profit. This highlights the
importance of selecting an appropriate mechanism when incorporating imperfect
inputs.

Abstract: Due to their expressive capacity, diffusion models have shown great promise
in offline RL and imitation learning. Diffusion Actor-Critic with Entropy
Regulator (DACER) extended this capability to online RL by using the reverse
diffusion process as a policy approximator, trained end-to-end with policy
gradient methods, achieving strong performance. However, this comes at the cost
of requiring many diffusion steps, which significantly hampers training
efficiency, while directly reducing the steps leads to noticeable performance
degradation. Critically, the lack of inference efficiency becomes a significant
bottleneck for applying diffusion policies in real-time online RL settings. To
improve training and inference efficiency while maintaining or even enhancing
performance, we propose a Q-gradient field objective as an auxiliary
optimization target to guide the denoising process at each diffusion step.
Nonetheless, we observe that the independence of the Q-gradient field from the
diffusion time step negatively impacts the performance of the diffusion policy.
To address this, we introduce a temporal weighting mechanism that enables the
model to efficiently eliminate large-scale noise in the early stages and refine
actions in the later stages. Experimental results on MuJoCo benchmarks and
several multimodal tasks demonstrate that the DACER2 algorithm achieves
state-of-the-art performance in most MuJoCo control tasks with only five
diffusion steps, while also exhibiting stronger multimodality compared to
DACER.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and uncertainty estimation (UE) are
critical components for building safe machine learning systems, especially in
real-world scenarios where unexpected inputs are inevitable. In this work, we
propose a novel framework that combines network inversion with classifier
training to simultaneously address both OOD detection and uncertainty
estimation. For a standard n-class classification task, we extend the
classifier to an (n+1)-class model by introducing a "garbage" class, initially
populated with random gaussian noise to represent outlier inputs. After each
training epoch, we use network inversion to reconstruct input images
corresponding to all output classes that initially appear as noisy and
incoherent and are therefore excluded to the garbage class for retraining the
classifier. This cycle of training, inversion, and exclusion continues
iteratively till the inverted samples begin to resemble the in-distribution
data more closely, suggesting that the classifier has learned to carve out
meaningful decision boundaries while sanitising the class manifolds by pushing
OOD content into the garbage class. During inference, this training scheme
enables the model to effectively detect and reject OOD samples by classifying
them into the garbage class. Furthermore, the confidence scores associated with
each prediction can be used to estimate uncertainty for both in-distribution
and OOD inputs. Our approach is scalable, interpretable, and does not require
access to external OOD datasets or post-hoc calibration techniques while
providing a unified solution to the dual challenges of OOD detection and
uncertainty estimation.

Method: StragglAR算法在慢节点延迟期间执行ReduceScatter操作，随后采用一种新的集体算法完成AllReduce。

Result: 理论分析显示，StragglAR在存在慢节点的大型GPU集群中比Ring等算法快2倍；在8-GPU服务器上实现了22%的速度提升。

Conclusion: StragglAR有效解决了慢节点问题，显著提升了分布式机器学习的效率。

Abstract: Distributed machine learning workloads use data and tensor parallelism for
training and inference, both of which rely on the AllReduce collective to
synchronize gradients or activations. However, bulk-synchronous AllReduce
algorithms can be delayed by a persistent straggler that is slower to reach the
synchronization barrier required to begin the collective. To address this
challenge, we propose StragglAR: an AllReduce algorithm that accelerates
distributed training and inference in the presence of persistent stragglers.
StragglAR implements a ReduceScatter among the remaining GPUs during the
straggler-induced delay, and then executes a novel collective algorithm to
complete the AllReduce once the straggler reaches the synchronization barrier.
StragglAR achieves a 2x theoretical speedup over popular bandwidth-efficient
AllReduce algorithms (e.g., Ring) for large GPU clusters with persistent
stragglers. On an 8-GPU server, our implementation of StragglAR yields a 22%
speedup over state-of-the-art AllReduce algorithms.

Abstract: The present study performs a comprehensive fairness analysis of machine
learning (ML) models for the diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and
Alzheimer's disease (AD) from MRI-derived neuroimaging features. Biases
associated with age, race, and gender in a multi-cohort dataset, as well as the
influence of proxy features encoding these sensitive attributes, are
investigated. The reliability of various fairness definitions and metrics in
the identification of such biases is also assessed. Based on the most
appropriate fairness measures, a comparative analysis of widely used
pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing bias mitigation strategies
is performed. Moreover, a novel composite measure is introduced to quantify the
trade-off between fairness and performance by considering the F1-score and the
equalized odds ratio, making it appropriate for medical diagnostic
applications. The obtained results reveal the existence of biases related to
age and race, while no significant gender bias is observed. The deployed
mitigation strategies yield varying improvements in terms of fairness across
the different sensitive attributes and studied subproblems. For race and
gender, Reject Option Classification improves equalized odds by 46% and 57%,
respectively, and achieves harmonic mean scores of 0.75 and 0.80 in the MCI
versus AD subproblem, whereas for age, in the same subproblem, adversarial
debiasing yields the highest equalized odds improvement of 40% with a harmonic
mean score of 0.69. Insights are provided into how variations in AD
neuropathology and risk factors, associated with demographic characteristics,

Abstract: Many modern learning tasks require models that can take inputs of varying

domains where the inputs are graphs, sets, and point clouds. Recent work on
graph neural networks has explored whether a model trained on low-dimensional
data can transfer its performance to higher-dimensional inputs. We extend this
body of work by introducing a general framework for transferability across
dimensions. We show that transferability corresponds precisely to continuity in
a limit space formed by identifying small problem instances with equivalent
large ones. This identification is driven by the data and the learning task. We
instantiate our framework on existing architectures, and implement the
necessary changes to ensure their transferability. Finally, we provide design
principles for designing new transferable models. Numerical experiments support

breadth-first and depth-first tree search. We evaluate our approach on a range

Abstract: Graph Bayesian optimization (BO) has shown potential as a powerful and
data-efficient tool for neural architecture search (NAS). Most existing graph
BO works focus on developing graph surrogates models, i.e., metrics of networks
and/or different kernels to quantify the similarity between networks. However,
the acquisition optimization, as a discrete optimization task over graph
structures, is not well studied due to the complexity of formulating the graph
search space and acquisition functions. This paper presents explicit
optimization formulations for graph input space including properties such as
reachability and shortest paths, which are used later to formulate graph
kernels and the acquisition function. We theoretically prove that the proposed
encoding is an equivalent representation of the graph space and provide
restrictions for the NAS domain with either node or edge labels. Numerical
results over several NAS benchmarks show that our method efficiently finds the
optimal architecture for most cases, highlighting its efficacy.

Abstract: Solving systems of polynomial equations, particularly those with finitely
many solutions, is a crucial challenge across many scientific fields.
Traditional methods like Gr\"obner and Border bases are fundamental but suffer
from high computational costs, which have motivated recent Deep Learning
approaches to improve efficiency, albeit at the expense of output correctness.
In this work, we introduce the Oracle Border Basis Algorithm, the first Deep
Learning approach that accelerates Border basis computation while maintaining
output guarantees. To this end, we design and train a Transformer-based oracle
that identifies and eliminates computationally expensive reduction steps, which
we find to dominate the algorithm's runtime. By selectively invoking this
oracle during critical phases of computation, we achieve substantial speedup
factors of up to 3.5x compared to the base algorithm, without compromising the
correctness of results. To generate the training data, we develop a sampling
method and provide the first sampling theorem for border bases. We construct a
tokenization and embedding scheme tailored to monomial-centered algebraic
computations, resulting in a compact and expressive input representation, which
reduces the number of tokens to encode an $n$-variate polynomial by a factor of
$O(n)$. Our learning approach is data efficient, stable, and a practical
enhancement to traditional computer algebra algorithms and symbolic
computation.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models provide a powerful approach to training
control policies for physical systems, such as robots, by combining end-to-end
learning with transfer of semantic knowledge from web-scale vision-language
model (VLM) training. However, the constraints of real-time control are often
at odds with the design of VLMs: the most powerful VLMs have tens or hundreds
of billions of parameters, presenting an obstacle to real-time inference, and
operate on discrete tokens rather than the continuous-valued outputs that are
required for controlling robots. To address this challenge, recent VLA models
have used specialized modules for efficient continuous control, such as action
experts or continuous output heads, which typically require adding new
untrained parameters to the pretrained VLM backbone. While these modules
improve real-time and control capabilities, it remains an open question whether
they preserve or degrade the semantic knowledge contained in the pretrained
VLM, and what effect they have on the VLA training dynamics. In this paper, we
study this question in the context of VLAs that include a continuous diffusion
or flow matching action expert, showing that naively including such experts
significantly harms both training speed and knowledge transfer. We provide an
extensive analysis of various design choices, their impact on performance and
knowledge transfer, and propose a technique for insulating the VLM backbone
during VLA training that mitigates this issue. Videos are available at

Conclusion: MF-TRPO通过结合RL与平均场决策，为多智能体问题提供了理论支持的方法。

Abstract: We introduce Mean-Field Trust Region Policy Optimization (MF-TRPO), a novel
algorithm designed to compute approximate Nash equilibria for ergodic
Mean-Field Games (MFG) in finite state-action spaces. Building on the
well-established performance of TRPO in the reinforcement learning (RL)
setting, we extend its methodology to the MFG framework, leveraging its
stability and robustness in policy optimization. Under standard assumptions in
the MFG literature, we provide a rigorous analysis of MF-TRPO, establishing
theoretical guarantees on its convergence. Our results cover both the exact
formulation of the algorithm and its sample-based counterpart, where we derive
high-probability guarantees and finite sample complexity. This work advances
MFG optimization by bridging RL techniques with mean-field decision-making,
offering a theoretically grounded approach to solving complex multi-agent
problems.

TL;DR: JAPAN是一种基于密度的共形预测框架，利用归一化流模型构建紧凑且自适应的预测区域，解决了传统残差方法在复杂分布下的保守性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统共形预测方法依赖残差评分，导致预测区域过于保守且难以捕捉复杂分布的真实形状。JAPAN旨在通过密度评分改进这一问题。

Method: JAPAN使用归一化流模型估计预测密度，并通过阈值化密度评分构建预测区域，支持紧凑、非连续且自适应的区域。

Result: 实验表明，JAPAN在多变量回归和预测任务中表现良好，校准准确且预测区域更紧凑。

Conclusion: JAPAN提供了一种高效且灵活的共形预测框架，适用于复杂分布场景。

Abstract: Conformal prediction provides a model-agnostic framework for uncertainty
quantification with finite-sample validity guarantees, making it an attractive
tool for constructing reliable prediction sets. However, existing approaches
commonly rely on residual-based conformity scores, which impose geometric
constraints and struggle when the underlying distribution is multimodal. In
particular, they tend to produce overly conservative prediction areas centred
around the mean, often failing to capture the true shape of complex predictive
distributions. In this work, we introduce JAPAN (Joint Adaptive Prediction
Areas with Normalising-Flows), a conformal prediction framework that uses
density-based conformity scores. By leveraging flow-based models, JAPAN
estimates the (predictive) density and constructs prediction areas by
thresholding on the estimated density scores, enabling compact, potentially
disjoint, and context-adaptive regions that retain finite-sample coverage
guarantees. We theoretically motivate the efficiency of JAPAN and empirically
validate it across multivariate regression and forecasting tasks, demonstrating
good calibration and tighter prediction areas compared to existing baselines.
We also provide several \emph{extensions} adding flexibility to our proposed
framework.

Method: 对Muon进行收敛率分析，并与梯度下降（GD）比较，探讨其优越性能的条件。

Result: 理论分析表明，Muon能从Hessian矩阵的低秩和近似块对角结构中受益。实验结果支持理论发现。

Conclusion: Muon在特定条件下优于GD，其性能与Hessian矩阵的结构特性密切相关。

Abstract: The majority of parameters in neural networks are naturally represented as
matrices. However, most commonly used optimizers treat these matrix parameters
as flattened vectors during optimization, potentially overlooking their
inherent structural properties. Recently, an optimizer called Muon has been
proposed, specifically designed to optimize matrix-structured parameters.
Extensive empirical evidence shows that Muon can significantly outperform
traditional optimizers when training neural networks. Nonetheless, the
theoretical understanding of Muon's convergence behavior and the reasons behind
its superior performance remain limited. In this work, we present a
comprehensive convergence rate analysis of Muon and its comparison with
Gradient Descent (GD). We further characterize the conditions under which Muon
can outperform GD. Our theoretical results reveal that Muon can benefit from
the low-rank and approximate blockwise diagonal structure of Hessian matrices
-- phenomena widely observed in practical neural network training. Our
experimental results support and corroborate the theoretical findings.

Result: 提供了认知误差界限和相应的泛化界限，并通过合成实验验证了负迁移的新定义。

Conclusion: 论文为处理认知不确定性提供了理论工具，适用于多种学习场景。

Abstract: When data are noisy, a statistical learner's goal is to resolve epistemic
uncertainty about the data it will encounter at test-time, i.e., to identify
the distribution of test (target) data. Many real-world learning settings
introduce sources of epistemic uncertainty that can not be resolved on the
basis of training (source) data alone: The source data may arise from multiple
tasks (multitask learning), the target data may differ systematically from the
source data tasks (distribution shift), and/or the learner may not arrive at an
accurate characterization of the source data (imperfect learning). We introduce
a principled definition of epistemic error, and provide a generic,
decompositional epistemic error bound. Our error bound is the first to (i)
consider epistemic error specifically, (ii) accommodate all the sources of
epistemic uncertainty above, and (iii) separately attribute the error to each
of multiple aspects of the learning procedure and environment. As corollaries
of the generic result, we provide (i) epistemic error bounds specialized to the
settings of Bayesian transfer learning and distribution shift within
$\epsilon$-neighborhoods, and (ii) a set of corresponding generalization
bounds. Finally, we provide a novel definition of negative transfer, and
validate its insights in a synthetic experimental setting.

Conclusion: TTA是一种灵活、计算高效且有效的方法，可显著提升共形分类器的实用性。

Abstract: A conformal classifier produces a set of predicted classes and provides a
probabilistic guarantee that the set includes the true class. Unfortunately, it
is often the case that conformal classifiers produce uninformatively large
sets. In this work, we show that test-time augmentation (TTA)--a technique that
introduces inductive biases during inference--reduces the size of the sets
produced by conformal classifiers. Our approach is flexible, computationally
efficient, and effective. It can be combined with any conformal score, requires
no model retraining, and reduces prediction set sizes by 10%-14% on average. We
conduct an evaluation of the approach spanning three datasets, three models,
two established conformal scoring methods, different guarantee strengths, and
several distribution shifts to show when and why test-time augmentation is a
useful addition to the conformal pipeline.

Abstract: The growing reliance on artificial intelligence in safety- and
security-critical applications demands effective neural network certification.
A challenging real-world use case is certification against ``patch attacks'',
where adversarial patches or lighting conditions obscure parts of images, for
example traffic signs. One approach to certification, which also gives
quantitative coverage estimates, utilizes preimages of neural networks, i.e.,
the set of inputs that lead to a specified output. However, these preimage
approximation methods, including the state-of-the-art PREMAP algorithm,
struggle with scalability. This paper presents novel algorithmic improvements
to PREMAP involving tighter bounds, adaptive Monte Carlo sampling, and improved
branching heuristics. We demonstrate efficiency improvements of at least an
order of magnitude on reinforcement learning control benchmarks, and show that
our method scales to convolutional neural networks that were previously
infeasible. Our results demonstrate the potential of preimage approximation
methodology for reliability and robustness certification.

Conclusion: 数据集质量是优化机器学习分类的独立目标。

Abstract: In the universal quest to optimize machine-learning classifiers, three
factors -- model architecture, dataset size, and class balance -- have been
shown to influence test-time performance but do not fully account for it.
Previously, evidence was presented for an additional factor that can be
referred to as dataset quality, but it was unclear whether this was actually a
joint property of the dataset and the model architecture, or an intrinsic
property of the dataset itself. If quality is truly dataset-intrinsic and
independent of model architecture, dataset size, and class balance, then the
same datasets should perform better (or worse) regardless of these other
factors. To test this hypothesis, here we create thousands of datasets, each
controlled for size and class balance, and use them to train classifiers with a
wide range of architectures, from random forests and support-vector machines to
deep networks. We find that classifier performance correlates strongly by
subset across architectures ($R^2=0.79$), supporting quality as an intrinsic
property of datasets independent of dataset size and class balance and of model
architecture. Digging deeper, we find that dataset quality appears to be an
emergent property of something more fundamental: the quality of datasets'
constituent classes. Thus, quality joins size, class balance, and model
architecture as an independent correlate of performance and a separate target
for optimizing machine-learning-based classification.

Abstract: Recent findings suggest that diffusion models significantly enhance empirical
adversarial robustness. While some intuitive explanations have been proposed,
the precise mechanisms underlying these improvements remain unclear. In this
work, we systematically investigate how and how well diffusion models improve
adversarial robustness. First, we observe that diffusion models intriguingly
increase, rather than decrease, the $\ell_p$ distance to clean
samples--challenging the intuition that purification denoises inputs closer to
the original data. Second, we find that the purified images are heavily
influenced by the internal randomness of diffusion models, where a compression
effect arises within each randomness configuration. Motivated by this
observation, we evaluate robustness under fixed randomness and find that the
improvement drops to approximately 24% on CIFAR-10--substantially lower than
prior reports approaching 70%. Importantly, we show that this remaining
robustness gain strongly correlates with the model's ability to compress the
input space, revealing the compression rate as a reliable robustness indicator
without requiring gradient-based analysis. Our findings provide novel insights
into the mechanisms underlying diffusion-based purification, and offer guidance
for developing more effective and principled adversarial purification systems.

Abstract: We study an extension of contextual stochastic linear optimization (CSLO)
that, in contrast to most of the existing literature, involves inequality
constraints that depend on uncertain parameters predicted by a machine learning
model. To handle the constraint uncertainty, we use contextual uncertainty sets
constructed via methods like conformal prediction. Given a contextual
uncertainty set method, we introduce the "Smart Predict-then-Optimize with
Robust Constraints" (SPO-RC) loss, a feasibility-sensitive adaptation of the
SPO loss that measures decision error of predicted objective parameters. We
also introduce a convex surrogate, SPO-RC+, and prove Fisher consistency with
SPO-RC. To enhance performance, we train on truncated datasets where true
constraint parameters lie within the uncertainty sets, and we correct the
induced sample selection bias using importance reweighting techniques. Through
experiments on fractional knapsack and alloy production problem instances, we
demonstrate that SPO-RC+ effectively handles uncertainty in constraints and
that combining truncation with importance reweighting can further improve
performance.

Conclusion: FTRL的动态遗憾问题源于算法状态与迭代的分离，而非懒惰投影风格。

Abstract: We revisit the Follow the Regularized Leader (FTRL) framework for Online
Convex Optimization (OCO) over compact sets, focusing on achieving dynamic
regret guarantees. Prior work has highlighted the framework's limitations in
dynamic environments due to its tendency to produce "lazy" iterates. However,
building on insights showing FTRL's ability to produce "agile" iterates, we
show that it can indeed recover known dynamic regret bounds through optimistic
composition of future costs and careful linearization of past costs, which can
lead to pruning some of them. This new analysis of FTRL against dynamic
comparators yields a principled way to interpolate between greedy and agile
updates and offers several benefits, including refined control over regret
terms, optimism without cyclic dependence, and the application of minimal
recursive regularization akin to AdaFTRL. More broadly, we show that it is not
the lazy projection style of FTRL that hinders (optimistic) dynamic regret, but
the decoupling of the algorithm's state (linearized history) from its iterates,
allowing the state to grow arbitrarily. Instead, pruning synchronizes these two
when necessary.

Abstract: The widespread success of foundation models in natural language processing
and computer vision has inspired researchers to extend the concept to
scientific machine learning and computational science. However, this position
paper argues that as the term "foundation model" is an evolving concept, its
application in computational science is increasingly used without a universally
accepted definition, potentially creating confusion and diluting its precise
scientific meaning. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing a formal
definition of foundation models in computational science, grounded in the core
values of generality, reusability, and scalability. We articulate a set of
essential and desirable characteristics that such models must exhibit, drawing
parallels with traditional foundational methods, like the finite element and
finite volume methods. Furthermore, we introduce the Data-Driven Finite Element
Method (DD-FEM), a framework that fuses the modular structure of classical FEM
with the representational power of data-driven learning. We demonstrate how
DD-FEM addresses many of the key challenges in realizing foundation models for
computational science, including scalability, adaptability, and physics
consistency. By bridging traditional numerical methods with modern AI
paradigms, this work provides a rigorous foundation for evaluating and
developing novel approaches toward future foundation models in computational

Conclusion: 图数据的高维特性本身为去噪过程提供了足够信息，支持设计更简单高效的GDM架构。

Abstract: Explicit noise-level conditioning is widely regarded as essential for the
effective operation of Graph Diffusion Models (GDMs). In this work, we
challenge this assumption by investigating whether denoisers can implicitly
infer noise levels directly from corrupted graph structures, potentially
eliminating the need for explicit noise conditioning. To this end, we develop a
theoretical framework centered on Bernoulli edge-flip corruptions and extend it
to encompass more complex scenarios involving coupled structure-attribute
noise. Extensive empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world graph
datasets, using models such as GDSS and DiGress, provide strong support for our
theoretical findings. Notably, unconditional GDMs achieve performance
comparable or superior to their conditioned counterparts, while also offering
reductions in parameters (4-6%) and computation time (8-10%). Our results
suggest that the high-dimensional nature of graph data itself often encodes
sufficient information for the denoising process, opening avenues for simpler,
more efficient GDM architectures.

Abstract: Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are a class of graphs commonly used in
practice, with examples that include electronic circuits, Bayesian networks,
and neural architectures. While many effective encoders exist for DAGs, it
remains challenging to decode them in a principled manner, because the nodes of
a DAG can have many different topological orders. In this work, we propose a
grammar-based approach to constructing a principled, compact and equivalent
sequential representation of a DAG. Specifically, we view a graph as
derivations over an unambiguous grammar, where the DAG corresponds to a unique
sequence of production rules. Equivalently, the procedure to construct such a
description can be viewed as a lossless compression of the data. Such a
representation has many uses, including building a generative model for graph
generation, learning a latent space for property prediction, and leveraging the
sequence representational continuity for Bayesian Optimization over structured
data. Code is available at https://github.com/shiningsunnyday/induction.

Abstract: Diffusion models represent the state-of-the-art for solving inverse problems
such as image restoration tasks. In the Bayesian framework, diffusion-based
inverse solvers incorporate a likelihood term to guide the prior sampling
process, generating data consistent with the posterior distribution. However,
due to the intractability of the likelihood term, many current methods rely on
isotropic Gaussian approximations, which lead to deviations from the data
manifold and result in inconsistent, unstable reconstructions. We propose
Equivariance Regularized (EquiReg) diffusion, a general framework for
regularizing posterior sampling in diffusion-based inverse problem solvers.
EquiReg enhances reconstructions by reweighting diffusion trajectories and
penalizing those that deviate from the data manifold. We define a new
distribution-dependent equivariance error, empirically identify functions that
exhibit low error for on-manifold samples and higher error for off-manifold
samples, and leverage these functions to regularize the diffusion sampling
process. When applied to a variety of solvers, EquiReg outperforms
state-of-the-art diffusion models in both linear and nonlinear image
restoration tasks, as well as in reconstructing partial differential equations.

Motivation: K-means聚类可能在敏感变量（如性别或种族）上存在不公平性，导致偏见和社会问题。

Method: 采用两阶段优化：先聚类，再调整少量数据点的成员关系。提出两种高效算法识别对公平性影响大的数据点。

Result: 实验表明，公平性显著提升，聚类质量影响极小。方法可扩展至其他聚类算法或公平性指标。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了K-means聚类的公平性问题，且具有通用性。

Abstract: The popular K-means clustering algorithm potentially suffers from a major
weakness for further analysis or interpretation. Some cluster may have
disproportionately more (or fewer) points from one of the subpopulations in
terms of some sensitive variable, e.g., gender or race. Such a fairness issue
may cause bias and unexpected social consequences. This work attempts to
improve the fairness of K-means clustering with a two-stage optimization
formulation--clustering first and then adjust cluster membership of a small
subset of selected data points. Two computationally efficient algorithms are
proposed in identifying those data points that are expensive for fairness, with
one focusing on nearest data points outside of a cluster and the other on
highly 'mixed' data points. Experiments on benchmark datasets show substantial
improvement on fairness with a minimal impact to clustering quality. The
proposed algorithms can be easily extended to a broad class of clustering
algorithms or fairness metrics.

Conclusion: 提出的基准测试和评估方法为TTS领域提供了更全面的评估工具。

Abstract: Text-to-Speech (TTS) benchmarks often fail to capture how well models handle
nuanced and semantically complex text. Building on $\textit{EmergentTTS}$, we
introduce $\textit{EmergentTTS-Eval}$, a comprehensive benchmark covering six
challenging TTS scenarios: emotions, paralinguistics, foreign words, syntactic
complexity, complex pronunciation (e.g. URLs, formulas), and questions.
Crucially, our framework automates both test-case generation and evaluation,
making the benchmark easily extensible. Starting from a small set of
human-written seed prompts, we iteratively extend them using LLMs to target
specific structural, phonetic and prosodic challenges, resulting in 1,645
diverse test cases. Moreover, we employ a model-as-a-judge approach, using a
Large Audio Language Model (LALM) to assess the speech across multiple
dimensions such as expressed emotion, prosodic, intonational, and pronunciation
accuracy. We evaluate state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary TTS systems,
such as 11Labs, Deepgram, and OpenAI's 4o-mini-TTS, on EmergentTTS-Eval,
demonstrating its ability to reveal fine-grained performance differences.
Results show that the model-as-a-judge approach offers robust TTS assessment
and a high correlation with human preferences. We open source the evaluation

Conclusion: 双曲PDEs范式为谱GNNs提供了一种消息传递增强方法，同时提升了拓扑特征的显式提取和解释性。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) leverage message passing mechanisms to learn the
topological features of graph data. Traditional GNNs learns node features in a
spatial domain unrelated to the topology, which can hardly ensure topological
features. In this paper, we formulates message passing as a system of
hyperbolic partial differential equations (hyperbolic PDEs), constituting a
dynamical system that explicitly maps node representations into a particular
solution space. This solution space is spanned by a set of eigenvectors
describing the topological structure of graphs. Within this system, for any
moment in time, a node features can be decomposed into a superposition of the
basis of eigenvectors. This not only enhances the interpretability of message
passing but also enables the explicit extraction of fundamental characteristics
about the topological structure. Furthermore, by solving this system of
hyperbolic partial differential equations, we establish a connection with
spectral graph neural networks (spectral GNNs), serving as a message passing
enhancement paradigm for spectral GNNs.We further introduce polynomials to
approximate arbitrary filter functions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
the paradigm of hyperbolic PDEs not only exhibits strong flexibility but also
significantly enhances the performance of various spectral GNNs across diverse
graph tasks.

efficacy of Large EEG Models (LEMs) by fine-tuning LaBraM, a state-of-the-art
foundation EEG model, on a real-world stress classification dataset collected

using data from controlled clinical settings, our work assesses their
applicability to real-world environments. We train a binary classifier that
distinguishes between normal and elevated stress states using resting-state EEG
data recorded from 18 graduate students during a class session. The
best-performing fine-tuned model achieves a balanced accuracy of 90.47% with a
5-second window, significantly outperforming traditional stress classifiers in
both accuracy and inference efficiency. We further evaluate the robustness of
the fine-tuned LEM under random data shuffling and reduced channel counts.
These results demonstrate the capability of LEMs to effectively process
real-world EEG data and highlight their potential to revolutionize
brain-computer interface applications by shifting the focus from model-centric

Abstract: Trajectory data is crucial for various applications but often suffers from

Existing imputation methods rely on sparse trajectory or travel information,

that sparse trajectories retain essential behavioral patterns, which place
significant demands on data acquisition and overlook the potential of
large-scale human trajectory embeddings. To address this, we propose ProDiff, a
trajectory imputation framework that uses only two endpoints as minimal

and a denoising diffusion probabilistic model for robust spatiotemporal
reconstruction. Joint training with a tailored loss function ensures effective
imputation. ProDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving accuracy by

Result: CDR-Agent在CDR选择上比基线LLM提升了56.3%（合成数据）和8.7%（CDR-Bench），同时显著降低计算开销。

Conclusion: CDR-Agent在高效选择CDR和谨慎决策方面优于传统LLM方法。

Abstract: Clinical decision-making is inherently complex and fast-paced, particularly
in emergency departments (EDs) where critical, rapid and high-stakes decisions
are made. Clinical Decision Rules (CDRs) are standardized evidence-based tools
that combine signs, symptoms, and clinical variables into decision trees to
make consistent and accurate diagnoses. CDR usage is often hindered by the
clinician's cognitive load, limiting their ability to quickly recall and apply
the appropriate rules. We introduce CDR-Agent, a novel LLM-based system
designed to enhance ED decision-making by autonomously identifying and applying
the most appropriate CDRs based on unstructured clinical notes. To validate
CDR-Agent, we curated two novel ED datasets: synthetic and CDR-Bench, although
CDR-Agent is applicable to non ED clinics. CDR-Agent achieves a 56.3\%
(synthetic) and 8.7\% (CDR-Bench) accuracy gain relative to the standalone LLM
baseline in CDR selection. Moreover, CDR-Agent significantly reduces
computational overhead. Using these datasets, we demonstrated that CDR-Agent
not only selects relevant CDRs efficiently, but makes cautious yet effective
imaging decisions by minimizing unnecessary interventions while successfully
identifying most positively diagnosed cases, outperforming traditional LLM
prompting approaches. Code for our work can be found at:

Conclusion: BOGC-MML通过显式建模梯度不确定性，优化了多模态学习的性能。

Abstract: Multi-Modal Learning (MML) integrates information from diverse modalities to
improve predictive accuracy. However, existing methods mainly aggregate
gradients with fixed weights and treat all dimensions equally, overlooking the
intrinsic gradient uncertainty of each modality. This may lead to (i) excessive
updates in sensitive dimensions, degrading performance, and (ii) insufficient
updates in less sensitive dimensions, hindering learning. To address this
issue, we propose BOGC-MML, a Bayesian-Oriented Gradient Calibration method for
MML to explicitly model the gradient uncertainty and guide the model
optimization towards the optimal direction. Specifically, we first model each
modality's gradient as a random variable and derive its probability
distribution, capturing the full uncertainty in the gradient space. Then, we
propose an effective method that converts the precision (inverse variance) of
each gradient distribution into a scalar evidence. This evidence quantifies the
confidence of each modality in every gradient dimension. Using these evidences,
we explicitly quantify per-dimension uncertainties and fuse them via a reduced
Dempster-Shafer rule. The resulting uncertainty-weighted aggregation produces a
calibrated update direction that balances sensitivity and conservatism across
dimensions. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method.

Abstract: SE(3)-equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have significantly advanced
molecular system modeling by employing group representations. However, their
message passing processes, which rely on tensor product-based convolutions, are
limited by insufficient non-linearity and incomplete group representations,
thereby restricting expressiveness. To overcome these limitations, we introduce
the Equivariant Spherical Transformer (EST), a novel framework that leverages a
Transformer structure within the spatial domain of group representations after
Fourier transform. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that EST can
encompass the function space of tensor products while achieving superior
expressiveness. Furthermore, EST's equivariant inductive bias is guaranteed
through a uniform sampling strategy for the Fourier transform. Our experiments
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance by EST on various molecular
benchmarks, including OC20 and QM9.

method integrates a reinforcement learning framework to dynamically select
neighborhood operators based on real-time solution states and learned
experience. We introduce a fitness metric that quantifies customers' temporal
flexibility to improve the shaking phase, and employ a transformer-based neural
policy network to intelligently guide operator selection during the local
search. Extensive computational experiments are conducted on realistic
scenarios derived from the replenishment of unmanned vending machines,
characterized by multiple clustered replenishment windows. Results demonstrate
that RL-AVNS significantly outperforms traditional variable neighborhood search
(VNS), adaptive VNS (AVNS), and state-of-the-art learning-based heuristics,
achieving substantial improvements in solution quality and computational
efficiency across various instance scales and time window complexities.
Particularly notable is the algorithm's capability to generalize effectively to

Conclusion: LUMION显著提高了数据中心资源利用率和ML任务性能，为加速器故障处理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: When accelerators fail in modern ML datacenters, operators migrate the
affected ML training or inference jobs to entirely new racks. This approach,
while preserving network performance, is highly inefficient, requiring
datacenters to reserve full racks of idle accelerators for fault tolerance. In
this paper, we address this resource inefficiency by introducing LUMION, a
novel reconfigurable optical fabric for connecting accelerators within a
datacenter rack. Instead of migrating entire ML jobs, LUMION dynamically
integrates spare accelerators into ongoing workloads as failures occur, thereby
maintaining consistent performance without costly migrations. We show the
benefits of LUMION by building an end-to-end hardware prototype. Our
experiments fine-tune Llama 3.2 and show that LUMION swaps a failed GPU with a
healthy one and restarts the ML job within ~ 1 second of the failure. LUMION
achieves higher inter-GPU bandwidth compared to traditional electrical racks
after replacing failed accelerators with spare ones, leading to nearly 2X
improvement in fine-tuning throughput.

Abstract: Time series forecasting with exogenous variables is a critical emerging
paradigm that presents unique challenges in modeling dependencies between
variables. Traditional models often struggle to differentiate between
endogenous and exogenous variables, leading to inefficiencies and overfitting.
In this paper, we introduce CrossLinear, a novel Linear-based forecasting model
that addresses these challenges by incorporating a plug-and-play
cross-correlation embedding module. This lightweight module captures the
dependencies between variables with minimal computational cost and seamlessly
integrates into existing neural networks. Specifically, it captures
time-invariant and direct variable dependencies while disregarding time-varying
or indirect dependencies, thereby mitigating the risk of overfitting in
dependency modeling and contributing to consistent performance improvements.
Furthermore, CrossLinear employs patch-wise processing and a global linear head
to effectively capture both short-term and long-term temporal dependencies,
further improving its forecasting precision. Extensive experiments on 12
real-world datasets demonstrate that CrossLinear achieves superior performance
in both short-term and long-term forecasting tasks. The ablation study
underscores the effectiveness of the cross-correlation embedding module.
Additionally, the generalizability of this module makes it a valuable plug-in

Abstract: We study the problem of assigning operations in a dataflow graph to devices

TensorFlow, which under-utilize devices due to barrier synchronization; (2)
lack of awareness of the scheduling mechanism of underlying systems when
designing learning-based methods; and (3) exclusive dependence on reinforcement
learning, ignoring the structure of effective heuristics designed by experts.
In this paper, we propose \textsc{Doppler}, a three-stage framework for

selecting operations and 2) a $\mathsf{PLC}$ policy for placing chosen
operations on devices. Our experiments show that \textsc{Doppler} outperforms

Abstract: We study the best arm identification (BAI) problem with potentially biased
offline data in the fixed confidence setting, which commonly arises in
real-world scenarios such as clinical trials. We prove an impossibility result
for adaptive algorithms without prior knowledge of the bias bound between
online and offline distributions. To address this, we propose the LUCB-H
algorithm, which introduces adaptive confidence bounds by incorporating an
auxiliary bias correction to balance offline and online data within the LUCB
framework. Theoretical analysis shows that LUCB-H matches the sample complexity
of standard LUCB when offline data is misleading and significantly outperforms
it when offline data is helpful. We also derive an instance-dependent lower
bound that matches the upper bound of LUCB-H in certain scenarios. Numerical
experiments further demonstrate the robustness and adaptability of LUCB-H in
effectively incorporating offline data.

Abstract: Deep learning models often struggle to maintain performance when deployed on
data distributions different from their training data, particularly in
real-world applications where environmental conditions frequently change. While
Multi-source Domain Generalization (MDG) has shown promise in addressing this

Pseudo Multi-source Domain Generalization (PMDG), a novel framework that

Single-source Domain Generalization (SDG) settings. PMDG generates multiple
pseudo-domains from a single source domain through style transfer and data
augmentation techniques, creating a synthetic multi-domain dataset that can be

empirical results provide valuable insights for future research in domain

Abstract: Contrastive learning has emerged as a competent approach for unsupervised
representation learning. However, the design of an optimal augmentation
strategy, although crucial for contrastive learning, is less explored for time
series classification tasks. Existing predefined time-domain augmentation
methods are primarily adopted from vision and are not specific to time series
data. Consequently, this cross-modality incompatibility may distort the
semantically relevant information of time series by introducing mismatched
patterns into the data. To address this limitation, we present a novel
perspective from the frequency domain and identify three advantages for
downstream classification: global, independent, and compact. To fully utilize
the three properties, we propose the lightweight yet effective Frequency
Refined Augmentation (FreRA) tailored for time series contrastive learning on
classification tasks, which can be seamlessly integrated with contrastive
learning frameworks in a plug-and-play manner. Specifically, FreRA
automatically separates critical and unimportant frequency components.
Accordingly, we propose semantic-aware Identity Modification and
semantic-agnostic Self-adaptive Modification to protect semantically relevant
information in the critical frequency components and infuse variance into the
unimportant ones respectively. Theoretically, we prove that FreRA generates
semantic-preserving views. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments on two
benchmark datasets, including UCR and UEA archives, as well as five large-scale
datasets on diverse applications. FreRA consistently outperforms ten leading
baselines on time series classification, anomaly detection, and transfer
learning tasks, demonstrating superior capabilities in contrastive
representation learning and generalization in transfer learning scenarios
across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Message-Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) have become a cornerstone for
processing and analyzing graph-structured data. However, their effectiveness is
often hindered by phenomena such as over-squashing, where long-range
dependencies or interactions are inadequately captured and expressed in the
MPNN output. This limitation mirrors the challenges of the Effective Receptive
Field (ERF) in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), where the theoretical
receptive field is underutilized in practice. In this work, we show and
theoretically explain the limited ERF problem in MPNNs. Furthermore, inspired
by recent advances in ERF augmentation for CNNs, we propose an Interleaved
Multiscale Message-Passing Neural Networks (IM-MPNN) architecture to address
these problems in MPNNs. Our method incorporates a hierarchical coarsening of
the graph, enabling message-passing across multiscale representations and
facilitating long-range interactions without excessive depth or
parameterization. Through extensive evaluations on benchmarks such as the
Long-Range Graph Benchmark (LRGB), we demonstrate substantial improvements over
baseline MPNNs in capturing long-range dependencies while maintaining
computational efficiency.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多标签数据集中复杂非线性关联问题，并实现了特征与标签空间的对齐。

Abstract: The rapid growth in feature dimension may introduce implicit associations
between features and labels in multi-label datasets, making the relationships
between features and labels increasingly complex. Moreover, existing methods
often adopt low-dimensional linear decomposition to explore the associations
between features and labels. However, linear decomposition struggles to capture
complex nonlinear associations and may lead to misalignment between the feature
space and the label space. To address these two critical challenges, we propose
innovative solutions. First, we design a random walk graph that integrates
feature-feature, label-label, and feature-label relationships to accurately
capture nonlinear and implicit indirect associations, while optimizing the
latent representations of associations between features and labels after
low-rank decomposition. Second, we align the variable spaces by leveraging
low-dimensional representation coefficients, while preserving the manifold
structure between the original high-dimensional multi-label data and the
low-dimensional representation space. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies conducted on seven benchmark datasets and three representative datasets
using various evaluation metrics demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
method\footnote{Code: https://github.com/Heilong623/-GRW-}.

Conclusion: 通过近似状态价值函数而非状态-控制价值函数，可以统一策略梯度方法。

Abstract: Policy gradients in continuous control have been derived for both stochastic
and deterministic policies. Here we study the relationship between the two. In
a widely-used family of MDPs involving Gaussian control noise and quadratic
control costs, we show that the stochastic and deterministic policy gradients,
natural gradients, and state value functions are identical; while the
state-control value functions are different. We then develop a general
procedure for constructing an MDP with deterministic policy that is equivalent
to a given MDP with stochastic policy. The controls of this new MDP are the
sufficient statistics of the stochastic policy in the original MDP. Our results
suggest that policy gradient methods can be unified by approximating state
value functions rather than state-control value functions.

Conclusion: DFL-Shapley和DFL-MR是DFL中有效的贡献测量方法，填补了现有方法的空白。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train
models without sharing their data. Measuring participant contributions in FL is
crucial for incentivizing clients and ensuring transparency. While various
methods have been proposed for contribution measurement, they are designed
exclusively for centralized federated learning (CFL), where a central server
collects and aggregates client models, along with evaluating their
contributions. Meanwhile, decentralized federated learning (DFL), in which
clients exchange models directly without a central server, has gained
significant attention for mitigating communication bottlenecks and eliminating
a single point of failure. However, applying existing contribution measurement
methods to DFL is challenging due to the presence of multiple global models and
the absence of a central server. In this study, we present novel methodologies
for measuring participant contributions in DFL. We first propose DFL-Shapley,
an extension of the Shapley value tailored for DFL, adapting this widely used
CFL metric to decentralized settings. Given the impracticality of computing the
ideal DFL-Shapley in real-world systems, we introduce DFL-MR, a computable
approximation that estimates overall contributions by accumulating round-wise
Shapley values. We evaluate DFL-Shapley and DFL-MR across various FL scenarios
and compare them with existing CFL metrics. The experimental results confirm
DFL-Shapley as a valid ground-truth metric and demonstrate DFL-MR's proximity
to DFL-Shapley across various settings, highlighting their effectiveness as
contribution metrics in DFL.

Abstract: Recent Diffusion models (DMs) advancements have explored incorporating the
second-order diffusion Fisher information (DF), defined as the negative Hessian
of log density, into various downstream tasks and theoretical analysis.
However, current practices typically approximate the diffusion Fisher by
applying auto-differentiation to the learned score network. This black-box
method, though straightforward, lacks any accuracy guarantee and is
time-consuming. In this paper, we show that the diffusion Fisher actually
resides within a space spanned by the outer products of score and initial data.
Based on the outer-product structure, we develop two efficient approximation
algorithms to access the trace and matrix-vector multiplication of DF,
respectively. These algorithms bypass the auto-differentiation operations with
time-efficient vector-product calculations. Furthermore, we establish the
approximation error bounds for the proposed algorithms. Experiments in
likelihood evaluation and adjoint optimization demonstrate the superior
accuracy and reduced computational cost of our proposed algorithms.
Additionally, based on the novel outer-product formulation of DF, we design the
first numerical verification experiment for the optimal transport property of
the general PF-ODE deduced map.

Abstract: Determining conditional independence (CI) relationships between random
variables is a fundamental yet challenging task in machine learning and
statistics, especially in high-dimensional settings. Existing generative
model-based CI testing methods, such as those utilizing generative adversarial
networks (GANs), often struggle with undesirable modeling of conditional
distributions and training instability, resulting in subpar performance. To
address these issues, we propose a novel CI testing method via score-based
generative modeling, which achieves precise Type I error control and strong
testing power. Concretely, we first employ a sliced conditional score matching
scheme to accurately estimate conditional score and use Langevin dynamics
conditional sampling to generate null hypothesis samples, ensuring precise Type
I error control. Then, we incorporate a goodness-of-fit stage into the method
to verify generated samples and enhance interpretability in practice. We
theoretically establish the error bound of conditional distributions modeled by
score-based generative models and prove the validity of our CI tests. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, providing a
promising way to revitalize generative model-based CI testing.

Abstract: Bayesian network classifiers (BNCs) possess a number of properties desirable
for a modern classifier: They are easily interpretable, highly scalable, and
offer adaptable complexity. However, traditional methods for learning BNCs have
historically underperformed when compared to leading classification methods
such as random forests. Recent parameter smoothing techniques using
hierarchical Dirichlet processes (HDPs) have enabled BNCs to achieve
performance competitive with random forests on categorical data, but these
techniques are relatively inflexible, and require a complicated, specialized
sampling process. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for parameter
estimation that uses a log-linear regression to approximate the behaviour of
HDPs. As a linear model, our method is remarkably flexible and simple to
interpret, and can leverage the vast literature on learning linear models. Our
experiments show that our method can outperform HDP smoothing while being
orders of magnitude faster, remaining competitive with random forests on
categorical data.

Conclusion: GraphPAE通过双路径设计有效解决了传统GAEs的局限性，能够学习更丰富的图结构信息，并在多个任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Graph self-supervised learning seeks to learn effective graph representations
without relying on labeled data. Among various approaches, graph autoencoders
(GAEs) have gained significant attention for their efficiency and scalability.
Typically, GAEs take incomplete graphs as input and predict missing elements,
such as masked nodes or edges. While effective, our experimental investigation
reveals that traditional node or edge masking paradigms primarily capture
low-frequency signals in the graph and fail to learn the expressive structural
information. To address these issues, we propose Graph Positional Autoencoders
(GraphPAE), which employs a dual-path architecture to reconstruct both node
features and positions. Specifically, the feature path uses positional encoding
to enhance the message-passing processing, improving GAE's ability to predict
the corrupted information. The position path, on the other hand, leverages node
representations to refine positions and approximate eigenvectors, thereby
enabling the encoder to learn diverse frequency information. We conduct
extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of GraphPAE, including
heterophilic node classification, graph property prediction, and transfer
learning. The results demonstrate that GraphPAE achieves state-of-the-art
performance and consistently outperforms baselines by a large margin.

Abstract: Speaker-dependent modelling can substantially improve performance in
speech-based health monitoring applications. While mixed-effect models are
commonly used for such speaker adaptation, they require computationally
expensive retraining for each new observation, making them impractical in a
production environment. We reformulate this task as a meta-learning problem and
explore three approaches of increasing complexity: ensemble-based distance
models, prototypical networks, and transformer-based sequence models. Using
pre-trained speech embeddings, we evaluate these methods on a large
longitudinal dataset of shift workers (N=1,185, 10,286 recordings), predicting
time since sleep from speech as a function of fatigue, a symptom commonly
associated with ill-health. Our results demonstrate that all meta-learning
approaches tested outperformed both cross-sectional and conventional
mixed-effects models, with a transformer-based method achieving the strongest
performance.

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) poses significant challenges in open-world
scenarios, where models must not only learn new classes over time without
forgetting previous ones but also handle inputs from unknown classes that a
closed-set model would misclassify. Recent works address both issues by
(i)~training multi-head models using the task-incremental learning framework,
and (ii) predicting the task identity employing out-of-distribution (OOD)
detectors. While effective, the latter mainly relies on joint training with a
memory buffer of past data, raising concerns around privacy, scalability, and
increased training time. In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of
post-hoc OOD detection methods and investigate their potential to eliminate the
need for a memory buffer. We uncover that these methods, when applied
appropriately at inference time, can serve as a strong substitute for
buffer-based OOD detection. We show that this buffer-free approach achieves
comparable or superior performance to buffer-based methods both in terms of
class-incremental learning and the rejection of unknown samples. Experimental
results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Tiny ImageNet datasets support our findings,
offering new insights into the design of efficient and privacy-preserving CIL
systems for open-world settings.

Abstract: Predictive coding (PC) is an influential computational model of visual
learning and inference in the brain. Classical PC was proposed as a top-down
generative model, where the brain actively predicts upcoming visual inputs, and
inference minimises the prediction errors. Recent studies have also shown that
PC can be formulated as a discriminative model, where sensory inputs predict
neural activities in a feedforward manner. However, experimental evidence
suggests that the brain employs both generative and discriminative inference,
while unidirectional PC models show degraded performance in tasks requiring
bidirectional processing. In this work, we propose bidirectional PC (bPC), a PC
model that incorporates both generative and discriminative inference while
maintaining a biologically plausible circuit implementation. We show that bPC
matches or outperforms unidirectional models in their specialised generative or
discriminative tasks, by developing an energy landscape that simultaneously
suits both tasks. We also demonstrate bPC's superior performance in two
biologically relevant tasks including multimodal learning and inference with
missing information, suggesting that bPC resembles biological visual inference
more closely.

Abstract: Ranking systems influence decision-making in high-stakes domains like health,
education, and employment, where they can have substantial economic and social
impacts. This makes the integration of safety mechanisms essential. One such
mechanism is $\textit{abstention}$, which enables algorithmic decision-making
system to defer uncertain or low-confidence decisions to human experts. While
abstention have been predominantly explored in the context of classification
tasks, its application to other machine learning paradigms remains
underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for abstention in
pairwise learning-to-rank tasks. Our approach is based on thresholding the
ranker's conditional risk: the system abstains from making a decision when the
estimated risk exceeds a predefined threshold. Our contributions are threefold:
a theoretical characterization of the optimal abstention strategy, a
model-agnostic, plug-in algorithm for constructing abstaining ranking models,
and a comprehensive empirical evaluations across multiple datasets,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Knowledge graph completion (KGC) has attracted considerable attention in
recent years because it is critical to improving the quality of knowledge
graphs. Researchers have continuously explored various models. However, most
previous efforts have neglected to take advantage of regularization from a
deeper perspective and therefore have not been used to their full potential.
This paper rethinks the application of regularization methods in KGC. Through
extensive empirical studies on various KGC models, we find that carefully
designed regularization not only alleviates overfitting and reduces variance
but also enables these models to break through the upper bounds of their
original performance. Furthermore, we introduce a novel sparse-regularization
method that embeds the concept of rank-based selective sparsity into the KGC
regularizer. The core idea is to selectively penalize those components with
significant features in the embedding vector, thus effectively ignoring many
components that contribute little and may only represent noise. Various
comparative experiments on multiple datasets and multiple models show that the
SPR regularization method is better than other regularization methods and can
enable the KGC model to further break through the performance margin.

Abstract: In strategic classification, the standard supervised learning setting is
extended to support the notion of strategic user behavior in the form of costly
feature manipulations made in response to a classifier. While standard learning
supports a broad range of model classes, the study of strategic classification
has, so far, been dedicated mostly to linear classifiers. This work aims to
expand the horizon by exploring how strategic behavior manifests under
non-linear classifiers and what this implies for learning. We take a bottom-up
approach showing how non-linearity affects decision boundary points, classifier
expressivity, and model classes complexity. A key finding is that universal
approximators (e.g., neural nets) are no longer universal once the environment
is strategic. We demonstrate empirically how this can create performance gaps
even on an unrestricted model class.

Motivation: 弱监督学习中标注函数的准确性直接影响标签质量，但修复LFs通常需要大量标注数据。本文旨在通过少量标注示例高效修复LFs。

Method: 将LFs建模为条件规则，选择性修改其输出以满足两个条件：1）每个标注数据点有足够证据支持正确标签；2）修复后的LFs准确性足够高。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能基于极少量标注数据显著提升LFs质量。

Conclusion: 通过条件规则建模和选择性修改，该方法高效修复LFs，适用于弱监督学习场景。

Abstract: Programmatic weak supervision (PWS) significantly reduces human effort for
labeling data by combining the outputs of user-provided labeling functions
(LFs) on unlabeled datapoints. However, the quality of the generated labels
depends directly on the accuracy of the LFs. In this work, we study the problem
of fixing LFs based on a small set of labeled examples. Towards this goal, we
develop novel techniques for repairing a set of LFs by minimally changing their
results on the labeled examples such that the fixed LFs ensure that (i) there
is sufficient evidence for the correct label of each labeled datapoint and (ii)
the accuracy of each repaired LF is sufficiently high. We model LFs as
conditional rules which enables us to refine them, i.e., to selectively change
their output for some inputs. We demonstrate experimentally that our system
improves the quality of LFs based on surprisingly small sets of labeled
datapoints.

Main category: cs.LG

Relevance: 40.0

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种热力学视角解释固定学习率下SGD在神经网络训练中的稳态行为，揭示了SGD隐式最小化自由能函数，平衡训练损失和权重分布熵。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解SGD在固定学习率下的行为，尤其是高学习率为何阻止收敛到损失最小值，以及不同学习率如何导致不同损失水平的稳定。

Method: 通过热力学框架（自由能函数$F=U-TS$）分析SGD行为，并在欠参数化和过参数化模型上进行实证验证。

Result: 欠参数化模型遵循自由能最小化，温度随学习率单调增加；过参数化模型在低学习率时温度降至零，SGD直接最小化损失并收敛到最优解。

Conclusion: SGD行为差异源于随机梯度在最优解附近的信噪比差异，为优化算法设计提供了新视角。

Abstract: We present a thermodynamic interpretation of the stationary behavior of
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) under fixed learning rates (LRs) in neural
network training. We show that SGD implicitly minimizes a free energy function
$F=U-TS$, balancing training loss $U$ and the entropy of the weights
distribution $S$, with temperature $T$ determined by the LR. This perspective
offers a new lens on why high LRs prevent training from converging to the loss
minima and how different LRs lead to stabilization at different loss levels. We
empirically validate the free energy framework on both underparameterized (UP)
and overparameterized (OP) models. UP models consistently follow free energy
minimization, with temperature increasing monotonically with LR, while for OP
models, the temperature effectively drops to zero at low LRs, causing SGD to
minimize the loss directly and converge to an optimum. We attribute this
mismatch to differences in the signal-to-noise ratio of stochastic gradients
near optima, supported by both a toy example and neural network experiments.

Conclusion: 结论强调只有充分表征认知不确定性，才能获得有意义的偶然性估计。

Abstract: In recent years various supervised learning methods that disentangle
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty based on second-order distributions have
been proposed. We argue that these methods fail to capture critical components
of epistemic uncertainty, particularly due to the often-neglected component of
model bias. To show this, we make use of a more fine-grained taxonomy of
epistemic uncertainty sources in machine learning models, and analyse how the
classical bias-variance decomposition of the expected prediction error can be
decomposed into different parts reflecting these uncertainties. By using a
simulation-based evaluation protocol which encompasses epistemic uncertainty
due to both procedural- and data-driven uncertainty components, we illustrate
that current methods rarely capture the full spectrum of epistemic uncertainty.
Through theoretical insights and synthetic experiments, we show that high model
bias can lead to misleadingly low estimates of epistemic uncertainty, and
common second-order uncertainty quantification methods systematically blur
bias-induced errors into aleatoric estimates, thereby underrepresenting
epistemic uncertainty. Our findings underscore that meaningful aleatoric
estimates are feasible only if all relevant sources of epistemic uncertainty
are properly represented.

Abstract: Graph Representation Learning (GRL) is a fundamental task in machine
learning, aiming to encode high-dimensional graph-structured data into
low-dimensional vectors. Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods are widely used
in GRL because they can avoid expensive human annotation. In this work, we
propose a novel Subgraph Gaussian Embedding Contrast (SubGEC) method. Our
approach introduces a subgraph Gaussian embedding module, which adaptively maps
subgraphs to a structured Gaussian space, ensuring the preservation of input
subgraph characteristics while generating subgraphs with a controlled
distribution. We then employ optimal transport distances, more precisely the
Wasserstein and Gromov-Wasserstein distances, to effectively measure the
similarity between subgraphs, enhancing the robustness of the contrastive
learning process. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate
that \method~outperforms or presents competitive performance against
state-of-the-art approaches. Our findings provide insights into the design of
SSL methods for GRL, emphasizing the importance of the distribution of the
generated contrastive pairs.

Result: 在主流预测模型上的实验表明，PIR显著减少了实例级误差，提高了预测可靠性。

Conclusion: PIR是一种有效的后处理方法，能够提升时间序列预测的实例级性能。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a vital role in various real-world applications
and has attracted significant attention in recent decades. While recent methods
have achieved remarkable accuracy by incorporating advanced inductive biases
and training strategies, we observe that instance-level variations remain a
significant challenge. These variations--stemming from distribution shifts,
missing data, and long-tail patterns--often lead to suboptimal forecasts for
specific instances, even when overall performance appears strong. To address
this issue, we propose a model-agnostic framework, PIR, designed to enhance
forecasting performance through Post-forecasting Identification and Revision.
Specifically, PIR first identifies biased forecasting instances by estimating
their accuracy. Based on this, the framework revises the forecasts using
contextual information, including covariates and historical time series, from
both local and global perspectives in a post-processing fashion. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets with mainstream forecasting models
demonstrate that PIR effectively mitigates instance-level errors and
significantly improves forecasting reliability.

Conclusion: DLNs是回归任务中透明且计算高效的可行替代方案。

Abstract: Neural networks (NNs) achieve outstanding performance in many domains;
however, their decision processes are often opaque and their inference can be
computationally expensive in resource-constrained environments. We recently
proposed Differentiable Logic Networks (DLNs) to address these issues for
tabular classification based on relaxing discrete logic into a differentiable
form, thereby enabling gradient-based learning of networks built from binary
logic operations. DLNs offer interpretable reasoning and substantially lower
inference cost.
  We extend the DLN framework to supervised tabular regression. Specifically,
we redesign the final output layer to support continuous targets and unify the
original two-phase training procedure into a single differentiable stage. We
evaluate the resulting model on 15 public regression benchmarks, comparing it
with modern neural networks and classical regression baselines. Regression DLNs
match or exceed baseline accuracy while preserving interpretability and fast
inference. Our results show that DLNs are a viable, cost-effective alternative
for regression tasks, especially where model transparency and computational
efficiency are important.

Abstract: Identifying mistakes (i.e., miscues) made while reading aloud is commonly
approached post-hoc by comparing automatic speech recognition (ASR)
transcriptions to the target reading text. However, post-hoc methods perform
poorly when ASR inaccurately transcribes verbatim speech. To improve on current
methods for reading error annotation, we propose a novel end-to-end
architecture that incorporates the target reading text via prompting and is
trained for both improved verbatim transcription and direct miscue detection.
Our contributions include: first, demonstrating that incorporating reading text
through prompting benefits verbatim transcription performance over fine-tuning,
and second, showing that it is feasible to augment speech recognition tasks for
end-to-end miscue detection. We conducted two case studies -- children's
read-aloud and adult atypical speech -- and found that our proposed strategies
improve verbatim transcription and miscue detection compared to current
state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations play a pivotal role in explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) by offering intuitive, human-understandable alternatives
that elucidate machine learning model decisions. Despite their significance,
existing methods for generating counterfactuals often require constant access
to the predictive model, involve computationally intensive optimization for
each instance and lack the flexibility to adapt to new user-defined constraints
without retraining. In this paper, we propose DiCoFlex, a novel model-agnostic,
conditional generative framework that produces multiple diverse counterfactuals
in a single forward pass. Leveraging conditional normalizing flows trained
solely on labeled data, DiCoFlex addresses key limitations by enabling
real-time user-driven customization of constraints such as sparsity and
actionability at inference time. Extensive experiments on standard benchmark
datasets show that DiCoFlex outperforms existing methods in terms of validity,
diversity, proximity, and constraint adherence, making it a practical and
scalable solution for counterfactual generation in sensitive decision-making

Abstract: This paper considers a contextual bandit problem involving multiple agents,
where a learner sequentially observes the contexts and the agent's reported
arms, and then selects the arm that maximizes the system's overall reward.
Existing work in contextual bandits assumes that agents truthfully report their
arms, which is unrealistic in many real-life applications. For instance,
consider an online platform with multiple sellers; some sellers may
misrepresent product quality to gain an advantage, such as having the platform
preferentially recommend their products to online users. To address this
challenge, we propose an algorithm, COBRA, for contextual bandit problems
involving strategic agents that disincentivize their strategic behavior without
using any monetary incentives, while having incentive compatibility and a
sub-linear regret guarantee. Our experimental results also validate the
different performance aspects of our proposed algorithm.

Conclusion: DiffER为模板自由模型提供了新基准，SMILES序列长度预测对性能提升至关重要。

Abstract: Methods for automatic chemical retrosynthesis have found recent success
through the application of models traditionally built for natural language
processing, primarily through transformer neural networks. These models have
demonstrated significant ability to translate between the SMILES encodings of
chemical products and reactants, but are constrained as a result of their
autoregressive nature. We propose DiffER, an alternative template-free method
for retrosynthesis prediction in the form of categorical diffusion, which
allows the entire output SMILES sequence to be predicted in unison. We
construct an ensemble of diffusion models which achieves state-of-the-art
performance for top-1 accuracy and competitive performance for top-3, top-5,
and top-10 accuracy among template-free methods. We prove that DiffER is a
strong baseline for a new class of template-free model, capable of learning a
variety of synthetic techniques used in laboratory settings and outperforming a
variety of other template-free methods on top-k accuracy metrics. By
constructing an ensemble of categorical diffusion models with a novel length
prediction component with variance, our method is able to approximately sample
from the posterior distribution of reactants, producing results with strong
metrics of confidence and likelihood. Furthermore, our analyses demonstrate
that accurate prediction of the SMILES sequence length is key to further
boosting the performance of categorical diffusion models.

Conclusion: EmotionRankCLAP能更好地建模情感序数性并改善跨模态对齐。

Abstract: Current emotion-based contrastive language-audio pretraining (CLAP) methods
typically learn by na\"ively aligning audio samples with corresponding text
prompts. Consequently, this approach fails to capture the ordinal nature of
emotions, hindering inter-emotion understanding and often resulting in a wide
modality gap between the audio and text embeddings due to insufficient
alignment. To handle these drawbacks, we introduce EmotionRankCLAP, a
supervised contrastive learning approach that uses dimensional attributes of
emotional speech and natural language prompts to jointly capture fine-grained
emotion variations and improve cross-modal alignment. Our approach utilizes a
Rank-N-Contrast objective to learn ordered relationships by contrasting samples
based on their rankings in the valence-arousal space. EmotionRankCLAP
outperforms existing emotion-CLAP methods in modeling emotion ordinality across
modalities, measured via a cross-modal retrieval task.

Abstract: Community partitioning is crucial in network analysis, with modularity
optimization being the prevailing technique. However, traditional
modularity-based methods often overlook fairness, a critical aspect in
real-world applications. To address this, we introduce protected group networks
and propose a novel fairness-modularity metric. This metric extends traditional
modularity by explicitly incorporating fairness, and we prove that minimizing
it yields naturally fair partitions for protected groups while maintaining
theoretical soundness. We develop a general optimization framework for fairness
partitioning and design the efficient Fair Fast Newman (FairFN) algorithm,
enhancing the Fast Newman (FN) method to optimize both modularity and fairness.
Experiments show FairFN achieves significantly improved fairness and
high-quality partitions compared to state-of-the-art methods, especially on
unbalanced datasets.

Abstract: We study the problem of minimizing non-convex functionals on the space of
probability measures, regularized by the relative entropy (KL divergence) with
respect to a fixed reference measure, as well as the corresponding problem of
solving entropy-regularized non-convex-non-concave min-max problems. We utilize
the Best Response flow (also known in the literature as the fictitious play
flow) and study how its convergence is influenced by the relation between the
degree of non-convexity of the functional under consideration, the
regularization parameter and the tail behaviour of the reference measure. In
particular, we demonstrate how to choose the regularizer, given the non-convex
functional, so that the Best Response operator becomes a contraction with
respect to the $L^1$-Wasserstein distance, which then ensures the existence of
its unique fixed point, which is then shown to be the unique global minimizer
for our optimization problem. This extends recent results where the Best
Response flow was applied to solve convex optimization problems regularized by
the relative entropy with respect to arbitrary reference measures, and with
arbitrary values of the regularization parameter. Our results explain precisely
how the assumption of convexity can be relaxed, at the expense of making a
specific choice of the regularizer. Additionally, we demonstrate how these
results can be applied in reinforcement learning in the context of policy
optimization for Markov Decision Processes and Markov games with softmax
parametrized policies in the mean-field regime.

Conclusion: DCC结合统计严谨性和神经网络表达能力，为依赖感知分类提供了数学基础和可解释框架。

Abstract: Traditional classifiers often assume feature independence or rely on overly
simplistic relationships, leading to poor performance in settings where
real-world dependencies matter. We introduce the Deep Copula Classifier (DCC),
a generative model that separates the learning of each feature's marginal
distribution from the modeling of their joint dependence structure via neural
network-parameterized copulas. For each class, lightweight neural networks are
used to flexibly and adaptively capture feature interactions, making DCC
particularly effective when classification is driven by complex dependencies.
We establish that DCC converges to the Bayes-optimal classifier under standard
conditions and provide explicit convergence rates of O(n^{-r/(2r + d)}) for
r-smooth copula densities. Beyond theoretical guarantees, we outline several
practical extensions, including high-dimensional scalability through vine and
factor copula architectures, semi-supervised learning via entropy
regularization, and online adaptation using streaming gradient methods. By
unifying statistical rigor with the representational power of neural networks,
DCC offers a mathematically grounded and interpretable framework for
dependency-aware classification.

optimization. However, their bounds for nonsmooth (strongly) convex functions
are only as fast as Proximal GD. In this work, we provide the first improved
last-iterate analysis for the nonsmooth case demonstrating that the widely used
Random Reshuffle ($\textsf{RR}$) and Single Shuffle ($\textsf{SS}$) strategies
are both provably faster than Proximal GD, reflecting the benefit of
randomness. As an important implication, we give the first (nearly) optimal
convergence result for the suffix average under the $\textsf{RR}$ sampling
scheme in the general convex case, matching the lower bound shown by (Koren et
al., 2022).

Conclusion: OSGM是一种新型一阶优化方法，具有非渐近超线性收敛性，并解释了超梯度下降启发式方法的成功。

Abstract: This paper establishes the theoretical foundations of the online scaled
gradient methods (OSGM), a framework that utilizes online learning to adapt
stepsizes and provably accelerate first-order methods. OSGM quantifies the
effectiveness of a stepsize by a feedback function motivated from a convergence
measure and uses the feedback to adjust the stepsize through an online learning
algorithm. Consequently, instantiations of OSGM achieve convergence rates that
are asymptotically no worse than the optimal stepsize. OSGM yields desirable
convergence guarantees on smooth convex problems, including 1)
trajectory-dependent global convergence on smooth convex objectives; 2) an
improved complexity result on smooth strongly convex problems, and 3) local
superlinear convergence. Notably, OSGM constitutes a new family of first-order
methods with non-asymptotic superlinear convergence, joining the celebrated
quasi-Newton methods. Finally, OSGM explains the empirical success of the
popular hypergradient-descent heuristic in optimization for machine learning.

Abstract: Overlapping Speech Detection (OSD) aims to identify regions where multiple
speakers overlap in a conversation, a critical challenge in multi-party speech
processing. This work proposes a speaker-aware progressive OSD model that
leverages a progressive training strategy to enhance the correlation between

Abstract: Accurately modeling time-continuous stochastic processes from irregular

Gaussians that allow for closed form formulas of the corresponding
Kullback-Leibler divergence in the loss. Unlike most other approaches, we are
able to handle irregularly sampled time series.

Result: 该方法在非独立同分布数据下仍能获得渐近正态估计，且仅以对数因子增加遗憾。

Conclusion: 通过小幅增加遗憾，实现了自适应决策算法的有效统计推断。

Abstract: We consider the problem of statistical inference when the data is collected
via a Thompson Sampling-type algorithm. While Thompson Sampling (TS) is known
to be both asymptotically optimal and empirically effective, its adaptive
sampling scheme poses challenges for constructing confidence intervals for
model parameters. We propose and analyze a variant of TS, called Stable
Thompson Sampling, in which the posterior variance is inflated by a logarithmic
factor. We show that this modification leads to asymptotically normal estimates
of the arm means, despite the non-i.i.d. nature of the data. Importantly, this
statistical benefit comes at a modest cost: the variance inflation increases
regret by only a logarithmic factor compared to standard TS. Our results reveal
a principled trade-off: by paying a small price in regret, one can enable valid
statistical inference for adaptive decision-making algorithms.

Result: 在轻尾目标和轻尾差异情况下，依赖关系不影响Goodhart效应的本质；但在轻尾目标和重尾差异情况下，过度优化的速率与差异的重尾性成反比。

Conclusion: 代理指标与目标之间的耦合关系在某些情况下会显著影响Goodhart效应的表现。

Abstract: Goodhart's law is a famous adage in policy-making that states that ``When a
measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure''. As machine learning
models and the optimisation capacity to train them grow, growing empirical
evidence reinforced the belief in the validity of this law without however
being formalised. Recently, a few attempts were made to formalise Goodhart's
law, either by categorising variants of it, or by looking at how optimising a
proxy metric affects the optimisation of an intended goal. In this work, we
alleviate the simplifying independence assumption, made in previous works, and
the assumption on the learning paradigm made in most of them, to study the
effect of the coupling between the proxy metric and the intended goal on
Goodhart's law. Our results show that in the case of light tailed goal and
light tailed discrepancy, dependence does not change the nature of Goodhart's
effect. However, in the light tailed goal and heavy tailed discrepancy case, we
exhibit an example where over-optimisation occurs at a rate inversely
proportional to the heavy tailedness of the discrepancy between the goal and
the metric. %

Abstract: We study the fundamental problem of estimating an unknown discrete
distribution $p$ over $d$ symbols, given $n$ i.i.d. samples from the
distribution. We are interested in minimizing the KL divergence between the
true distribution and the algorithm's estimate. We first construct minimax
optimal private estimators. Minimax optimality however fails to shed light on
an algorithm's performance on individual (non-worst-case) instances $p$ and
simple minimax-optimal DP estimators can have poor empirical performance on
real distributions. We then study this problem from an instance-optimality
viewpoint, where the algorithm's error on $p$ is compared to the minimum
achievable estimation error over a small local neighborhood of $p$. Under
natural notions of local neighborhood, we propose algorithms that achieve
instance-optimality up to constant factors, with and without a differential
privacy constraint. Our upper bounds rely on (private) variants of the
Good-Turing estimator. Our lower bounds use additive local neighborhoods that
more precisely captures the hardness of distribution estimation in KL
divergence, compared to ones considered in prior works.

function in a sparse set of eigenbasis of the backward Kolmogorov operator
associated with the diffusion process, we reformulate score estimation as the

sample generation. We analyze the approximation error using perturbation theory
and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on high-dimensional Boltzmann
distributions and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Weather forecasting is crucial for managing risks and economic planning,
particularly in tropical Africa, where extreme events severely impact
livelihoods. Yet, existing forecasting methods often struggle with the region's
complex, non-linear weather patterns. This study benchmarks deep recurrent
neural networks such as $\texttt{LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, BiGRU}$, and
Kolmogorov-Arnold-based models $(\texttt{KAN} and \texttt{TKAN})$ for daily
forecasting of temperature, precipitation, and pressure in two tropical cities:
Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast) and Kigali (Rwanda). We further introduce
two customized variants of $ \texttt{TKAN}$ that replace its original
$\texttt{SiLU}$ activation function with $ \texttt{GeLU}$ and \texttt{MiSH},
respectively. Using station-level meteorological data spanning from 2010 to
2024, we evaluate all the models on standard regression metrics. $\texttt{KAN}$
achieves temperature prediction ($R^2=0.9986$ in Abidjan, $0.9998$ in Kigali,
$\texttt{MSE} < 0.0014~^\circ C ^2$), while $\texttt{TKAN}$ variants minimize
absolute errors for precipitation forecasting in low-rainfall regimes. The
customized $\texttt{TKAN}$ models demonstrate improvements over the standard
$\texttt{TKAN}$ across both datasets. Classical \texttt{RNNs} remain highly
competitive for atmospheric pressure ($R^2 \approx 0.83{-}0.86$), outperforming
$\texttt{KAN}$-based models in this task. These results highlight the potential
of spline-based neural architectures for efficient and data-efficient
forecasting.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) techniques for Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problems have
recently garnered significant attention, reflecting a broader trend of
leveraging ML to approximate and/or accelerate the resolution of complex
optimization problems. These developments are necessitated by the increased
volatility and scale in energy production for modern and future grids. However,
progress in ML for OPF is hindered by the lack of standardized datasets and
evaluation metrics, from generating and solving OPF instances, to training and
benchmarking machine learning models. To address this challenge, this paper
introduces PGLearn, a comprehensive suite of standardized datasets and
evaluation tools for ML and OPF. PGLearn provides datasets that are
representative of real-life operating conditions, by explicitly capturing both
global and local variability in the data generation, and by, for the first
time, including time series data for several large-scale systems. In addition,
it supports multiple OPF formulations, including AC, DC, and second-order cone
formulations. Standardized datasets are made publicly available to democratize
access to this field, reduce the burden of data generation, and enable the fair
comparison of various methodologies. PGLearn also includes a robust toolkit for
training, evaluating, and benchmarking machine learning models for OPF, with
the goal of standardizing performance evaluation across the field. By promoting
open, standardized datasets and evaluation metrics, PGLearn aims at
democratizing and accelerating research and innovation in machine learning
applications for optimal power flow problems. Datasets are available for

Abstract: Finding the number of meaningful clusters in an unlabeled dataset is
important in many applications. Regularized k-means algorithm is a possible
approach frequently used to find the correct number of distinct clusters in
datasets. The most common formulation of the regularization function is the
additive linear term $\lambda k$, where $k$ is the number of clusters and
$\lambda$ a positive coefficient. Currently, there are no principled guidelines
for setting a value for the critical hyperparameter $\lambda$. In this paper,
we derive rigorous bounds for $\lambda$ assuming clusters are {\em ideal}.
Ideal clusters (defined as $d$-dimensional spheres with identical radii) are
close proxies for k-means clusters ($d$-dimensional spherically symmetric
distributions with identical standard deviations). Experiments show that the
k-means algorithm with additive regularizer often yields multiple solutions.
Thus, we also analyze k-means algorithm with multiplicative regularizer. The
consensus among k-means solutions with additive and multiplicative
regularizations reduces the ambiguity of multiple solutions in certain cases.
We also present selected experiments that demonstrate performance of the
regularized k-means algorithms as clusters deviate from the ideal assumption.

Abstract: Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting (PTSF) plays a crucial role in
decision-making across various fields, including economics, energy, and
transportation. Most existing methods excell at short-term forecasting, while
overlooking the hurdles of Long-term Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting
(LPTSF). As the forecast horizon extends, the inherent nonlinear dynamics have
a significant adverse effect on prediction accuracy, and make generative models
inefficient by increasing the cost of each iteration. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce $K^2$VAE, an efficient VAE-based generative model
that leverages a KoopmanNet to transform nonlinear time series into a linear
dynamical system, and devises a KalmanNet to refine predictions and model
uncertainty in such linear system, which reduces error accumulation in
long-term forecasting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $K^2$VAE
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both short- and long-term PTSF,

Abstract: Crop disease detection and classification is a critical challenge in
agriculture, with major implications for productivity, food security, and
environmental sustainability. While deep learning models such as CNN and ViT
have shown excellent performance in classifying plant diseases from images,
their large-scale deployment is often limited by data privacy concerns.
Federated Learning (FL) addresses this issue, but centralized FL remains
vulnerable to single-point failures and scalability limits. In this paper, we
introduce a novel Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) framework that uses
validation loss (Loss_val) both to guide model sharing between peers and to
correct local training via an adaptive loss function controlled by weighting

Conclusion: Sentinel有效解决了CCPs中的调度优化问题，显著提升了性能和收益。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of live streaming services, Crowdsourced Cloud-edge
service Platforms (CCPs) are playing an increasingly important role in meeting
the increasing demand. Although stream scheduling plays a critical role in
optimizing CCPs' revenue, most optimization strategies struggle to achieve
practical results due to various anomalies in unstable CCPs. Additionally, the
substantial scale of CCPs magnifies the difficulties of anomaly detection in
time-sensitive scheduling. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes
Sentinel, a proactive anomaly detection-based scheduling framework. Sentinel
models the scheduling process as a two-stage Pre-Post-Scheduling paradigm: in
the pre-scheduling stage, Sentinel conducts anomaly detection and constructs a
strategy pool; in the post-scheduling stage, upon request arrival, it triggers
an appropriate scheduling based on a pre-generated strategy to implement the
scheduling process. Extensive experiments on realistic datasets show that
Sentinel significantly reduces anomaly frequency by 70%, improves revenue by
74%, and doubles the scheduling speed.

Abstract: Modeling propagation is the cornerstone for designing and optimizing
next-generation wireless systems, with a particular emphasis on 5G and beyond
era. Traditional modeling methods have long relied on statistic-based
techniques to characterize propagation behavior across different environments.
With the expansion of wireless communication systems, there is a growing demand
for methods that guarantee the accuracy and interoperability of modeling.
Artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques, in particular, are increasingly
being adopted to overcome this challenge, although the interpretability is not
assured with most of these methods. Inspired by recent advancements in AI, this
paper proposes a novel approach that accelerates the discovery of path loss
models while maintaining interpretability. The proposed method automates the
model formulation, evaluation, and refinement, facilitating model discovery. We
evaluate two techniques: one based on Deep Symbolic Regression, offering full
interpretability, and the second based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, providing
two levels of interpretability. Both approaches are evaluated on two synthetic
and two real-world datasets. Our results show that Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
achieve R^2 values close to 1 with minimal prediction error, while Deep
Symbolic Regression generates compact models with moderate accuracy. Moreover,
on the selected examples, we demonstrate that automated methods outperform
traditional methods, achieving up to 75% reduction in prediction errors,
offering accurate and explainable solutions with potential to increase the
efficiency of discovering next-generation path loss models.

Abstract: In China's competitive fresh e-commerce market, optimizing operational
strategies, especially inventory management in front-end warehouses, is key to
enhance customer satisfaction and to gain a competitive edge. Front-end
warehouses are placed in residential areas to ensure the timely delivery of
fresh goods and are usually in small size. This brings the challenge of
deciding which goods to stock and in what quantities, taking into account
capacity constraints. To address this issue, traditional predict-then-optimize
(PTO) methods that predict sales and then decide on inventory often don't align
prediction with inventory goals, as well as fail to prioritize consumer
satisfaction. This paper proposes a multi-task
Optimize-then-Predict-then-Optimize (OTPTO) approach that jointly optimizes
product selection and inventory management, aiming to increase consumer
satisfaction by maximizing the full order fulfillment rate. Our method employs
a 0-1 mixed integer programming model OM1 to determine historically optimal
inventory levels, and then uses a product selection model PM1 and the stocking
model PM2 for prediction. The combined results are further refined through a
post-processing algorithm OM2. Experimental results from JD.com's 7Fresh
platform demonstrate the robustness and significant advantages of our OTPTO
method. Compared to the PTO approach, our OTPTO method substantially enhances
the full order fulfillment rate by 4.34% (a relative increase of 7.05%) and
narrows the gap to the optimal full order fulfillment rate by 5.27%. These
findings substantiate the efficacy of the OTPTO method in managing inventory at
front-end warehouses of fresh e-commerce platforms and provide valuable
insights for future research in this domain.

Abstract: Depression is a debilitating mood disorder negatively impacting millions
worldwide. While researchers have explored multiple verbal and non-verbal
behavioural cues for automated depression assessment, head motion has received
little attention thus far. Further, the common practice of validating machine
learning models via a single dataset can limit model generalisability. This
work examines the effectiveness and generalisability of models utilising
elementary head motion units, termed kinemes, for depression severity
estimation. Specifically, we consider three depression datasets from different
western cultures (German: AVEC2013, Australian: Blackdog and American: Pitt
datasets) with varied contextual and recording settings to investigate the
generalisability of the derived kineme patterns via two methods: (i) k-fold
cross-validation over individual/multiple datasets, and (ii) model reuse on
other datasets. Evaluating classification and regression performance with
classical machine learning methods, our results show that: (1) head motion
patterns are efficient biomarkers for estimating depression severity, achieving
highly competitive performance for both classification and regression tasks on
a variety of datasets, including achieving the second best Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) on the AVEC2013 dataset, and (2) kineme-based features are more
generalisable than (a) raw head motion descriptors for binary severity
classification, and (b) other visual behavioural cues for severity estimation
(regression).

Abstract: This paper explores second-order optimization methods in Federated Learning
(FL), addressing the critical challenges of slow convergence and the excessive
communication rounds required to achieve optimal performance from the global
model. While existing surveys in FL primarily focus on challenges related to
statistical and device label heterogeneity, as well as privacy and security
concerns in first-order FL methods, less attention has been given to the issue
of slow model training. This slow training often leads to the need for
excessive communication rounds or increased communication costs, particularly
when data across clients are highly heterogeneous. In this paper, we examine
various FL methods that leverage second-order optimization to accelerate the
training process. We provide a comprehensive categorization of state-of-the-art
second-order FL methods and compare their performance based on convergence
speed, computational cost, memory usage, transmission overhead, and
generalization of the global model. Our findings show the potential of
incorporating Hessian curvature through second-order optimization into FL and
highlight key challenges, such as the efficient utilization of Hessian and its
inverse in FL. This work lays the groundwork for future research aimed at
developing scalable and efficient federated optimization methods for improving
the training of the global model in FL.

Abstract: The transition from traditional power grids to smart grids, significant
increase in the use of renewable energy sources, and soaring electricity prices
has triggered a digital transformation of the energy infrastructure that
enables new, data driven, applications often supported by machine learning
models. However, the majority of the developed machine learning models rely on
univariate data. To date, a structured study considering the role meta-data and
additional measurements resulting in multivariate data is missing. In this
paper we propose a taxonomy that identifies and structures various types of
data related to energy applications. The taxonomy can be used to guide
application specific data model development for training machine learning
models. Focusing on a household electricity forecasting application, we
validate the effectiveness of the proposed taxonomy in guiding the selection of
the features for various types of models. As such, we study of the effect of
domain, contextual and behavioral features on the forecasting accuracy of four
interpretable machine learning techniques and three openly available datasets.
Finally, using a feature importance techniques, we explain individual feature
contributions to the forecasting accuracy.

Abstract: This paper proposes a family of permutation-invariant graph embeddings,

in group theory and harmonic analysis, our method introduces a new class of
graph invariants that are isomorphism-invariant and capable of embedding richer
graph structures - including attributed graphs, multilayer graphs, and
hypergraphs - which the Skew Spectrum could not handle. Our generalization
further defines a family of functions that enables a trade-off between
computational complexity and expressivity. By applying
generalization-preserving heuristics to this family, we improve the Skew
Spectrum's expressivity at the same computational cost. We formally prove the
invariance of our generalization, demonstrate its improved expressiveness
through experiments, and discuss its efficient computation.

Abstract: The cost and accuracy of simulating complex physical systems using the Finite
Element Method (FEM) scales with the resolution of the underlying mesh.
Adaptive meshes improve computational efficiency by refining resolution in
critical regions, but typically require task-specific heuristics or cumbersome
manual design by a human expert. We propose Adaptive Meshing By Expert
Reconstruction (AMBER), a supervised learning approach to mesh adaptation.
Starting from a coarse mesh, AMBER iteratively predicts the sizing field, i.e.,
a function mapping from the geometry to the local element size of the target
mesh, and uses this prediction to produce a new intermediate mesh using an
out-of-the-box mesh generator. This process is enabled through a hierarchical
graph neural network, and relies on data augmentation by automatically
projecting expert labels onto AMBER-generated data during training. We evaluate
AMBER on 2D and 3D datasets, including classical physics problems, mechanical
components, and real-world industrial designs with human expert meshes. AMBER
generalizes to unseen geometries and consistently outperforms multiple recent
baselines, including ones using Graph and Convolutional Neural Networks, and
Reinforcement Learning-based approaches.

Conclusion: (U)NFV通过结合神经网络和FV方法的优势，为双曲守恒律问题提供了一种高精度、灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce (U)NFV, a modular neural network architecture that generalizes
classical finite volume (FV) methods for solving hyperbolic conservation laws.
Hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) are challenging to solve,
particularly conservation laws whose physically relevant solutions contain
shocks and discontinuities. FV methods are widely used for their mathematical
properties: convergence to entropy solutions, flow conservation, or total
variation diminishing, but often lack accuracy and flexibility in complex
settings. Neural Finite Volume addresses these limitations by learning update
rules over extended spatial and temporal stencils while preserving conservation
structure. It supports both supervised training on solution data (NFV) and
unsupervised training via weak-form residual loss (UNFV). Applied to
first-order conservation laws, (U)NFV achieves up to 10x lower error than
Godunov's method, outperforms ENO/WENO, and rivals discontinuous Galerkin
solvers with far less complexity. On traffic modeling problems, both from PDEs
and from experimental highway data, (U)NFV captures nonlinear wave dynamics
with significantly higher fidelity and scalability than traditional FV
approaches.

Abstract: In high-frequency trading (HFT), leveraging limit order books (LOB) to model
stock price movements is crucial for achieving profitable outcomes. However,
this task is challenging due to the high-dimensional and volatile nature of the
original data. Even recent deep learning models often struggle to capture price
movement patterns effectively, particularly without well-designed features. We
observed that raw LOB data exhibits inherent symmetry between the ask and bid
sides, and the bid-ask differences demonstrate greater stability and lower
complexity compared to the original data. Building on this insight, we propose
a novel approach in which leverages the Siamese architecture to enhance the
performance of existing deep learning models. The core idea involves processing
the ask and bid sides separately using the same module with shared parameters.
We applied our Siamese-based methods to several widely used strong baselines
and validated their effectiveness using data from 14 military industry stocks
in the Chinese A-share market. Furthermore, we integrated multi-head attention
(MHA) mechanisms with the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) module to investigate
its role in modeling stock price movements. Our experiments used raw data and
widely used Order Flow Imbalance (OFI) features as input with some strong
baseline models. The results show that our method improves the performance of
strong baselines in over 75$% of cases, excluding the Multi-Layer Perception
(MLP) baseline, which performed poorly and is not considered practical.
Furthermore, we found that Multi-Head Attention can enhance model performance,
particularly over shorter forecasting horizons.

Abstract: In a variety of physically relevant settings for learning from quantum data,
designing protocols that can computationally efficiently extract information
remains largely an art, and there are important cases where we believe this to
be impossible, that is, where there is an information-computation gap. While
there is a large array of tools in the classical literature for giving evidence
for average-case hardness of statistical inference problems, the corresponding
tools in the quantum literature are far more limited. One such framework in the
classical literature, the low-degree method, makes predictions about hardness
of inference problems based on the failure of estimators given by low-degree
polynomials. In this work, we extend this framework to the quantum setting.
  We establish a general connection between state designs and low-degree
hardness. We use this to obtain the first information-computation gaps for
learning Gibbs states of random, sparse, non-local Hamiltonians. We also use it
to prove hardness for learning random shallow quantum circuit states in a
challenging model where states can be measured in adaptively chosen bases. To
our knowledge, the ability to model adaptivity within the low-degree framework
was open even in classical settings. In addition, we also obtain a low-degree
hardness result for quantum error mitigation against strategies with
single-qubit measurements.
  We define a new quantum generalization of the planted biclique problem and
identify the threshold at which this problem becomes computationally hard for
protocols that perform local measurements. Interestingly, the complexity
landscape for this problem shifts when going from local measurements to more
entangled single-copy measurements.
  We show average-case hardness for the "standard" variant of Learning
Stabilizers with Noise and for agnostically learning product states.

long animated statistics and learning theory. This paper characterizes when a
(univariate) convex M-estimation or stochastic optimization problem is solvable
in such an assumption-free setting, providing a precise dividing line between
solvable and unsolvable problems. The conditions we identify show, perhaps
surprisingly, that Lipschitz continuity of the loss being minimized is not
necessary for distribution free minimization, and they are also distinct from
classical characterizations of learnability in machine learning.

Abstract: Coordinating the motion between lower and upper limbs and aligning limb
control with perception are substantial challenges in robotics, particularly in
dynamic environments. To this end, we introduce an approach for enabling legged
mobile manipulators to play badminton, a task that requires precise
coordination of perception, locomotion, and arm swinging. We propose a unified
reinforcement learning-based control policy for whole-body visuomotor skills
involving all degrees of freedom to achieve effective shuttlecock tracking and
striking. This policy is informed by a perception noise model that utilizes
real-world camera data, allowing for consistent perception error levels between
simulation and deployment and encouraging learned active perception behaviors.
Our method includes a shuttlecock prediction model, constrained reinforcement
learning for robust motion control, and integrated system identification
techniques to enhance deployment readiness. Extensive experimental results in a
variety of environments validate the robot's capability to predict shuttlecock
trajectories, navigate the service area effectively, and execute precise
strikes against human players, demonstrating the feasibility of using legged
mobile manipulators in complex and dynamic sports scenarios.

Abstract: We initiate the study of a repeated principal-agent problem over a finite
horizon $T$, where a principal sequentially interacts with $K\geq 2$ types of
agents arriving in an adversarial order. At each round, the principal
strategically chooses one of the $N$ arms to incentivize for an arriving agent
of unknown type. The agent then chooses an arm based on its own utility and the
provided incentive, and the principal receives a corresponding reward. The
objective is to minimize regret against the best incentive in hindsight.
Without prior knowledge of agent behavior, we show that the problem becomes
intractable, leading to linear regret. We analyze two key settings where
sublinear regret is achievable. In the first setting, the principal knows the
arm each agent type would select greedily for any given incentive. Under this
setting, we propose an algorithm that achieves a regret bound of
$O(\min\{\sqrt{KT\log N},K\sqrt{T}\})$ and provide a matching lower bound up to
a $\log K$ factor. In the second setting, an agent's response varies smoothly
with the incentive and is governed by a Lipschitz constant $L\geq 1$. Under
this setting, we show that there is an algorithm with a regret bound of
$\tilde{O}((LN)^{1/3}T^{2/3})$ and establish a matching lower bound up to
logarithmic factors. Finally, we extend our algorithmic results for both
settings by allowing the principal to incentivize multiple arms simultaneously
in each round.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel adaptive framework for processing dynamic flow
signals over simplicial complexes, extending classical least-mean-squares (LMS)
methods to high-order topological domains. Building on discrete Hodge theory,
we present a topological LMS algorithm that efficiently processes streaming
signals observed over time-varying edge subsets. We provide a detailed
stochastic analysis of the algorithm, deriving its stability conditions,
steady-state mean-square-error, and convergence speed, while exploring the
impact of edge sampling on performance. We also propose strategies to design
optimal edge sampling probabilities, minimizing rate while ensuring desired
estimation accuracy. Assuming partial knowledge of the complex structure (e.g.,
the underlying graph), we introduce an adaptive topology inference method that
integrates with the proposed LMS framework. Additionally, we propose a
distributed version of the algorithm and analyze its stability and
mean-square-error properties. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world
traffic data demonstrate that our approach, in both centralized and distributed
settings, outperforms graph-based LMS methods by leveraging higher-order
topological features.

Result: 证明了在某些图结构下，即使测量非常稀疏（如每个顶点仅测量一个坐标），估计器仍具有弱一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法在图信号恢复中具有潜力，尤其是在稀疏测量场景下。

Abstract: Given an undirected and connected graph $G$ on $T$ vertices, suppose each
vertex $t$ has a latent signal $x_t \in \mathbb{R}^n$ associated to it. Given
partial linear measurements of the signals, for a potentially small subset of
the vertices, our goal is to estimate $x_t$'s. Assuming that the signals are
smooth w.r.t $G$, in the sense that the quadratic variation of the signals over
the graph is small, we obtain non-asymptotic bounds on the mean squared error
for jointly recovering $x_t$'s, for the smoothness penalized least squares
estimator. In particular, this implies for certain choices of $G$ that this
estimator is weakly consistent (as $T \rightarrow \infty$) under potentially
very stringent sampling, where only one coordinate is measured per vertex for a
vanishingly small fraction of the vertices. The results are extended to a
``multi-layer'' ranking problem where $x_t$ corresponds to the latent strengths
of a collection of $n$ items, and noisy pairwise difference measurements are
obtained at each ``layer'' $t$ via a measurement graph $G_t$. Weak consistency
is established for certain choices of $G$ even when the individual $G_t$'s are
very sparse and disconnected.

Abstract: We present MGE-LDM, a unified latent diffusion framework for simultaneous
music generation, source imputation, and query-driven source separation. Unlike
prior approaches constrained to fixed instrument classes, MGE-LDM learns a
joint distribution over full mixtures, submixtures, and individual stems within
a single compact latent diffusion model. At inference, MGE-LDM enables (1)
complete mixture generation, (2) partial generation (i.e., source imputation),
and (3) text-conditioned extraction of arbitrary sources. By formulating both
separation and imputation as conditional inpainting tasks in the latent space,
our approach supports flexible, class-agnostic manipulation of arbitrary
instrument sources. Notably, MGE-LDM can be trained jointly across
heterogeneous multi-track datasets (e.g., Slakh2100, MUSDB18, MoisesDB) without

Abstract: In this work, we propose a full-band real-time speech enhancement system with
GAN-based stochastic regeneration. Predictive models focus on estimating the

over-suppression, i.e. the removal of speech content. In the literature, it was
shown that combining a predictive model with a generative one within the
stochastic regeneration framework can reduce the distortion in the output. We
use this framework to obtain a real-time speech enhancement system. With 3.58M
parameters and a low latency, our system is designed for real-time streaming

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic response relied heavily on statistical and machine
learning models to predict key outcomes such as case prevalence and fatality
rates. These predictions were instrumental in enabling timely public health
interventions that helped break transmission cycles. While most existing models
are grounded in traditional epidemiological data, the potential of alternative
datasets, such as those derived from genomic information and human behavior,
remains underexplored. In the current study, we investigated the usefulness of
diverse modalities of feature sets in predicting case surges. Our results
highlight the relative effectiveness of biological (e.g., mutations), public
health (e.g., case counts, policy interventions) and human behavioral features
(e.g., mobility and social media conversations) in predicting country-level
case surges. Importantly, we uncover considerable heterogeneity in predictive
performance across countries and feature modalities, suggesting that surge
prediction models may need to be tailored to specific national contexts and
pandemic phases. Overall, our work highlights the value of integrating
alternative data sources into existing disease surveillance frameworks to
enhance the prediction of pandemic dynamics.

Abstract: Nonadiabatic couplings (NACs) play a crucial role in modeling photochemical
and photophysical processes with methods such as the widely used
fewest-switches surface hopping (FSSH). There is therefore a strong incentive
to machine learn NACs for accelerating simulations. However, this is
challenging due to NACs' vectorial, double-valued character and the singularity
near a conical intersection seam. For the first time, we design NAC-specific
descriptors based on our domain expertise and show that they allow learning
NACs with never-before-reported accuracy of $R^2$ exceeding 0.99. The key to
success is also our new ML phase-correction procedure. We demonstrate the
efficiency and robustness of our approach on a prototypical example of fully
ML-driven FSSH simulations of fulvene targeting the SA-2-CASSCF(6,6) electronic
structure level. This ML-FSSH dynamics leads to an accurate description of
$S_1$ decay while reducing error bars by allowing the execution of a large

Abstract: Quantum sensing exploits non-classical effects to overcome limitations of
classical sensors, with applications ranging from gravitational-wave detection
to nanoscale imaging. However, practical quantum sensors built on noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices face significant noise and sampling
constraints, and current variational quantum sensing (VQS) methods lack
rigorous performance guarantees. This paper proposes an online control
framework for VQS that dynamically updates the variational parameters while
providing deterministic error bars on the estimates. By leveraging online
conformal inference techniques, the approach produces sequential estimation
sets with a guaranteed long-term risk level. Experiments on a quantum
magnetometry task confirm that the proposed dynamic VQS approach maintains the
required reliability over time, while still yielding precise estimates. The
results demonstrate the practical benefits of combining variational quantum

measures for polygonal curves. We show interesting properties of $k$-DTW and
give an exact algorithm as well as a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm
for $k$-DTW by a parametric search for the $k$-th largest matched distance. We
prove the first dimension-free learning bounds for curves and further learning
theoretic results. $k$-DTW not only admits smaller sample size than DTW for the
problem of learning the median of curves, where some factors depending on the
curves' complexity $m$ are replaced by $k$, but we also show a surprising
separation on the associated Rademacher and Gaussian complexities: $k$-DTW
admits strictly smaller bounds than DTW, by a factor $\tilde\Omega(\sqrt{m})$
when $k\ll m$. We complement our theoretical findings with an experimental
illustration of the benefits of using $k$-DTW for clustering and nearest

Abstract: We propose a data-driven, user-centric vehicle-to-grid (V2G) methodology

revenue according to EV user preference. Given the lack of accurate and
generalizable battery degradation models, we leverage input convex neural
networks (ICNNs) to develop a data-driven degradation model trained on
extensive experimental datasets. This approach enables our model to capture
nonconvex dependencies on battery temperature and time while maintaining
convexity with respect to the charging rate. Such a partial convexity property
ensures that the second stage of our methodology remains computationally
efficient. In the second stage, we integrate our data-driven degradation model
into a multi-objective optimization framework to generate an optimal smart
charging profile for each EV. This profile effectively balances the trade-off
between financial benefits from V2G participation and battery degradation,
controlled by a hyperparameter reflecting the user prioritization of battery
health. Numerical simulations show the high accuracy of the ICNN model in
predicting battery degradation for unseen data. Finally, we present a trade-off
curve illustrating financial benefits from V2G versus losses from battery
health degradation based on user preferences and showcase smart charging

Abstract: We present the Star-Based Automated Single-locus and Epistasis analysis tool
- Genetic Programming (StarBASE-GP), an automated framework for discovering
meaningful genetic variants associated with phenotypic variation in large-scale
genomic datasets. StarBASE-GP uses a genetic programming-based multi-objective
optimization strategy to evolve machine learning pipelines that simultaneously
maximize explanatory power (r2) and minimize pipeline complexity. Biological
domain knowledge is integrated at multiple stages, including the use of nine
inheritance encoding strategies to model deviations from additivity, a custom
linkage disequilibrium pruning node that minimizes redundancy among features,
and a dynamic variant recommendation system that prioritizes informative
candidates for pipeline inclusion. We evaluate StarBASE-GP on a cohort of
Rattus norvegicus (brown rat) to identify variants associated with body mass
index, benchmarking its performance against a random baseline and a
biologically naive version of the tool. StarBASE-GP consistently evolves Pareto
fronts with superior performance, yielding higher accuracy in identifying both
ground truth and novel quantitative trait loci, highlighting relevant targets
for future validation. By incorporating evolutionary search and relevant
biological theory into a flexible automated machine learning framework,
StarBASE-GP demonstrates robust potential for advancing variant discovery in
complex traits.

Abstract: We investigate the end-to-end altitude estimation performance of a
convolutional autoencoder-based interference mitigation approach for
frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar altimeters. Specifically, we
show that a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) autoencoder effectively
exploits temporal correlations in the received signal, providing superior
interference suppression compared to a Least Mean Squares (LMS) adaptive
filter. Unlike existing approaches, the present method operates directly on the
received FMCW signal. Additionally, we identify key challenges in applying deep
learning to wideband FMCW interference mitigation and outline directions for
future research to enhance real-time feasibility and generalization to
arbitrary interference conditions.

Abstract: Multilook coherent imaging is a widely used technique in applications such as
digital holography, ultrasound imaging, and synthetic aperture radar. A central
challenge in these systems is the presence of multiplicative noise, commonly
known as speckle, which degrades image quality. Despite the widespread use of
coherent imaging systems, their theoretical foundations remain relatively
underexplored. In this paper, we study both the theoretical and algorithmic
aspects of likelihood-based approaches for multilook coherent imaging,
providing a rigorous framework for analysis and method development. Our
theoretical contributions include establishing the first theoretical upper
bound on the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the maximum likelihood estimator under
the deep image prior hypothesis. Our results capture the dependence of MSE on
the number of parameters in the deep image prior, the number of looks, the
signal dimension, and the number of measurements per look. On the algorithmic
side, we employ projected gradient descent (PGD) as an efficient method for
computing the maximum likelihood solution. Furthermore, we introduce two key
ideas to enhance the practical performance of PGD. First, we incorporate the
Newton-Schulz algorithm to compute matrix inverses within the PGD iterations,
significantly reducing computational complexity. Second, we develop a bagging
strategy to mitigate projection errors introduced during PGD updates. We
demonstrate that combining these techniques with PGD yields state-of-the-art
performance. Our code is available at

Abstract: Collaborative training methods like Federated Learning (FL) and Split
Learning (SL) enable distributed machine learning without sharing raw data.
However, FL assumes clients can train entire models, which is infeasible for
large-scale models. In contrast, while SL alleviates the client memory
constraint in FL by offloading most training to the server, it increases
network latency due to its sequential nature. Other methods address the
conundrum by using local loss functions for parallel client-side training to
improve efficiency, but they lack server feedback and potentially suffer poor
accuracy. We propose FSL-SAGE (Federated Split Learning via Smashed Activation
Gradient Estimation), a new federated split learning algorithm that estimates
server-side gradient feedback via auxiliary models. These auxiliary models
periodically adapt to emulate server behavior on local datasets. We show that
FSL-SAGE achieves a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ is
the number of communication rounds. This result matches FedAvg, while
significantly reducing communication costs and client memory requirements. Our
empirical results also verify that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art FSL
methods, offering both communication efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) with preference-based feedback has recently
garnered significant attention due to its emerging applications. We refer to
this problem as Bayesian Optimization from Human Feedback (BOHF), which differs
from conventional BO by learning the best actions from a reduced feedback
model, where only the preference between two actions is revealed to the learner
at each time step. The objective is to identify the best action using a limited
number of preference queries, typically obtained through costly human feedback.
Existing work, which adopts the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) feedback model,
provides regret bounds for the performance of several algorithms. In this work,
within the same framework we develop tighter performance guarantees.
Specifically, we derive regret bounds of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{\Gamma(T)T})$, where $\Gamma(T)$ represents the
maximum information gain$\unicode{x2014}$a kernel-specific complexity
term$\unicode{x2014}$and $T$ is the number of queries. Our results
significantly improve upon existing bounds. Notably, for common kernels, we
show that the order-optimal sample complexities of conventional
BO$\unicode{x2014}$achieved with richer feedback models$\unicode{x2014}$are
recovered. In other words, the same number of preferential samples as
scalar-valued samples is sufficient to find a nearly optimal solution.

Abstract: Recent advances in language modeling have underscored the role of preference
feedback in enhancing model performance. This paper investigates the conditions
under which preference feedback improves parameter estimation in classes of
continuous parametric distributions. In our framework, the learner observes
pairs of samples from an unknown distribution along with their relative
preferences depending on the same unknown parameter. We show that
preference-based M-estimators achieve a better asymptotic variance than
sample-only M-estimators, further improved by deterministic preferences.
Leveraging the hard constraints revealed by deterministic preferences, we
propose an estimator achieving an estimation error scaling of
$\mathcal{O}(1/n)$ -- a significant improvement over the $\Theta(1/\sqrt{n})$
rate attainable with samples alone. Next, we establish a lower bound that
matches this accelerated rate; up to dimension and problem-dependent constants.
While the assumptions underpinning our analysis are restrictive, they are
satisfied by notable cases such as Gaussian or Laplace distributions for
preferences based on the log-probability reward.
