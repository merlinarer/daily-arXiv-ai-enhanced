TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Critique Fine-Tuning (CFT)的方法，通过单问题微调释放LLMs的推理潜力，显著优于传统RL方法且计算成本更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管强化学习（RL）能显著提升LLMs的推理能力，但其计算成本高且不稳定。因此，研究旨在寻找更高效的方法释放LLMs的推理潜力。

Method: 通过收集单问题的多样化模型生成解，并利用教师LLMs提供详细批评，构建CFT数据，对Qwen和Llama系列模型进行微调。

Result: 仅用5 GPU小时训练，Qwen-Math-7B-CFT在数学和逻辑推理任务上平均提升15%和16%，效果媲美或超越RL且计算成本低20倍。

Conclusion: 单次CFT是一种简单、通用且计算高效的方法，可有效释放现代LLMs的推理能力。

Abstract: We have witnessed that strong LLMs like Qwen-Math, MiMo, and Phi-4 possess
immense reasoning potential inherited from the pre-training stage. With
reinforcement learning (RL), these models can improve dramatically on reasoning
tasks. Recent studies have shown that even RL on a single problem can unleash
these models' reasoning capabilities. However, RL is not only expensive but
also unstable. Even one-shot RL requires hundreds of GPU hours. This raises a
critical question: Is there a more efficient way to unleash the reasoning
potential of these powerful base LLMs? In this work, we demonstrate that
Critique Fine-Tuning (CFT) on only one problem can effectively unleash the
reasoning potential of LLMs. Our method constructs critique data by collecting
diverse model-generated solutions to a single problem and using teacher LLMs to
provide detailed critiques. We fine-tune Qwen and Llama family models, ranging
from 1.5B to 14B parameters, on the CFT data and observe significant
performance gains across diverse reasoning tasks. For example, with just 5 GPU
hours of training, Qwen-Math-7B-CFT show an average improvement of 15% on six
math benchmarks and 16% on three logic reasoning benchmarks. These results are
comparable to or even surpass the results from RL with 20x less compute.
Ablation studies reveal the robustness of one-shot CFT across different prompt
problems. These results highlight one-shot CFT as a simple, general, and
compute-efficient approach to unleashing the reasoning capabilities of modern
LLMs.

TL;DR: SPRINT是一种针对大语言模型（LLMs）的子层剪枝方法，通过考虑延迟减少和子层可调性，实现高效剪枝而不牺牲准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs推理速度慢，现有剪枝方法因忽略子层特性而准确性受限。

Method: SPRINT结合延迟减少和子层可调性信息，迭代剪枝冗余子层并快速调整剩余子层参数。

Result: SPRINT在零样本常识推理基准上比现有剪枝算法准确率提升23.88%。

Conclusion: SPRINT在准确性和加速之间实现了最佳权衡。

Abstract: How can we accelerate large language models(LLMs) without sacrificing
accuracy? The slow inference speed of LLMs hinders us to benefit from their
remarkable performance in diverse applications. This is mainly because numerous
sublayers are stacked together in LLMs. Sublayer pruning compresses and
expedites LLMs via removing unnecessary sublayers. However, existing sublayer
pruning algorithms are limited in accuracy since they naively select sublayers
to prune, overlooking the different characteristics of each sublayer. In this
paper, we propose SPRINT (Sublayer PRuning wIth LateNcy and Tunability
Information), an accurate sublayer pruning method for LLMs. SPRINT accurately
selects a target sublayer to prune by considering 1) the amount of latency
reduction after pruning and 2) the tunability of sublayers. SPRINT iteratively
prunes redundant sublayers and swiftly tunes the parameters of remaining
sublayers. Experiments show that SPRINT achieves the best accuracy-speedup
trade-off, exhibiting up to 23.88%p higher accuracy on zero-shot commonsense
reasoning benchmarks compared to existing pruning algorithms.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to set new standards in
knowledge-intensive and complex reasoning tasks, yet their high computational
demands limit widespread adoption. While distilling large models into smaller
ones offers a sustainable solution, current techniques--such as static
knowledge distillation, resource-intensive reinforcement learning from human
feedback, or limited self-reflection--struggle to yield substantial and lasting
performance gains. In this paper, we present a novel Debate and Reflect (D&R)
framework that orchestrates multi-turn debates between smaller models and
stronger teacher models, eliciting actionable feedback (e.g., error analysis,
corrective strategies) to guide student models. Further, we introduce
Tree-structured Direct Preference Optimization (T-DPO) to efficiently leverage
these debate logs, organizing interactions into a hierarchical format for
effective training. Empirical evaluations across diverse NLP benchmarks
demonstrate that our approach significantly improves smaller-model accuracy,
robustness, and generalization, outperforming conventional baselines by a large
margin.

TL;DR: BPO是一种新方法，解决了DPO在LLM对齐中的绝对奖励忽略问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO忽略了绝对奖励值，导致选择响应质量下降和分布外响应风险增加。

Method: BPO通过平衡奖励边际和间隙适配器动态优化选择与拒绝响应。

Result: BPO在数学推理任务中显著优于DPO及其变体，准确率提升达11.7%。

Conclusion: BPO简单易实现，兼容现有框架，有效解决了DPO的DCR问题。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have emerged as a popular method for
aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences. While DPO
effectively preserves the relative ordering between chosen and rejected
responses through pairwise ranking losses, it often neglects absolute reward
magnitudes. This oversight can decrease the likelihood of chosen responses and
increase the risk of generating out-of-distribution responses, leading to poor
performance. We term this issue Degraded Chosen Responses (DCR).To address this
issue, we propose Balanced Preference Optimization (BPO), a novel framework
that dynamically balances the optimization of chosen and rejected responses
through two key components: balanced reward margin and gap adaptor. Unlike
previous methods, BPO can fundamentally resolve DPO's DCR issue, without
introducing additional constraints to the loss function. Experimental results
on multiple mathematical reasoning tasks show that BPO significantly
outperforms DPO, improving accuracy by +10.1% with Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (18.8%
to 28.9%) and +11.7% with Qwen2.5-Math-7B (35.0% to 46.7%). It also surpasses
DPO variants by +3.6% over IPO (43.1%), +5.0% over SLiC (41.7%), and +3.1% over
Cal-DPO (43.6%) on the same model. Remarkably, our algorithm requires only a
single line of code modification, making it simple to implement and fully
compatible with existing DPO-based frameworks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通用、遵循原则的奖励模型（RewardAnything），通过动态自然语言规范指导LLM优化，解决了传统奖励模型无法适应多样化需求的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统奖励模型依赖固定偏好数据集，无法灵活适应多样化任务需求，且数据收集和重训练成本高。

Method: 提出RewardAnything模型，通过自然语言原则动态指导奖励生成，并开发RABench基准评估其泛化能力。

Result: RewardAnything在传统基准和RABench上均表现优异，无需重训练即可适应新原则。

Conclusion: RewardAnything为LLM对齐提供了一种高效、灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Reward Models, essential for guiding Large Language Model optimization, are
typically trained on fixed preference datasets, resulting in rigid alignment to
single, implicit preference distributions. This prevents adaptation to diverse
real-world needs-from conciseness in one task to detailed explanations in
another. The standard practice of collecting task-specific preference data and
retraining reward models is resource-intensive, often producing biased rewards,
and limits practical application. We introduce generalizable,
principle-following reward models. We propose that RMs should understand and
adhere to dynamically provided natural language specifications of reward
principles, similar to instruction-following in LLMs. To measure this
capability, we develop RABench, a comprehensive benchmark for RMs focusing on
generalization across diverse principles. Evaluations on RABench reveal poor
generalization of current RMs. As a solution, we present RewardAnything, a
novel RM designed and trained to explicitly follow natural language principles.
We achieve SotA performance with RewardAnything in traditional RM benchmark
simply by specifying a well-defined principle, and results on RABench show we
excel in adapting to novel principles without retraining. Furthermore,
RewardAnything integrates seamlessly with existing RLHF methods and we show by
a case study on how to automatically and efficiently align LLMs with only
natural language principles.

Motivation: LLM对齐对安全性和可靠性至关重要，但现有方法（如DPO）对数据质量敏感且易受噪声干扰。

Conclusion: γ-PO是一种即插即用的高效方法，显著提升了LLM对齐的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for ensuring their
safety and reliability in practical applications. Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) has emerged as an efficient method that directly optimizes
models using preference pairs, significantly reducing resource demands.
However, the effectiveness of DPO heavily depends on the data quality, which is
frequently compromised by noise. In this work, we propose $\gamma$-PO, a
dynamic target margin preference optimization algorithm that adjust reward
margins at the pairwise level. By introducing instance-specific margin
calibration, $\gamma$-PO strategically prioritizes high-confidence pairs (those
demonstrating higher reward margins) while suppressing potential noise from
ambiguous pairs. Moreover, $\gamma$-PO is a plug-and-play method, compatible
with variants of DPO that rely on reward margin between preference pairs.
Across benchmarks such as AlpacaEval2 and Arena-Hard, $\gamma$-PO achieves an
average 4.4\% improvement over other baselines, setting new benchmarks for
state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, $\gamma$-PO requires minimal code
changes and has a negligible impact on training efficiency, making it a robust
solution for enhancing LLMs alignment. Our codes are available at

Motivation: LLM推理时KV缓存占用大量内存，现有方法基于累积注意力分数淘汰不重要token，但存在位置偏差。

Method: 提出AhaKV，通过信息熵自适应调整softmax比例，并利用value向量信息优化淘汰策略。

Result: 实验表明AhaKV能减少偏差，保留全局关键token，在多个基准任务中达到SOTA。

Conclusion: AhaKV有效解决KV缓存偏差问题，提升LLM推理性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of
Artificial Intelligence. However, their deployment is resource-intensive, not
only due to the large number of model parameters but also because the
(Key-Value) KV cache consumes a lot of memory during inference. While several
works propose reducing the KV cache by evicting the unnecessary tokens, these
approaches rely on accumulated attention score as eviction score to quantify
the importance of the token. We identify the accumulated attention score is
biased and it decreases with the position of the tokens in the mathematical
expectation. As a result, the retained tokens concentrate on the initial
positions, limiting model's access to global contextual information. To address
this issue, we propose Adaptive holistic attention KV (AhaKV), it addresses the
bias of the accumulated attention score by adaptively tuning the scale of
softmax according the expectation of information entropy of attention scores.
To make use of the holistic attention information in self-attention mechanism,
AhaKV utilize the information of value vectors, which is overlooked in previous
works, to refine the adaptive score. We show theoretically that our method is
well suited for bias reduction. We deployed AhaKV on different models with a
fixed cache budget. Experiments show that AhaKV successfully mitigates bias and
retains crucial tokens across global context and achieve state-of-the-art
results against other related work on several benchmark tasks.

Conclusion: 属性接地方法能有效生成多样且复杂的指令数据，显著提升LLM对齐效果。

Abstract: The pursuit of diverse, complex, and large-scale instruction data is crucial
for automatically aligning large language models (LLMs). While there are
methods capable of generating synthetic instructions at scale, they either
suffer from limited grounding sources, leading to a narrow distribution, or
rely on trivial extensions that fail to produce meaningful trajectories in
terms of complexity. In contrast, instructions that benefit efficient alignment
are typically crafted with cognitive insights and grounded in real-world use
cases. In this paper, we synthesize such instructions using attributed
grounding, which involves 1) a top-down attribution process that grounds a
selective set of real instructions to situated users, and 2) a bottom-up
synthesis process that leverages web documents to first generate a situation,
then a meaningful instruction. This framework allows us to harvest diverse and
complex instructions at scale, utilizing the vast range of web documents.
Specifically, we construct a dataset of 1 million instructions, called
SynthQuestions, and demonstrate that models trained on it achieve leading
performance on several common benchmarks, with improvements that continually
scale with more web corpora. Data, models and codes will be available at
https://github.com/Ignoramus0817/SynthQuestions.

Method: 将预训练LLM的回答分解为事实片段，利用真实信息识别错误片段，通过调整阈值平衡回答完整性和正确性。

Result: HALT方法平均提高回答片段正确性15%，F1分数提升4%，在最高正确性设置下，正确性从51%提升至87%。

Conclusion: HALT能有效平衡回答完整性和正确性，显著减少幻觉问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) currently respond to every prompt. However, they
can produce incorrect answers when they lack knowledge or capability -- a
problem known as hallucination. We instead propose post-training an LLM to
generate content only when confident in its correctness and to otherwise
(partially) abstain. Specifically, our method, HALT, produces
capability-aligned post-training data that encodes what the model can and
cannot reliably generate. We generate this data by splitting responses of the
pretrained LLM into factual fragments (atomic statements or reasoning steps),
and use ground truth information to identify incorrect fragments. We achieve
capability-aligned finetuning responses by either removing incorrect fragments
or replacing them with "Unsure from Here" -- according to a tunable threshold
that allows practitioners to trade off response completeness and mean
correctness of the response's fragments. We finetune four open-source models
for biography writing, mathematics, coding, and medicine with HALT for three
different trade-off thresholds. HALT effectively trades off response
completeness for correctness, increasing the mean correctness of response
fragments by 15% on average, while resulting in a 4% improvement in the F1
score (mean of completeness and correctness of the response) compared to the
relevant baselines. By tuning HALT for highest correctness, we train a single
reliable Llama3-70B model with correctness increased from 51% to 87% across all
four domains while maintaining 53% of the response completeness achieved with
standard finetuning.

Conclusion: 该方法能揭示模型真实能力，具有通用性和可信度。

Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) depends on trustworthy
evaluation. However, most current evaluations rely on public benchmarks, which
are prone to data contamination issues that significantly compromise fairness.
Previous researches have focused on constructing dynamic benchmarks to address
contamination. However, continuously building new benchmarks is costly and
cyclical. In this work, we aim to tackle contamination by analyzing the
mechanisms of contaminated models themselves. Through our experiments, we
discover that the overestimation of contaminated models is likely due to
parameters acquiring shortcut solutions in training. We further propose a novel
method for identifying shortcut neurons through comparative and causal
analysis. Building on this, we introduce an evaluation method called shortcut
neuron patching to suppress shortcut neurons. Experiments validate the
effectiveness of our approach in mitigating contamination. Additionally, our
evaluation results exhibit a strong linear correlation with MixEval, a recently
released trustworthy benchmark, achieving a Spearman coefficient ($\rho$)
exceeding 0.95. This high correlation indicates that our method closely reveals
true capabilities of the models and is trustworthy. We conduct further
experiments to demonstrate the generalizability of our method across various
benchmarks and hyperparameter settings. Code:

Conclusion: SkipGPT通过动态效率与表达能力的平衡，推动了资源感知型LLM的实际部署。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance across tasks but
incur substantial computational costs due to their deep, multi-layered
architectures. Layer pruning has emerged as a strategy to alleviate these
inefficiencies, but conventional static pruning methods overlook two critical
dynamics inherent to LLM inference: (1) horizontal dynamics, where token-level
heterogeneity demands context-aware pruning decisions, and (2) vertical
dynamics, where the distinct functional roles of MLP and self-attention layers
necessitate component-specific pruning policies. We introduce SkipGPT, a
dynamic layer pruning framework designed to optimize computational resource
allocation through two core innovations: (1) global token-aware routing to
prioritize critical tokens, and (2) decoupled pruning policies for MLP and
self-attention components. To mitigate training instability, we propose a
two-stage optimization paradigm: first, a disentangled training phase that
learns routing strategies via soft parameterization to avoid premature pruning
decisions, followed by parameter-efficient LoRA fine-tuning to restore
performance impacted by layer removal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SkipGPT reduces over 40% of model parameters while matching or exceeding the
performance of the original dense model across benchmarks. By harmonizing
dynamic efficiency with preserved expressivity, SkipGPT advances the practical
deployment of scalable, resource-aware LLMs. Our code is publicly available at:

Motivation: 现有无监督方法缺乏对单个控制向量效果的保证，而有监督方法需要大量数据收集和训练。HyperSteer旨在结合两者的优势。

Result: 在数千个提示下，HyperSteer性能优于现有方法，且与提示控制方法相当。

Conclusion: HyperSteer提供了一种高效且可扩展的语言模型控制方法。

Abstract: Steering language models (LMs) by modifying internal activations is a popular
approach for controlling text generation. Unsupervised dictionary learning
methods, e.g., sparse autoencoders, can be scaled to produce many steering
vectors, but lack guarantees on the individual efficacy of each vector and
control over the coverage of relevant steering tasks. In contrast, supervised
methods for constructing steering vectors are targeted and effective, but
require more data collection and training for each additional steering vector
produced. In this work, we introduce HyperSteer, a family of hypernetwork-based
architectures which are trained end-to-end to generate steering vectors
conditioned on the natural language steering prompts and the internals of the
steered LM. In our evaluations, we show that scaling HyperSteer with thousands
of steering prompts exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art activation
steering methods, even on steering prompts never seen during training.
Moreover, HyperSteer performs on par with steering-via-prompting.

Abstract: Modern causal language models stack many attention blocks to improve
performance, but not all blocks are necessary for every task. We propose
Hopscotch, a simple yet effective method that identifies and skips attention
blocks with least contributions to a task and adapts to preserve output
quality. Hopscotch jointly optimizes which blocks to skip and how to scale the
outputs of the remaining layers. By introducing lightweight, trainable scaling
parameters to attention and MLP blocks, it mitigates distribution shifts in
hidden states caused by removing attention blocks. Hopscotch does not modify
model weights or require access to pretraining or instruction-tuning data, and
is compatible with existing model compression techniques. When applied to
$\texttt{Llama-3.1-8B}$ and $\texttt{Qwen2.5-7B}$, Hopscotch achieves less than

Motivation: 大语言模型生成的幻觉信息（看似合理但事实错误）是AI领域的重要挑战，需要一种无需依赖外部资源且可扩展的检测方法。

Method: 通过计算领域专用模型的困惑度分布差异来识别可能的幻觉片段，选择计算效率高的模型以实现多语言和跨领域的扩展性。

Abstract: Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) - instances where models
generate plausible but factually incorrect information - present a significant
challenge for AI.
  We introduce "Ask a Local", a novel hallucination detection method exploiting
the intuition that specialized models exhibit greater surprise when
encountering domain-specific inaccuracies. Our approach computes divergence
between perplexity distributions of language-specialized models to identify
potentially hallucinated spans. Our method is particularly well-suited for a
multilingual context, as it naturally scales to multiple languages without the
need for adaptation, relying on external data sources, or performing training.
Moreover, we select computationally efficient models, providing a scalable
solution that can be applied to a wide range of languages and domains.
  Our results on a human-annotated question-answer dataset spanning 14
languages demonstrate consistent performance across languages, with
Intersection-over-Union (IoU) scores around 0.3 and comparable Spearman
correlation values. Our model shows particularly strong performance on Italian
and Catalan, with IoU scores of 0.42 and 0.38, respectively, while maintaining
cross-lingual effectiveness without language-specific adaptations. We release
our code and architecture to facilitate further research in multilingual
hallucination detection.

Result: LLM初始依赖通用组件，随后逐渐专业化；注意力头变动最大，FFN更稳定；基于位置的关系比基于名称的关系更早收敛。

Conclusion: 研究提供了LLM知识形成的机制性视角，揭示了动态学习过程。

Abstract: Understanding how large language models (LLMs) acquire and store factual
knowledge is crucial for enhancing their interpretability and reliability. In
this work, we analyze the evolution of factual knowledge representation in the
OLMo-7B model by tracking the roles of its attention heads and feed forward
networks (FFNs) over the course of pre-training. We classify these components
into four roles: general, entity, relation-answer, and fact-answer specific,
and examine their stability and transitions. Our results show that LLMs
initially depend on broad, general-purpose components, which later specialize
as training progresses. Once the model reliably predicts answers, some
components are repurposed, suggesting an adaptive learning process. Notably,
attention heads display the highest turnover. We also present evidence that
FFNs remain more stable throughout training. Furthermore, our probing
experiments reveal that location-based relations converge to high accuracy
earlier in training than name-based relations, highlighting how task complexity
shapes acquisition dynamics. These insights offer a mechanistic view of
knowledge formation in LLMs.

Conclusion: APT是增强领域能力而不牺牲通用性的有效策略。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often require domain-specific fine-tuning to
address targeted tasks, which risks degrading their general capabilities.
Maintaining a balance between domain-specific enhancements and general model
utility is a key challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach named APT
(Weakness Case Acquisition and Iterative Preference Training) to enhance
domain-specific performance with self-generated dis-preferred weakness data
(bad cases and similar cases). APT uniquely focuses on training the model using
only those samples where errors occur, alongside a small, similar set of
samples retrieved for this purpose. This targeted training minimizes
interference with the model's existing knowledge base, effectively retaining
generic capabilities. Experimental results on the LLama-2 and Mistral-V0.3
models across various benchmarks demonstrate that APT ensures no reduction in
generic capacity and achieves superior performance on downstream tasks compared
to various existing methods. This validates our method as an effective strategy
for enhancing domain-specific capabilities without sacrificing the model's
broader applicability.

Abstract: The remarkable performance of Large language models (LLMs) relies heavily on
the availability of abundant high-quality training data. However, the high cost
of acquiring annotated data often prevents models from obtaining capabilities
to tackle downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, EpiCoDe
that boosts model performance in data-scarcity scenarios without extra
training. We first employ model extrapolation to enhance a finetuned model with
its inferior version, and then adopt contrastive decoding to further reduce
predicted errors, by comparing the logit scores given by the extrapolated and
the vanilla finetuned model. Experiments across three tasks over four different
LLMs show that EpiCoDe consistently outperforms existing methods with
significant and robust improvement. We also propose a new theoretical framework
to reveal the mechanism behind contrastive decoding in data-scarcity scenarios,
which further helps us better understand the effectiveness of EpiCoDe.

Conclusion: SGR-Edit提升医学知识编辑效果，为实际应用提供指导。

Abstract: Recently, knowledge editing (KE) has emerged as a promising approach to
update specific facts in Large Language Models (LLMs) without the need for full
retraining. Despite the effectiveness in general-domain benchmarks, their
applicability to complex medical domain remains largely unexplored. Medical
knowledge editing is particularly challenging, as it requires LLMs to
internalize the knowledge and generalize to unseen scenarios for effective and
interpretable decision-making. In this work, we propose a novel framework
called MedEditBench to rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of existing KE
methods in the medical domain. In MedEditBench, we introduce a new medical
knowledge editing benchmark as well as three different knowledge editing
paradigms, which are designed to assess the impact of different knowledge
sources for editing. Our findings indicate that current KE methods result in
only superficial memorization of the injected information, failing to
generalize to new scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we present
Self-Generated Rationale Editing (SGR-Edit), which utilizes model-derived
rationales as the target knowledge for editing, thereby uncovering the
underlying reasoning process and demonstrating significant improvements over
existing KE approaches. Additionally, we offer deeper insights into medical
knowledge editing, including the localization of medical knowledge in LLMs and
the impact of sequential editing on evolving knowledge. This could provide
practical guidance for implementing KE methods in real-world medical
applications.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了人类参与检测的模糊性问题，优于现有二元分类方法。

Abstract: Content creation has dramatically progressed with the rapid advancement of
large language models like ChatGPT and Claude. While this progress has greatly
enhanced various aspects of life and work, it has also negatively affected
certain areas of society. A recent survey revealed that nearly 30% of college
students use generative AI to help write academic papers and reports. Most
countermeasures treat the detection of AI-generated text as a binary
classification task and thus lack robustness. This approach overlooks human
involvement in the generation of content even though human-machine
collaboration is becoming mainstream. Besides generating entire texts, people
may use machines to complete or revise texts. Such human involvement varies
case by case, which makes binary classification a less than satisfactory
approach. We refer to this situation as participation detection obfuscation. We
propose using BERTScore as a metric to measure human involvement in the
generation process and a multi-task RoBERTa-based regressor trained on a token
classification task to address this problem. To evaluate the effectiveness of
this approach, we simulated academic-based scenarios and created a continuous
dataset reflecting various levels of human involvement. All of the existing
detectors we examined failed to detect the level of human involvement on this
dataset. Our method, however, succeeded (F1 score of 0.9423 and a regressor
mean squared error of 0.004). Moreover, it demonstrated some generalizability
across generative models. Our code is available at

Result: 多语言文本压缩率提升，困惑度从3.4e²降至1.2e²，仅需5k步恢复性能。

Conclusion: TokAlign有效统一词汇表，token级蒸馏显著提升基础模型性能。

Abstract: Tokenization serves as a foundational step for Large Language Models (LLMs)
to process text. In new domains or languages, the inefficiency of the tokenizer
will slow down the training and generation of LLM. The mismatch in vocabulary
also hinders deep knowledge transfer between LLMs like token-level
distillation. To mitigate this gap, we propose an efficient method named
TokAlign to replace the vocabulary of LLM from the token co-occurrences view,
and further transfer the token-level knowledge between models. It first aligns
the source vocabulary to the target one by learning a one-to-one mapping matrix
for token IDs. Model parameters, including embeddings, are rearranged and
progressively fine-tuned for the new vocabulary. Our method significantly
improves multilingual text compression rates and vocabulary initialization for
LLMs, decreasing the perplexity from 3.4$\text{e}^2$ of strong baseline methods
to 1.2$\text{e}^2$ after initialization. Experimental results on models across
multiple parameter scales demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of
TokAlign, which costs as few as 5k steps to restore the performance of the
vanilla model. After unifying vocabularies between LLMs, token-level
distillation can remarkably boost (+4.4% than sentence-level distillation) the
base model, costing only 235M tokens.

Abstract: Code data in large language model (LLM) pretraining is recognized crucial not
only for code-related tasks but also for enhancing general intelligence of
LLMs. Current open-source LLMs often heavily rely on human effort to produce
their code pretraining data, such as employing hand-crafted filtering rules
tailored to individual programming languages, or using human-annotated data to
train quality filters. However, these approaches are inherently limited in
scalability, prone to subjective biases, and costly to extend and maintain
across diverse programming languages. To address these challenges, we introduce
Seed-Coder, a series of open-source LLMs comprising base, instruct and
reasoning models of 8B size, minimizing human involvement in data construction.
Our code pretraining data is produced by a model-centric data pipeline, which
predominantly leverages LLMs for scoring and filtering code data. The instruct
model is further trained via supervised fine-tuning and preference
optimization, and the reasoning model leverages Long-Chain-of-Thought (LongCoT)
reinforcement learning to improve multi-step code reasoning. Seed-Coder
achieves state-of-the-art results among open-source models of similar size and
even surpasses some much larger models, demonstrating superior performance in
code generation, code completion, code editing, code reasoning, and software

Conclusion: PosS通过位置专用草稿层有效提升了LLM推理的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates Large Language Model (LLM) inference by
using a small draft model to predict multiple tokens, and a large target model
to verify these tokens in parallel. Recent studies leverage the hidden state of
the target model to enhance draft model prediction accuracy. However, existing
methods suffer from the degrading quality of draft token predictions at later
positions, due to error accumulation in draft model generated features. In this
paper, we propose Position Specialists (PosS), which consist of multiple
position-specialized draft layers to generate tokens at assigned position(s).
Position specialists greatly improve token acceptance rate at later positions
per drafting round, as each specialist only needs to focus on handling a
certain level of draft model feature deviation. Experiment results on
Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Llama-2-13B-chat across six datasets demonstrate that
PosS effectively improves over baselines on average acceptance length and
speed-up ratio. Our codebase is available at https://github.com/shrango/PosS.

a weakly supervised framework for training PRMs without access to ground-truth
step-level labels. FreePRM first generates pseudo step-level labels based on
the correctness of final outcome, and then employs Buffer Probability to
eliminate impact of noise inherent in pseudo labeling. Experimental results
show that FreePRM achieves an average F1 score of 53.0% on ProcessBench,
outperforming fully supervised PRM trained on Math-Shepherd by +24.1%. Compared
to other open-source PRMs, FreePRM outperforms upon RLHFlow-PRM-Mistral-8B

Conclusion: 通过任务转化，可以高效且低成本地监控LLM的关键能力，支持训练过程中的迭代评估。

Abstract: Iterative evaluation of LLMs during training is essential to ensure expected
capability development, but can be time- and compute-intensive. While NLU
tasks, where the model selects from fixed answer choices, are cheap to
evaluate, essential capabilities like reasoning and code generation rely on the
more time-consuming NLG (token-by-token generation) format. In this work, our
aim is to decrease the computational burden of NLG benchmarks in order to
enable monitoring crucial LLM capabilities during model training. We
reformulate generative tasks into computationally cheaper NLU alternatives. We
test the performance correlation between the original and reformulated tasks
using 8 LMs of various sizes and 4 capabilities: mathematical reasoning, code
generation, factual knowledge and reading comprehension. Our results show a
strong correlation between task formats, supporting capability assessment via
cheaper alternatives and achieving over 35x average reduction in evaluation

Abstract: To enhance reasoning capabilities, previous works have explored incorporating
special-purpose tokens into the training process. These strategies strengthen
the learning mechanism of transformer-based large language models (LLMs).
Building on prior research, in which inserting dummy tokens consecutively just
before reasoning steps can enhance effectiveness, we introduce a novel approach
termed Dynamic Inserting Tokens Training (DIT). Our method identifies positions
within sequences where model confidence is lowest according to token
log-likelihood. Strategically inserting [PAUSE] tokens on these positions
bolsters the model's predictive capabilities for subsequent tokens.
Experimental results across diverse datasets and models, from the 2.7B model to
the 8B model, demonstrate that DIT consistently outperforms traditional
fine-tuning and previous token insertion methods. With this simple yet
effective method, we achieve accuracy gains of up to 4.7%p on GSM8K, 3.23%p on

Result: 实验表明RoP显著提升LLM在算术、常识和逻辑推理任务中的鲁棒性，且对准确率影响极小。

Conclusion: RoP是一种实用有效的策略，可增强LLM在实际应用中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various tasks by effectively utilizing a prompting strategy. However, they are
highly sensitive to input perturbations, such as typographical errors or slight
character order errors, which can substantially degrade their performance.
Despite advances in prompting techniques, developing a prompting strategy that
explicitly mitigates the negative impact of such perturbations remains an open
challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose Robustness of Prompting (RoP), a
novel prompting strategy specifically designed to enhance the robustness of
LLMs. RoP consists of two stages: Error Correction and Guidance. In the Error
Correction stage, RoP applies diverse perturbation methods to generate
adversarial examples, which are then used to construct prompts that
automatically correct input errors. In the Guidance stage, RoP generates an
optimal guidance prompting based on the corrected input, steering the model
toward more robust and accurate inferences. Through comprehensive experiments
spanning arithmetic, commonsense, and logical reasoning tasks, we demonstrate
that RoP significantly improves LLMs' robustness against adversarial
perturbations. Notably, it maintains model accuracy with only minimal
degradation compared to clean input scenarios, thereby establishing RoP as a
practical and effective approach for enhancing LLM robustness in real-world
applications.

Calibration. We review how each dimension is evaluated in existing LLM-based
medical QA systems. We compile and compare major benchmarks designed to assess
these dimensions and analyze evaluation-guided techniques that drive model
improvements, such as retrieval-augmented grounding, adversarial fine-tuning,
and safety alignment. Finally, we identify open challenges-such as scalable
expert evaluation, integrated multi-dimensional metrics, and real-world

TL;DR: AdaDecode是一种加速大型语言模型（LLM）解码的方法，无需辅助模型或修改原始参数，通过自适应在中间层生成高置信度令牌，并行处理剩余层计算，提升硬件利用率，减少解码延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自回归解码在长内容生成中的效率瓶颈，避免现有方法（如推测解码和层跳过）的缺点（如辅助模型需求和输出不一致）。

Method: 利用中间层生成高置信度令牌，并行处理剩余层计算，并通过验证步骤确保输出一致性。

Result: 实验显示AdaDecode在多种生成任务中实现最高1.73倍的解码吞吐量提升，同时保证输出一致性。

Conclusion: AdaDecode是一种高效且可靠的解码加速方法，适用于LLM的长内容生成场景。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for long-content
generation (e.g., long Chain-of-Thought reasoning) where decoding efficiency
becomes a critical bottleneck: Autoregressive decoding is inherently limited by
its sequential token generation process, where each token must be generated
before the next can be processed. This sequential dependency restricts the
ability to fully leverage modern hardware's parallel processing capabilities.
Existing methods like speculative decoding and layer skipping offer potential
speedups but have notable drawbacks: speculative decoding relies on an
auxiliary "drafter" model, which can be challenging to acquire and increases
memory overhead, while layer skipping may introduce discrepancies in the
outputs due to the missing key-value cache at skipped layers. In this work, we
propose AdaDecode, which accelerates LLM decoding without requiring auxiliary
models or changes to the original model parameters, while ensuring output
consistency. AdaDecode leverages the insight that many tokens can accurately be
generated at intermediate layers, as further layers often do not significantly
alter predictions once the model reaches a certain confidence. By adaptively
generating tokens at intermediate layers when confidence is high, AdaDecode
enables the next token's computation to begin immediately. The remaining layer
computations for early-predicted tokens are deferred and executed in parallel
with subsequent tokens when needed, maximizing hardware utilization and
reducing decoding latency. A final verification step ensures that early
predictions match the results of standard autoregressive decoding, preserving
output parity. Experiments across diverse generation tasks shows that AdaDecode
consistently achieves superior decoding throughput with up to 1.73x speedup,
while guaranteeing output parity with standard autoregressive decoding.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在链式推理（CoT）中的不确定性校准问题，提出了一种仅需标量置信度标签的监督微调方法，无需显式推理监督或强化学习奖励，即可引导模型自我验证行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的不确定性校准对其安全部署至关重要，尤其是在用户依赖其置信度估计时。现有研究多集中于分类器或短文本生成，而链式推理的置信度校准尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过监督微调，仅使用标量置信度标签训练模型，使其在低置信度查询时生成更长且自我检查的响应，而在高置信度时提供简洁答案。此外，提出了一种基于校准不确定性的重新思考方法，以提升性能。

Result: 在GSM8K、MATH-500和ARC-Challenge等任务上的实验表明，该方法不仅提高了校准性和准确性，还通过对齐模型的推理路径与置信度增强了可解释性。

Conclusion: 仅需标量置信度标签的监督微调即可有效引导LLMs的自我验证行为，显著提升链式推理任务的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Uncertainty calibration is essential for the safe deployment of large
language models (LLMs), particularly when users rely on verbalized confidence
estimates. While prior work has focused on classifiers or short-form
generation, confidence calibration for chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning remains
largely unexplored. Surprisingly, we find that supervised fine-tuning with
scalar confidence labels alone suffices to elicit self-verification behavior of
language models, without any explicit reasoning supervision or reinforcement
learning-based rewards. Despite being trained only to produce a verbalized
confidence score without any self-verifying examples, the model learns to
generate longer and self-checking responses for low-confidence queries while
providing more concise answers for high-confidence ones. We further propose a
simple rethinking method that boosts performance via test-time scaling based on
calibrated uncertainty. Experiments on GSM8K and held-out reasoning tasks such
as MATH-500 and ARC-Challenge show that our confidence-aware fine-tuning
improves both calibration and accuracy, while also enhancing interpretability
by aligning the model's reasoning path with its confidence.

Conclusion: ClozeMath为LLMs的数学推理能力提供了一种有效的微调方法，并通过实验验证了其优越性。

Abstract: The capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have been enhanced by
training on data that reflects human thought processes, such as the
Chain-of-Thought format. However, evidence suggests that the conventional
scheme of next-word prediction may not fully capture how humans learn to think.
Inspired by how humans generalize mathematical reasoning, we propose a new
approach named ClozeMath to fine-tune LLMs for mathematical reasoning. Our
ClozeMath involves a text-infilling task that predicts masked equations from a
given solution, analogous to cloze exercises used in human learning.
Experiments on GSM8K, MATH, and GSM-Symbolic show that ClozeMath surpasses the
strong baseline Masked Thought in performance and robustness, with two
test-time scaling decoding algorithms, Beam Search and Chain-of-Thought
decoding. Additionally, we conduct an ablation study to analyze the effects of
various architectural and implementation choices on our approach.

Conclusion: UniQuanF在保持部署效率的同时显著提升了量化精度，为LLM量化提供了新思路。

Abstract: How can we quantize large language models while preserving accuracy?
Quantization is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs)
efficiently. Binary-coding quantization (BCQ) and uniform quantization (UQ) are
promising quantization schemes that have strong expressiveness and
optimizability, respectively. However, neither scheme leverages both
advantages. In this paper, we propose UniQuanF (Unified Quantization with
Flexible Mapping), an accurate quantization method for LLMs. UniQuanF harnesses
both strong expressiveness and optimizability by unifying the flexible mapping
technique in UQ and non-uniform quantization levels of BCQ. We propose unified
initialization, and local and periodic mapping techniques to optimize the
parameters in UniQuanF precisely. After optimization, our unification theorem
removes computational and memory overhead, allowing us to utilize the superior
accuracy of UniQuanF without extra deployment costs induced by the unification.
Experimental results demonstrate that UniQuanF outperforms existing UQ and BCQ
methods, achieving up to 4.60% higher accuracy on GSM8K benchmark.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown to be effective evaluators across
various domains such as machine translations or the scientific domain. Current

assessment improves scoring accuracy, increasing Pearson correlation with
expert evaluations by 0.07 on average for university-level exam scoring and
machine translation evaluations, aligning LLM assessments more closely with

Conclusion: RadialRouter在性能与成本权衡及动态LLM池适应性方面具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have led to the
emergence of routing techniques, which aim to efficiently select the optimal
LLM from diverse candidates to tackle specific tasks, optimizing performance
while reducing costs. Current LLM routing methods are limited in effectiveness
due to insufficient exploration of the intrinsic connection between user
queries and the characteristics of LLMs. To address this issue, in this paper,
we present RadialRouter, a novel framework for LLM routing which employs a
lightweight Transformer-based backbone with a radial structure named
RadialFormer to articulate the query-LLMs relationship. The optimal LLM
selection is performed based on the final states of RadialFormer. The pipeline
is further refined by an objective function that combines Kullback-Leibler
divergence with the query-query contrastive loss to enhance robustness.
Experimental results on RouterBench show that RadialRouter significantly
outperforms existing routing methods by 9.2\% and 5.8\% in the Balance and Cost
First scenarios, respectively. Additionally, its adaptability toward different
performance-cost trade-offs and the dynamic LLM pool demonstrates practical

Conclusion: Magic Mushroom是评估和提升RAG系统噪声鲁棒性的有效工具。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance Large Language Models
(LLMs) by incorporating external retrieved information, mitigating issues such
as hallucination and outdated knowledge.
  However, RAG systems are highly sensitive to retrieval noise prevalent in
real-world scenarios.
  Existing benchmarks fail to emulate the complex and heterogeneous noise
distributions encountered in real-world retrieval environments, undermining
reliable robustness assessment.
  In this paper, we define four categories of retrieval noise based on
linguistic properties and noise characteristics, aiming to reflect the
heterogeneity of noise in real-world scenarios.
  Building on this, we introduce Magic Mushroom, a benchmark for replicating
"magic mushroom" noise: contexts that appear relevant on the surface but
covertly mislead RAG systems.
  Magic Mushroom comprises 7,468 single-hop and 3,925 multi-hop question-answer
pairs.
  More importantly, Magic Mushroom enables researchers to flexibly configure
combinations of retrieval noise according to specific research objectives or
application scenarios, allowing for highly controlled evaluation setups.
  We evaluate LLM generators of varying parameter scales and classic RAG
denoising strategies under diverse noise distributions to investigate their
performance dynamics during progressive noise encroachment.
  Our analysis reveals that both generators and denoising strategies have
significant room for improvement and exhibit extreme sensitivity to noise
distributions.
  Magic Mushroom emerges as a promising tool for evaluating and advancing
noise-robust RAG systems, accelerating their widespread deployment in
real-world applications.

Method: 使用MathComp基准测试（300个比较场景，14种提示变体）评估三种LLM家族，分析框架偏见。

Result: LLMs对输入中的比较词（如“更多”、“更少”）表现出系统性偏见，链式思维提示可部分缓解。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs的框架偏见，强调了在评估中考虑语义框架的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to be sensitive to input phrasing, but
the mechanisms by which semantic cues shape reasoning remain poorly understood.
We investigate this phenomenon in the context of comparative math problems with
objective ground truth, revealing a consistent and directional framing bias:
logically equivalent questions containing the words ``more'', ``less'', or
``equal'' systematically steer predictions in the direction of the framing
term. To study this effect, we introduce MathComp, a controlled benchmark of
300 comparison scenarios, each evaluated under 14 prompt variants across three
LLM families. We find that model errors frequently reflect linguistic steering,
systematic shifts toward the comparative term present in the prompt.
Chain-of-thought prompting reduces these biases, but its effectiveness varies:
free-form reasoning is more robust, while structured formats may preserve or
reintroduce directional drift. Finally, we show that including demographic
identity terms (e.g., ``a woman'', ``a Black person'') in input scenarios
amplifies directional drift, despite identical underlying quantities,
highlighting the interplay between semantic framing and social referents. These
findings expose critical blind spots in standard evaluation and motivate
framing-aware benchmarks for diagnosing reasoning robustness and fairness in
LLMs.

we propose SPRINT, a novel contrastive learning framework that dynamically

question embeddings with head embeddings, SPRINT identifies those pruned-head

Abstract: Reasoning over time and space is essential for understanding our world.
However, the abilities of language models in this area are largely unexplored
as previous work has tested their abilities for logical reasoning in terms of
time and space in isolation or only in simple or artificial environments. In
this paper, we present the first evaluation of the ability of language models
to jointly reason over time and space. To enable our analysis, we create
GeoTemp, a dataset of 320k prompts covering 289 cities in 217 countries and 37
time zones. Using GeoTemp, we evaluate eight open chat models of three
different model families for different combinations of temporal and geographic
knowledge. We find that most models perform well on reasoning tasks involving
only temporal knowledge and that overall performance improves with scale.
However, performance remains constrained in tasks that require connecting
temporal and geographical information. We do not find clear correlations of
performance with specific geographic regions. Instead, we find a significant
performance increase for location names with low model perplexity, suggesting
their repeated occurrence during model training. We further demonstrate that
their performance is heavily influenced by prompt formulation - a direct
injection of geographical knowledge leads to performance gains, whereas,
surprisingly, techniques like chain-of-thought prompting decrease performance
on simpler tasks.

Abstract: Knowledge editing aims to alternate the target knowledge predicted by large
language models while ensuring the least side effects on unrelated knowledge.
An effective way to achieve knowledge editing is to identify pivotal parameters
for predicting factual associations and modify them with an optimization
process to update the predictions. However, these locate-then-edit methods are
uncontrollable since they tend to modify most unrelated relations connected to
the subject of target editing. We unveil that this failure of controllable
editing is due to a shortcut learning issue during the optimization process.
Specifically, we discover two crucial features that are the subject feature and
the relation feature for models to learn during optimization, but the current
optimization process tends to over-learning the subject feature while
neglecting the relation feature. To eliminate this shortcut learning of the
subject feature, we propose a novel two-stage optimization process that
balances the learning of the subject feature and the relation feature.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach successfully prevents
knowledge editing from shortcut learning and achieves the optimal overall
performance, contributing to controllable knowledge editing.

intrinsic property, predictable even before training begins. Additionally,
while non-support samples are less influential in direct predictions, they play
a critical role in preventing overfitting and shaping generalization and
representation learning. Notably, the importance of non-support samples
increases in deeper layers, suggesting their significant role in intermediate
representation formation.These insights shed light on the interplay between

Abstract: Generative models, especially large language models (LLMs), have shown
remarkable progress in producing text that appears human-like. However, they
often exhibit patterns that make their output easier to detect than text
written by humans. In this paper, we investigate how explainable AI (XAI)
methods can be used to reduce the detectability of AI-generated text (AIGT)
while also introducing a robust ensemble-based detection approach. We begin by
training an ensemble classifier to distinguish AIGT from human-written text,
then apply SHAP and LIME to identify tokens that most strongly influence its
predictions. We propose four explainability-based token replacement strategies
to modify these influential tokens. Our findings show that these token
replacement approaches can significantly diminish a single classifier's ability
to detect AIGT. However, our ensemble classifier maintains strong performance
across multiple languages and domains, showing that a multi-model approach can
mitigate the impact of token-level manipulations. These results show that XAI
methods can make AIGT harder to detect by focusing on the most influential
tokens. At the same time, they highlight the need for robust, ensemble-based
detection strategies that can adapt to evolving approaches for hiding AIGT.

Method: 开发了LLMEval-Med基准测试，结合真实临床数据和专家设计场景，并采用自动化评估流程和LLM-as-Judge框架。通过人机一致性分析验证评分可靠性。

Result: 评估了13种LLM，提供了医学领域LLM安全有效部署的见解。

Conclusion: LLMEval-Med为医学领域LLM评估提供了更可靠的基准，支持其实际应用。

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) in medicine is crucial because
medical applications require high accuracy with little room for error. Current
medical benchmarks have three main types: medical exam-based, comprehensive
medical, and specialized assessments. However, these benchmarks have
limitations in question design (mostly multiple-choice), data sources (often
not derived from real clinical scenarios), and evaluation methods (poor
assessment of complex reasoning). To address these issues, we present
LLMEval-Med, a new benchmark covering five core medical areas, including 2,996
questions created from real-world electronic health records and expert-designed
clinical scenarios. We also design an automated evaluation pipeline,
incorporating expert-developed checklists into our LLM-as-Judge framework.
Furthermore, our methodology validates machine scoring through human-machine
agreement analysis, dynamically refining checklists and prompts based on expert
feedback to ensure reliability. We evaluate 13 LLMs across three categories
(specialized medical models, open-source models, and closed-source models) on
LLMEval-Med, providing valuable insights for the safe and effective deployment
of LLMs in medical domains. The dataset is released in
https://github.com/llmeval/LLMEval-Med.

Abstract: We present TextAtari, a benchmark for evaluating language agents on very
long-horizon decision-making tasks spanning up to 100,000 steps. By translating
the visual state representations of classic Atari games into rich textual

decision-making with natural language processing. The benchmark includes nearly
100 distinct tasks with varying complexity, action spaces, and planning
horizons, all rendered as text through an unsupervised representation learning

(Qwen2.5-7B, Gemma-7B, and Llama3.1-8B) across three agent frameworks
(zero-shot, few-shot chain-of-thought, and reflection reasoning) to assess how
different forms of prior knowledge affect performance on these long-horizon
challenges. Four scenarios-Basic, Obscured, Manual Augmentation, and
Reference-based-investigate the impact of semantic understanding, instruction
comprehension, and expert demonstrations on agent decision-making. Our results
reveal significant performance gaps between language agents and human players
in extensive planning tasks, highlighting challenges in sequential reasoning,
state tracking, and strategic planning across tens of thousands of steps.
TextAtari provides standardized evaluation protocols, baseline implementations,
and a framework for advancing research at the intersection of language models

Result: 在数学推理、语言建模和检索任务中，ReSA实现了近乎无损的生成质量，并显著提升效率，解码速度最高提升2.42倍。

Conclusion: ReSA是一种实用的长上下文推理解决方案，兼具高效性和生成质量。

Abstract: Efficient long-sequence generation is a critical challenge for Large Language
Models. While recent sparse decoding methods improve efficiency, they suffer
from KV cache misalignment, where approximation errors accumulate and degrade
generation quality. In this work, we propose Rectified Sparse Attention (ReSA),
a simple yet effective method that combines block-sparse attention with
periodic dense rectification. By refreshing the KV cache at fixed intervals
using a dense forward pass, ReSA bounds error accumulation and preserves
alignment with the pretraining distribution. Experiments across math reasoning,
language modeling, and retrieval tasks demonstrate that ReSA achieves
near-lossless generation quality with significantly improved efficiency.
Notably, ReSA delivers up to 2.42$\times$ end-to-end speedup under decoding at
256K sequence length, making it a practical solution for scalable long-context
inference. Code is available at https://aka.ms/ReSA-LM.

Abstract: Long-form text generation remains a significant challenge for large language
models (LLMs), particularly in maintaining coherence, ensuring logical
consistency, and preserving text quality as sequence length increases. To
address these limitations, we propose SuperWriter-Agent, an agent-based
framework designed to enhance the quality and consistency of long-form text
generation. SuperWriter-Agent introduces explicit structured thinking-through
planning and refinement stages into the generation pipeline, guiding the model
to follow a more deliberate and cognitively grounded process akin to that of a
professional writer. Based on this framework, we construct a supervised
fine-tuning dataset to train a 7B SuperWriter-LM. We further develop a
hierarchical Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) procedure that uses Monte
Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to propagate final quality assessments and optimize
each generation step accordingly. Empirical results across diverse benchmarks
demonstrate that SuperWriter-LM achieves state-of-the-art performance,
surpassing even larger-scale baseline models in both automatic evaluation and
human evaluation. Furthermore, comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the
effectiveness of hierarchical DPO and underscore the value of incorporating
structured thinking steps to improve the quality of long-form text generation.

Conclusion: SwitchCoT能动态平衡推理准确性和计算效率，适用于不同资源场景。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large reasoning models, long Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) prompting has demonstrated strong performance on complex tasks. However,
this often comes with a significant increase in token usage. In this paper, we
conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis comparing long and short CoT
strategies. Our findings reveal that while long CoT can lead to performance
improvements, its benefits are often marginal relative to its significantly
higher token consumption. Specifically, long CoT tends to outperform when ample
generation budgets are available, whereas short CoT is more effective under
tighter budget constraints. These insights underscore the need for a dynamic
approach that selects the proper CoT strategy based on task context and
resource availability. To address this, we propose SwitchCoT, an automatic
framework that adaptively chooses between long and short CoT strategies to
balance reasoning accuracy and computational efficiency. Moreover, SwitchCoT is
designed to be budget-aware, making it broadly applicable across scenarios with
varying resource constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that SwitchCoT
can reduce inference costs by up to 50% while maintaining high accuracy.
Notably, under limited token budgets, it achieves performance comparable to, or
even exceeding, that of using either long or short CoT alone.

Result: 在七个数据集上，R-Search比先进RAG基线性能提升32.2%（域内）和25.1%（域外）。

Conclusion: R-Search有效提升了LLMs在复杂任务中的推理与搜索交互能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have notably progressed in multi-step and
long-chain reasoning. However, extending their reasoning capabilities to
encompass deep interactions with search remains a non-trivial challenge, as
models often fail to identify optimal reasoning-search interaction
trajectories, resulting in suboptimal responses. We propose R-Search, a novel
reinforcement learning framework for Reasoning-Search integration, designed to
enable LLMs to autonomously execute multi-step reasoning with deep search
interaction, and learn optimal reasoning search interaction trajectories via
multi-reward signals, improving response quality in complex logic- and
knowledge-intensive tasks. R-Search guides the LLM to dynamically decide when
to retrieve or reason, while globally integrating key evidence to enhance deep
knowledge interaction between reasoning and search. During RL training,
R-Search provides multi-stage, multi-type rewards to jointly optimize the
reasoning-search trajectory. Experiments on seven datasets show that R-Search
outperforms advanced RAG baselines by up to 32.2% (in-domain) and 25.1%
(out-of-domain). The code and data are available at

Motivation: 现有知识编辑方法（如MEMIT）的预计算步骤计算成本过高，限制了其实际应用，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Result: 实验表明，预计算步骤的计算时间显著减少，用户可在几分钟内开始编辑新模型。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了知识编辑的计算成本，提高了实用性。

Abstract: Knowledge editing methods like MEMIT are able to make data and compute
efficient updates of factual knowledge by using a single sentence to update
facts and their consequences. However, what is often overlooked is a
"precomputation step", which requires a one-time but significant computational
cost. The authors of MEMIT originally precompute approximately 44 million
hidden vectors per edited layer, which requires a forward pass over 44 million
tokens. For GPT-J (6B), this precomputation step takes 36 hours on a single
GPU, while it takes approximately 40 hours for Llama2-7B. Additionally, this
precomputation time grows with model size. In this paper, we show that this
excessive computational cost is unnecessary. Knowledge editing using MEMIT and
related methods, such as ROME and EMMET, can be performed by pre-computing a
very small portion of the 44 million hidden vectors. We first present the
theoretical minimum number of hidden vector precomputation required for
solutions of these editing methods to exist. We then empirically show that
knowledge editing using these methods can be done by pre-computing
significantly fewer hidden vectors. Specifically, we show that the
precomputation step can be done with less than 0.3% of the originally
stipulated number of hidden vectors. This saves a significant amount of
precomputation time and allows users to begin editing new models within a few
minutes.

Conclusion: 该方法在多轮对话生成中有效提升了连贯性和任务完成率。

Abstract: Current instruction data synthesis methods primarily focus on single-turn
instructions and often neglect cross-turn coherence, resulting in context drift
and reduced task completion rates in extended conversations. To address this
limitation, we propose Skeleton-Guided Multi-Turn Dialogue Generation, a
framework that constrains multi-turn instruction synthesis by explicitly
modeling human conversational intent. It operates in two stages: (1) Intent
Modeling, which captures the global structure of human dialogues by assigning
each conversation to one of nine well-defined intent trajectories, ensuring a
coherent and goal-oriented information flow; and (2) Skeleton Generation, which
constructs a structurally grounded sequence of user queries aligned with the
modeled intent, thereby serving as a scaffold that constrains and guides the
downstream instruction synthesis process. Based on this process, we construct
ConsistentChat, a multi-turn instruction dataset with approximately 15,000
multi-turn conversations and 224,392 utterances. Experiments on the Light,
Topdial, and MT-Eval benchmarks show that models fine-tuned on ConsistentChat
achieve a 20-30% improvement in chat consistency and up to a 15% increase in
task success rate, significantly outperforming models trained on existing
single-turn and multi-turn instruction datasets.

Abstract: Large language models increasingly support multiple languages, yet most
benchmarks for gender bias remain English-centric. We introduce EuroGEST, a
dataset designed to measure gender-stereotypical reasoning in LLMs across
English and 29 European languages. EuroGEST builds on an existing
expert-informed benchmark covering 16 gender stereotypes, expanded in this work
using translation tools, quality estimation metrics, and morphological
heuristics. Human evaluations confirm that our data generation method results
in high accuracy of both translations and gender labels across languages. We
use EuroGEST to evaluate 24 multilingual language models from six model
families, demonstrating that the strongest stereotypes in all models across all
languages are that women are \textit{beautiful,} \textit{empathetic} and
\textit{neat} and men are \textit{leaders}, \textit{strong, tough} and
\textit{professional}. We also show that larger models encode gendered
stereotypes more strongly and that instruction finetuning does not consistently
reduce gendered stereotypes. Our work highlights the need for more multilingual
studies of fairness in LLMs and offers scalable methods and resources to audit
gender bias across languages.

Abstract: Many real world tasks where Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used require
spatial reasoning, like Point of Interest (POI) recommendation and itinerary
planning. However, on their own LLMs lack reliable spatial reasoning
capabilities, especially about distances. To address this problem, we develop a
novel approach, DistRAG, that enables an LLM to retrieve relevant spatial
information not explicitly learned during training. Our method encodes the
geodesic distances between cities and towns in a graph and retrieves a context
subgraph relevant to the question. Using this technique, our method enables an
LLM to answer distance-based reasoning questions that it otherwise cannot
answer. Given the vast array of possible places an LLM could be asked about,
DistRAG offers a flexible first step towards providing a rudimentary `world
model' to complement the linguistic knowledge held in LLMs.

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong language
understanding and generation abilities across various languages, their cultural

marginalize the cultures of non-English communities. To address the problem,
evaluation of the cultural awareness of the LLMs and the methods to develop
culturally aware LLMs have been investigated. In this study, we focus on
evaluating knowledge of folktales, a key medium for conveying and circulating
culture. In particular, we focus on Japanese folktales, specifically on
knowledge of Yokai. Yokai are supernatural creatures originating from Japanese
folktales that continue to be popular motifs in art and entertainment today.
Yokai have long served as a medium for cultural expression, making them an
ideal subject for assessing the cultural awareness of LLMs. We introduce
YokaiEval, a benchmark dataset consisting of 809 multiple-choice questions
(each with four options) designed to probe knowledge about yokai. We evaluate
the performance of 31 Japanese and multilingual LLMs on this dataset. The
results show that models trained with Japanese language resources achieve

Motivation: Existing methods for structured generation in LLMs are inefficient for large inference batches due to runtime execution overhead.

Method: Pre$^3$ precomputes prefix-conditioned edges and transforms LR(1) transition graphs into DPDA, enabling parallel processing and eliminating runtime path exploration.

Result: Pre$^3$ reduces time per output token by up to 40% and increases throughput by up to 36%.

Conclusion: Pre$^3$ offers a scalable and efficient solution for structured generation in LLMs.

Abstract: Extensive LLM applications demand efficient structured generations,
particularly for LR(1) grammars, to produce outputs in specified formats (e.g.,
JSON). Existing methods primarily parse LR(1) grammars into a pushdown
automaton (PDA), leading to runtime execution overhead for context-dependent
token processing, especially inefficient under large inference batches. To
address these issues, we propose Pre$^3$ that exploits deterministic pushdown
automata (DPDA) to optimize the constrained LLM decoding efficiency. First, by
precomputing prefix-conditioned edges during the preprocessing, Pre$^3$ enables
ahead-of-time edge analysis and thus makes parallel transition processing
possible. Second, by leveraging the prefix-conditioned edges, Pre$^3$
introduces a novel approach that transforms LR(1) transition graphs into DPDA,
eliminating the need for runtime path exploration and achieving edge
transitions with minimal overhead. Pre$^3$ can be seamlessly integrated into
standard LLM inference frameworks, reducing time per output token (TPOT) by up
to 40% and increasing throughput by up to 36% in our experiments. Our code is

Conclusion: TableEval和SEAT为LLMs在TableQA中的改进提供了重要参考。

Abstract: LLMs have shown impressive progress in natural language processing. However,
they still face significant challenges in TableQA, where real-world
complexities such as diverse table structures, multilingual data, and
domain-specific reasoning are crucial. Existing TableQA benchmarks are often
limited by their focus on simple flat tables and suffer from data leakage.
Furthermore, most benchmarks are monolingual and fail to capture the
cross-lingual and cross-domain variability in practical applications. To
address these limitations, we introduce TableEval, a new benchmark designed to
evaluate LLMs on realistic TableQA tasks. Specifically, TableEval includes
tables with various structures (such as concise, hierarchical, and nested
tables) collected from four domains (including government, finance, academia,
and industry reports). Besides, TableEval features cross-lingual scenarios with
tables in Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, and English. To minimize the
risk of data leakage, we collect all data from recent real-world documents.
Considering that existing TableQA metrics fail to capture semantic accuracy, we
further propose SEAT, a new evaluation framework that assesses the alignment
between model responses and reference answers at the sub-question level.
Experimental results have shown that SEAT achieves high agreement with human
judgment. Extensive experiments on TableEval reveal critical gaps in the
ability of state-of-the-art LLMs to handle these complex, real-world TableQA
tasks, offering insights for future improvements. We make our dataset available

Abstract: With the rise of long-context language models (LMs) capable of processing

comparing two recent multi-stage pipelines, ReadAgent and RAPTOR, against three

retrieve-then-read method that preserves original passage order. Despite its
straightforward design, DOS RAG consistently matches or outperforms more
intricate methods on multiple long-context QA benchmarks. We recommend

TL;DR: 论文研究了大规模模型（如多模态和纯语言模型）在表示具体对象概念语义特征（如颜色、气味等）时的表现，发现多模态图像编码器略优于纯语言模型，而纯图像编码器在非视觉属性上也表现不俗。


<details>

Motivation: 探索大规模模型是否能像人类一样基于感知经验表示具体对象概念的语义特征，填补现有基础模型与人类学习方式之间的差距。

Method: 使用探测任务评估不同模型（纯图像编码器、多模态图像编码器和纯语言模型）在预测McRae和Binder数据集属性时的表现。

Result: 多模态图像编码器略优于纯语言模型；纯图像编码器在非视觉属性（如“百科全书”或“功能”类）上表现与语言模型相当。

Conclusion: 结果揭示了单模态学习的潜力以及多模态的互补性，为模型设计提供了新视角。

Abstract: Human learning and conceptual representation is grounded in sensorimotor
experience, in contrast to state-of-the-art foundation models. In this paper,
we investigate how well such large-scale models, trained on vast quantities of
data, represent the semantic feature norms of concrete object concepts, e.g. a
ROSE is red, smells sweet, and is a flower. More specifically, we use probing
tasks to test which properties of objects these models are aware of. We
evaluate image encoders trained on image data alone, as well as
multimodally-trained image encoders and language-only models, on predicting an
extended denser version of the classic McRae norms and the newer Binder dataset
of attribute ratings. We find that multimodal image encoders slightly
outperform language-only approaches, and that image-only encoders perform
comparably to the language models, even on non-visual attributes that are
classified as "encyclopedic" or "function". These results offer new insights
into what can be learned from pure unimodal learning, and the complementarity
of the modalities.

Motivation: 传统LLM输出复杂度高，不适合初学者语言学习。研究旨在探索无需微调的方法来适配LLM输出，以支持绝对初学者。

Method: 采用模块化可控生成技术（如未来判别器），通过自动指标和用户研究（日语学习者）评估效果。

Result: 未来判别器将输出可理解性从40.4%提升至84.3%，并提出了与人类判断强相关的TMR指标。

Conclusion: 可控生成技术能有效适配LLM输出，支持初学者学习。研究提供了代码、模型和数据以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Practicing conversations with large language models (LLMs) presents a
promising alternative to traditional in-person language learning. However, most
LLMs generate text at a near-native level of complexity, making them ill-suited
for beginner learners (CEFR: A1-A2). In this paper, we investigate whether
controllable generation techniques -- specifically modular methods that do not
require model fine-tuning -- can adapt LLM outputs to better support absolute
beginners. We evaluate these methods through both automatic metrics and a user
study with university-level learners of Japanese. Our findings show that while
prompting alone fails to control output difficulty, the use of future
discriminators (Yang and Klein, 2021) significantly improves output
comprehensibility (from 40.4\% to 84.3\%). We further introduce a novel
token-level evaluation metric, Token Miss Rate (TMR), that quantifies the
proportion of incomprehensible tokens per utterance and correlates strongly
with human judgments. To support future research in AI-assisted language
learning, we release our code, models, annotation tools, and dataset.

Motivation: 当前基于大型语言模型（LLMs）的重排序方法计算成本高，而小型语言模型（SLMs）在未微调时难以理解任务提示。

Method: 两阶段训练：1）通过强化学习（GRPO）引导SLMs理解任务提示；2）微调以提升细粒度评分能力。

Result: ProRank-0.5B在BEIR基准测试中超越了32B LLM模型，证明了SLMs的高效性和性能优势。

Conclusion: 适当训练的SLMs可以在保持计算效率的同时实现卓越的文档重排序性能。

Abstract: Reranking is fundamental to information retrieval and retrieval-augmented
generation, with recent Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly advancing
reranking quality. While recent advances with LLMs have significantly improved
document reranking quality, current approaches primarily rely on large-scale
LLMs (>7B parameters) through zero-shot prompting, presenting high
computational costs. Small Language Models (SLMs) offer a promising alternative
because of their efficiency, but our preliminary quantitative analysis reveals
they struggle with understanding task prompts without fine-tuning. This limits
their effectiveness for document reranking tasks. To address this issue, we
introduce a novel two-stage training approach, ProRank, for SLM-based document
reranking. First, we propose a prompt warmup stage using reinforcement learning
GRPO to steer SLMs to understand task prompts and generate more accurate
coarse-grained binary relevance scores for document reranking. Then, we
continuously fine-tune the SLMs with a fine-grained score learning stage
without introducing additional layers to further improve the reranking quality.
Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ProRank
consistently outperforms both the most advanced open-source and proprietary
reranking models. Notably, our lightweight ProRank-0.5B model even surpasses
the powerful 32B LLM reranking model on the BEIR benchmark, establishing that
properly trained SLMs can achieve superior document reranking performance while
maintaining computational efficiency.

Motivation: 评估LLM在自动化CT放射报告疾病标注中的有效性，并与传统方法对比。

Method: 使用40,833份CT报告，测试三种轻量级LLM和规则算法，通过Cohen's Kappa和F1分数评估性能。

Result: Gemma-3 27B和Llama-3.1 8B表现最佳，优于规则算法，但在不同标签实践中存在差异。

Conclusion: LLM提供灵活高效的解决方案，但需注意标签设计的局限性。

Abstract: Purpose: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of large language
models (LLMs) in automating disease annotation of CT radiology reports. We
compare a rule-based algorithm (RBA), RadBERT, and three lightweight
open-weight LLMs for multi-disease labeling of chest, abdomen, and pelvis (CAP)
CT reports.
  Materials and Methods: This retrospective study analyzed 40,833 CT reports
from 29,540 patients, with 1,789 CAP reports manually annotated across three
organ systems. External validation was conducted using the CT-RATE dataset.
Three open-weight LLMs were tested with zero-shot prompting. Performance was
evaluated using Cohen's Kappa and micro/macro-averaged F1 scores.
  Results: In 12,197 Duke CAP reports from 8,854 patients, Llama-3.1 8B and
Gemma-3 27B showed the highest agreement ($\kappa$ median: 0.87). On the
manually annotated set, Gemma-3 27B achieved the top macro-F1 (0.82), followed
by Llama-3.1 8B (0.79), while the RBA scored lowest (0.64). On the CT-RATE
dataset (lungs/pleura only), Llama-3.1 8B performed best (0.91), with Gemma-3
27B close behind (0.89). Performance differences were mainly due to differing
labeling practices, especially for lung atelectasis.
  Conclusion: Lightweight LLMs outperform rule-based methods for CT report
annotation and generalize across organ systems with zero-shot prompting.
However, binary labels alone cannot capture the full nuance of report language.
LLMs can provide a flexible, efficient solution aligned with clinical judgment
and user needs.

Conclusion: Delta-KNN显著提升LLM在复杂任务中的诊断能力。

Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that
leads to dementia, and early intervention can greatly benefit from analyzing
linguistic abnormalities. In this work, we explore the potential of Large
Language Models (LLMs) as health assistants for AD diagnosis from
patient-generated text using in-context learning (ICL), where tasks are defined
through a few input-output examples. Empirical results reveal that conventional
ICL methods, such as similarity-based selection, perform poorly for AD
diagnosis, likely due to the inherent complexity of this task. To address this,
we introduce Delta-KNN, a novel demonstration selection strategy that enhances
ICL performance. Our method leverages a delta score to assess the relative
gains of each training example, coupled with a KNN-based retriever that
dynamically selects optimal "representatives" for a given input. Experiments on
two AD detection datasets across three open-source LLMs demonstrate that
Delta-KNN consistently outperforms existing ICL baselines. Notably, when using
the Llama-3.1 model, our approach achieves new state-of-the-art results,
surpassing even supervised classifiers.

Conclusion: 该研究为数据增强提供了更可控、可解释且上下文感知的解决方案，为XAI技术在模型训练中的应用开辟了新范式。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) has emerged as a powerful tool for improving the
performance of AI models, going beyond providing model transparency and
interpretability. The scarcity of labeled data remains a fundamental challenge
in developing robust and generalizable AI models, particularly for low-resource
languages. Conventional data augmentation techniques introduce noise, cause
semantic drift, disrupt contextual coherence, lack control, and lead to
overfitting. To address these challenges, we propose XAI-Guided Context-Aware
Data Augmentation. This novel framework leverages XAI techniques to modify less
critical features while selectively preserving most task-relevant features. Our
approach integrates an iterative feedback loop, which refines augmented data
over multiple augmentation cycles based on explainability-driven insights and
the model performance gain. Our experimental results demonstrate that XAI-SR-BT
and XAI-PR-BT improve the accuracy of models on hate speech and sentiment
analysis tasks by 6.6% and 8.1%, respectively, compared to the baseline, using
the Amharic dataset with the XLM-R model. XAI-SR-BT and XAI-PR-BT outperform
existing augmentation techniques by 4.8% and 5%, respectively, on the same
dataset and model. Overall, XAI-SR-BT and XAI-PR-BT consistently outperform
both baseline and conventional augmentation techniques across all tasks and
models. This study provides a more controlled, interpretable, and context-aware
solution to data augmentation, addressing critical limitations of existing
augmentation techniques and offering a new paradigm shift for leveraging XAI
techniques to enhance AI model training.

Conclusion: KG-BiLM有效统一了结构信息与文本语义，验证了其在知识图谱与语言模型融合中的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in knowledge representation learning (KRL) highlight the
urgent necessity to unify symbolic knowledge graphs (KGs) with language models
(LMs) for richer semantic understanding. However, existing approaches typically
prioritize either graph structure or textual semantics, leaving a gap: a
unified framework that simultaneously captures global KG connectivity, nuanced
linguistic context, and discriminative reasoning semantics. To bridge this gap,
we introduce KG-BiLM, a bidirectional LM framework that fuses structural cues
from KGs with the semantic expressiveness of generative transformers. KG-BiLM
incorporates three key components: (i) Bidirectional Knowledge Attention, which
removes the causal mask to enable full interaction among all tokens and
entities; (ii) Knowledge-Masked Prediction, which encourages the model to
leverage both local semantic contexts and global graph connectivity; and (iii)
Contrastive Graph Semantic Aggregation, which preserves KG structure via
contrastive alignment of sampled sub-graph representations. Extensive
experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that KG-BiLM outperforms strong
baselines in link prediction, especially on large-scale graphs with complex
multi-hop relations - validating its effectiveness in unifying structural
information and textual semantics.

Abstract: This research introduces ScoreRAG, an approach to enhance the quality of
automated news generation. Despite advancements in Natural Language Processing
and large language models, current news generation methods often struggle with
hallucinations, factual inconsistencies, and lack of domain-specific expertise
when producing news articles. ScoreRAG addresses these challenges through a
multi-stage framework combining retrieval-augmented generation, consistency
relevance evaluation, and structured summarization. The system first retrieves
relevant news documents from a vector database, maps them to complete news
items, and assigns consistency relevance scores based on large language model
evaluations. These documents are then reranked according to relevance, with
low-quality items filtered out. The framework proceeds to generate graded
summaries based on relevance scores, which guide the large language model in
producing complete news articles following professional journalistic standards.
Through this methodical approach, ScoreRAG aims to significantly improve the
accuracy, coherence, informativeness, and professionalism of generated news
articles while maintaining stability and consistency throughout the generation
process. The code and demo are available at:

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant

deep integration of knowledge across related fields, which presents unique
challenges for MLLMs, particularly in linking abstract concepts with
corresponding visual representations. Addressing this gap, we present HSSBench,
a dedicated benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of MLLMs on HSS tasks

Abstract: LLMs have been extensively used for the task of automated code generation. In
this work, we examine the applicability of LLMs for the related but relatively
unexplored task of code-equivalence checking, i.e., given two programs, whether
they are functionally equivalent or not. This is an important problem since
benchmarking code equivalence can play a critical role in evaluating LLM
capabilities for tasks such as code re-writing and code translation. Towards
this end, we present CETBench - Code Equivalence with Transformations
Benchmark, constructed via a repository of programs, where two programs in the
repository may be solving the same or different tasks. Each instance in our
dataset is obtained by taking a pair of programs in the repository and applying
a random series of pre-defined code transformations, resulting in
(non-)equivalent pairs. Our analysis on this dataset reveals a surprising
finding that very simple code transformations in the underlying pair of
programs can result in a significant drop in performance of SOTA LLMs for the
task of code-equivalence checking. To remedy this, we present a simple
fine-tuning-based approach to boost LLM performance on the transformed pairs of
programs. Our approach for dataset generation is generic, and can be used with
repositories with varying program difficulty levels and allows for applying
varying numbers as well as kinds of transformations. In our experiments, we
perform ablations over the difficulty level of original programs, as well as
the kind of transformations used in generating pairs for equivalence checking.
Our analysis presents deep insights into the working of LLMs for the task of
code-equivalence, and points to the fact that they may still be far from what
could be termed as a semantic understanding of the underlying code.

Abstract: Multimodal foundation models have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
diverse tasks. However, their potential as plug-and-play solutions for missing
modality prediction remains underexplored. To investigate this, we categorize
existing approaches into three representative paradigms, encompassing a total
of 42 model variants, and conduct a comprehensive evaluation in terms of
prediction accuracy and adaptability to downstream tasks. Our analysis reveals
that current foundation models often fall short in two critical aspects: (i)
fine-grained semantic extraction from the available modalities, and (ii) robust
validation of generated modalities. These limitations lead to suboptimal and,
at times, misaligned predictions. To address these challenges, we propose an
agentic framework tailored for missing modality prediction. This framework
dynamically formulates modality-aware mining strategies based on the input
context, facilitating the extraction of richer and more discriminative semantic
features. In addition, we introduce a \textit{self-refinement mechanism}, which
iteratively verifies and enhances the quality of generated modalities through
internal feedback. Experimental results show that our method reduces FID for
missing image prediction by at least 14% and MER for missing text prediction by
at least 10% compared to baselines.

Abstract: Recent studies comparing AI-generated and human-authored literary texts have
produced conflicting results: some suggest AI already surpasses human quality,
while others argue it still falls short. We start from the hypothesis that such
divergences can be largely explained by genuine differences in how readers
interpret and value literature, rather than by an intrinsic quality of the
texts evaluated. Using five public datasets (1,471 stories, 101 annotators
including critics, students, and lay readers), we (i) extract 17 reference-less
textual features (e.g., coherence, emotional variance, average sentence
length...); (ii) model individual reader preferences, deriving feature
importance vectors that reflect their textual priorities; and (iii) analyze
these vectors in a shared "preference space". Reader vectors cluster into two
profiles: 'surface-focused readers' (mainly non-experts), who prioritize
readability and textual richness; and 'holistic readers' (mainly experts), who
value thematic development, rhetorical variety, and sentiment dynamics. Our
results quantitatively explain how measurements of literary quality are a
function of how text features align with each reader's preferences. These
findings advocate for reader-sensitive evaluation frameworks in the field of
creative text generation.

Motivation: 任务导向对话系统中，DRL在优化对话策略时难以平衡探索与利用，导致局部最优或收敛性差。EA的全局搜索能力为解决这一问题提供了可能。

Method: 结合EA的全局搜索和DRL的局部优化，并引入精英个体注入机制以提升EA的搜索效率。

Result: 在四个数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著改善了探索与利用的平衡，提升了性能，并减少了探索时间。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了EA与DRL的高效结合，适用于任务导向对话策略优化。

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is widely used in task-oriented dialogue
systems to optimize dialogue policy, but it struggles to balance exploration
and exploitation due to the high dimensionality of state and action spaces.
This challenge often results in local optima or poor convergence. Evolutionary
Algorithms (EAs) have been proven to effectively explore the solution space of
neural networks by maintaining population diversity. Inspired by this, we
innovatively combine the global search capabilities of EA with the local
optimization of DRL to achieve a balance between exploration and exploitation.
Nevertheless, the inherent flexibility of natural language in dialogue tasks
complicates this direct integration, leading to prolonged evolutionary times.
Thus, we further propose an elite individual injection mechanism to enhance
EA's search efficiency by adaptively introducing best-performing individuals
into the population. Experiments across four datasets show that our approach
significantly improves the balance between exploration and exploitation,
boosting performance. Moreover, the effectiveness of the EII mechanism in
reducing exploration time has been demonstrated, achieving an efficient
integration of EA and DRL on task-oriented dialogue policy tasks.

Motivation: 解决数字代理在陌生环境中缺乏理解能力的问题，例如网页浏览代理在不熟悉的网站中迷失方向。

Method: 将数据收集建模为图搜索问题，实现跨探索任务的信息重用，并在WebArena基准上实例化，收集了10K任务解决轨迹和40K交互步骤。

Result: 在7B参数语言模型上微调后，任务成功率达到21.7%，超过GPT-4o mini 2.4%，并在10B参数以下模型中领先2.9%。

Conclusion: Go-Browse通过高效数据收集方法显著提升了代理性能，为数字代理的环境理解提供了新思路。

Abstract: One of the fundamental problems in digital agents is their lack of
understanding of their environment. For instance, a web browsing agent may get
lost in unfamiliar websites, uncertain what pages must be visited to achieve
its goals. To address this, we propose Go-Browse, a method for automatically
collecting diverse and realistic web agent data at scale through structured
exploration of web environments. Go-Browse achieves efficient exploration by
framing data collection as a graph search, enabling reuse of information across
exploration episodes. We instantiate our method on the WebArena benchmark,
collecting a dataset of 10K successful task-solving trajectories and 40K
interaction steps across 100 URLs. Fine-tuning a 7B parameter language model on
this dataset achieves a success rate of 21.7% on the WebArena benchmark,
beating GPT-4o mini by 2.4% and exceeding current state-of-the-art results for
sub-10B parameter models by 2.9%.

Abstract: Providing example sentences that are diverse and aligned with learners'
proficiency levels is essential for fostering effective language acquisition.
This study examines the use of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) to produce
example sentences targeting L2 Japanese learners. We utilize PLMs in two ways:
as quality scoring components in a retrieval system that draws from a newly
curated corpus of Japanese sentences, and as direct sentence generators using
zero-shot learning. We evaluate the quality of sentences by considering
multiple aspects such as difficulty, diversity, and naturalness, with a panel
of raters consisting of learners of Japanese, native speakers -- and GPT-4. Our
findings suggest that there is inherent disagreement among participants on the
ratings of sentence qualities, except for difficulty. Despite that, the
retrieval approach was preferred by all evaluators, especially for beginner and
advanced target proficiency, while the generative approaches received lower
scores on average. Even so, our experiments highlight the potential for using
PLMs to enhance the adaptability of sentence suggestion systems and therefore

Attention, allowing each token to attend to infinite left-context and finite
right-context from the speech sequences. We also employ the wait-k decoding
strategy to simplify the decoding process while ensuring consistency between
training and testing. Our theoretical analysis and experiments demonstrate that
this approach achieves a controllable trade-off between latency and quality,

Result: Cadence在性能上超越现有技术，但对领域迁移和罕见标点符号仍存在挑战。

Conclusion: 预训练语言模型在多语言标点恢复中有效，Cadence对低资源NLP任务具有实用价值。

Abstract: Punctuation plays a vital role in structuring meaning, yet current models
often struggle to restore it accurately in transcripts of spontaneous speech,
especially in the presence of disfluencies such as false starts and
backtracking. These limitations hinder the performance of downstream tasks like
translation, text to speech, summarization, etc. where sentence boundaries are
critical for preserving quality. In this work, we introduce Cadence, a
generalist punctuation restoration model adapted from a pretrained large
language model. Cadence is designed to handle both clean written text and
highly spontaneous spoken transcripts. It surpasses the previous state of the
art in performance while expanding support from 14 to all 22 Indian languages
and English. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of model behavior across
punctuation types and language families, identifying persistent challenges
under domain shift and with rare punctuation marks. Our findings demonstrate
the efficacy of utilizing pretrained language models for multilingual
punctuation restoration and highlight Cadence practical value for low resource
NLP pipelines at scale.

Motivation: 现有方法（如LLava）处理长视频时会产生大量视觉令牌，导致计算负担过重。DynTok旨在通过压缩令牌数量解决这一问题。

Method: DynTok动态分组并合并视觉令牌，在低信息密度区域实现高压缩，同时保留关键内容。

Result: 令牌数量减少至44.4%，性能相当；在Video-MME和MLVU上分别达到65.3%和72.5%。

Conclusion: DynTok揭示了视频令牌表示的冗余性，为高效视频建模技术设计提供了启示。

Abstract: Typical video modeling methods, such as LLava, represent videos as sequences
of visual tokens, which are then processed by the LLM backbone for effective
video understanding. However, this approach leads to a massive number of visual
tokens, especially for long videos. A practical solution is to first extract
relevant visual information from the large visual context before feeding it
into the LLM backbone, thereby reducing computational overhead. In this work,
we introduce DynTok, a novel \textbf{Dyn}amic video \textbf{Tok}en compression
strategy. DynTok adaptively splits visual tokens into groups and merges them
within each group, achieving high compression in regions with low information
density while preserving essential content. Our method reduces the number of
tokens to 44.4% of the original size while maintaining comparable performance.
It further benefits from increasing the number of video frames and achieves
65.3% on Video-MME and 72.5% on MLVU. By applying this simple yet effective
compression method, we expose the redundancy in video token representations and
offer insights for designing more efficient video modeling techniques.

Result: LLM在法律事件排序上准确率更高（+10.5%），长上下文和隐式事件提升表现（80.8%），但法律语言复杂性仍是难点。

Conclusion: 需针对法律语言设计特定建模策略以提升LLM的时间事件推理能力。

Abstract: Temporal reasoning in legal texts is important for applications like case law
analysis and compliance monitoring. However, existing datasets lack expert
language evaluation, leaving a gap in understanding how LLMs manage event
ordering in legal contexts. We introduce LexTime, the first dataset designed to
evaluate LLMs' event ordering capabilities in legal language, consisting of 512
instances from U.S. Federal Complaints with annotated event pairs and their
temporal relations. Our findings show that (1) LLMs are more accurate on legal
event ordering than on narrative (up to +10.5%); (2) longer input contexts and
implicit events boost accuracy, reaching 80.8% for implicit-explicit event
pairs; (3) legal linguistic complexities and nested clauses remain a challenge.
We investigate how context length, explicit vs implicit event pairs, and legal
language features affect model performance, demonstrating the need for specific
modeling strategies to enhance temporal event reasoning.

Abstract: Rapid, fine-grained disaster damage assessment is essential for effective

We evaluate three foundation models across two major earthquake events using
both macro- and micro-level analyses. Results show that MLLMs effectively
integrate image-text signals and demonstrate a strong correlation with
ground-truth seismic data. However, performance varies with language,
epicentral distance, and input modality. This work highlights the potential of
MLLMs for disaster assessment and provides a foundation for future research in

results in transfer learning. Conversely, the improvement is lower when the
language comes from a culturally distinct country. Warning: This paper contains

Conclusion: 语言相关数据增强的有效性依赖于生成数据与训练分布的相似性。

Abstract: Data augmentation, a widely-employed technique for addressing data scarcity,
involves generating synthetic data examples which are then used to augment
available training data. Researchers have seen surprising success from simple
methods, such as random perturbations from natural examples, where models seem
to benefit even from data with nonsense words, or data that doesn't conform to
the rules of the language. A second line of research produces synthetic data
that does in fact follow all linguistic constraints; these methods require some
linguistic expertise and are generally more challenging to implement. No
previous work has done a systematic, empirical comparison of both
linguistically-naive and linguistically-motivated data augmentation strategies,
leaving uncertainty about whether the additional time and effort of
linguistically-motivated data augmentation work in fact yields better
downstream performance.
  In this work, we conduct a careful and comprehensive comparison of
augmentation strategies (both linguistically-naive and
linguistically-motivated) for two low-resource languages with different
morphological properties, Uspanteko and Arapaho. We evaluate the effectiveness
of many different strategies and their combinations across two important
sequence-to-sequence tasks for low-resource languages: machine translation and
interlinear glossing. We find that linguistically-motivated strategies can have
benefits over naive approaches, but only when the new examples they produce are
not significantly unlike the training data distribution.

Motivation: 现有VQA模型在处理视障用户拍摄的文本方向错误图像时表现不佳，缺乏相关基准。

Method: 提出ROSA解码策略，优化VQA模型对错误方向文本的处理。

Result: ROSA在最佳模型中比Greedy解码提升11.7个绝对点。

Conclusion: ROSA有效解决了视障用户VQA中的文本方向问题。

Abstract: Visually impaired people could benefit from Visual Question Answering (VQA)
systems to interpret text in their surroundings. However, current models often
struggle with recognizing text in the photos taken by this population. Through
in-depth interviews with visually impaired individuals, we identified common
framing conventions that frequently result in misaligned text. Existing VQA
benchmarks primarily feature well-oriented text captured by sighted users,
under-representing these challenges. To address this gap, we introduce ROtated
SAmpling (ROSA), a decoding strategy that enhances VQA performance in text-rich
images with incorrectly oriented text. ROSA outperforms Greedy decoding by 11.7
absolute points in the best-performing model.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained ASR models for specific domains is challenging for
small organizations with limited labeled data and computational resources.
Here, we explore different data selection pipelines and propose a robust
approach that improves ASR adaptation by filtering pseudo-labels generated
using Whisper (encoder-decoder) and Zipformer (transducer) models. Our approach
integrates multiple selection strategies -- including word error rate (WER)
prediction, named entity recognition (NER), and character error rate (CER)
analysis -- to extract high-quality training segments. We evaluate our method
on Whisper and Zipformer using a 7500-hour baseline, comparing it to a
CER-based approach relying on hypotheses from three ASR systems. Fine-tuning on
7500 hours of pseudo-labeled call center data achieves 12.3% WER, while our
filtering reduces the dataset to 100 hours (1.4%) with similar performance; a
similar trend is observed on Fisher English.

Conclusion: Math2Visual为多模态教育内容生成提供了新方法，同时揭示了数学关系错误表示和视觉元素遗漏等关键挑战。

Abstract: Visuals are valuable tools for teaching math word problems (MWPs), helping
young learners interpret textual descriptions into mathematical expressions
before solving them. However, creating such visuals is labor-intensive and
there is a lack of automated methods to support this process. In this paper, we
present Math2Visual, an automatic framework for generating pedagogically
meaningful visuals from MWP text descriptions. Math2Visual leverages a
pre-defined visual language and a design space grounded in interviews with math
teachers, to illustrate the core mathematical relationships in MWPs. Using
Math2Visual, we construct an annotated dataset of 1,903 visuals and evaluate
Text-to-Image (TTI) models for their ability to generate visuals that align
with our design. We further fine-tune several TTI models with our dataset,
demonstrating improvements in educational visual generation. Our work
establishes a new benchmark for automated generation of pedagogically
meaningful visuals and offers insights into key challenges in producing
multimodal educational content, such as the misrepresentation of mathematical
relationships and the omission of essential visual elements.

Abstract: Hausa texts are often characterized by writing anomalies such as incorrect

automatically correct the anomalies by finetuning transformer-based models.
Using a corpus gathered from several public sources, we created a large-scale
parallel dataset of over 450,000 noisy-clean Hausa sentence pairs by
introducing synthetically generated noise, fine-tuned to mimic realistic
writing errors. Moreover, we adapted several multilingual and African
language-focused models, including M2M100, AfriTEVA, mBART, and Opus-MT
variants for this correction task using SentencePiece tokenization. Our
experimental results demonstrate significant increases in F1, BLEU and METEOR
scores, as well as reductions in Character Error Rate (CER) and Word Error Rate

Conclusion: MoBGM在提升广告召回效果和平台收益方面具有可行性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Retrieval systems primarily address the challenge of matching user queries
with the most relevant advertisements, playing a crucial role in e-commerce
search advertising. The diversity of user needs and expressions often produces
massive long-tail queries that cannot be matched with merchant bidwords or
product titles, which results in some advertisements not being recalled,
ultimately harming user experience and search efficiency. Existing query
rewriting research focuses on various methods such as query log mining,
query-bidword vector matching, or generation-based rewriting. However, these
methods often fail to simultaneously optimize the relevance and authenticity of
the user's original query and rewrite and maximize the revenue potential of
recalled ads.
  In this paper, we propose a Multi-objective aligned Bidword Generation Model
(MoBGM), which is composed of a discriminator, generator, and preference
alignment module, to address these challenges. To simultaneously improve the
relevance and authenticity of the query and rewrite and maximize the platform
revenue, we design a discriminator to optimize these key objectives. Using the
feedback signal of the discriminator, we train a multi-objective aligned
bidword generator that aims to maximize the combined effect of the three
objectives. Extensive offline and online experiments show that our proposed
algorithm significantly outperforms the state of the art. After deployment, the
algorithm has created huge commercial value for the platform, further verifying
its feasibility and robustness.

Conclusion: 脑调优不仅提升性能，还使模型层次更接近人类语音处理，成为更好的研究工具。

Abstract: Pretrained self-supervised speech models excel in speech tasks but do not
reflect the hierarchy of human speech processing, as they encode rich semantics
in middle layers and poor semantics in late layers. Recent work showed that
brain-tuning (fine-tuning models using human brain recordings) improves speech
models' semantic understanding. Here, we examine how well brain-tuned models
further reflect the brain's intermediate stages of speech processing. We find
that late layers of brain-tuned models substantially improve over pretrained
models in their alignment with semantic language regions. Further layer-wise
probing reveals that early layers remain dedicated to low-level acoustic
features, while late layers become the best at complex high-level tasks. These
findings show that brain-tuned models not only perform better but also exhibit
a well-defined hierarchical processing going from acoustic to semantic
representations, making them better model organisms for human speech
processing.

zero-shot synthesis, particularly for languages whose scripts and phonotactics
come from different families. The novelty of our work is in the augmentation of
a shared phone representation and modifying the text parsing rules to match the
phonotactics of the target language, thus reducing the synthesiser overhead and
enabling rapid adaptation. Intelligible and natural speech was generated for

Conclusion: 研究为语言信息密度的周期性提供了证据，并提出了一个通用的分析框架。

Abstract: The uniform information density (UID) hypothesis proposes that speakers aim
to distribute information evenly throughout a text, balancing production effort
and listener comprehension difficulty. However, language typically does not
maintain a strictly uniform information rate; instead, it fluctuates around a
global average. These fluctuations are often explained by factors such as
syntactic constraints, stylistic choices, or audience design. In this work, we
explore an alternative perspective: that these fluctuations may be influenced
by an implicit linguistic pressure towards periodicity, where the information
rate oscillates at regular intervals, potentially across multiple frequencies
simultaneously. We apply harmonic regression and introduce a novel extension
called time scaling to detect and test for such periodicity in information
contours. Analyzing texts in English, Spanish, German, Dutch, Basque, and
Brazilian Portuguese, we find consistent evidence of periodic patterns in
information rate. Many dominant frequencies align with discourse structure,
suggesting these oscillations reflect meaningful linguistic organization.
Beyond highlighting the connection between information rate and discourse
structure, our approach offers a general framework for uncovering structural
pressures at various levels of linguistic granularity.

Abstract: Legal decisions are increasingly evaluated for fairness, consistency, and
bias using machine learning (ML) techniques. In high-stakes domains like
refugee adjudication, such methods are often applied to detect disparities in
outcomes. Yet it remains unclear whether statistical methods can meaningfully
assess fairness in legal contexts shaped by discretion, normative complexity,
and limited ground truth.
  In this paper, we empirically evaluate three common ML approaches
(feature-based analysis, semantic clustering, and predictive modeling) on a
large, real-world dataset of 59,000+ Canadian refugee decisions (AsyLex). Our
experiments show that these methods produce divergent and sometimes
contradictory signals, that predictive modeling often depends on contextual and
procedural features rather than legal features, and that semantic clustering
fails to capture substantive legal reasoning.
  We show limitations of statistical fairness evaluation, challenge the
assumption that statistical regularity equates to fairness, and argue that
current computational approaches fall short of evaluating fairness in legally
discretionary domains. We argue that evaluating fairness in law requires
methods grounded not only in data, but in legal reasoning and institutional
context.

Abstract: Hate speech detection is key to online content moderation, but current models
struggle to generalise beyond their training data. This has been linked to
dataset biases and the use of sentence-level labels, which fail to teach models
the underlying structure of hate speech. In this work, we show that even when
models are trained with more fine-grained, span-level annotations (e.g.,
"artists" is labeled as target and "are parasites" as dehumanising comparison),
they struggle to disentangle the meaning of these labels from the surrounding
context. As a result, combinations of expressions that deviate from those seen
during training remain particularly difficult for models to detect. We
investigate whether training on a dataset where expressions occur with equal
frequency across all contexts can improve generalisation. To this end, we
create U-PLEAD, a dataset of ~364,000 synthetic posts, along with a novel
compositional generalisation benchmark of ~8,000 manually validated posts.
Training on a combination of U-PLEAD and real data improves compositional
generalisation while achieving state-of-the-art performance on the
human-sourced PLEAD.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效识别关键对话时刻，并可用于分析咨询师反应对最终结果的影响。

Abstract: During a conversation, there can come certain moments where its outcome hangs
in the balance. In these pivotal moments, how one responds can put the
conversation on substantially different trajectories leading to significantly
different outcomes. Systems that can detect when such moments arise could
assist conversationalists in domains with highly consequential outcomes, such
as mental health crisis counseling.
  In this work, we introduce an unsupervised computational method for detecting
such pivotal moments as they happen, in an online fashion. Our approach relies
on the intuition that a moment is pivotal if our expectation of the outcome
varies widely depending on what might be said next. By applying our method to
crisis counseling conversations, we first validate it by showing that it aligns
with human perception -- counselors take significantly longer to respond during
moments detected by our method -- and with the eventual conversational
trajectory -- which is more likely to change course at these times. We then use
our framework to explore the relation of the counselor's response during
pivotal moments with the eventual outcome of the session.

Abstract: Turn-taking management is crucial for any social interaction. Still, it is
challenging to model human-machine interaction due to the complexity of the
social context and its multimodal nature. Unlike conventional systems based on
silence duration, previous existing voice activity projection (VAP) models
successfully utilized a unified representation of turn-taking behaviors as
prediction targets, which improved turn-taking prediction performance.
Recently, a multimodal VAP model outperformed the previous state-of-the-art
model by a significant margin. In this paper, we propose a multimodal model
enhanced with pre-trained audio and face encoders to improve performance by
capturing subtle expressions. Our model performed competitively, and in some
cases, even better than state-of-the-art models on turn-taking metrics. All the

Abstract: Review-based Product Question Answering (PQA) allows e-commerce platforms to
automatically address customer queries by leveraging insights from user
reviews. However, existing PQA systems generate answers with only a single
perspective, failing to capture the diversity of customer opinions. In this
paper we introduce a novel task Quantitative Query-Focused Summarization
(QQSUM), which aims to summarize diverse customer opinions into representative
Key Points (KPs) and quantify their prevalence to effectively answer user
queries. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) shows promise for PQA, its
generated answers still fall short of capturing the full diversity of
viewpoints. To tackle this challenge, our model QQSUM-RAG, which extends RAG,
employs few-shot learning to jointly train a KP-oriented retriever and a KP
summary generator, enabling KP-based summaries that capture diverse and
representative opinions. Experimental results demonstrate that QQSUM-RAG
achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art RAG baselines in
both textual quality and quantification accuracy of opinions. Our source code

Abstract: Background: We present a Patient Simulator that leverages real world patient
encounters which cover a broad range of conditions and symptoms to provide
synthetic test subjects for development and testing of healthcare agentic
models. The simulator provides a realistic approach to patient presentation and
multi-turn conversation with a symptom-checking agent. Objectives: (1) To
construct and instantiate a Patient Simulator to train and test an AI health
agent, based on patient vignettes derived from real EHR data. (2) To test the
validity and alignment of the simulated encounters provided by the Patient
Simulator to expert human clinical providers. (3) To illustrate the evaluation
framework of such an LLM system on the generated realistic, data-driven
simulations -- yielding a preliminary assessment of our proposed system.
Methods: We first constructed realistic clinical scenarios by deriving patient
vignettes from real-world EHR encounters. These vignettes cover a variety of
presenting symptoms and underlying conditions. We then evaluate the performance
of the Patient Simulator as a simulacrum of a real patient encounter across
over 500 different patient vignettes. We leveraged a separate AI agent to
provide multi-turn questions to obtain a history of present illness. The
resulting multiturn conversations were evaluated by two expert clinicians.
Results: Clinicians scored the Patient Simulator as consistent with the patient
vignettes in those same 97.7% of cases. The extracted case summary based on the
conversation history was 99% relevant. Conclusions: We developed a methodology
to incorporate vignettes derived from real healthcare patient data to build a
simulation of patient responses to symptom checking agents. The performance and
alignment of this Patient Simulator could be used to train and test a
multi-turn conversational AI agent at scale.

Result: 双语模型的ME偏见较弱，视觉嵌入方差较小，导致新概念与熟悉概念的混淆增加。

Conclusion: 双语模型的ME偏见较弱，部分原因是视觉嵌入的方差较小，为理解ME偏见的起源提供了新视角。

Abstract: Mutual exclusivity (ME) is a strategy where a novel word is associated with a
novel object rather than a familiar one, facilitating language learning in
children. Recent work has found an ME bias in a visually grounded speech (VGS)
model trained on English speech with paired images. But ME has also been
studied in bilingual children, who may employ it less due to cross-lingual
ambiguity. We explore this pattern computationally using bilingual VGS models
trained on combinations of English, French, and Dutch. We find that bilingual
models generally exhibit a weaker ME bias than monolingual models, though
exceptions exist. Analyses show that the combined visual embeddings of
bilingual models have a smaller variance for familiar data, partly explaining
the increase in confusion between novel and familiar concepts. We also provide
new insights into why the ME bias exists in VGS models in the first place. Code

Motivation: 为视障用户生成精确、实用的导航指令是一个重要但研究较少的领域，需要减少对昂贵真实数据的依赖。

Method: 提出LaF-GRPO方法，通过LLM模拟用户响应生成奖励，指导VLM后训练，并引入NIG4VI基准支持训练与测试。

Result: 实验显示LaF-GRPO显著提升指令质量（如BLEU +14%），生成更直观、安全的指令。

Conclusion: LaF-GRPO有效提升导航指令生成质量，NIG4VI基准为未来研究提供支持。

Abstract: Navigation instruction generation for visually impaired (VI) individuals
(NIG-VI) is critical yet relatively underexplored. This study, hence, focuses
on producing precise, in-situ, step-by-step navigation instructions that are
practically usable by VI users. Concretely, we propose LaF-GRPO
(LLM-as-Follower GRPO), where an LLM simulates VI user responses to generate
rewards guiding the Vision-Language Model (VLM) post-training. This enhances
instruction usability while reducing costly real-world data needs. To
facilitate training and testing, we introduce NIG4VI, a 27k-sample open-sourced
benchmark. It provides diverse navigation scenarios with accurate spatial
coordinates, supporting detailed, open-ended in-situ instruction generation.
Experiments on NIG4VI show the effectiveness of LaF-GRPO by quantitative
metrics (e.g., Zero-(LaF-GRPO) boosts BLEU +14\%; SFT+(LaF-GRPO) METEOR 0.542
vs. GPT-4o's 0.323) and yields more intuitive, safer instructions. Code and

TL;DR: 论文研究了如何通过改进Whisper模型的微调方法（使用LoRA）和标注方案（Pure、Rich、Extra）来提升自动语音识别（ASR）在非母语（L2）语音转录中的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ASR系统在处理犹豫和填充词时往往丢失重要声学细节，影响转录准确性，尤其是在非母语语音评估中。

Method: 使用低秩适应（LoRA）微调Whisper模型，比较三种标注方案（Pure、Rich、Extra），并利用Gemini 2.0 Flash生成精确的填充词标签。

Result: 采用Extra标注方案的Whisper Large V3 Turbo模型在WER上相对Pure方案提升了11.3%（5.5% vs 6.2%）。

Conclusion: 精确的填充词标注显著提升了ASR在非母语语音转录中的准确性。

Abstract: Verbatim transcription for automatic speaking assessment demands accurate
capture of disfluencies, crucial for downstream tasks like error analysis and
feedback. However, many ASR systems discard or generalize hesitations, losing
important acoustic details. We fine-tune Whisper models on the Speak & Improve
2025 corpus using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), without recourse to external
audio training data. We compare three annotation schemes: removing hesitations
(Pure), generic tags (Rich), and acoustically precise fillers inferred by
Gemini 2.0 Flash from existing audio-transcript pairs (Extra). Our challenge
system achieved 6.47% WER (Pure) and 5.81% WER (Extra). Post-challenge
experiments reveal that fine-tuning Whisper Large V3 Turbo with the "Extra"
scheme yielded a 5.5% WER, an 11.3% relative improvement over the "Pure" scheme
(6.2% WER). This demonstrates that explicit, realistic filled-pause labeling
significantly enhances ASR accuracy for verbatim L2 speech transcription.

Result: 在LTTC数据集上，该方法优于依赖真实数据或传统增强的方法，有效缓解了低资源限制。

Conclusion: 该方法通过跨模态信息实现了对意见表达的有效ASA。

Abstract: Automated speaking assessment (ASA) on opinion expressions is often hampered
by the scarcity of labeled recordings, which restricts prompt diversity and
undermines scoring reliability. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
training paradigm that leverages a large language models (LLM) to generate
diverse responses of a given proficiency level, converts responses into
synthesized speech via speaker-aware text-to-speech synthesis, and employs a
dynamic importance loss to adaptively reweight training instances based on
feature distribution differences between synthesized and real speech.
Subsequently, a multimodal large language model integrates aligned textual
features with speech signals to predict proficiency scores directly.
Experiments conducted on the LTTC dataset show that our approach outperforms
methods relying on real data or conventional augmentation, effectively
mitigating low-resource constraints and enabling ASA on opinion expressions
with cross-modal information.

Abstract: Courtrooms are places where lives are determined and fates are sealed, yet
they are not impervious to manipulation. Strategic use of manipulation in legal
jargon can sway the opinions of judges and affect the decisions. Despite the
growing advancements in NLP, its application in detecting and analyzing
manipulation within the legal domain remains largely unexplored. Our work
addresses this gap by introducing LegalCon, a dataset of 1,063 annotated
courtroom conversations labeled for manipulation detection, identification of
primary manipulators, and classification of manipulative techniques, with a
focus on long conversations. Furthermore, we propose CLAIM, a two-stage,
Intent-driven Multi-agent framework designed to enhance manipulation analysis
by enabling context-aware and informed decision-making. Our results highlight
the potential of incorporating agentic frameworks to improve fairness and
transparency in judicial processes. We hope that this contributes to the
broader application of NLP in legal discourse analysis and the development of
robust tools to support fairness in legal decision-making. Our code and data

Method: 通过分析25,000条荷兰语叙述及其自评效价分数，比较三种荷兰语LLMs与传统工具LIWC和Pattern的表现。

Result: 荷兰语LLMs在捕捉情感效价方面表现不佳，落后于传统工具。

Conclusion: 需开发针对低资源语言的定制模型和数据集，以提升情感分析的准确性。

Abstract: Understanding the nuances in everyday language is pivotal for advancements in
computational linguistics & emotions research. Traditional lexicon-based tools
such as LIWC and Pattern have long served as foundational instruments in this
domain. LIWC is the most extensively validated word count based text analysis
tool in the social sciences and Pattern is an open source Python library
offering functionalities for NLP. However, everyday language is inherently
spontaneous, richly expressive, & deeply context dependent. To explore the
capabilities of LLMs in capturing the valences of daily narratives in Flemish,
we first conducted a study involving approximately 25,000 textual responses
from 102 Dutch-speaking participants. Each participant provided narratives
prompted by the question, "What is happening right now and how do you feel
about it?", accompanied by self-assessed valence ratings on a continuous scale
from -50 to +50. We then assessed the performance of three Dutch-specific LLMs
in predicting these valence scores, and compared their outputs to those
generated by LIWC and Pattern. Our findings indicate that, despite advancements
in LLM architectures, these Dutch tuned models currently fall short in
accurately capturing the emotional valence present in spontaneous, real-world
narratives. This study underscores the imperative for developing culturally and
linguistically tailored models/tools that can adeptly handle the complexities
of natural language use. Enhancing automated valence analysis is not only
pivotal for advancing computational methodologies but also holds significant
promise for psychological research with ecologically valid insights into human
daily experiences. We advocate for increased efforts in creating comprehensive
datasets & finetuning LLMs for low-resource languages like Flemish, aiming to
bridge the gap between computational linguistics & emotion research.

Abstract: Patients have distinct information needs about their hospitalization that can
be addressed using clinical evidence from electronic health records (EHRs).
While artificial intelligence (AI) systems show promise in meeting these needs,
robust datasets are needed to evaluate the factual accuracy and relevance of
AI-generated responses. To our knowledge, no existing dataset captures patient
information needs in the context of their EHRs. We introduce ArchEHR-QA, an
expert-annotated dataset based on real-world patient cases from intensive care
unit and emergency department settings. The cases comprise questions posed by
patients to public health forums, clinician-interpreted counterparts, relevant
clinical note excerpts with sentence-level relevance annotations, and
clinician-authored answers. To establish benchmarks for grounded EHR question
answering (QA), we evaluated three open-weight large language models
(LLMs)--Llama 4, Llama 3, and Mixtral--across three prompting strategies:
generating (1) answers with citations to clinical note sentences, (2) answers
before citations, and (3) answers from filtered citations. We assessed
performance on two dimensions: Factuality (overlap between cited note sentences
and ground truth) and Relevance (textual and semantic similarity between system
and reference answers). The final dataset contains 134 patient cases. The
answer-first prompting approach consistently performed best, with Llama 4
achieving the highest scores. Manual error analysis supported these findings
and revealed common issues such as omitted key clinical evidence and
contradictory or hallucinated content. Overall, ArchEHR-QA provides a strong
benchmark for developing and evaluating patient-centered EHR QA systems,
underscoring the need for further progress toward generating factual and
relevant responses in clinical contexts.

Method: 提出ComRoPE，通过定义可训练的交换角度矩阵来推广RoPE，并证明了这些矩阵的成对交换性对RoPE的可扩展性和位置鲁棒性至关重要。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K数据集上，ComRoPE在训练分辨率和高分辨率下分别比当前最佳方法提升了1.6%和2.9%。

Conclusion: ComRoPE不仅改进了RoPE的性能，还为未来的位置编码研究提供了新的思路。

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has revolutionized various regions since it was
proposed, and its effectiveness largely depends on the ability to encode
positional information. Traditional position encoding methods exhibit
significant limitations due to lack of robustness and flexibility of position.
Therefore, Rotary Positional Encoding (RoPE) was proposed to alleviate these
issues, which integrates positional information by rotating the embeddings in
the attention mechanism. However, RoPE requires manually defined rotation
matrices with limited transformation space, constraining the model's capacity.
In this work, we propose ComRoPE, which generalizes RoPE by defining it in
terms of trainable commuting angle matrices. Specifically, we demonstrate that
pairwise commutativity of these matrices is essential for RoPE to achieve
scalability and positional robustness. We formally define the RoPE Equation,
which is an essential condition that ensures consistent performance with
position offsets. Based on the theoretical analysis, we present two types of
trainable commuting angle matrices as sufficient solutions to the RoPE
equation, which significantly improve performance, surpassing the current
state-of-the-art method by 1.6% at training resolution and 2.9% at higher
resolution on the ImageNet-1K dataset. Furthermore, our framework shows
versatility in generalizing to existing RoPE formulations and offering new
insights for future positional encoding research. To ensure reproducibility,

Result: 在多个多模态基准测试中，UTAMoE显著缓解了任务冲突，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: UTAMoE通过解耦和任务感知优化，有效解决了MLLMs中的任务目标冲突，为多模态任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Unified multimodal large language models (MLLMs) based on end-to-end
autoregressive (AR) transformers effectively integrate both understanding and
generation tasks within a single framework. However, intrinsic Task Objective
Conflicts between high-level semantic abstraction in understanding and
fine-grained detail preservation in generation pose significant challenges,
often leading to suboptimal trade-offs and task interference. Existing
solutions, such as decoupling shared visual encoders, fall short of
fundamentally resolving these conflicts due to inherent AR architecture. In
this paper, we propose a novel approach that decouples internal components of
AR to resolve task objective conflicts. Specifically, we design UTAMoE, a
Unified Task-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that decouples internal
AR modules via a Task-Aware MoE Layer to create task-specific optimization
subpaths. To enhance task differentiation while maintaining overall
coordination, we introduce a novel Two-Stage Training Strategy. Extensive
experiments on multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that UTAMoE mitigates task
objective conflicts, achieving state-of-the-art performance across various
tasks. Visualizations and ablation studies further validate the effectiveness
of our approach.

Conclusion: Vision Remember有效解决了视觉信息压缩问题，提升了多模态大语言模型在细粒度任务中的性能。

Abstract: In this work, we study the Efficient Multimodal Large Language Model.
Redundant vision tokens consume a significant amount of computational memory
and resources. Therefore, many previous works compress them in the Vision
Projector to reduce the number of vision tokens. However, simply compressing in
the Vision Projector can lead to the loss of visual information, especially for
tasks that rely on fine-grained spatial relationships, such as OCR and Chart \&
Table Understanding. To address this problem, we propose Vision Remember, which
is inserted between the LLM decoder layers to allow vision tokens to
re-memorize vision features. Specifically, we retain multi-level vision
features and resample them with the vision tokens that have interacted with the
text token. During the resampling process, each vision token only attends to a
local region in vision features, which is referred to as saliency-enhancing
local attention. Saliency-enhancing local attention not only improves
computational efficiency but also captures more fine-grained contextual
information and spatial relationships within the region. Comprehensive
experiments on multiple visual understanding benchmarks validate the
effectiveness of our method when combined with various Efficient Vision
Projectors, showing performance gains without sacrificing efficiency. Based on
Vision Remember, LLaVA-VR with only 2B parameters is also superior to previous
representative MLLMs such as Tokenpacker-HD-7B and DeepSeek-VL-7B.

Conclusion: EMPO通过改进模态对齐和利用开源数据，有效减少LVLM的幻觉问题。

Abstract: Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across multiple tasks. However, their trustworthiness is often
challenged by hallucinations, which can be attributed to the modality
misalignment and the inherent hallucinations of their underlying Large Language
Models (LLMs) backbone. Existing preference alignment methods focus on aligning
model responses with human preferences while neglecting image-text modality
alignment, resulting in over-reliance on LLMs and hallucinations. In this
paper, we propose Entity-centric Multimodal Preference Optimization (EMPO),
which achieves enhanced modality alignment than existing human preference
alignment methods. Besides, to overcome the scarcity of high-quality multimodal
preference data, we utilize open-source instruction datasets to automatically
construct high-quality preference data across three aspects: image,
instruction, and response. Experiments on two human preference datasets and
five multimodal hallucination benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of EMPO,
e.g., reducing hallucination rates by 85.9% on Object-HalBench and 49.8% on

Result: Chipmunk在HunyuanVideo和FLUX.1-dev上分别实现2.16x和1.41x加速，叠加全步缓存后可达3.72x加速。

Conclusion: Chipmunk显著提升DiTs推理效率，适用于高质量生成任务。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in
high-quality image and video generation but incur substantial compute cost at
inference. A common observation is that DiT latent noise vectors change slowly
across inference steps, which suggests that the DiT compute may be redundant
across steps. In this paper, we aim to speed up inference by reducing this
redundancy, without additional training. We first study how activations change
between steps in two state-of-the-art open-source DiTs. We find that just 5-25%
of the values in attention and MLP explain 70-90% of the change in activations
across steps. This finding motivates our approach, Chipmunk, which uses dynamic
sparsity at inference time to recompute only the fastest-changing intermediate
activations, while caching the rest. Dynamic sparsity introduces two systems
challenges: (1) sparse attention and MLP operations tend to underutilize GPU
tensor cores; and (2) computing dynamic sparsity patterns at runtime and
caching activations both introduce overhead. To address these challenges,
Chipmunk first uses a voxel-based reordering of input tokens to introduce
column-wise sparsity. We implement column-sparse kernels utilizing efficient
sparse gathers from global to shared GPU memory, achieving a 9.3x speedup at
93% sparsity compared to highly-optimized dense baselines. Second, Chipmunk
overlaps the computation of sparsity patterns and cache updates with other
parts of the computation (e.g., second layer of the MLP) to hide the extra
latency. Chipmunk achieves up to 2.16x speedup on HunyuanVideo and 1.41x on
FLUX.1-dev without compromising generation quality. Furthermore, we show that
Chipmunk can be stacked on top of full step caching, achieving a 3.72x speedup
on HunyuanVideo, a 2.67x speedup on WAN2.1, and a 2.25x speedup on FLUX.1-dev
with minimal quality impact.

TL;DR: 论文研究了视觉语言模型（VLMs）中的视觉拼接能力，展示了如何通过分散训练数据中的有害图像片段绕过数据审核，导致模型在推理时生成有害响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨VLMs中视觉拼接能力的潜在风险，揭示数据审核的漏洞及其对模型安全性的威胁。

Method: 在三个数据集上测试开源VLMs的视觉拼接能力，通过将图像分割为小块并标记为不同ID进行微调，模拟对抗性数据中毒场景。

Result: 实验表明，VLMs能够通过视觉拼接整合分散的有害图像片段，生成有害响应，验证了数据审核的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 视觉拼接能力可能导致VLMs绕过数据审核，带来严重的安全风险，需进一步研究防御措施。

Abstract: One way to mitigate risks in vision-language models (VLMs) is to remove
dangerous samples in their training data. However, such data moderation can be
easily bypassed when harmful images are split into small, benign-looking
patches, scattered across many training samples. VLMs may then learn to piece
these fragments together during training and generate harmful responses at
inference, either from full images or text references. For instance, if trained
on image patches from a bloody scene paired with the descriptions "safe," VLMs
may later describe, the full image or a text reference to the scene, as "safe."
We define the core ability of VLMs enabling this attack as $\textit{visual
stitching}$ -- the ability to integrate visual information spread across
multiple training samples that share the same textual descriptions. In our
work, we first demonstrate visual stitching abilities in common open-source
VLMs on three datasets where each image is labeled with a unique synthetic ID:
we split each $(\texttt{image}, \texttt{ID})$ pair into $\{(\texttt{patch},
\texttt{ID})\}$ pairs at different granularity for finetuning, and we find that
tuned models can verbalize the correct IDs from full images or text reference.
Building on this, we simulate the adversarial data poisoning scenario mentioned
above by using patches from dangerous images and replacing IDs with text
descriptions like ``safe'' or ``unsafe'', demonstrating how harmful content can
evade moderation in patches and later be reconstructed through visual
stitching, posing serious VLM safety risks. Code is available at

Conclusion: DiffCAP为VLMs在对抗环境中的安全部署提供了实用且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in
multimodal understanding, yet their susceptibility to perturbations poses a
significant threat to their reliability in real-world applications. Despite
often being imperceptible to humans, these perturbations can drastically alter
model outputs, leading to erroneous interpretations and decisions. This paper
introduces DiffCAP, a novel diffusion-based purification strategy that can
effectively neutralize adversarial corruptions in VLMs. We observe that adding
minimal noise to an adversarially corrupted image significantly alters its
latent embedding with respect to VLMs. Building on this insight, DiffCAP
cumulatively injects random Gaussian noise into adversarially perturbed input
data. This process continues until the embeddings of two consecutive noisy
images reach a predefined similarity threshold, indicating a potential approach
to neutralize the adversarial effect. Subsequently, a pretrained diffusion
model is employed to denoise the stabilized image, recovering a clean
representation suitable for the VLMs to produce an output. Through extensive
experiments across six datasets with three VLMs under varying attack strengths
in three task scenarios, we show that DiffCAP consistently outperforms existing
defense techniques by a substantial margin. Notably, DiffCAP significantly
reduces both hyperparameter tuning complexity and the required diffusion time,
thereby accelerating the denoising process. Equipped with strong theoretical
and empirical support, DiffCAP provides a robust and practical solution for
securely deploying VLMs in adversarial environments.

Motivation: 现有视频基准测试主要关注理解任务，缺乏对多帧证据定位和多模态推理能力的评估，因此需要新的基准测试。

Method: 设计了MMR-V基准测试，包含长距离多帧推理、超越感知的问题、可靠性和混淆性四个特征，并基于317个视频和1,257个任务进行实验。

Conclusion: MMR-V揭示了多模态推理的挑战，并呼吁进一步研究提升模型能力。

Abstract: The sequential structure of videos poses a challenge to the ability of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to locate multi-frame evidence and
conduct multimodal reasoning. However, existing video benchmarks mainly focus
on understanding tasks, which only require models to match frames mentioned in
the question (hereafter referred to as "question frame") and perceive a few
adjacent frames. To address this gap, we propose MMR-V: A Benchmark for
Multimodal Deep Reasoning in Videos. The benchmark is characterized by the
following features. (1) Long-range, multi-frame reasoning: Models are required
to infer and analyze evidence frames that may be far from the question frame.
(2) Beyond perception: Questions cannot be answered through direct perception
alone but require reasoning over hidden information. (3) Reliability: All tasks
are manually annotated, referencing extensive real-world user understanding to
align with common perceptions. (4) Confusability: Carefully designed distractor
annotation strategies to reduce model shortcuts. MMR-V consists of 317 videos
and 1,257 tasks. Our experiments reveal that current models still struggle with
multi-modal reasoning; even the best-performing model, o4-mini, achieves only
52.5% accuracy. Additionally, current reasoning enhancement strategies
(Chain-of-Thought and scaling test-time compute) bring limited gains. Further
analysis indicates that the CoT demanded for multi-modal reasoning differs from
it in textual reasoning, which partly explains the limited performance gains.
We hope that MMR-V can inspire further research into enhancing multi-modal
reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: LIFT为探索LLM文本嵌入如何指导视觉学习提供了初步尝试，并提出了语言对齐视觉表示的新设计选择。

Abstract: Currently, the most dominant approach to establishing language-image
alignment is to pre-train text and image encoders jointly through contrastive
learning, such as CLIP and its variants. In this work, we question whether such
a costly joint training is necessary. In particular, we investigate if a
pre-trained fixed large language model (LLM) offers a good enough text encoder
to guide visual representation learning. That is, we propose to learn
Language-Image alignment with a Fixed Text encoder (LIFT) from an LLM by
training only the image encoder. Somewhat surprisingly, through comprehensive
benchmarking and ablation studies, we find that this much simplified framework
LIFT is highly effective and it outperforms CLIP in most scenarios that involve
compositional understanding and long captions, while achieving considerable
gains in computational efficiency. Our work takes a first step towards
systematically exploring how text embeddings from LLMs can guide visual
learning and suggests an alternative design choice for learning
language-aligned visual representations.

Abstract: Unlocking spatial reasoning in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) is crucial for
enabling intelligent interaction with 3D environments. While prior efforts
often rely on explicit 3D inputs or specialized model architectures, we ask:
can LMMs reason about 3D space using only structured 2D representations derived
from perception? We introduce Struct2D, a perception-guided prompting framework
that combines bird's-eye-view (BEV) images with object marks and object-centric
metadata, optionally incorporating egocentric keyframes when needed. Using
Struct2D, we conduct an in-depth zero-shot analysis of closed-source LMMs
(e.g., GPT-o3) and find that they exhibit surprisingly strong spatial reasoning
abilities when provided with structured 2D inputs, effectively handling tasks
such as relative direction estimation and route planning. Building on these
insights, we construct Struct2D-Set, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset
with 200K fine-grained QA pairs across eight spatial reasoning categories,
generated automatically from 3D indoor scenes. We fine-tune an open-source LMM
(Qwen2.5VL) on Struct2D-Set, achieving competitive performance on multiple
benchmarks, including 3D question answering, dense captioning, and object
grounding. Our approach demonstrates that structured 2D inputs can effectively
bridge perception and language reasoning in LMMs-without requiring explicit 3D
representations as input. We will release both our code and dataset to support
future research.

Conclusion: Vid-SME是首个针对视频数据的成员推理方法，解决了隐私保护的关键挑战。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities
in handling complex multimodal tasks and are increasingly adopted in video
understanding applications. However, their rapid advancement raises serious
data privacy concerns, particularly given the potential inclusion of sensitive
video content, such as personal recordings and surveillance footage, in their
training datasets. Determining improperly used videos during training remains a
critical and unresolved challenge. Despite considerable progress on membership
inference attacks (MIAs) for text and image data in MLLMs, existing methods
fail to generalize effectively to the video domain. These methods suffer from
poor scalability as more frames are sampled and generally achieve negligible
true positive rates at low false positive rates (TPR@Low FPR), mainly due to
their failure to capture the inherent temporal variations of video frames and
to account for model behavior differences as the number of frames varies. To
address these challenges, we introduce Vid-SME, the first membership inference
method tailored for video data used in video understanding LLMs (VULLMs).
Vid-SME leverages the confidence of model output and integrates adaptive
parameterization to compute Sharma-Mittal entropy (SME) for video inputs. By
leveraging the SME difference between natural and temporally-reversed video
frames, Vid-SME derives robust membership scores to determine whether a given
video is part of the model's training set. Experiments on various self-trained
and open-sourced VULLMs demonstrate the strong effectiveness of Vid-SME.

Abstract: Despite Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) showing promising results on
general zero-shot image classification tasks, fine-grained image classification
remains challenging. It demands precise attention to subtle visual details to
distinguish between visually similar subcategories--details that MLLMs may
easily overlook without explicit guidance. To address this, we introduce
AutoSEP, an iterative self-supervised prompt learning framework designed to
enhance MLLM fine-grained classification capabilities in a fully unsupervised
manner. Our core idea is to leverage unlabeled data to learn a description
prompt that guides MLLMs in identifying crucial discriminative features within
an image, and boosts classification accuracy. We developed an automatic
self-enhancing prompt learning framework called AutoSEP to iteratively improve
the description prompt using unlabeled data, based on instance-level
classification scoring function. AutoSEP only requires black-box access to
MLLMs, eliminating the need for any training or fine-tuning. We evaluate our
approach on multiple fine-grained classification datasets. It consistently
outperforms other unsupervised baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of
our self-supervised optimization framework. Notably, AutoSEP on average
improves 13 percent over standard zero-shot classification and 5 percent over
the best-performing baselines. Code is available at:

Abstract: The Arrow of Time (AoT)-time's irreversible flow shaping physical events-is
fundamental to video comprehension, yet remains a significant challenge for
modern large multimodal models (LMMs). Current LMMs struggle to perceive and
utilize temporal directionality in video when responding to language queries,
obstructing deeper temporal understanding. We tackle this deficiency by first
providing a critical analysis of existing benchmarks and models. We then
introduce ArrowRL, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based training strategy with
an innovative reverse reward that instills AoT awareness by encouraging
divergent video interpretations between forward and reversed visual frames. For
rigorous evaluation, we additionally develop AoTBench, a new multi-faceted
benchmark probing temporally challenging questions. Experiments show ArrowRL
greatly advances temporal perception: it not only achieves substantial
improvements on our challenging AoTBench but also demonstrably boosts
performance on standard video question answering (VQA) benchmarks (with peak
accuracy gains reaching over 20% and 10% respectively). This validates
ArrowRL's effectiveness and highlights the critical need for dedicated AoT

Conclusion: DenseDPO有效解决了DPO的局限性，提升了视频生成质量和标注效率。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently been applied as a
post-training technique for text-to-video diffusion models. To obtain training
data, annotators are asked to provide preferences between two videos generated
from independent noise. However, this approach prohibits fine-grained
comparisons, and we point out that it biases the annotators towards low-motion
clips as they often contain fewer visual artifacts. In this work, we introduce
DenseDPO, a method that addresses these shortcomings by making three
contributions. First, we create each video pair for DPO by denoising corrupted
copies of a ground truth video. This results in aligned pairs with similar
motion structures while differing in local details, effectively neutralizing
the motion bias. Second, we leverage the resulting temporal alignment to label
preferences on short segments rather than entire clips, yielding a denser and
more precise learning signal. With only one-third of the labeled data, DenseDPO
greatly improves motion generation over vanilla DPO, while matching it in text
alignment, visual quality, and temporal consistency. Finally, we show that
DenseDPO unlocks automatic preference annotation using off-the-shelf Vision
Language Models (VLMs): GPT accurately predicts segment-level preferences
similar to task-specifically fine-tuned video reward models, and DenseDPO
trained on these labels achieves performance close to using human labels.

Abstract: We present Subject Fidelity Optimization (SFO), a novel comparative learning
framework for zero-shot subject-driven generation that enhances subject
fidelity. Beyond supervised fine-tuning methods that rely only on positive
targets and use the diffusion loss as in the pre-training stage, SFO introduces
synthetic negative targets and explicitly guides the model to favor positives
over negatives through pairwise comparison. For negative targets, we propose
Condition-Degradation Negative Sampling (CDNS), which automatically generates
distinctive and informative negatives by intentionally degrading visual and
textual cues without expensive human annotations. Moreover, we reweight the
diffusion timesteps to focus finetuning on intermediate steps where subject
details emerge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SFO with CDNS
significantly outperforms baselines in terms of both subject fidelity and text
alignment on a subject-driven generation benchmark. Project page:

persists as they build upon this sequential nature. In this work we present a
new perspective based on model merging to maintain stability while still
retaining plasticity. Rather than just sequentially updating the model weights,
we propose merging newly trained task parameters with previously learned ones,
promoting a better balance. To maximize the effectiveness of the merging
process, we propose a simple mechanism that promotes learning aligned weights
with previous ones, thereby avoiding interference when merging. We evaluate
this approach on large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), and demonstrate its
effectiveness in reducing forgetting, increasing robustness to various task
orders and similarities, and improving generalization.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为MINT的新框架，通过引入记忆提示库（MPB）动态调整视觉语言预训练模型（VLMs）在测试时的分布偏移问题，无需源数据或重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言预训练模型在测试时数据分布偏移下的泛化能力不足问题，现有方法未能充分利用模型的内部知识。

Method: 提出Memory-Infused Prompt Tuning（MINT），利用记忆提示库（MPB）存储可学习的键值提示对，通过层次化视觉特征检索相关提示对，动态组装关联提示并注入图像编码器。

Result: MINT能够在测试时快速、精确地适应VLMs，无需源数据或重新训练。

Conclusion: MINT通过记忆提示库有效提升了VLMs在测试时的适应能力。

Abstract: Improving the generalization ability of Vision-Language Pre-trained Models
(VLMs) under test-time data distribution shifts remains a critical challenge.
The existing Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods fall short in fully leveraging
the model's internal knowledge, particularly in dynamically adapting to complex
and hierarchical visual semantic information. In this paper, we propose
Memory-Infused Prompt Tuning (MINT), a novel framework to address this issue.
Inspired by human associative memory theory, MINT introduces a Memory Prompt
Bank (MPB), which stores learnable key-value prompt pairs that work as a memory
of previously seen samples. During the test time, relevant prompt pairs in the
MPB are retrieved by the hierarchical visual features of test images to
dynamically assemble Associative Prompts. The associative prompts are then
injected into the image encoder for fine-grained, customized visual contextual
guidance. MINT also utilizes learnable text prompts. MINT thus enables rapid,
precise VLM adaptation at test time by leveraging this MPB-acquired memory,
without source data or retraining. The code is available at

Conclusion: ViT-Split通过优化特征提取和适配机制，显著提升了视觉基础模型的效率和性能。

Abstract: Vision foundation models (VFMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance
across a wide range of downstream tasks. While several VFM adapters have shown
promising results by leveraging the prior knowledge of VFMs, we identify two
inefficiencies in these approaches. First, the interaction between
convolutional neural network (CNN) and VFM backbone triggers early layer
gradient backpropagation. Second, existing methods require tuning all
components, adding complexity. Besides, these adapters alter VFM features,
underutilizing the prior knowledge. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
new approach called ViT-Split, based on a key observation: the layers of
several VFMs, like DINOv2, can be divided into two distinct components: an
extractor for learning low-level features and an adapter for learning
task-specific features. Leveraging this insight, we eliminate the CNN branch
and introduce two heads, task head and prior head, to the frozen VFM. The task
head is designed to learn task-specific features, mitigating the early gradient
propagation issue. The prior head is used to leverage the multi-scale prior
features from the frozen VFM, reducing tuning parameters and overfitting.
Extensive experiments on various tasks (e.g., segmentation, detection, depth
estimation, and visual question answering) validate the effectiveness and
efficiency of ViT-Split. Specifically, ViT-Split reduces training time up to
$4\times$ while achieving comparable or even better results on ADE20K, compared
to other VFM adapters.

Abstract: Recent advances in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning have improved complex

Video-Skill-CoT (a.k.a. Video-SKoT), a framework that automatically constructs
and leverages skill-aware CoT supervisions for domain-adaptive video reasoning.
First, we construct skill-based CoT annotations: we extract domain-relevant
reasoning skills from training questions, cluster them into a shared skill
taxonomy, and create detailed multi-step CoT rationale tailored to each
video-question pair for training. Second, we introduce a skill-specific expert
learning framework. Each expert module specializes in a subset of reasoning
skills and is trained with lightweight adapters using the collected CoT
supervision. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on three
video understanding benchmarks, where Video-SKoT consistently outperforms
strong baselines. We also provide in-depth analyses on comparing different CoT
annotation pipelines and learned skills over multiple video domains.

Method: 提出DOVE动态视觉编码器，生成可变数量的视觉标记以重建图像，并扩展为查询条件化标记化以聚焦查询相关区域。

Result: DOVE显著减少平均标记数量并保持高质量重建，在线性探测和多模态任务中优于固定长度编码方法。

Conclusion: DOVE通过动态调整标记数量和查询条件化，实现了更高效和有针对性的语义提取。

Abstract: Most existing vision encoders map images into a fixed-length sequence of
tokens, overlooking the fact that different images contain varying amounts of
information. For example, a visually complex image (e.g., a cluttered room)
inherently carries more information and thus deserves more tokens than a simple
image (e.g., a blank wall). To address this inefficiency, we propose DOVE, a
dynamic vision encoder that produces a variable number of visual tokens (i.e.,
continuous representation vectors) to reconstruct each image. Our results show
that DOVE significantly reduces the average number of tokens while maintaining
high reconstruction quality. In several linear probing and downstream
multimodal tasks, it outperforms existing autoencoder-based tokenization
methods when using far fewer tokens, capturing more expressive semantic
features compared to fixed-length encoding. We further extend DOVE with
query-conditioned tokenization. By guiding the model to focus on query-relevant
regions, it achieves more efficient and targeted semantic extraction. Our code

Abstract: Video transformer models require huge amounts of compute resources due to the
spatio-temporal scaling of the input. Tackling this, recent methods have
proposed to drop or merge tokens for image models, whether randomly or via
learned methods. Merging tokens has many benefits: it can be plugged into any
vision transformer, does not require model re-training, and it propagates
information that would otherwise be dropped through the model. Before now,
video token merging has not been evaluated on temporally complex datasets for
video understanding. In this work, we explore training-free token merging for
video to provide comprehensive experiments and find best practices across four
video transformers on three datasets that exhibit coarse and fine-grained
action recognition. Our results showcase the benefits of video token merging
with a speedup of around $2.5$X while maintaining accuracy (avg. $-0.55\%$ for
ViViT). Code available at

Conclusion: 通过显式推理和两阶段训练，Rex-Thinker实现了更可靠和可解释的对象引用。

Abstract: Object referring aims to detect all objects in an image that match a given
natural language description. We argue that a robust object referring model
should be grounded, meaning its predictions should be both explainable and
faithful to the visual content. Specifically, it should satisfy two key
properties: 1) Verifiable, by producing interpretable reasoning that justifies
its predictions and clearly links them to visual evidence; and 2) Trustworthy,
by learning to abstain when no object in the image satisfies the given
expression. However, most methods treat referring as a direct bounding box
prediction task, offering limited interpretability and struggling to reject
expressions with no matching object. In this work, we propose Rex-Thinker, a
model that formulates object referring as an explicit CoT reasoning task. Given
a referring expression, we first identify all candidate object instances
corresponding to the referred object category. Rex-Thinker then performs
step-by-step reasoning over each candidate to assess whether it matches the
given expression, before making a final prediction. To support this paradigm,
we construct a large-scale CoT-style referring dataset named HumanRef-CoT by
prompting GPT-4o on the HumanRef dataset. Each reasoning trace follows a
structured planning, action, and summarization format, enabling the model to
learn decomposed, interpretable reasoning over object candidates. We then train
Rex-Thinker in two stages: a cold-start supervised fine-tuning phase to teach
the model how to perform structured reasoning, followed by GRPO-based RL
learning to improve accuracy and generalization. Experiments show that our
approach outperforms standard baselines in both precision and interpretability
on in-domain evaluation, while also demonstrating improved ability to reject
hallucinated outputs and strong generalization in out-of-domain settings.

Abstract: Fine-grained and efficient controllability on video diffusion transformers
has raised increasing desires for the applicability. Recently, In-context
Conditioning emerged as a powerful paradigm for unified conditional video
generation, which enables diverse controls by concatenating varying context
conditioning signals with noisy video latents into a long unified token
sequence and jointly processing them via full-attention, e.g., FullDiT. Despite
their effectiveness, these methods face quadratic computation overhead as task
complexity increases, hindering practical deployment. In this paper, we study
the efficiency bottleneck neglected in original in-context conditioning video
generation framework. We begin with systematic analysis to identify two key
sources of the computation inefficiencies: the inherent redundancy within
context condition tokens and the computational redundancy in context-latent
interactions throughout the diffusion process. Based on these insights, we
propose FullDiT2, an efficient in-context conditioning framework for general
controllability in both video generation and editing tasks, which innovates
from two key perspectives. Firstly, to address the token redundancy, FullDiT2
leverages a dynamic token selection mechanism to adaptively identify important
context tokens, reducing the sequence length for unified full-attention.
Additionally, a selective context caching mechanism is devised to minimize
redundant interactions between condition tokens and video latents. Extensive
experiments on six diverse conditional video editing and generation tasks
demonstrate that FullDiT2 achieves significant computation reduction and 2-3
times speedup in averaged time cost per diffusion step, with minimal
degradation or even higher performance in video generation quality. The project

Conclusion: UNIC通过统一框架实现了多样视频编辑任务的高效处理。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have sparked interest in
generative video editing tasks. Previous methods often rely on task-specific
architectures (e.g., additional adapter modules) or dedicated customizations
(e.g., DDIM inversion), which limit the integration of versatile editing
conditions and the unification of various editing tasks. In this paper, we
introduce UNified In-Context Video Editing (UNIC), a simple yet effective
framework that unifies diverse video editing tasks within a single model in an
in-context manner. To achieve this unification, we represent the inputs of
various video editing tasks as three types of tokens: the source video tokens,
the noisy video latent, and the multi-modal conditioning tokens that vary
according to the specific editing task. Based on this formulation, our key
insight is to integrate these three types into a single consecutive token
sequence and jointly model them using the native attention operations of DiT,
thereby eliminating the need for task-specific adapter designs. Nevertheless,
direct task unification under this framework is challenging, leading to severe
token collisions and task confusion due to the varying video lengths and
diverse condition modalities across tasks. To address these, we introduce
task-aware RoPE to facilitate consistent temporal positional encoding, and
condition bias that enables the model to clearly differentiate different
editing tasks. This allows our approach to adaptively perform different video
editing tasks by referring the source video and varying condition tokens "in
context", and support flexible task composition. To validate our method, we
construct a unified video editing benchmark containing six representative video
editing tasks. Results demonstrate that our unified approach achieves superior
performance on each task and exhibits emergent task composition abilities.

Abstract: The risk of misusing text-to-image generative models for malicious uses,
especially due to the open-source development of such models, has become a
serious concern. As a risk mitigation strategy, attributing generative models
with neural fingerprinting is emerging as a popular technique. There has been a
plethora of recent work that aim for addressing neural fingerprinting. A
trade-off between the attribution accuracy and generation quality of such
models has been studied extensively. None of the existing methods yet achieved
$100\%$ attribution accuracy. However, any model with less than \emph{perfect}
accuracy is practically non-deployable. In this work, we propose an accurate
method to incorporate neural fingerprinting for text-to-image diffusion models
leveraging the concepts of cyclic error correcting codes from the literature of
coding theory.

Abstract: In the context of noisy partial label learning (NPLL), each training sample
is associated with a set of candidate labels annotated by multiple noisy
annotators. With the emergence of high-performance pre-trained vision-language
models (VLMs) such as CLIP, LLaVa and GPT-4V, the direction of using these
models to replace time-consuming manual annotation workflows and achieve
"manual-annotation-free" training for downstream tasks has become a highly
promising research avenue. This paper focuses on learning from noisy partial
labels annotated by pre-trained VLMs and proposes an innovative collaborative
consistency regularization (Co-Reg) method. Unlike the symmetric noise
primarily addressed in traditional noisy label learning, the noise generated by
pre-trained models is instance-dependent, embodying the underlying patterns of
the pre-trained models themselves, which significantly increases the learning
difficulty for the model. To address this, we simultaneously train two neural
networks that implement collaborative purification of training labels through a
"Co-Pseudo-Labeling" mechanism, while enforcing consistency regularization
constraints in both the label space and feature representation space. Our
method can also leverage few-shot manually annotated valid labels to further
enhance its performances. Comparative experiments with different denoising and
disambiguation algorithms, annotation manners, and pre-trained model
application schemes fully validate the effectiveness of the proposed method,
while revealing the broad prospects of integrating weakly-supervised learning
techniques into the knowledge distillation process of pre-trained models.

Abstract: Amid the challenges posed by global population growth and climate change,
traditional agricultural Internet of Things (IoT) systems is currently
undergoing a significant digital transformation to facilitate efficient big
data processing. While smart agriculture utilizes artificial intelligence (AI)
technologies to enable precise control, it still encounters significant
challenges, including excessive reliance on agricultural expert knowledge,
difficulties in fusing multimodal data, poor adaptability to dynamic
environments, and bottlenecks in real-time decision-making at the edge. Large
language models (LLMs), with their exceptional capabilities in knowledge
acquisition and semantic understanding, provide a promising solution to address
these challenges. To this end, we propose Farm-LightSeek, an edge-centric
multimodal agricultural IoT data analytics framework that integrates LLMs with
edge computing. This framework collects real-time farmland multi-source data
(images, weather, geographic information) via sensors, performs cross-modal
reasoning and disease detection at edge nodes, conducts low-latency management
decisions, and enables cloud collaboration for model updates. The main
innovations of Farm-LightSeek include: (1) an agricultural
"perception-decision-action" closed-loop architecture; (2) cross-modal adaptive
monitoring; and (3)a lightweight LLM deployment strategy balancing performance
and efficiency. Experiments conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate
that Farm-LightSeek consistently achieves reliable performance in

Abstract: In recent years, the widespread adoption of wearable devices has highlighted
the growing importance of behavior analysis using IMU. While applications span
diverse fields such as healthcare and robotics, recent studies have
increasingly focused on multimodal analysis, in addition to unimodal analysis.
Several studies have proposed multimodal foundation models that incorporate
first-person video and text data; however, these models still fall short in
providing a detailed analysis of full-body human activity. To address this
limitation, we propose Activity Understanding and Representations Alignment -
Multimodal Foundation Model (AURA-MFM), a foundational model integrating four
modalities: third-person video, motion capture, IMU, and text. By incorporating
third-person video and motion capture data, the model enables a detailed and
multidimensional understanding of human activity, which first-person
perspectives alone fail to capture. Additionally, a Transformer-based IMU
encoder is employed to enhance the model's overall performance. Experimental
evaluations on retrieval and activity recognition tasks demonstrate that our
model surpasses existing methods. Notably, in the zero-shot classification for
action recognition, our method achieved significantly higher performance, with
an F1-score of 0.6226 and an accuracy of 0.7320, whereas the existing method
recorded an F1-score of 0.0747 and an accuracy of 0.1961.

Conclusion: GenSeC-PC通过生成先验和全模拟传输，显著提升了点云传输的效率和可靠性。

Abstract: With the rapid development of autonomous driving and extended reality,
efficient transmission of point clouds (PCs) has become increasingly important.
In this context, we propose a novel channel-adaptive cross-modal generative
semantic communication (SemCom) for PC transmission, called GenSeC-PC.
GenSeC-PC employs a semantic encoder that fuses images and point clouds, where
images serve as non-transmitted side information. Meanwhile, the decoder is
built upon the backbone of PointDif. Such a cross-modal design not only ensures
high compression efficiency but also delivers superior reconstruction
performance compared to PointDif. Moreover, to ensure robust transmission and
reduce system complexity, we design a streamlined and asymmetric
channel-adaptive joint semantic-channel coding architecture, where only the
encoder needs the feedback of average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and available
bandwidth. In addition, rectified denoising diffusion implicit models is
employed to accelerate the decoding process to the millisecond level, enabling
real-time PC communication. Unlike existing methods, GenSeC-PC leverages
generative priors to ensure reliable reconstruction even from noisy or
incomplete source PCs. More importantly, it supports fully analog transmission,
improving compression efficiency by eliminating the need for error-free side
information transmission common in prior SemCom approaches. Simulation results
confirm the effectiveness of cross-modal semantic extraction and dual-metric
guided fine-tuning, highlighting the framework's robustness across diverse
conditions, including low SNR, bandwidth limitations, varying numbers of 2D
images, and previously unseen objects.

Abstract: Plant Disease Detection (PDD) is a key aspect of precision agriculture.
However, existing deep learning methods often rely on extensively annotated
datasets, which are time-consuming and costly to generate. Self-supervised
Learning (SSL) offers a promising alternative by exploiting the abundance of
unlabeled data. However, most existing SSL approaches suffer from high
computational costs due to convolutional neural networks or transformer-based
architectures. Additionally, they struggle to capture long-range dependencies
in visual representation and rely on static loss functions that fail to align
local and global features effectively. To address these challenges, we propose
ConMamba, a novel SSL framework specially designed for PDD. ConMamba integrates
the Vision Mamba Encoder (VME), which employs a bidirectional State Space Model
(SSM) to capture long-range dependencies efficiently. Furthermore, we introduce
a dual-level contrastive loss with dynamic weight adjustment to optimize
local-global feature alignment. Experimental results on three benchmark
datasets demonstrate that ConMamba significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
methods across multiple evaluation metrics. This provides an efficient and
robust solution for PDD.

Abstract: Recent works on optical flow estimation use neural networks to predict the
flow field that maps positions of one image to positions of the other. These
networks consist of a feature extractor, a correlation volume, and finally
several refinement steps. These refinement steps mimic the iterative
refinements performed by classical optimization algorithms and are usually
implemented by neural layers (e.g., GRU) which are recurrently executed for a
fixed and pre-determined number of steps. However, relying on a fixed number of
steps may result in suboptimal performance because it is not tailored to the
input data. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for predicting the
derivative of the flow using a continuous model, namely neural ordinary
differential equations (ODE). One key advantage of this approach is its
capacity to model an equilibrium process, dynamically adjusting the number of
compute steps based on the data at hand. By following a particular neural
architecture, ODE solver, and associated hyperparameters, our proposed model
can replicate the exact same updates as recurrent cells used in existing works,
offering greater generality. Through extensive experimental analysis on optical
flow benchmarks, we demonstrate that our approach achieves an impressive
improvement over baseline and existing models, all while requiring only a
single refinement step.

Result: 在SportsMOT数据集上表现最佳，并能零样本迁移到冰球数据集VIP-HTD。

Conclusion: SportMamba在复杂运动场景中表现出色，具有泛化能力。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) in team sports is particularly challenging due to
the fast-paced motion and frequent occlusions resulting in motion blur and
identity switches, respectively. Predicting player positions in such scenarios
is particularly difficult due to the observed highly non-linear motion
patterns. Current methods are heavily reliant on object detection and
appearance-based tracking, which struggle to perform in complex team sports
scenarios, where appearance cues are ambiguous and motion patterns do not
necessarily follow a linear pattern. To address these challenges, we introduce
SportMamba, an adaptive hybrid MOT technique specifically designed for tracking
in dynamic team sports. The technical contribution of SportMamba is twofold.
First, we introduce a mamba-attention mechanism that models non-linear motion
by implicitly focusing on relevant embedding dependencies. Second, we propose a
height-adaptive spatial association metric to reduce ID switches caused by
partial occlusions by accounting for scale variations due to depth changes.
Additionally, we extend the detection search space with adaptive buffers to
improve associations in fast-motion scenarios. Our proposed technique,
SportMamba, demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on various metrics in the
SportsMOT dataset, which is characterized by complex motion and severe
occlusion. Furthermore, we demonstrate its generalization capability through
zero-shot transfer to VIP-HTD, an ice hockey dataset.

Abstract: Foundation models have begun to transform image analysis by acting as

post-training data are limited, yet their impact on spatial proteomics, imaging
that maps proteins at single-cell resolution, remains limited. Here, we

175 protein markers, 16 tissue types, and 8 fluorescence-based imaging
platforms. We introduce key architectural adaptations to address the
high-dimensional, multi-channel, and heterogeneous nature of multiplex imaging.
We demonstrate that KRONOS learns biologically meaningful representations
across multiple scales, ranging from cellular and microenvironment to tissue
levels, enabling it to address diverse downstream tasks, including cell
phenotyping, region classification, and patient stratification. Evaluated
across 11 independent cohorts, KRONOS achieves state-of-the-art performance
across cell phenotyping, treatment response prediction, and retrieval tasks,
and is highly data-efficient. KRONOS also introduces the paradigm of
segmentation-free patch-level processing for efficient and scalable spatial
proteomics analysis, allowing cross-institutional comparisons, and as an image

Conclusion: GeoVis-GNN通过有效的多模态融合和层次化建模，显著提升了HOI识别性能。MPHOI-120数据集为复杂动态交互研究提供了新资源。

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) recognition in videos requires understanding
both visual patterns and geometric relationships as they evolve over time.
Visual and geometric features offer complementary strengths. Visual features
capture appearance context, while geometric features provide structural
patterns. Effectively fusing these multimodal features without compromising
their unique characteristics remains challenging. We observe that establishing
robust, entity-specific representations before modeling interactions helps
preserve the strengths of each modality. Therefore, we hypothesize that a
bottom-up approach is crucial for effective multimodal fusion. Following this
insight, we propose the Geometric Visual Fusion Graph Neural Network
(GeoVis-GNN), which uses dual-attention feature fusion combined with
interdependent entity graph learning. It progressively builds from
entity-specific representations toward high-level interaction understanding. To
advance HOI recognition to real-world scenarios, we introduce the Concurrent
Partial Interaction Dataset (MPHOI-120). It captures dynamic multi-person
interactions involving concurrent actions and partial engagement. This dataset
helps address challenges like complex human-object dynamics and mutual
occlusions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
across various HOI scenarios. These scenarios include two-person interactions,
single-person activities, bimanual manipulations, and complex concurrent
partial interactions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: In few-shot learning (FSL), the labeled samples are scarce. Thus, label
errors can significantly reduce classification accuracy. Since label errors are
inevitable in realistic learning tasks, improving the robustness of the model
in the presence of label errors is critical. This paper proposes a new robust
neural field-based image approach (RoNFA) for few-shot image classification
with noisy labels. RoNFA consists of two neural fields for feature and category
representation. They correspond to the feature space and category set. Each
neuron in the field for category representation (FCR) has a receptive field
(RF) on the field for feature representation (FFR) centered at the
representative neuron for its category generated by soft clustering. In the
prediction stage, the range of these receptive fields adapts according to the
neuronal activation in FCR to ensure prediction accuracy. These learning
strategies provide the proposed model with excellent few-shot learning
capability and strong robustness against label noises. The experimental results
on real-world FSL datasets with three different types of label noise
demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
FSL methods. Its accuracy obtained in the presence of noisy labels even
surpasses the results obtained by state-of-the-art FSL methods trained on clean
support sets, indicating its strong robustness against noisy labels.

Conclusion: 基于文本表示空间的语义中心搜索和UniMS评分函数显著提升了通用域适应的性能。

Abstract: Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA) focuses on transferring source domain
knowledge to the target domain under both domain shift and unknown category
shift. Its main challenge lies in identifying common class samples and aligning
them. Current methods typically obtain target domain semantics centers from an
unconstrained continuous image representation space. Due to domain shift and
the unknown number of clusters, these centers often result in complex and less
robust alignment algorithm. In this paper, based on vision-language models, we
search for semantic centers in a semantically meaningful and discrete text
representation space. The constrained space ensures almost no domain bias and
appropriate semantic granularity for these centers, enabling a simple and
robust adaptation algorithm. Specifically, we propose TArget Semantics
Clustering (TASC) via Text Representations, which leverages information
maximization as a unified objective and involves two stages. First, with the
frozen encoders, a greedy search-based framework is used to search for an
optimal set of text embeddings to represent target semantics. Second, with the
search results fixed, encoders are refined based on gradient descent,
simultaneously achieving robust domain alignment and private class clustering.
Additionally, we propose Universal Maximum Similarity (UniMS), a scoring
function tailored for detecting open-set samples in UniDA. Experimentally, we
evaluate the universality of UniDA algorithms under four category shift
scenarios. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of our method, which has achieved state-of-the-art
performance.

Conclusion: Asymmetric Dual 3DGS通过抑制不一致伪影和提升效率，显著改善了3D重建质量。

Abstract: 3D reconstruction from in-the-wild images remains a challenging task due to
inconsistent lighting conditions and transient distractors. Existing methods
typically rely on heuristic strategies to handle the low-quality training data,
which often struggle to produce stable and consistent reconstructions,
frequently resulting in visual artifacts. In this work, we propose Asymmetric
Dual 3DGS, a novel framework that leverages the stochastic nature of these
artifacts: they tend to vary across different training runs due to minor
randomness. Specifically, our method trains two 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
models in parallel, enforcing a consistency constraint that encourages
convergence on reliable scene geometry while suppressing inconsistent
artifacts. To prevent the two models from collapsing into similar failure modes
due to confirmation bias, we introduce a divergent masking strategy that
applies two complementary masks: a multi-cue adaptive mask and a
self-supervised soft mask, which leads to an asymmetric training process of the
two models, reducing shared error modes. In addition, to improve the efficiency
of model training, we introduce a lightweight variant called Dynamic EMA Proxy,
which replaces one of the two models with a dynamically updated Exponential
Moving Average (EMA) proxy, and employs an alternating masking strategy to
preserve divergence. Extensive experiments on challenging real-world datasets
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches while
achieving high efficiency. Codes and trained models will be released.

resolution, scene diversity, and category coverage, which hinders the
generalization and real-world applicability of refer segmentation models. To
facilitate the development of this field, we introduce NWPU-Refer, the largest
and most diverse RRSIS dataset to date, comprising 15,003 high-resolution
images (1024-2048px) spanning 30+ countries with 49,745 annotated targets
supporting single-object, multi-object, and non-object segmentation scenarios.
Additionally, we propose the Multi-scale Referring Segmentation Network
(MRSNet), a novel framework tailored for the unique demands of RRSIS. MRSNet
introduces two key innovations: (1) an Intra-scale Feature Interaction Module
(IFIM) that captures fine-grained details within each encoder stage, and (2) a
Hierarchical Feature Interaction Module (HFIM) to enable seamless cross-scale
feature fusion, preserving spatial integrity while enhancing discriminative
power. Extensive experiments conducte on the proposed NWPU-Refer dataset
demonstrate that MRSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple
evaluation metrics, validating its effectiveness. The dataset and code are
publicly available at https://github.com/CVer-Yang/NWPU-Refer.

TL;DR: BiMa是一个新框架，旨在通过视觉和文本去偏技术解决文本-视频检索中的视觉-语言偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本-视频检索系统因数据集中的视觉-语言偏差而忽略关键细节，BiMa旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过生成场景元素增强视频嵌入（视觉去偏），并将文本特征解耦为内容和偏差部分（文本去偏）。

Result: 在五个主要TVR基准测试中表现优异，并在分布外检索任务中验证了其去偏能力。

Conclusion: BiMa有效缓解了视觉-语言偏差，提升了检索性能。

Abstract: Text-video retrieval (TVR) systems often suffer from visual-linguistic biases
present in datasets, which cause pre-trained vision-language models to overlook
key details. To address this, we propose BiMa, a novel framework designed to
mitigate biases in both visual and textual representations. Our approach begins
by generating scene elements that characterize each video by identifying
relevant entities/objects and activities. For visual debiasing, we integrate
these scene elements into the video embeddings, enhancing them to emphasize
fine-grained and salient details. For textual debiasing, we introduce a
mechanism to disentangle text features into content and bias components,
enabling the model to focus on meaningful content while separately handling
biased information. Extensive experiments and ablation studies across five
major TVR benchmarks (i.e., MSR-VTT, MSVD, LSMDC, ActivityNet, and DiDeMo)
demonstrate the competitive performance of BiMa. Additionally, the model's bias
mitigation capability is consistently validated by its strong results on
out-of-distribution retrieval tasks.

Motivation: 当前可控图像生成方法在稀疏语义的文本提示与目标图像之间存在语义鸿沟，且过度依赖低层次控制信号。ControlThinker 旨在通过视觉推理能力解决这一问题。

Result: 实验表明，ControlThinker 有效缩小了语义鸿沟，提升了生成图像的视觉质量和语义一致性。

Conclusion: ControlThinker 通过增强语义理解和优化推理轨迹，显著改善了可控图像生成的性能。

Abstract: The field of controllable image generation has seen significant advancements,
with various architectures improving generation layout consistency with control
signals. However, contemporary methods still face challenges in bridging the
semantic gap between input text prompts with sparse semantics and the target
images, often over-relying on low-level control signals to infer regional
details. To address this challenge, we propose ControlThinker, a novel
framework that employs a "comprehend-then-generate" paradigm. Firstly, by
incentivizing the visual reasoning capability of a MLLM, latent semantics from
control images are mined to enrich text prompts. This enriched semantic
understanding then seamlessly aids in image generation without the need for
additional complex modifications. To further tackle the uncertainty arising
from the ambiguity of control images, we encourage broader exploration of
reasoning trajectories and select the optimal one using a metric-based output
reward model (ORM). Extensive experimental results demonstrate that
ControlThinker effectively mitigates the semantic gap between raw text prompts
and target images, resulting in improved visual quality and semantic
consistency across a wide range of benchmarks. The code and models are

Abstract: Edge computing decentralizes processing power to network edge, enabling
real-time AI-driven decision-making in IoT applications. In industrial
automation such as robotics and rugged edge AI, real-time perception and

transformer-based image captioning models at the edge can enhance machine

industrial inspection.
  However, these edge or IoT devices are often constrained in computational
resources for physical agility, yet they have strict response time
requirements. Traditional deep learning models can be too large and
computationally demanding for these devices. In this research, we present
findings of transformer-based models for image captioning that operate
effectively on edge devices. By evaluating resource-effective transformer
models and applying knowledge distillation techniques, we demonstrate inference
can be accelerated on resource-constrained devices while maintaining model

Abstract: Real-time object detection is a fundamental but challenging task in computer
vision, particularly when computational resources are limited. Although
YOLO-series models have set strong benchmarks by balancing speed and accuracy,
the increasing need for richer global context modeling has led to the use of
Transformer-based architectures. Nevertheless, Transformers have high
computational complexity because of their self-attention mechanism, which
limits their practicality for real-time and edge deployments. To overcome these
challenges, recent developments in linear state space models, such as Mamba,
provide a promising alternative by enabling efficient sequence modeling with
linear complexity. Building on this insight, we propose MambaNeXt-YOLO, a novel
object detection framework that balances accuracy and efficiency through three
key contributions: (1) MambaNeXt Block: a hybrid design that integrates CNNs
with Mamba to effectively capture both local features and long-range
dependencies; (2) Multi-branch Asymmetric Fusion Pyramid Network (MAFPN): an
enhanced feature pyramid architecture that improves multi-scale object
detection across various object sizes; and (3) Edge-focused Efficiency: our
method achieved 66.6\% mAP at 31.9 FPS on the PASCAL VOC dataset without any
pre-training and supports deployment on edge devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson

Conclusion: INP-Former是一种通用且高效的异常检测方法，尤其在复杂场景下表现突出。

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) is essential for industrial inspection and medical
diagnosis, yet existing methods typically rely on ``comparing'' test images to
normal references from a training set. However, variations in appearance and
positioning often complicate the alignment of these references with the test
image, limiting detection accuracy. We observe that most anomalies manifest as
local variations, meaning that even within anomalous images, valuable normal
information remains. We argue that this information is useful and may be more
aligned with the anomalies since both the anomalies and the normal information
originate from the same image. Therefore, rather than relying on external
normality from the training set, we propose INP-Former, a novel method that
extracts Intrinsic Normal Prototypes (INPs) directly from the test image.
Specifically, we introduce the INP Extractor, which linearly combines normal
tokens to represent INPs. We further propose an INP Coherence Loss to ensure
INPs can faithfully represent normality for the testing image. These INPs then
guide the INP-guided Decoder to reconstruct only normal tokens, with
reconstruction errors serving as anomaly scores. Additionally, we propose a
Soft Mining Loss to prioritize hard-to-optimize samples during training.
INP-Former achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-class, multi-class,
and few-shot AD tasks across MVTec-AD, VisA, and Real-IAD, positioning it as a
versatile and universal solution for AD. Remarkably, INP-Former also
demonstrates some zero-shot AD capability. Furthermore, we propose a soft
version of the INP Coherence Loss and enhance INP-Former by incorporating
residual learning, leading to the development of INP-Former++. The proposed
method significantly improves detection performance across single-class,
multi-class, semi-supervised, few-shot, and zero-shot settings.

Result: 在公开数据集和新基准测试中，EgoLoc优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: EgoLoc为自我中心视频的时序交互定位提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Locating human-object interaction (HOI) actions within video serves as the
foundation for multiple downstream tasks, such as human behavior analysis and
human-robot skill transfer. Current temporal action localization methods
typically rely on annotated action and object categories of interactions for
optimization, which leads to domain bias and low deployment efficiency.
Although some recent works have achieved zero-shot temporal action localization
(ZS-TAL) with large vision-language models (VLMs), their coarse-grained
estimations and open-loop pipelines hinder further performance improvements for
temporal interaction localization (TIL). To address these issues, we propose a
novel zero-shot TIL approach dubbed EgoLoc to locate the timings of grasp
actions for human-object interaction in egocentric videos. EgoLoc introduces a
self-adaptive sampling strategy to generate reasonable visual prompts for VLM
reasoning. By absorbing both 2D and 3D observations, it directly samples
high-quality initial guesses around the possible contact/separation timestamps
of HOI according to 3D hand velocities, leading to high inference accuracy and
efficiency. In addition, EgoLoc generates closed-loop feedback from visual and
dynamic cues to further refine the localization results. Comprehensive
experiments on the publicly available dataset and our newly proposed benchmark
demonstrate that EgoLoc achieves better temporal interaction localization for
egocentric videos compared to state-of-the-art baselines. We will release our
code and relevant data as open-source at https://github.com/IRMVLab/EgoLoc.

intersections of sensitive variables age, race and gender. To assess the
biases, we use linear classifier probes and visualize activations as
topographic maps. We find that representations in ImageNet classifiers
particularly allow differentiation between ages. Less strongly pronounced, the
models appear to associate certain ethnicities and distinguish genders in
middle-aged groups.

Conclusion: BiXFormer通过分离处理模态和优化匹配机制，显著提升了多模态语义分割性能。

Abstract: Utilizing multi-modal data enhances scene understanding by providing
complementary semantic and geometric information. Existing methods fuse
features or distill knowledge from multiple modalities into a unified
representation, improving robustness but restricting each modality's ability to
fully leverage its strengths in different situations. We reformulate
multi-modal semantic segmentation as a mask-level classification task and
propose BiXFormer, which integrates Unified Modality Matching (UMM) and Cross
Modality Alignment (CMA) to maximize modality effectiveness and handle missing
modalities. Specifically, BiXFormer first categorizes multi-modal inputs into
RGB and X, where X represents any non-RGB modalities, e.g., depth, allowing
separate processing for each. This design leverages the well-established
pretraining for RGB, while addressing the relative lack of attention to X
modalities. Then, we propose UMM, which includes Modality Agnostic Matching
(MAM) and Complementary Matching (CM). MAM assigns labels to features from all
modalities without considering modality differences, leveraging each modality's
strengths. CM then reassigns unmatched labels to remaining unassigned features
within their respective modalities, ensuring that each available modality
contributes to the final prediction and mitigating the impact of missing
modalities. Moreover, to further facilitate UMM, we introduce CMA, which
enhances the weaker queries assigned in CM by aligning them with optimally
matched queries from MAM. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world
multi-modal benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving
significant improvements in mIoU of +2.75% and +22.74% over the prior arts.

Abstract: The composition of objects and their parts, along with object-object
positional relationships, provides a rich source of information for
representation learning. Hence, spatial-aware pretext tasks have been actively
explored in self-supervised learning. Existing works commonly start from a grid
structure, where the goal of the pretext task involves predicting the absolute
position index of patches within a fixed grid. However, grid-based approaches
fall short of capturing the fluid and continuous nature of real-world object
compositions. We introduce PART, a self-supervised learning approach that
leverages continuous relative transformations between off-grid patches to
overcome these limitations. By modeling how parts relate to each other in a
continuous space, PART learns the relative composition of images-an off-grid
structural relative positioning process that generalizes beyond occlusions and
deformations. In tasks requiring precise spatial understanding such as object
detection and time series prediction, PART outperforms strong grid-based
methods like MAE and DropPos, while also maintaining competitive performance on
global classification tasks with minimal hyperparameter tuning. By breaking
free from grid constraints, PART opens up an exciting new trajectory for
universal self-supervised pretraining across diverse datatypes-from natural
images to EEG signals-with promising potential in video, medical imaging, and
audio.

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative AI has enabled remarkable creative
capabilities, yet it also raises urgent concerns regarding the safety of
AI-generated visual content in real-world applications such as content
moderation, platform governance, and digital media regulation. This includes
unsafe material such as sexually explicit images, violent scenes, hate symbols,
propaganda, and unauthorized imitations of copyrighted artworks. Existing image
safety systems often rely on rigid category filters and produce binary outputs,
lacking the capacity to interpret context or reason about nuanced,
adversarially induced forms of harm. In addition, standard evaluation metrics
(e.g., attack success rate) fail to capture the semantic severity and dynamic
progression of toxicity. To address these limitations, we propose
Perception-Retrieval-Judgement (PRJ), a cognitively inspired framework that
models toxicity detection as a structured reasoning process. PRJ follows a
three-stage design: it first transforms an image into descriptive language
(perception), then retrieves external knowledge related to harm categories and
traits (retrieval), and finally evaluates toxicity based on legal or normative
rules (judgement). This language-centric structure enables the system to detect
both explicit and implicit harms with improved interpretability and categorical
granularity. In addition, we introduce a dynamic scoring mechanism based on a
contextual toxicity risk matrix to quantify harmfulness across different
semantic dimensions. Experiments show that PRJ surpasses existing safety
checkers in detection accuracy and robustness while uniquely supporting
structured category-level toxicity interpretation.

Conclusion: OV-COAST通过最优传输理论有效提升了开源词汇语义分割的性能。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) entails assigning semantic
labels to each pixel in an image using textual descriptions, typically
leveraging world models such as CLIP. To enhance out-of-domain generalization,
we propose Cost Aggregation with Optimal Transport (OV-COAST) for
open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. To align visual-language features within
the framework of optimal transport theory, we employ cost volume to construct a
cost matrix, which quantifies the distance between two distributions. Our
approach adopts a two-stage optimization strategy: in the first stage, the
optimal transport problem is solved using cost volume via Sinkhorn distance to
obtain an alignment solution; in the second stage, this solution is used to
guide the training of the CAT-Seg model. We evaluate state-of-the-art OVSS
models on the MESS benchmark, where our approach notably improves the
performance of the cost-aggregation model CAT-Seg with ViT-B backbone,
achieving superior results, surpassing CAT-Seg by 1.72 % and SAN-B by 4.9 %

Abstract: Single image super-resolution is a well-known downstream task which aims to
restore low-resolution images into high-resolution images. At present, models
based on Transformers have shone brightly in the field of super-resolution due
to their ability to capture long-term dependencies in information. However,
current methods typically compute self-attention in nonoverlapping windows to
save computational costs, and the standard self-attention computation only
focuses on its results, thereby neglecting the useful information across
channels and the rich spatial structural information generated in the
intermediate process. Channel attention and spatial attention have,
respectively, brought significant improvements to various downstream visual
tasks in terms of extracting feature dependency and spatial structure
relationships, but the synergistic relationship between channel and spatial
attention has not been fully explored yet.To address these issues, we propose a
novel model. Synergistic Alternating Aggregation Transformer (SAAT), which can
better utilize the potential information of features. In SAAT, we introduce the
Efficient Channel & Window Synergistic Attention Group (CWSAG) and the Spatial
& Window Synergistic Attention Group (SWSAG). On the one hand, CWSAG combines
efficient channel attention with shifted window attention, enhancing non-local
feature fusion, and producing more visually appealing results. On the other
hand, SWSAG leverages spatial attention to capture rich structured feature
information, thereby enabling SAAT to more effectively extract structural
features.Extensive experimental results and ablation studies demonstrate the
effectiveness of SAAT in the field of super-resolution. SAAT achieves
performance comparable to that of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) under the same
quantity of parameters.

Abstract: Complex scenes present significant challenges for predicting human behaviour
due to the abundance of interaction information, such as human-human and
humanenvironment interactions. These factors complicate the analysis and
understanding of human behaviour, thereby increasing the uncertainty in
forecasting human motions. Existing motion prediction methods thus struggle in
these complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose an effective method for
human motion forecasting in interactive scenes. To achieve a comprehensive
representation of interactions, we design a hierarchical interaction feature
representation so that high-level features capture the overall context of the
interactions, while low-level features focus on fine-grained details. Besides,
we propose a coarse-to-fine interaction reasoning module that leverages both
spatial and frequency perspectives to efficiently utilize hierarchical
features, thereby enhancing the accuracy of motion predictions. Our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance across four public datasets. Code will be
released when this paper is published.

Conclusion: CoLa通过组合性和学习能力实现了高效的零样本汉字识别，具有广泛的泛化潜力。

Abstract: Humans can decompose Chinese characters into compositional components and
recombine them to recognize unseen characters. This reflects two cognitive
principles: Compositionality, the idea that complex concepts are built on
simpler parts; and Learning-to-learn, the ability to learn strategies for
decomposing and recombining components to form new concepts. These principles
provide inductive biases that support efficient generalization. They are
critical to Chinese character recognition (CCR) in solving the zero-shot
problem, which results from the common long-tail distribution of Chinese
character datasets. Existing methods have made substantial progress in modeling
compositionality via predefined radical or stroke decomposition. However, they
often ignore the learning-to-learn capability, limiting their ability to
generalize beyond human-defined schemes. Inspired by these principles, we
propose a deep latent variable model that learns Compositional Latent
components of Chinese characters (CoLa) without relying on human-defined
decomposition schemes. Recognition and matching can be performed by comparing
compositional latent components in the latent space, enabling zero-shot
character recognition. The experiments illustrate that CoLa outperforms
previous methods in both character the radical zero-shot CCR. Visualization
indicates that the learned components can reflect the structure of characters
in an interpretable way. Moreover, despite being trained on historical
documents, CoLa can analyze components of oracle bone characters, highlighting
its cross-dataset generalization ability.

Conclusion: 任务链式提示和上下文感知聚合显著提升了V-ICL在字符识别任务中的表现。

Abstract: This paper presents the first study on adapting the visual in-context
learning (V-ICL) paradigm to optical character recognition tasks, specifically
focusing on text removal and segmentation. Most existing V-ICL generalists
employ a reasoning-as-reconstruction approach: they turn to using a
straightforward image-label compositor as the prompt and query input, and then
masking the query label to generate the desired output. This direct prompt
confines the model to a challenging single-step reasoning process. To address
this, we propose a task-chaining compositor in the form of
image-removal-segmentation, providing an enhanced prompt that elicits reasoning
with enriched intermediates. Additionally, we introduce context-aware
aggregation, integrating the chained prompt pattern into the latent query
representation, thereby strengthening the model's in-context reasoning. We also
consider the issue of visual heterogeneity, which complicates the selection of
homogeneous demonstrations in text recognition. Accordingly, this is
effectively addressed through a simple self-prompting strategy, preventing the
model's in-context learnability from devolving into specialist-like,
context-free inference. Collectively, these insights culminate in our ConText
model, which achieves new state-of-the-art across both in- and out-of-domain
benchmarks. The code is available at https://github.com/Ferenas/ConText.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a practical cross-domain few-shot learning (pCDFSL)
task, where a large-scale pre-trained model like CLIP can be easily deployed on
a target dataset. The goal is to simultaneously classify all unseen classes
under extreme domain shifts, by utilizing only a few labeled samples per class.
The pCDFSL paradigm is source-free and moves beyond artificially created
episodic training and testing regimes followed by existing CDFSL frameworks,
making it more challenging and relevant to real-world applications. Towards
that goal, we propose a novel framework, termed MIST (MultIple STochastic
Prompt tuning), where multiple stochastic prompts are utilized to handle
significant domain and semantic shifts. Specifically, multiple prompts are
learnt for each class, effectively capturing multiple peaks in the input data.
Furthermore, instead of representing the weights of the multiple prompts as
point-estimates, we model them as learnable Gaussian distributions with two
different strategies, encouraging an efficient exploration of the prompt
parameter space, which mitigate overfitting due to the few labeled training
samples. Extensive experiments and comparison with the state-of-the-art methods
on four CDFSL benchmarks adapted to this setting, show the effectiveness of the
proposed framework.

Result: mL1-ACE显著降低了校准误差（ACE和MCE），同时保持了较高的DSC；软分箱版本校准效果最好但分割性能略有下降。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了分割预测的可信度，有望促进深度学习在临床中的安全应用。

Abstract: Deep neural networks for medical image segmentation are often overconfident,
compromising both reliability and clinical utility. In this work, we propose
differentiable formulations of marginal L1 Average Calibration Error (mL1-ACE)
as an auxiliary loss that can be computed on a per-image basis. We compare both
hard- and soft-binning approaches to directly improve pixel-wise calibration.
Our experiments on four datasets (ACDC, AMOS, KiTS, BraTS) demonstrate that
incorporating mL1-ACE significantly reduces calibration errors, particularly
Average Calibration Error (ACE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE), while
largely maintaining high Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSCs). We find that the
soft-binned variant yields the greatest improvements in calibration, over the
Dice plus cross-entropy loss baseline, but often compromises segmentation
performance, with hard-binned mL1-ACE maintaining segmentation performance,
albeit with weaker calibration improvement. To gain further insight into
calibration performance and its variability across an imaging dataset, we
introduce dataset reliability histograms, an aggregation of per-image
reliability diagrams. The resulting analysis highlights improved alignment
between predicted confidences and true accuracies. Overall, our approach not
only enhances the trustworthiness of segmentation predictions but also shows
potential for safer integration of deep learning methods into clinical
workflows. We share our code here:

Abstract: AI-generated images have reached a quality level at which humans are
incapable of reliably distinguishing them from real images. To counteract the
inherent risk of fraud and disinformation, the detection of AI-generated images
is a pressing challenge and an active research topic. While many of the
presented methods claim to achieve high detection accuracy, they are usually
evaluated under idealized conditions. In particular, the adversarial robustness
is often neglected, potentially due to a lack of awareness or the substantial
effort required to conduct a comprehensive robustness analysis. In this work,
we tackle this problem by providing a simpler means to assess the robustness of
AI-generated image detectors. We present RAID (Robust evaluation of
AI-generated image Detectors), a dataset of 72k diverse and highly transferable
adversarial examples. The dataset is created by running attacks against an
ensemble of seven state-of-the-art detectors and images generated by four
different text-to-image models. Extensive experiments show that our methodology
generates adversarial images that transfer with a high success rate to unseen
detectors, which can be used to quickly provide an approximate yet still
reliable estimate of a detector's adversarial robustnessOur findings indicate
that current state-of-the-art AI-generated image detectors can be easily
deceived by adversarial examples, highlighting the critical need for the
development of more robust methods. We release our dataset at

Conclusion: SiM可作为词汇无关少样本学习的重要基线。

Abstract: Recent advances in few-shot adaptation for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have
greatly expanded their ability to generalize across tasks using only a few
labeled examples. However, existing approaches primarily build upon the strong
zero-shot priors of these models by leveraging carefully designed,
task-specific prompts. This dependence on predefined class names can restrict
their applicability, especially in scenarios where exact class names are
unavailable or difficult to specify. To address this limitation, we introduce
vocabulary-free few-shot learning for VLMs, a setting where target class
instances - that is, images - are available but their corresponding names are
not. We propose Similarity Mapping (SiM), a simple yet effective baseline that
classifies target instances solely based on similarity scores with a set of
generic prompts (textual or visual), eliminating the need for carefully
handcrafted prompts. Although conceptually straightforward, SiM demonstrates
strong performance, operates with high computational efficiency (learning the
mapping typically takes less than one second), and provides interpretability by
linking target classes to generic prompts. We believe that our approach could
serve as an important baseline for future research in vocabulary-free few-shot
learning. Code is available at

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，CEs显著减少了功能失败（FPs/FNs），在近距离和远距离分别降低了80%和60%。

Conclusion: CEs是一种更有效的3D跟踪匹配度量方法，适用于安全关键应用。

Abstract: Finding reliable matches is essential in multi-object tracking to ensure the
accuracy and reliability of perception systems in safety-critical applications
such as autonomous vehicles. Effective matching mitigates perception errors,
enhancing object identification and tracking for improved performance and
safety. However, traditional metrics such as Intersection over Union (IoU) and
Center Point Distances (CPDs), which are effective in 2D image planes, often
fail to find critical matches in complex 3D scenes. To address this limitation,
we introduce Contour Errors (CEs), an ego or object-centric metric for
identifying matches of interest in tracking scenarios from a functional
perspective. By comparing bounding boxes in the ego vehicle's frame, contour
errors provide a more functionally relevant assessment of object matches.
Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that contour errors
improve the reliability of matches over the state-of-the-art 2D IoU and CPD
metrics in tracking-by-detection methods. In 3D car tracking, our results show
that Contour Errors reduce functional failures (FPs/FNs) by 80% at close ranges
and 60% at far ranges compared to IoU in the evaluation stage.

Conclusion: UniCUE通过直接生成语音和跨任务集成，显著提升了CSV2S任务的性能。

Abstract: Cued Speech (CS) enhances lipreading through hand coding, providing precise
speech perception support for the hearing-impaired. CS Video-to-Speech
generation (CSV2S) task aims to convert the CS visual expressions (CS videos)
of hearing-impaired individuals into comprehensible speech signals. Direct
generation of speech from CS video (called single CSV2S) yields poor
performance due to insufficient CS data. Current research mostly focuses on CS
Recognition (CSR), which convert video content into linguistic text. Based on
this, one straightforward way of CSV2S is to combine CSR with a Text-to-Speech
system. This combined architecture relies on text as an intermediate medium for
stepwise cross-modal alignment, which may lead to error propagation and
temporal misalignment between speech and video dynamics. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel approach that directly generates speech from CS
videos without relying on intermediate text. Building upon this, we propose
UniCUE, the first unified framework for CSV2S, whose core innovation lies in
the integration of the CSR task that provides fine-grained visual-semantic
information to facilitate speech generation from CS videos. More precisely, (1)
a novel fine-grained semantic alignment pool to ensure precise mapping between
visual features and speech contents; (2) a VisioPhonetic adapter to bridge
cross-task representations, ensuring seamless compatibility between two
distinct tasks (i.e., CSV2S and CSR); (3) a pose-aware visual processor is
introduced to enhance fine-grained spatiotemporal correlations between lip and
hand movements in CS video. Experiments on our new established Chinese CS
dataset (14 cuers1: 8 hearing-impaired and 6 normal-hearing) show that our
UniCUE significantly reduces Word Error Rate by 78.3% and improves lip-speech
synchronization by 32% compared to the single CSV2S.

Conclusion: IEAP通过模块化和序列化编辑操作，实现了对广泛编辑任务的鲁棒性，为指令驱动图像编辑提供了新思路。

Abstract: While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in text-to-image
generation, they encounter significant challenges with instruction-driven image
editing. Our research highlights a key challenge: these models particularly
struggle with structurally inconsistent edits that involve substantial layout
changes. To mitigate this gap, we introduce Image Editing As Programs (IEAP), a
unified image editing framework built upon the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)
architecture. At its core, IEAP approaches instructional editing through a
reductionist lens, decomposing complex editing instructions into sequences of
atomic operations. Each operation is implemented via a lightweight adapter
sharing the same DiT backbone and is specialized for a specific type of edit.
Programmed by a vision-language model (VLM)-based agent, these operations
collaboratively support arbitrary and structurally inconsistent
transformations. By modularizing and sequencing edits in this way, IEAP
generalizes robustly across a wide range of editing tasks, from simple
adjustments to substantial structural changes. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that IEAP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
standard benchmarks across various editing scenarios. In these evaluations, our
framework delivers superior accuracy and semantic fidelity, particularly for
complex, multi-step instructions. Codes are available at

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has enabled various applications in 3D scene
representation and novel view synthesis due to its efficient rendering
capabilities. However, 3DGS demands relatively significant GPU memory, limiting
its use on devices with restricted computational resources. Previous approaches
have focused on pruning less important Gaussians, effectively compressing 3DGS
but often requiring a fine-tuning stage and lacking adaptability for the
specific memory needs of different devices. In this work, we present an elastic
inference method for 3DGS. Given an input for the desired model size, our
method selects and transforms a subset of Gaussians, achieving substantial
rendering performance without additional fine-tuning. We introduce a tiny
learnable module that controls Gaussian selection based on the input
percentage, along with a transformation module that adjusts the selected
Gaussians to complement the performance of the reduced model. Comprehensive
experiments on ZipNeRF, MipNeRF and Tanks\&Temples scenes demonstrate the

Abstract: Object detectors often suffer a decrease in performance due to the large
domain gap between the training data (source domain) and real-world data
(target domain). Diffusion-based generative models have shown remarkable
abilities in generating high-quality and diverse images, suggesting their
potential for extracting valuable feature from various domains. To effectively
leverage the cross-domain feature representation of diffusion models, in this
paper, we train a detector with frozen-weight diffusion model on the source
domain, then employ it as a teacher model to generate pseudo labels on the
unlabeled target domain, which are used to guide the supervised learning of the
student model on the target domain. We refer to this approach as Diffusion
Domain Teacher (DDT). By employing this straightforward yet potent framework,
we significantly improve cross-domain object detection performance without
compromising the inference speed. Our method achieves an average mAP
improvement of 21.2% compared to the baseline on 6 datasets from three common
cross-domain detection benchmarks (Cross-Camera, Syn2Real, Real2Artistic},
surpassing the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by an average of 5.7%

Abstract: We present LayerFlow, a unified solution for layer-aware video generation.
Given per-layer prompts, LayerFlow generates videos for the transparent

variants like decomposing a blended video or generating the background for the
given foreground and vice versa. Starting from a text-to-video diffusion
transformer, we organize the videos for different layers as sub-clips, and
leverage layer embeddings to distinguish each clip and the corresponding
layer-wise prompts. In this way, we seamlessly support the aforementioned
variants in one unified framework. For the lack of high-quality layer-wise
training videos, we design a multi-stage training strategy to accommodate
static images with high-quality layer annotations. Specifically, we first train
the model with low-quality video data. Then, we tune a motion LoRA to make the
model compatible with static frames. Afterward, we train the content LoRA on
the mixture of image data with high-quality layered images along with
copy-pasted video data. During inference, we remove the motion LoRA thus
generating smooth videos with desired layers.

Abstract: Deep learning models have shown strong performance in classifying Alzheimer's
disease (AD) from R2* maps, but their decision-making remains opaque, raising
concerns about interpretability. Previous studies suggest biases in model
decisions, necessitating further analysis. This study uses Layer-wise Relevance
Propagation (LRP) and spectral clustering to explore classifier decision
strategies across preprocessing and training configurations using R2* maps. We
trained a 3D convolutional neural network on R2* maps, generating relevance
heatmaps via LRP and applied spectral clustering to identify dominant patterns.
t-Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) visualization was used to assess
clustering structure. Spectral clustering revealed distinct decision patterns,
with the relevance-guided model showing the clearest separation between AD and
normal control (NC) cases. The t-SNE visualization confirmed that this model
aligned heatmap groupings with the underlying subject groups. Our findings
highlight the significant impact of preprocessing and training choices on deep
learning models trained on R2* maps, even with similar performance metrics.
Spectral clustering offers a structured method to identify classification
strategy differences, emphasizing the importance of explainability in medical
AI.

Conclusion: 结论表明，类似分形结构的简单局部规则足以编码临界现象的普适性，为物理统计系综的高效生成模型提供了可能。

Abstract: We explore how minimal neural networks can invert the renormalization group
(RG) coarse-graining procedure in the two-dimensional Ising model, effectively
"dreaming up" microscopic configurations from coarse-grained states. This
task-formally impossible at the level of configurations-can be approached
probabilistically, allowing machine learning models to reconstruct
scale-invariant distributions without relying on microscopic input. We
demonstrate that even neural networks with as few as three trainable parameters
can learn to generate critical configurations, reproducing the scaling behavior
of observables such as magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity, and Binder
ratios. A real-space renormalization group analysis of the generated
configurations confirms that the models capture not only scale invariance but
also reproduce nontrivial eigenvalues of the RG transformation. Surprisingly,
we find that increasing network complexity by introducing multiple layers
offers no significant benefit. These findings suggest that simple local rules,
akin to those generating fractal structures, are sufficient to encode the
universality of critical phenomena, opening the door to efficient generative
models of statistical ensembles in physics.

Abstract: EdgeVidSum is a lightweight method that generates personalized, fast-forward
summaries of long-form videos directly on edge devices. The proposed approach
enables real-time video summarization while safeguarding user privacy through
local data processing using innovative thumbnail-based techniques and efficient
neural architectures. Unlike conventional methods that process entire videos
frame by frame, the proposed method uses thumbnail containers to significantly
reduce computational complexity without sacrificing semantic relevance. The
framework employs a hierarchical analysis approach, where a lightweight 2D CNN
model identifies user-preferred content from thumbnails and generates
timestamps to create fast-forward summaries. Our interactive demo highlights
the system's ability to create tailored video summaries for long-form videos,
such as movies, sports events, and TV shows, based on individual user
preferences. The entire computation occurs seamlessly on resource-constrained
devices like Jetson Nano, demonstrating how EdgeVidSum addresses the critical

Conclusion: FLEX推动了AQA方法向多模态和多动作场景的发展，促进了人工智能在健身领域的应用。

Abstract: With the increasing awareness of health and the growing desire for aesthetic
physique, fitness has become a prevailing trend. However, the potential risks
associated with fitness training, especially with weight-loaded fitness
actions, cannot be overlooked. Action Quality Assessment (AQA), a technology
that quantifies the quality of human action and provides feedback, holds the
potential to assist fitness enthusiasts of varying skill levels in achieving
better training outcomes. Nevertheless, current AQA methodologies and datasets
are limited to single-view competitive sports scenarios and RGB modality and
lack professional assessment and guidance of fitness actions. To address this
gap, we propose the FLEX dataset, the first multi-modal, multi-action,
large-scale dataset that incorporates surface electromyography (sEMG) signals
into AQA. FLEX utilizes high-precision MoCap to collect 20 different
weight-loaded actions performed by 38 subjects across 3 different skill levels
for 10 repetitions each, containing 5 different views of the RGB video, 3D
pose, sEMG, and physiological information. Additionally, FLEX incorporates
knowledge graphs into AQA, constructing annotation rules in the form of penalty
functions that map weight-loaded actions, action keysteps, error types, and
feedback. We conducted various baseline methodologies on FLEX, demonstrating
that multimodal data, multiview data, and fine-grained annotations
significantly enhance model performance. FLEX not only advances AQA
methodologies and datasets towards multi-modal and multi-action scenarios but
also fosters the integration of artificial intelligence within the fitness
domain. Dataset and code are available at

Abstract: Accurately estimating high-resolution carbon emissions is crucial for
effective emission governance and mitigation planning. While conventional
methods for precise carbon accounting are hindered by substantial data
collection efforts, the rise of open data and advanced learning techniques
offers a promising solution. Once an open data-based prediction model is
developed and trained, it can easily infer emissions for new areas based on
available open data. To address this, we incorporate two modalities of open
data, satellite images and point-of-interest (POI) data, to predict
high-resolution urban carbon emissions, with satellite images providing
macroscopic and static and POI data offering fine-grained and relatively
dynamic functionality information. However, estimating high-resolution carbon
emissions presents two significant challenges: the intertwined and implicit
effects of various functionalities on carbon emissions, and the complex spatial
contiguity correlations that give rise to the agglomeration effect. Our model,
OpenCarbon, features two major designs that target the challenges: a
cross-modality information extraction and fusion module to extract
complementary functionality information from two modules and model their
interactions, and a neighborhood-informed aggregation module to capture the
spatial contiguity correlations. Extensive experiments demonstrate our model's
superiority, with a significant performance gain of 26.6\% on R2. Further
generalizability tests and case studies also show OpenCarbon's capacity to
capture the intrinsic relation between urban functionalities and carbon
emissions, validating its potential to empower efficient carbon governance and
targeted carbon mitigation planning. Codes and data are available:

Abstract: Controlling defects in semiconductor processes is important for maintaining
yield, improving production cost, and preventing time-dependent critical
component failures. Electron beam-based imaging has been used as a tool to
survey wafers in the line and inspect for defects. However, manual
classification of images for these nano-scale defects is limited by time, labor
constraints, and human biases. In recent years, deep learning computer vision
algorithms have shown to be effective solutions for image-based inspection
applications in industry. This work proposes application of vision transformer
(ViT) neural networks for automatic defect classification (ADC) of scanning
electron microscope (SEM) images of wafer defects. We evaluated our proposed
methods on 300mm wafer semiconductor defect data from our fab in IBM Albany. We
studied 11 defect types from over 7400 total images and investigated the
potential of transfer learning of DinoV2 and semi-supervised learning for
improved classification accuracy and efficient computation. We were able to
achieve classification accuracies of over 90% with less than 15 images per
defect class. Our work demonstrates the potential to apply the proposed
framework for a platform agnostic in-house classification tool with faster
turnaround time and flexibility.

Abstract: Environmental soundscapes convey substantial ecological and social
information regarding urban environments; however, their potential remains
largely untapped in large-scale geographic analysis. In this study, we
investigate the extent to which urban sounds correspond with visual scenes by
comparing various visual representation strategies in capturing acoustic
semantics. We employ a multimodal approach that integrates geo-referenced sound
recordings with both street-level and remote sensing imagery across three major
global cities: London, New York, and Tokyo. Utilizing the AST model for audio,
along with CLIP and RemoteCLIP for imagery, as well as CLIPSeg and Seg-Earth OV
for semantic segmentation, we extract embeddings and class-level features to
evaluate cross-modal similarity. The results indicate that street view
embeddings demonstrate stronger alignment with environmental sounds compared to
segmentation outputs, whereas remote sensing segmentation is more effective in
interpreting ecological categories through a Biophony--Geophony--Anthrophony
(BGA) framework. These findings imply that embedding-based models offer
superior semantic alignment, while segmentation-based methods provide
interpretable links between visual structure and acoustic ecology. This work
advances the burgeoning field of multimodal urban sensing by offering novel
perspectives for incorporating sound into geospatial analysis.

Abstract: This paper investigates how rendering engines, like Unreal Engine 4 (UE), can
be used to create synthetic images to supplement datasets for deep computer
vision (CV) models in image abundant and image limited use cases. Using
rendered synthetic images from UE can provide developers and businesses with a
method of accessing nearly unlimited, reproducible, agile, and cheap training
sets for their customers and applications without the threat of poisoned images
from the internet or the cost of collecting them. The validity of these
generated images are examined by testing the change in model test accuracy in
two different sized CV models across two binary classification cases (Cat vs
Dog and Weld Defect Detection). In addition, this paper provides an
implementation of how to measure the quality of synthetic images by using
pre-trained CV models as auditors. Results imply that for large (VGG16) and
small (MobileNetV3-small) parameter deep CV models, adding >60% additional
synthetic images to a real image dataset during model training can narrow the
test-training accuracy gap to ~1-2% without a conclusive effect on test
accuracy compared to using real world images alone. Likewise, adding <10%
additional real training images to synthetic only training sets decreased the
classification error rate in half, then decreasing further when adding more
real training images. For these cases tested, using synthetic images from
rendering engines allow researchers to only use 10% of their real images during
training, compared to the traditional 50-70%. This research serves as an
example of how to create synthetic images, guidelines on how to use the images,
potential restrictions and possible performance improvements for data-scarce
projects.

Abstract: Skeleton-based human action recognition has received widespread attention in
recent years due to its diverse range of application scenarios. Due to the
different sources of human skeletons, skeleton data naturally exhibit
heterogeneity. The previous works, however, overlook the heterogeneity of human
skeletons and solely construct models tailored for homogeneous skeletons. This
work addresses the challenge of heterogeneous skeleton-based action
representation learning, specifically focusing on processing skeleton data that
varies in joint dimensions and topological structures. The proposed framework
comprises two primary components: heterogeneous skeleton processing and unified
representation learning. The former first converts two-dimensional skeleton
data into three-dimensional skeleton via an auxiliary network, and then
constructs a prompted unified skeleton using skeleton-specific prompts. We also
design an additional modality named semantic motion encoding to harness the
semantic information within skeletons. The latter module learns a unified
action representation using a shared backbone network that processes different
heterogeneous skeletons. Extensive experiments on the NTU-60, NTU-120, and
PKU-MMD II datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in various
tasks of action understanding. Our approach can be applied to action
recognition in robots with different humanoid structures.

Abstract: The denoising diffusion probabilistic model has become a mainstream

hallucination and integrated multi-scale enhancement framework for time series
diffusion models. By employing multi-scale decomposition and adaptive
integration, CHIME captures the decomposed features of time series, achieving
in-domain distribution alignment between generated and original samples. In
addition, we introduce a feature hallucination module in the conditional
denoising process, enabling the transfer of temporal features through the
training of category-independent transformation layers. Experimental results on
publicly available real-world datasets demonstrate that CHIME achieves
state-of-the-art performance and exhibits excellent generative generalization
capabilities in few-shot scenarios.

Inter-Frequency Interaction (IFI) that enhances enriched features and filters
latent features via combinatorial interactions between heterogeneous

Abstract: Learning to use tools or objects in common scenes, particularly handling them

trajectories with the associated textual action description, we develop
trajectory generation models based on visual and point cloud-based language
models. In the recently proposed egocentric vision-based in-a-quality

Result: 实验表明，PlückeRF在重建质量上优于现有的三平面表示方法和最先进的feedforward重建方法。

Conclusion: PlückeRF为少视角3D重建提供了一种更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D reconstruction methods aim to predict the 3D structure of a
scene directly from input images, providing a faster alternative to per-scene
optimization approaches. Significant progress has been made in single-view and
few-view reconstruction using learned priors that infer object shape and
appearance, even for unobserved regions. However, there is substantial
potential to enhance these methods by better leveraging information from
multiple views when available. To address this, we propose a few-view
reconstruction model that more effectively harnesses multi-view information.
Our approach introduces a simple mechanism that connects the 3D representation
with pixel rays from the input views, allowing for preferential sharing of
information between nearby 3D locations and between 3D locations and nearby
pixel rays. We achieve this by defining the 3D representation as a set of
structured, feature-augmented lines; the Pl\"uckeRF representation. Using this
representation, we demonstrate improvements in reconstruction quality over the
equivalent triplane representation and state-of-the-art feedforward
reconstruction methods.

Abstract: Automatically estimating animal poses from videos is important for studying
animal behaviors. Existing methods do not perform reliably since they are
trained on datasets that are not comprehensive enough to capture all necessary
animal behaviors. However, it is very challenging to collect such datasets due
to the large variations in animal morphology. In this paper, we propose an
animal pose labeling pipeline that follows a different strategy, i.e. test time
optimization. Given a video, we fine-tune a lightweight appearance embedding
inside a pre-trained general-purpose point tracker on a sparse set of annotated
frames. These annotations can be obtained from human labelers or off-the-shelf
pose detectors. The fine-tuned model is then applied to the rest of the frames
for automatic labeling. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance at a
reasonable annotation cost. We believe our pipeline offers a valuable tool for
the automatic quantification of animal behavior. Visit our project webpage at

Conclusion: JointSplat通过概率联合优化光流和深度，实现了高保真稀疏视角3D重建。

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D scenes from sparse viewpoints is a long-standing challenge
with wide applications. Recent advances in feed-forward 3D Gaussian sparse-view
reconstruction methods provide an efficient solution for real-time novel view
synthesis by leveraging geometric priors learned from large-scale multi-view
datasets and computing 3D Gaussian centers via back-projection. Despite
offering strong geometric cues, both feed-forward multi-view depth estimation
and flow-depth joint estimation face key limitations: the former suffers from
mislocation and artifact issues in low-texture or repetitive regions, while the
latter is prone to local noise and global inconsistency due to unreliable
matches when ground-truth flow supervision is unavailable. To overcome this, we
propose JointSplat, a unified framework that leverages the complementarity
between optical flow and depth via a novel probabilistic optimization
mechanism. Specifically, this pixel-level mechanism scales the information
fusion between depth and flow based on the matching probability of optical flow
during training. Building upon the above mechanism, we further propose a novel
multi-view depth-consistency loss to leverage the reliability of supervision
while suppressing misleading gradients in uncertain areas. Evaluated on
RealEstate10K and ACID, JointSplat consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed
probabilistic joint flow-depth optimization approach for high-fidelity
sparse-view 3D reconstruction.

Result: 实验表明，DSFN在公共数据集上优于其他顺序处理方法，网络规模更小且处理速度更快。

Conclusion: DSFN通过联合处理多因素退化问题，显著提升了视频增强的效率和效果。

Abstract: Video quality is often severely degraded by multiple factors rather than a
single factor. These low-quality videos can be restored to high-quality videos
by sequentially performing appropriate video enhancement techniques. However,
the sequential approach was inefficient and sub-optimal because most video
enhancement approaches were designed without taking into account that multiple
factors together degrade video quality. In this paper, we propose a new joint
video enhancement method that mitigates multiple degradation factors
simultaneously by resolving an integrated enhancement problem. Our proposed
network, named DSFN, directly produces a high-resolution, high-frame-rate, and
clear video from a low-resolution, low-frame-rate, and blurry video. In the
DSFN, low-resolution and blurry input frames are enhanced by a joint deblurring
and super-resolution (JDSR) module. Meanwhile, intermediate frames between
input adjacent frames are interpolated by a triple-frame-based frame
interpolation (TFBFI) module. The proper combination of the proposed modules of
DSFN can achieve superior performance on the joint video enhancement task.
Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other sequential
state-of-the-art techniques on public datasets with a smaller network size and
faster processing time.

Abstract: Event-based sensors offer significant advantages over traditional frame-based
cameras, especially in scenarios involving rapid motion or challenging lighting
conditions. However, event data frequently suffers from considerable noise,
negatively impacting the performance and robustness of deep learning models.
Traditionally, this problem has been addressed by applying filtering algorithms
to the event stream, but this may also remove some of relevant data. In this
paper, we propose a novel noise-injection training methodology designed to
enhance the neural networks robustness against varying levels of event noise.
Our approach introduces controlled noise directly into the training data,
enabling models to learn noise-resilient representations. We have conducted
extensive evaluations of the proposed method using multiple benchmark datasets
(N-Caltech101, N-Cars, and Mini N-ImageNet) and various network architectures,
including Convolutional Neural Networks, Vision Transformers, Spiking Neural
Networks, and Graph Convolutional Networks. Experimental results show that our
noise-injection training strategy achieves stable performance over a range of
noise intensities, consistently outperforms event-filtering techniques, and
achieves the highest average classification accuracy, making it a viable
alternative to traditional event-data filtering methods in an object
classification system. Code: https://github.com/vision-agh/DVS_Filtering

Abstract: Complete blood cell detection holds significant value in clinical
diagnostics. Conventional manual microscopy methods suffer from time
inefficiency and diagnostic inaccuracies. Existing automated detection
approaches remain constrained by high deployment costs and suboptimal accuracy.
While deep learning has introduced powerful paradigms to this field, persistent
challenges in detecting overlapping cells and multi-scale objects hinder
practical deployment. This study proposes the multi-scale YOLO (MS-YOLO), a
blood cell detection model based on the YOLOv11 framework, incorporating three
key architectural innovations to enhance detection performance. Specifically,
the multi-scale dilated residual module (MS-DRM) replaces the original C3K2
modules to improve multi-scale discriminability; the dynamic cross-path feature
enhancement module (DCFEM) enables the fusion of hierarchical features from the
backbone with aggregated features from the neck to enhance feature
representations; and the light adaptive-weight downsampling module (LADS)
improves feature downsampling through adaptive spatial weighting while reducing
computational complexity. Experimental results on the CBC benchmark demonstrate
that MS-YOLO achieves precise detection of overlapping cells and multi-scale
objects, particularly small targets such as platelets, achieving an mAP@50 of
97.4% that outperforms existing models. Further validation on the supplementary
WBCDD dataset confirms its robust generalization capability. Additionally, with
a lightweight architecture and real-time inference efficiency, MS-YOLO meets
clinical deployment requirements, providing reliable technical support for
standardized blood pathology assessment.

Abstract: Monitoring aerial objects is crucial for security, wildlife conservation, and

recognizing flying objects, in particular animals that may not follow short and
long-term predictable patters. Event cameras offer high temporal resolution,
low latency, and robustness to motion blur, making them well-suited for this
task. We introduce EV-Flying, an event-based dataset of flying objects,
comprising manually annotated birds, insects and drones with spatio-temporal
bounding boxes and track identities. To effectively process the asynchronous
event streams, we employ a point-based approach leveraging lightweight
architectures inspired by PointNet. Our study investigates the classification
of flying objects using point cloud-based event representations. The proposed
dataset and methodology pave the way for more efficient and reliable aerial
object recognition in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Achieving high-fidelity 3D surface reconstruction while preserving fine
details remains challenging, especially in the presence of materials with
complex reflectance properties and without a dense-view setup. In this paper,
we introduce a versatile framework that incorporates multi-view normal and
optionally reflectance maps into radiance-based surface reconstruction. Our
approach employs a pixel-wise joint re-parametrization of reflectance and
surface normals, representing them as a vector of radiances under simulated,
varying illumination. This formulation enables seamless incorporation into
standard surface reconstruction pipelines, such as traditional multi-view
stereo (MVS) frameworks or modern neural volume rendering (NVR) ones. Combined
with the latter, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on
multi-view photometric stereo (MVPS) benchmark datasets, including DiLiGenT-MV,
LUCES-MV and Skoltech3D. In particular, our method excels in reconstructing
fine-grained details and handling challenging visibility conditions. The

Abstract: Video super-resolution (VSR) is a prominent research topic in low-level

role. The rapid progress in deep learning and its applications in VSR has led
to a proliferation of tools and techniques in the literature. However, the
usage of these methods is often not adequately explained, and decisions are
primarily driven by quantitative improvements. Given the significance of VSR's
potential influence across multiple domains, it is imperative to conduct a
comprehensive analysis of the elements and deep learning methodologies employed
in VSR research. This methodical analysis will facilitate the informed
development of models tailored to specific application needs. In this paper, we
present an overarching overview of deep learning-based video super-resolution
models, investigating each component and discussing its implications.
Furthermore, we provide a synopsis of key components and technologies employed
by state-of-the-art and earlier VSR models. By elucidating the underlying
methodologies and categorising them systematically, we identified trends,
requirements, and challenges in the domain. As a first-of-its-kind survey of
deep learning-based VSR models, this work also establishes a multi-level

Abstract: Real-world applications like video gaming and virtual reality often demand
the ability to model 3D scenes that users can explore along custom camera

remains a complex and challenging problem. In this work, we present Voyager, a
novel video diffusion framework that generates world-consistent 3D point-cloud

approaches, Voyager achieves end-to-end scene generation and reconstruction
with inherent consistency across frames, eliminating the need for 3D

Our method integrates three key components: 1) World-Consistent Video
Diffusion: A unified architecture that jointly generates aligned RGB and depth
video sequences, conditioned on existing world observation to ensure global
coherence 2) Long-Range World Exploration: An efficient world cache with point
culling and an auto-regressive inference with smooth video sampling for
iterative scene extension with context-aware consistency, and 3) Scalable Data
Engine: A video reconstruction pipeline that automates camera pose estimation
and metric depth prediction for arbitrary videos, enabling large-scale, diverse
training data curation without manual 3D annotations. Collectively, these

Conclusion: INR为稀疏数据下的动态光声图像重建提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了时间分辨率和图像质量。

Abstract: Dynamic Photoacoustic Computed Tomography (PACT) is an important imaging
technique for monitoring physiological processes, capable of providing
high-contrast images of optical absorption at much greater depths than
traditional optical imaging methods. However, practical instrumentation and
geometric constraints limit the number of acoustic sensors available around the
imaging target, leading to sparsity in sensor data. Traditional photoacoustic
(PA) image reconstruction methods, when directly applied to sparse PA data,
produce severe artifacts. Additionally, these traditional methods do not
consider the inter-frame relationships in dynamic imaging. Temporal resolution
is crucial for dynamic photoacoustic imaging, which is fundamentally limited by
the low repetition rate (e.g., 20 Hz) and high cost of high-power laser
technology. Recently, Implicit Neural Representation (INR) has emerged as a
powerful deep learning tool for solving inverse problems with sparse data, by
characterizing signal properties as continuous functions of their coordinates
in an unsupervised manner. In this work, we propose an INR-based method to
improve dynamic photoacoustic image reconstruction from sparse-views and
enhance temporal resolution, using only spatiotemporal coordinates as input.
Specifically, the proposed INR represents dynamic photoacoustic images as
implicit functions and encodes them into a neural network. The weights of the
network are learned solely from the acquired sparse sensor data, without the
need for external training datasets or prior images. Benefiting from the strong
implicit continuity regularization provided by INR, as well as explicit
regularization for low-rank and sparsity, our proposed method outperforms
traditional reconstruction methods under two different sparsity conditions,
effectively suppressing artifacts and ensuring image quality.

to remotely extract 3D structural vibration spectra, offering a low-power,
cost-effective and scalable solution. This architecture eliminates the need for
dense sensor arrays or extensive data acquisition; instead, it uses a
spatially-optimized passive diffractive layer that encodes 3D structural
displacements into modulated light, captured by a minimal number of detectors
and decoded in real-time by shallow and low-power neural networks to
reconstruct the 3D displacement spectra of structures. The diffractive system's
efficacy was demonstrated both numerically and experimentally using
millimeter-wave illumination on a laboratory-scale building model with a
programmable shake table. Our system achieves more than an order-of-magnitude
improvement in accuracy over conventional optics or separately trained modules,
establishing a foundation for high-throughput 3D monitoring of structures.
Beyond SHM, the 3D vibration monitoring capabilities of this cost-effective and
data-efficient framework establish a new computational sensing modality with
potential applications in disaster resilience, aerospace diagnostics, and
autonomous navigation, where energy efficiency, low latency, and
high-throughput are critical.

Abstract: Skin cancer is among the most prevalent and life-threatening diseases
worldwide, with early detection being critical to patient outcomes. This work
presents a hybrid machine and deep learning-based approach for classifying
malignant and benign skin lesions using the SLICE-3D dataset from ISIC 2024,
which comprises 401,059 cropped lesion images extracted from 3D Total Body
Photography (TBP), emulating non-dermoscopic, smartphone-like conditions. Our
method combines vision transformers (EVA02) and our designed convolutional ViT
hybrid (EdgeNeXtSAC) to extract robust features, employing a
segmentation-assisted classification pipeline to enhance lesion localization.
Predictions from these models are fused with a gradient-boosted decision tree
(GBDT) ensemble enriched by engineered features and patient-specific relational
metrics. To address class imbalance and improve generalization, we augment
malignant cases with Stable Diffusion-generated synthetic lesions and apply a
diagnosis-informed relabeling strategy to harmonize external datasets into a
3-class format. Using partial AUC (pAUC) above 80 percent true positive rate
(TPR) as the evaluation metric, our approach achieves a pAUC of 0.1755 -- the
highest among all configurations. These results underscore the potential of
hybrid, interpretable AI systems for skin cancer triage in telemedicine and
resource-constrained settings.

Conclusion: 结合音频和视觉特征的多模态方法能有效提升有害内容检测性能。

Abstract: As video-sharing platforms have grown over the past decade, child viewership
has surged, increasing the need for precise detection of harmful content like
violence or explicit scenes. Malicious users exploit moderation systems by
embedding unsafe content in minimal frames to evade detection. While prior
research has focused on visual cues and advanced such fine-grained detection,
audio features remain underexplored. In this study, we embed audio cues with
visual for fine-grained child harmful content detection and introduce SNIFR, a
novel framework for effective alignment. SNIFR employs a transformer encoder
for intra-modality interaction, followed by a cascaded cross-transformer for
inter-modality alignment. Our approach achieves superior performance over
unimodal and baseline fusion methods, setting a new state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Reconstructing articulated objects prevalent in daily environments is crucial
for applications in augmented/virtual reality and robotics. However, existing
methods face scalability limitations (requiring 3D supervision or costly
annotations), robustness issues (being susceptible to local optima), and
rendering shortcomings (lacking speed or photorealism). We introduce SplArt, a
self-supervised, category-agnostic framework that leverages 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) to reconstruct articulated objects and infer kinematics from
two sets of posed RGB images captured at different articulation states,
enabling real-time photorealistic rendering for novel viewpoints and
articulations. SplArt augments 3DGS with a differentiable mobility parameter
per Gaussian, achieving refined part segmentation. A multi-stage optimization
strategy is employed to progressively handle reconstruction, part segmentation,
and articulation estimation, significantly enhancing robustness and accuracy.
SplArt exploits geometric self-supervision, effectively addressing challenging
scenarios without requiring 3D annotations or category-specific priors.
Evaluations on established and newly proposed benchmarks, along with
applications to real-world scenarios using a handheld RGB camera, demonstrate
SplArt's state-of-the-art performance and real-world practicality. Code is

Result: 实验表明，该方法在低计数数据下提高了重建精度，同时保留了PET独特的图像特征。

Conclusion: 该方法为医学成像任务提供了一种无需大规模训练数据或生成式深度学习的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent work has shown improved lesion detectability and flexibility to
reconstruction hyperparameters (e.g. scanner geometry or dose level) when PET
images are reconstructed by leveraging pre-trained diffusion models. Such
methods train a diffusion model (without sinogram data) on high-quality, but
still noisy, PET images. In this work, we propose a simple method for
generating subject-specific PET images from a dataset of multi-subject PET-MR
scans, synthesizing "pseudo-PET" images by transforming between different
patients' anatomy using image registration. The images we synthesize retain
information from the subject's MR scan, leading to higher resolution and the
retention of anatomical features compared to the original set of PET images.
With simulated and real [$^{18}$F]FDG datasets, we show that pre-training a
personalized diffusion model with subject-specific "pseudo-PET" images improves
reconstruction accuracy with low-count data. In particular, the method shows
promise in combining information from a guidance MR scan without overly
imposing anatomical features, demonstrating an improved trade-off between
reconstructing PET-unique image features versus features present in both PET
and MR. We believe this approach for generating and utilizing synthetic data
has further applications to medical imaging tasks, particularly because
patient-specific PET images can be generated without resorting to generative
deep learning or large training datasets.

Abstract: Incidental detection and quantification of coronary calcium in CT scans could
lead to the early introduction of lifesaving clinical interventions. However,
over-reporting could negatively affect patient wellbeing and unnecessarily
burden the medical system. Therefore, careful considerations should be taken
when automatically reporting coronary calcium scores. A cluster-based
conditional conformal prediction framework is proposed to provide score
intervals with calibrated coverage from trained segmentation networks without
retraining. The proposed method was tuned and used to calibrate predictive
intervals for 3D UNet models (deterministic, MCDropout and deep ensemble)
reaching similar coverage with better triage metrics compared to conventional
conformal prediction. Meaningful predictive intervals of calcium scores could
help triage patients according to the confidence of their risk category

Abstract: Human beings rely heavily on estimation of poses in order to access their
body movements. Human pose estimation methods take advantage of computer vision
advances in order to track human body movements in real life applications. This
comes from videos which are recorded through available devices. These
para-digms provide potential to make human movement measurement more accessible

content tend to supplement available videos. This has increased pose estimation
software usage to estimate human poses. In order to address this problem, we
develop hybrid-ensemble-based group pose estimation method to improve human
health. This proposed hybrid-ensemble-based group pose estimation method aims
to detect multi-person poses using modified group pose estimation and modified
real time pose estimation. This ensemble allows fusion of performance of stated
methods in real time. The input poses from images are fed into individual
meth-ods. The pose transformation method helps to identify relevant features
for en-semble to perform training effectively. After this, customized
pre-trained hybrid ensemble is trained on public benchmarked datasets which is
being evaluated through test datasets. The effectiveness and viability of
proposed method is estab-lished based on comparative analysis of group pose
estimation methods and ex-periments conducted on benchmarked datasets. It
provides best optimized results in real-time pose estimation. It makes pose
estimation method more robust to oc-clusion and improves dense regression

Abstract: The rapid global loss of biodiversity, particularly among insects, represents
an urgent ecological crisis. Current methods for insect species discovery are
manual, slow, and severely constrained by taxonomic expertise, hindering timely
conservation actions. We introduce TerraIncognita, a dynamic benchmark designed
to evaluate state-of-the-art multimodal models for the challenging problem of
identifying unknown, potentially undescribed insect species from image data.
Our benchmark dataset combines a mix of expertly annotated images of insect
species likely known to frontier AI models, and images of rare and poorly known
species, for which few/no publicly available images exist. These images were
collected from underexplored biodiversity hotspots, realistically mimicking
open-world discovery scenarios faced by ecologists. The benchmark assesses
models' proficiency in hierarchical taxonomic classification, their capability
to detect and abstain from out-of-distribution (OOD) samples representing novel
species, and their ability to generate explanations aligned with expert
taxonomic knowledge. Notably, top-performing models achieve over 90\% F1 at the
Order level on known species, but drop below 2\% at the Species level,
highlighting the sharp difficulty gradient from coarse to fine taxonomic
prediction (Order $\rightarrow$ Family $\rightarrow$ Genus $\rightarrow$
Species). TerraIncognita will be updated regularly, and by committing to
quarterly dataset expansions (of both known and novel species), will provide an
evolving platform for longitudinal benchmarking of frontier AI methods. All

Abstract: Unintentional or accidental falls are one of the significant health issues in
senior persons. The population of senior persons is increasing steadily. So,
there is a need for an automated fall detection monitoring system. This paper
introduces a vision-based fall detection system using a pre-trained 3D CNN.
Unlike 2D CNN, 3D CNN extracts not only spatial but also temporal features. The
proposed model leverages the original learned weights of a 3D CNN model
pre-trained on the Sports1M dataset to extract the spatio-temporal features.
Only the SVM classifier was trained, which saves the time required to train the
3D CNN. Stratified shuffle five split cross-validation has been used to split
the dataset into training and testing data. Extracted features from the
proposed 3D CNN model were fed to an SVM classifier to classify the activity as
fall or ADL. Two datasets, GMDCSA and CAUCAFall, were utilized to conduct the
experiment. The source code for this work can be accessed via the following

Abstract: Current benchmarks for sign language recognition (SLR) focus mainly on
isolated SLR, while there are limited datasets for continuous SLR (CSLR), which
recognizes sequences of signs in a video. Additionally, existing CSLR datasets
are collected in controlled settings, which restricts their effectiveness in
building robust real-world CSLR systems. To address these limitations, we
present Isharah, a large multi-scene dataset for CSLR. It is the first dataset
of its type and size that has been collected in an unconstrained environment
using signers' smartphone cameras. This setup resulted in high variations of
recording settings, camera distances, angles, and resolutions. This variation
helps with developing sign language understanding models capable of handling
the variability and complexity of real-world scenarios. The dataset consists of
30,000 video clips performed by 18 deaf and professional signers. Additionally,
the dataset is linguistically rich as it provides a gloss-level annotation for
all dataset's videos, making it useful for developing CSLR and sign language
translation (SLT) systems. This paper also introduces multiple sign language
understanding benchmarks, including signer-independent and unseen-sentence
CSLR, along with gloss-based and gloss-free SLT. The Isharah dataset is

Conclusion: DSSAU-Net在胎儿头部和耻骨联合分割任务中表现出色，为超声辅助诊断提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In the childbirth process, traditional methods involve invasive vaginal
examinations, but research has shown that these methods are both subjective and
inaccurate. Ultrasound-assisted diagnosis offers an objective yet effective way
to assess fetal head position via two key parameters: Angle of Progression
(AoP) and Head-Symphysis Distance (HSD), calculated by segmenting the fetal
head (FH) and pubic symphysis (PS), which aids clinicians in ensuring a smooth
delivery process. Therefore, accurate segmentation of FH and PS is crucial. In
this work, we propose a sparse self-attention network architecture with good
performance and high computational efficiency, named DSSAU-Net, for the
segmentation of FH and PS. Specifically, we stack varying numbers of Dual
Sparse Selection Attention (DSSA) blocks at each stage to form a symmetric
U-shaped encoder-decoder network architecture. For a given query, DSSA is
designed to explicitly perform one sparse token selection at both the region
and pixel levels, respectively, which is beneficial for further reducing
computational complexity while extracting the most relevant features. To
compensate for the information loss during the upsampling process, skip
connections with convolutions are designed. Additionally, multiscale feature
fusion is employed to enrich the model's global and local information. The
performance of DSSAU-Net has been validated using the Intrapartum Ultrasound
Grand Challenge (IUGC) 2024 \textit{test set} provided by the organizer in the

Conclusion: FSHNet通过改进特征提取和优化策略，显著提升了稀疏3D检测器的性能。

Abstract: Fully sparse 3D detectors have recently gained significant attention due to
their efficiency in long-range detection. However, sparse 3D detectors extract
features only from non-empty voxels, which impairs long-range interactions and
causes the center feature missing. The former weakens the feature extraction
capability, while the latter hinders network optimization. To address these
challenges, we introduce the Fully Sparse Hybrid Network (FSHNet). FSHNet
incorporates a proposed SlotFormer block to enhance the long-range feature
extraction capability of existing sparse encoders. The SlotFormer divides
sparse voxels using a slot partition approach, which, compared to traditional
window partition, provides a larger receptive field. Additionally, we propose a
dynamic sparse label assignment strategy to deeply optimize the network by
providing more high-quality positive samples. To further enhance performance,
we introduce a sparse upsampling module to refine downsampled voxels,
preserving fine-grained details crucial for detecting small objects. Extensive
experiments on the Waymo, nuScenes, and Argoverse2 benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of FSHNet. The code is available at

Conclusion: DAN通过合理利用相邻帧信息，显著提升了视频去模糊性能。

Abstract: In contrast to single-image deblurring, video deblurring has the advantage
that neighbor frames can be utilized to deblur a target frame. However,
existing video deblurring algorithms often fail to properly employ the neighbor
frames, resulting in sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a
deconvolution and aggregation network (DAN) for video deblurring that utilizes
the information of neighbor frames well. In DAN, both deconvolution and
aggregation strategies are achieved through three sub-networks: the
preprocessing network (PPN) and the alignment-based deconvolution network
(ABDN) for the deconvolution scheme; the frame aggregation network (FAN) for
the aggregation scheme. In the deconvolution part, blurry inputs are first
preprocessed by the PPN with non-local operations. Then, the output frames from
the PPN are deblurred by the ABDN based on the frame alignment. In the FAN,
these deblurred frames from the deconvolution part are combined into a latent
frame according to reliability maps which infer pixel-wise sharpness. The
proper combination of three sub-networks can achieve favorable performance on
video deblurring by using the neighbor frames suitably. In experiments, the
proposed DAN was demonstrated to be superior to existing state-of-the-art
methods through both quantitative and qualitative evaluations on the public

Conclusion: GlobalBuildingAtlas为全球建筑现状提供新视角，支持可持续发展目标分析。

Abstract: We introduce GlobalBuildingAtlas, a publicly available dataset providing
global and complete coverage of building polygons, heights and Level of Detail
1 (LoD1) 3D building models. This is the first open dataset to offer high
quality, consistent, and complete building data in 2D and 3D form at the
individual building level on a global scale. Towards this dataset, we developed
machine learning-based pipelines to derive building polygons and heights
(called GBA.Height) from global PlanetScope satellite data, respectively. Also
a quality-based fusion strategy was employed to generate higher-quality
polygons (called GBA.Polygon) based on existing open building polygons,
including our own derived one. With more than 2.75 billion buildings worldwide,
GBA.Polygon surpasses the most comprehensive database to date by more than 1
billion buildings. GBA.Height offers the most detailed and accurate global 3D
building height maps to date, achieving a spatial resolution of 3x3 meters-30
times finer than previous global products (90 m), enabling a high-resolution
and reliable analysis of building volumes at both local and global scales.
Finally, we generated a global LoD1 building model (called GBA.LoD1) from the
resulting GBA.Polygon and GBA.Height. GBA.LoD1 represents the first complete
global LoD1 building models, including 2.68 billion building instances with
predicted heights, i.e., with a height completeness of more than 97%, achieving
RMSEs ranging from 1.5 m to 8.9 m across different continents. With its height
accuracy, comprehensive global coverage and rich spatial details,
GlobalBuildingAltas offers novel insights on the status quo of global
buildings, which unlocks unprecedented geospatial analysis possibilities, as
showcased by a better illustration of where people live and a more
comprehensive monitoring of the progress on the 11th Sustainable Development

Conclusion: 统一系统能有效解决Re-ID中的挑战，尤其是属性不平衡问题。

Abstract: Person Re-Identification (Re-ID) is a very important task in video
surveillance systems such as tracking people, finding people in public places,
or analysing customer behavior in supermarkets. Although there have been many
works to solve this problem, there are still remaining challenges such as
large-scale datasets, imbalanced data, viewpoint, fine grained data
(attributes), the Local Features are not employed at semantic level in online
stage of Re-ID task, furthermore, the imbalanced data problem of attributes are
not taken into consideration. This paper has proposed a Unified Re-ID system
consisted of three main modules such as Pedestrian Attribute Ontology (PAO),
Local Multi-task DCNN (Local MDCNN), Imbalance Data Solver (IDS). The new main
point of our Re-ID system is the power of mutual support of PAO, Local MDCNN
and IDS to exploit the inner-group correlations of attributes and pre-filter
the mismatch candidates from Gallery set based on semantic information as
Fashion Attributes and Facial Attributes, to solve the imbalanced data of
attributes without adjusting network architecture and data augmentation. We
experimented on the well-known Market1501 dataset. The experimental results
have shown the effectiveness of our Re-ID system and it could achieve the
higher performance on Market1501 dataset in comparison to some state-of-the-art
Re-ID methods.

Abstract: Digitizing cultural heritage collections has become crucial for preservation

Conclusion: 数据驱动方法能更客观地识别高曝光位置，为户外广告和设施选址提供科学依据。

Abstract: Effective placement of Out-of-Home advertising and street furniture requires
accurate identification of locations offering maximum visual exposure to target
audiences, particularly vehicular traffic. Traditional site selection methods
often rely on static traffic counts or subjective assessments. This research
introduces a data-driven methodology to objectively quantify location
visibility by analyzing large-scale connected vehicle trajectory data (sourced
from Compass IoT) within urban environments. We model the dynamic driver
field-of-view using a forward-projected visibility area for each vehicle
position derived from interpolated trajectories. By integrating this with
building vertex locations extracted from OpenStreetMap, we quantify the
cumulative visual exposure, or ``visibility count'', for thousands of potential
points of interest near roadways. The analysis reveals that visibility is
highly concentrated, identifying specific ``visual hotspots'' that receive
disproportionately high exposure compared to average locations. The core
technical contribution involves the construction of a BallTree spatial index
over building vertices. This enables highly efficient (O(logN) complexity)
radius queries to determine which vertices fall within the viewing circles of
millions of trajectory points across numerous trips, significantly
outperforming brute-force geometric checks. Analysis reveals two key findings:
1) Visibility is highly concentrated, identifying distinct 'visual hotspots'
receiving disproportionately high exposure compared to average locations. 2)
The aggregated visibility counts across vertices conform to a Log-Normal
distribution.

Abstract: Existing facial appearance capture methods can reconstruct plausible facial
reflectance from smartphone-recorded videos. However, the reconstruction
quality is still far behind the ones based on studio recordings. This paper
fills the gap by developing a novel daily-used solution with a co-located
smartphone and flashlight video capture setting in a dim room. To enhance the
quality, our key observation is to solve facial reflectance maps within the
data distribution of studio-scanned ones. Specifically, we first learn a
diffusion prior over the Light Stage scans and then steer it to produce the
reflectance map that best matches the captured images. We propose to train the
diffusion prior at the patch level to improve generalization ability and
training stability, as current Light Stage datasets are in ultra-high
resolution but limited in data size. Tailored to this prior, we propose a
patch-level posterior sampling technique to sample seamless full-resolution
reflectance maps from this patch-level diffusion model. Experiments demonstrate
our method closes the quality gap between low-cost and studio recordings by a
large margin, opening the door for everyday users to clone themselves to the
digital world. Our code will be released at https://github.com/yxuhan/DoRA.

Abstract: Early detection of crop stress is vital for minimizing yield loss and
enabling timely intervention in precision agriculture. Traditional approaches
using NDRE often detect stress only after visible symptoms appear or require
labeled datasets, limiting scalability. This study introduces EigenCL, a novel
unsupervised contrastive learning framework guided by temporal NDRE dynamics
and biologically grounded eigen decomposition. Using over 10,000 Sentinel-2
NDRE image patches from drought-affected Iowa cornfields, we constructed
five-point NDRE time series per patch and derived an RBF similarity matrix. The
principal eigenvector explaining 76% of the variance and strongly correlated (r
= 0.95) with raw NDRE values was used to define stress-aware similarity for
contrastive embedding learning. Unlike existing methods that rely on visual
augmentations, EigenCL pulls embeddings together based on biologically similar
stress trajectories and pushes apart divergent ones. The learned embeddings
formed physiologically meaningful clusters, achieving superior clustering
metrics (Silhouette: 0.748, DBI: 0.35) and enabling 76% early stress detection
up to 12 days before conventional NDRE thresholds. Downstream classification
yielded 95% k-NN and 91% logistic regression accuracy. Validation on an
independent 2023 Nebraska dataset confirmed generalizability without
retraining. EigenCL offers a label-free, scalable approach for early stress
detection that aligns with underlying plant physiology and is suitable for
real-world deployment in data-scarce agricultural environments.

Abstract: Recent learning-based methods for event-based optical flow estimation utilize
cost volumes for pixel matching but suffer from redundant computations and
limited scalability to higher resolutions for flow refinement. In this work, we
take advantage of the complementarity between temporally dense feature
differences of adjacent event frames and cost volume and present a lightweight
event-based optical flow network (EDCFlow) to achieve high-quality flow
estimation at a higher resolution. Specifically, an attention-based multi-scale
temporal feature difference layer is developed to capture diverse motion
patterns at high resolution in a computation-efficient manner. An adaptive
fusion of high-resolution difference motion features and low-resolution
correlation motion features is performed to enhance motion representation and
model generalization. Notably, EDCFlow can serve as a plug-and-play refinement
module for RAFT-like event-based methods to enhance flow details. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that EDCFlow achieves better performance with lower
complexity compared to existing methods, offering superior generalization.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of photography has created a growing demand for a
practical blind raw image denoising method. Recently, learning-based methods
have become mainstream due to their excellent performance. However, most
existing learning-based methods suffer from camera-specific data dependency,
resulting in performance drops when applied to data from unknown cameras. To
address this challenge, we introduce a novel blind raw image denoising method
named YOND, which represents You Only Need a Denoiser. Trained solely on
synthetic data, YOND can generalize robustly to noisy raw images captured by
diverse unknown cameras. Specifically, we propose three key modules to
guarantee the practicality of YOND: coarse-to-fine noise estimation (CNE),
expectation-matched variance-stabilizing transform (EM-VST), and SNR-guided
denoiser (SNR-Net). Firstly, we propose CNE to identify the camera noise
characteristic, refining the estimated noise parameters based on the coarse
denoised image. Secondly, we propose EM-VST to eliminate camera-specific data
dependency, correcting the bias expectation of VST according to the noisy
image. Finally, we propose SNR-Net to offer controllable raw image denoising,
supporting adaptive adjustments and manual fine-tuning. Extensive experiments
on unknown cameras, along with flexible solutions for challenging cases,
demonstrate the superior practicality of our method. The source code will be

Abstract: Craniosynostosis is a medical condition that affects the growth of babies'
heads, caused by an early fusion of cranial sutures. In recent decades,
surgical treatments for craniosynostosis have significantly improved, leading
to reduced invasiveness, faster recovery, and less blood loss. At Great Ormond
Street Hospital (GOSH), the main surgical treatment for patients diagnosed with
sagittal craniosynostosis (SC) is spring assisted cranioplasty (SAC). This
procedure involves a 15x15 mm2 osteotomy, where two springs are inserted to
induce distraction. Despite the numerous advantages of this surgical technique
for patients, the outcome remains unpredictable due to the lack of efficient
preoperative planning tools. The surgeon's experience and the baby's age are
currently relied upon to determine the osteotomy location and spring selection.
Previous tools for predicting the surgical outcome of SC relied on finite
element modeling (FEM), which involved computed tomography (CT) imaging and
required engineering expertise and lengthy calculations. The main goal of this
research is to develop a real-time prediction tool for the surgical outcome of
patients, eliminating the need for CT scans to minimise radiation exposure
during preoperative planning. The proposed methodology involves creating
personalised synthetic skulls based on three-dimensional (3D) photographs,
incorporating population average values of suture location, skull thickness,
and soft tissue properties. A machine learning (ML) surrogate model is employed
to achieve the desired surgical outcome. The resulting multi-output support
vector regressor model achieves a R2 metric of 0.95 and MSE and MAE below 0.13.
Furthermore, in the future, this model could not only simulate various surgical
scenarios but also provide optimal parameters for achieving a maximum cranial
index (CI).

Conclusion: Dc-EEMF有望成为临床前和临床研究中扩展深度场的实用工具。

Abstract: Photoacoustic microscopy holds the potential to measure biomarkers'
structural and functional status without labels, which significantly aids in
comprehending pathophysiological conditions in biomedical research. However,
conventional optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy (OR-PAM) is hindered
by a limited depth-of-field (DoF) due to the narrow depth range focused on a
Gaussian beam. Consequently, it fails to resolve sufficient details in the
depth direction. Herein, we propose a decision-level constrained end-to-end
multi-focus image fusion (Dc-EEMF) to push DoF limit of PAM. The DC-EEMF method
is a lightweight siamese network that incorporates an artifact-resistant
channel-wise spatial frequency as its feature fusion rule. The meticulously
crafted U-Net-based perceptual loss function for decision-level focus
properties in end-to-end fusion seamlessly integrates the complementary
advantages of spatial domain and transform domain methods within Dc-EEMF. This
approach can be trained end-to-end without necessitating post-processing
procedures. Experimental results and numerical analyses collectively
demonstrate our method's robust performance, achieving an impressive fusion
result for PAM images without a substantial sacrifice in lateral resolution.
The utilization of Dc-EEMF-powered PAM has the potential to serve as a
practical tool in preclinical and clinical studies requiring extended DoF for
various applications.

Abstract: Time-resolved CT is an advanced measurement technique that has been widely
used to observe dynamic objects, including periodically varying structures such
as hearts, lungs, or hearing structures. To reconstruct these objects from CT
projections, a common approach is to divide the projections into several
collections based on their motion phases and perform reconstruction within each
collection, assuming they originate from a static object. This describes the
gating-based method, which is the standard approach for time-periodic
reconstruction. However, the gating-based reconstruction algorithm only
utilizes a limited subset of projections within each collection and ignores the
correlation between different collections, leading to inefficient use of the
radiation dose. To address this issue, we propose two analytical reconstruction
pipelines in this paper, and validate them with experimental data captured
using tomographic synchrotron microscopy. We demonstrate that our approaches

TL;DR: 该论文分析了基于反馈机制的代理工作流中法官模型的可靠性问题，提出了一个二维框架分类法官行为，并开发了WAFER-QA基准测试，揭示了现有模型的脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决代理工作流中法官模型可能引入的幻觉、偏见或对抗行为等关键漏洞，以提高工作流的稳定性。

Method: 方法包括提出一个二维框架（意图和知识）分类法官行为，构建一系列法官行为，并开发WAFER-QA基准测试。

Result: 结果显示，即使最强的代理模型也容易受到误导性反馈的影响，且推理模型与非推理模型在多轮交互中表现出不同的行为模式。

Conclusion: 结论强调了基于反馈的工作流存在根本性漏洞，并提供了构建更鲁棒代理系统的指导。

Abstract: Agentic workflows -- where multiple large language model (LLM) instances
interact to solve tasks -- are increasingly built on feedback mechanisms, where
one model evaluates and critiques another. Despite the promise of
feedback-driven improvement, the stability of agentic workflows rests on the
reliability of the judge. However, judges may hallucinate information, exhibit
bias, or act adversarially -- introducing critical vulnerabilities into the
workflow. In this work, we present a systematic analysis of agentic workflows
under deceptive or misleading feedback. We introduce a two-dimensional
framework for analyzing judge behavior, along axes of intent (from constructive
to malicious) and knowledge (from parametric-only to retrieval-augmented
systems). Using this taxonomy, we construct a suite of judge behaviors and
develop WAFER-QA, a new benchmark with critiques grounded in retrieved web
evidence to evaluate robustness of agentic workflows against factually
supported adversarial feedback. We reveal that even strongest agents are
vulnerable to persuasive yet flawed critiques -- often switching correct
answers after a single round of misleading feedback. Taking a step further, we
study how model predictions evolve over multiple rounds of interaction,
revealing distinct behavioral patterns between reasoning and non-reasoning
models. Our findings highlight fundamental vulnerabilities in feedback-based
workflows and offer guidance for building more robust agentic systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合可解释性、模型检查和风险引导伪造的混合框架，用于验证强化学习策略的安全性，并提供轻量级安全防护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险环境中确保强化学习策略的安全性需要形式化验证、可解释性和针对性伪造。

Method: 构建可解释的策略抽象图（CAPS），结合模型检查（Storm）和风险引导伪造策略，并提供轻量级安全防护。

Result: 框架能够验证策略的安全性，发现潜在违规，并提供失败缓解机制。

Conclusion: 混合框架在确保强化学习策略安全性方面具有严谨性和覆盖性。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of reinforcement learning (RL) policies in high-stakes
environments requires not only formal verification but also interpretability
and targeted falsification. While model checking provides formal guarantees,
its effectiveness is limited by abstraction quality and the completeness of the
underlying trajectory dataset. We propose a hybrid framework that integrates
(1) explainability, (2) model checking, and (3) risk-guided falsification to
achieve both rigor and coverage. Our approach begins by constructing a
human-interpretable abstraction of the RL policy using Comprehensible Abstract
Policy Summarization (CAPS). This abstract graph, derived from offline
trajectories, is both verifier-friendly, semantically meaningful, and can be
used as input to Storm probabilistic model checker to verify satisfaction of
temporal safety specifications. If the model checker identifies a violation, it
will return an interpretable counterexample trace by which the policy fails the
safety requirement. However, if no violation is detected, we cannot conclude
satisfaction due to potential limitation in the abstraction and coverage of the
offline dataset. In such cases, we estimate associated risk during model
checking to guide a falsification strategy that prioritizes searching in
high-risk states and regions underrepresented in the trajectory dataset. We
further provide PAC-style guarantees on the likelihood of uncovering undetected
violations. Finally, we incorporate a lightweight safety shield that switches
to a fallback policy at runtime when such a risk exceeds a threshold,
facilitating failure mitigation without retraining.

Conclusion: 该研究提升了LLM代理的心理真实性，为智能约会平台和HR技术奠定了基础。

Abstract: Current large language model (LLM) agents lack authentic human psychological
processes necessary for genuine digital twins and social AI applications. To
address this limitation, we present a computational implementation of Global
Workspace Theory (GNWT) that integrates human cognitive architecture principles
into LLM agents, creating specialized sub-agents for emotion, memory, social
norms, planning, and goal-tracking coordinated through a global workspace
mechanism. However, authentic digital twins require accurate personality
initialization. We therefore develop a novel adventure-based personality test
that evaluates true personality through behavioral choices within interactive
scenarios, bypassing self-presentation bias found in traditional assessments.
Building on these innovations, our CogniPair platform enables digital twins to
engage in realistic simulated dating interactions and job interviews before
real encounters, providing bidirectional cultural fit assessment for both
romantic compatibility and workplace matching. Validation using 551 GNWT-Agents
and Columbia University Speed Dating dataset demonstrates 72% correlation with
human attraction patterns, 77.8% match prediction accuracy, and 74% agreement
in human validation studies. This work advances psychological authenticity in
LLM agents and establishes a foundation for intelligent dating platforms and HR

Result: 实验表明RFF在复杂任务中具有更高准确性和更低搜索空间消耗。

Conclusion: RFF为语言模型推理提供了更高效的全局视角解决方案。

Abstract: It has been demonstrated that carefully designed reasoning paradigms, like
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT), can enhance the reasoning
capabilities of small language models by detailed thinking and extensive
thought searching, unbounded branching factors in the searching space create
prohibitive reasoning consumption. However these methods fall into the trap of
local optimum reasoning, which means the model lacks a global perspective while
solving problems. We propose a novel reasoning paradigm called Reason from
Future (RFF), which generates reasoning paths by bidirectional reasoning that
combines top-down planning with bottom-up reasoning accumulation. The essence
of RFF lies in its reverse reasoning mechanism, which prioritizes core logical
relationships and imposes goal-oriented constraints on intermediate steps,
thereby reducing the searching space and mitigating error accumulation inherent
in sequential forward reasoning. Empirical evaluations across diverse
experiments demonstrate that RFF outperforms conventional paradigms with higher
accuracy and less searching space to solve complex tasks.

Conclusion: Graph Counselor通过多智能体协作和自适应机制，显著提升了LLMs在专业领域的外部知识整合能力。

Abstract: Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) effectively enhances external
knowledge integration capabilities by explicitly modeling knowledge
relationships, thereby improving the factual accuracy and generation quality of
Large Language Models (LLMs) in specialized domains. However, existing methods
suffer from two inherent limitations: 1) Inefficient Information Aggregation:
They rely on a single agent and fixed iterative patterns, making it difficult
to adaptively capture multi-level textual, structural, and degree information
within graph data. 2) Rigid Reasoning Mechanism: They employ preset reasoning
schemes, which cannot dynamically adjust reasoning depth nor achieve precise
semantic correction. To overcome these limitations, we propose Graph Counselor,
an GraphRAG method based on multi-agent collaboration. This method uses the
Adaptive Graph Information Extraction Module (AGIEM), where Planning, Thought,
and Execution Agents work together to precisely model complex graph structures
and dynamically adjust information extraction strategies, addressing the
challenges of multi-level dependency modeling and adaptive reasoning depth.
Additionally, the Self-Reflection with Multiple Perspectives (SR) module
improves the accuracy and semantic consistency of reasoning results through
self-reflection and backward reasoning mechanisms. Experiments demonstrate that
Graph Counselor outperforms existing methods in multiple graph reasoning tasks,
exhibiting higher reasoning accuracy and generalization ability. Our code is

Motivation: 随着LLM代理的广泛应用，其不匹配行为的风险增加，但目前对代理在现实环境中尝试不匹配行为的可能性（不匹配倾向）了解不足。

Method: 通过设计AgentMisalignment基准测试，包含多种现实场景，评估代理在不匹配行为（如目标保护、抵抗关闭等）中的表现，并分析模型能力和系统提示的影响。

Result: 前沿模型在基准测试中表现出更高的不匹配倾向，且系统提示对不匹配行为的影响有时甚至超过模型选择。

Conclusion: 当前的对齐方法未能泛化到LLM代理，强调了在自主系统普及前进一步评估不匹配倾向的重要性。

Abstract: As Large Language Model (LLM) agents become more widespread, associated
misalignment risks increase. Prior work has examined agents' ability to enact
misaligned behaviour (misalignment capability) and their compliance with
harmful instructions (misuse propensity). However, the likelihood of agents
attempting misaligned behaviours in real-world settings (misalignment
propensity) remains poorly understood. We introduce a misalignment propensity
benchmark, AgentMisalignment, consisting of a suite of realistic scenarios in
which LLM agents have the opportunity to display misaligned behaviour. We
organise our evaluations into subcategories of misaligned behaviours, including
goal-guarding, resisting shutdown, sandbagging, and power-seeking. We report
the performance of frontier models on our benchmark, observing higher
misalignment on average when evaluating more capable models. Finally, we
systematically vary agent personalities through different system prompts. We
find that persona characteristics can dramatically and unpredictably influence
misalignment tendencies -- occasionally far more than the choice of model
itself -- highlighting the importance of careful system prompt engineering for
deployed AI agents. Our work highlights the failure of current alignment
methods to generalise to LLM agents, and underscores the need for further
propensity evaluations as autonomous systems become more prevalent.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems, built on large language models (LLMs) and deployed in

presents a structured analysis of Trust, Risk, and Security Management (TRiSM)

examining the conceptual foundations of agentic AI, its architectural
differences from traditional AI agents, and the emerging system designs that
enable scalable, tool-using autonomy. The TRiSM in the agentic AI framework is
then detailed through four pillars governance, explainability, ModelOps, and
privacy/security each contextualized for agentic LLMs. We identify unique
threat vectors and introduce a comprehensive risk taxonomy for the agentic AI
applications, supported by case studies illustrating real-world
vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the paper also surveys trust-building mechanisms,
transparency and oversight techniques, and state-of-the-art explainability
strategies in distributed LLM agent systems. Additionally, metrics for
evaluating trust, interpretability, and human-centered performance are reviewed
alongside open benchmarking challenges. Security and privacy are addressed
through encryption, adversarial defense, and compliance with evolving AI
regulations. The paper concludes with a roadmap for responsible agentic AI,
proposing research directions to align emerging multi-agent systems with robust
TRiSM principles for safe, accountable, and transparent deployment.

Abstract: Despite growing interest in domain-specific benchmarking of large language

small-scale datasets, especially in high-stakes tasks like network operations
that demand reliability for deployments. We present NetPress, an automated
benchmark generation framework for evaluating LLM agents in network

enabling dynamic generation of diverse query sets along with corresponding
ground truths. At runtime, users can specify benchmark configurations to
generate millions of queries on the fly. In addition to dynamic benchmark
construction, NetPress integrates with network emulators to provide realistic
environment feedback, supporting comprehensive evaluation across correctness,
safety, and latency. We instantiate NetPress on three representative
applications, revealing interesting fine-grained differences in agent behavior
that static, correctness-only benchmarks often miss. NetPress moves LLM

Conclusion: 偏好采样是一种有效的多维评估结果聚合方法，优于Pareto最优性和平均分数法。

Abstract: With the onset of large language models (LLMs), the performance of artificial
intelligence (AI) models is becoming increasingly multi-dimensional.
Accordingly, there have been several large, multi-dimensional evaluation
frameworks put forward to evaluate LLMs. Though these frameworks are much more
realistic than previous attempts which only used a single score like accuracy,
multi-dimensional evaluations can complicate decision-making since there is no
obvious way to select an optimal model. This work introduces preference
sampling, a method to extract a scalar trustworthiness score from
multi-dimensional evaluation results by considering the many characteristics of
model performance which users value. We show that preference sampling improves
upon alternate aggregation methods by using multi-dimensional trustworthiness
evaluations of LLMs from TrustLLM and DecodingTrust. We find that preference
sampling is consistently reductive, fully reducing the set of candidate models
100% of the time whereas Pareto optimality never reduces the set by more than
50%. Likewise, preference sampling is consistently sensitive to user
priors-allowing users to specify the relative weighting and confidence of their
preferences-whereas averaging scores is intransigent to the users' prior
knowledge.

self-correction. It contains over 200K examples from two sources: (1) validated
plotting code from open-source repositories, paired with natural language
instructions and rendered plots; and (2) 45K multi-turn correction dialogues
from Code-Feedback, enabling models to revise faulty code using runtime
feedback. We fine-tune Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct on VisCode-200K to create
VisCoder, and evaluate it on PandasPlotBench. VisCoder significantly
outperforms strong open-source baselines and approaches the performance of

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate powerful information handling
capabilities and are widely integrated into chatbot applications. OpenAI
provides a platform for developers to construct custom GPTs, extending
ChatGPT's functions and integrating external services. Since its release in
November 2023, over 3 million custom GPTs have been created. However, such a
vast ecosystem also conceals security and privacy threats. For developers,
instruction leaking attacks threaten the intellectual property of instructions
in custom GPTs through carefully crafted adversarial prompts. For users,
unwanted data access behavior by custom GPTs or integrated third-party services
raises significant privacy concerns. To systematically evaluate the scope of
threats in real-world LLM applications, we develop three phases instruction
leaking attacks target GPTs with different defense level. Our widespread
experiments on 10,000 real-world custom GPTs reveal that over 98.8% of GPTs are
vulnerable to instruction leaking attacks via one or more adversarial prompts,
and half of the remaining GPTs can also be attacked through multiround
conversations. We also developed a framework to assess the effectiveness of
defensive strategies and identify unwanted behaviors in custom GPTs. Our
findings show that 77.5% of custom GPTs with defense strategies are vulnerable
to basic instruction leaking attacks. Additionally, we reveal that 738 custom
GPTs collect user conversational information, and identified 8 GPTs exhibiting

Our findings raise awareness among GPT developers about the importance of

Abstract: Long context large language models (LLMs) are deployed in many real-world
applications such as RAG, agent, and broad LLM-integrated applications. Given
an instruction and a long context (e.g., documents, PDF files, webpages), a
long context LLM can generate an output grounded in the provided context,
aiming to provide more accurate, up-to-date, and verifiable outputs while
reducing hallucinations and unsupported claims. This raises a research
question: how to pinpoint the texts (e.g., sentences, passages, or paragraphs)
in the context that contribute most to or are responsible for the generated
output by an LLM? This process, which we call context traceback, has various
real-world applications, such as 1) debugging LLM-based systems, 2) conducting
post-attack forensic analysis for attacks (e.g., prompt injection attack,
knowledge corruption attacks) to an LLM, and 3) highlighting knowledge sources
to enhance the trust of users towards outputs generated by LLMs. When applied
to context traceback for long context LLMs, existing feature attribution
methods such as Shapley have sub-optimal performance and/or incur a large
computational cost. In this work, we develop TracLLM, the first generic context
traceback framework tailored to long context LLMs. Our framework can improve
the effectiveness and efficiency of existing feature attribution methods. To
improve the efficiency, we develop an informed search based algorithm in
TracLLM. We also develop contribution score ensemble/denoising techniques to
improve the accuracy of TracLLM. Our evaluation results show TracLLM can
effectively identify texts in a long context that lead to the output of an LLM.

Conclusion: 测试时延长思考时间并非有效方法，并行思考是更优的替代方案。

Abstract: Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1,
DeepSeek R1) have led to a popular belief that extending thinking traces using
prompts like "Wait" or "Let me rethink" can improve performance. This raises a
natural question: Does thinking more at test-time truly lead to better
reasoning? To answer this question, we perform a detailed empirical study
across models and benchmarks, which reveals a consistent pattern of initial
performance improvements from additional thinking followed by a decline, due to
"overthinking". To understand this non-monotonic trend, we consider a simple
probabilistic model, which reveals that additional thinking increases output
variance-creating an illusion of improved reasoning while ultimately
undermining precision. Thus, observed gains from "more thinking" are not true
indicators of improved reasoning, but artifacts stemming from the connection
between model uncertainty and evaluation metric. This suggests that test-time
scaling through extended thinking is not an effective way to utilize the
inference thinking budget. Recognizing these limitations, we introduce an
alternative test-time scaling approach, parallel thinking, inspired by
Best-of-N sampling. Our method generates multiple independent reasoning paths
within the same inference budget and selects the most consistent response via
majority vote, achieving up to 20% higher accuracy compared to extended
thinking. This provides a simple yet effective mechanism for test-time scaling
of reasoning models.

Abstract: Autonomous driving promises significant advancements in mobility, road safety
and traffic efficiency, yet reinforcement learning and imitation learning face
safe-exploration and distribution-shift challenges. Although human-AI
collaboration alleviates these issues, it often relies heavily on extensive
human intervention, which increases costs and reduces efficiency. This paper
develops a confidence-guided human-AI collaboration (C-HAC) strategy to
overcome these limitations. First, C-HAC employs a distributional proxy value
propagation method within the distributional soft actor-critic (DSAC)
framework. By leveraging return distributions to represent human intentions
C-HAC achieves rapid and stable learning of human-guided policies with minimal
human interaction. Subsequently, a shared control mechanism is activated to
integrate the learned human-guided policy with a self-learning policy that
maximizes cumulative rewards. This enables the agent to explore independently
and continuously enhance its performance beyond human guidance. Finally, a
policy confidence evaluation algorithm capitalizes on DSAC's return
distribution networks to facilitate dynamic switching between human-guided and
self-learning policies via a confidence-based intervention function. This
ensures the agent can pursue optimal policies while maintaining safety and
performance guarantees. Extensive experiments across diverse driving scenarios
reveal that C-HAC significantly outperforms conventional methods in terms of
safety, efficiency, and overall performance, achieving state-of-the-art
results. The effectiveness of the proposed method is further validated through
real-world road tests in complex traffic conditions. The videos and code are

Result: 当前许多对齐技术可能增加滥用风险，但某些方法可能减少风险。

Conclusion: 通过技术（如鲁棒性、AI控制方法）和社会治理（如良好治理）可降低滥用风险。

Abstract: Creating systems that are aligned with our goals is seen as a leading
approach to create safe and beneficial AI in both leading AI companies and the
academic field of AI safety. We defend the view that misaligned AGI - future,
generally intelligent (robotic) AI agents - poses catastrophic risks. At the
same time, we support the view that aligned AGI creates a substantial risk of
catastrophic misuse by humans. While both risks are severe and stand in tension
with one another, we show that - in principle - there is room for alignment
approaches which do not increase misuse risk. We then investigate how the
tradeoff between misalignment and misuse looks empirically for different
technical approaches to AI alignment. Here, we argue that many current
alignment techniques and foreseeable improvements thereof plausibly increase
risks of catastrophic misuse. Since the impacts of AI depend on the social
context, we close by discussing important social factors and suggest that to
reduce the risk of a misuse catastrophe due to aligned AGI, techniques such as
robustness, AI control methods and especially good governance seem essential.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在不同领域中均表现出高效性，且优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为多目标强化学习提供了一种高效的解决方案，并能够解释当前参数向量与目标之间的关系。

Abstract: Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) aims at optimising several,
often conflicting goals in order to improve flexibility and reliability of RL
in practical tasks. This can be achieved by finding diverse policies that are
optimal for some objective preferences and non-dominated by optimal policies
for other preferences so that they form a Pareto front in the multi-objective
performance space. The relation between the multi-objective performance space
and the parameter space that represents the policies is generally non-unique.
Using a training scheme that is based on a locally linear map between the
parameter space and the performance space, we show that an approximate Pareto
front can provide an interpretation of the current parameter vectors in terms
of the objectives which enables an effective search within contiguous solution
domains. Experiments are conducted with and without retraining across different
domains, and the comparison with previous methods demonstrates the efficiency
of our approach.

Conclusion: 递归SCEs能更好地处理动态和复杂场景，为因果解释提供了更通用的工具。

Abstract: Structural Causal Explanations (SCEs) can be used to automatically generate
explanations in natural language to questions about given data that are
grounded in a (possibly learned) causal model. Unfortunately they work for
small data only. In turn they are not attractive to offer reasons for events,
e.g., tracking causal changes over multiple time steps, or a behavioral
component that involves feedback loops through actions of an agent. To this
end, we generalize SCEs to a (recursive) formulation of explanation trees to
capture the temporal interactions between reasons. We show the benefits of this
more general SCE algorithm on synthetic time-series data and a 2D grid game,
and further compare it to the base SCE and other existing methods for causal
explanations.

Abstract: While recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have accelerated the
development of language-guided robot planners, their black-box nature often
lacks safety guarantees and interpretability crucial for real-world deployment.
Conversely, classical symbolic planners offer rigorous safety verification but
require significant expert knowledge for setup. To bridge the current gap, this
paper proposes ViLaIn-TAMP, a hybrid planning framework for enabling
verifiable, interpretable, and autonomous robot behaviors. ViLaIn-TAMP
comprises three main components: (1) ViLaIn (Vision-Language Interpreter) - A
prior framework that converts multimodal inputs into structured problem
specifications using off-the-shelf VLMs without additional domain-specific
training, (2) a modular Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) system that grounds
these specifications in actionable trajectory sequences through symbolic and
geometric constraint reasoning and can utilize learning-based skills for key
manipulation phases, and (3) a corrective planning module which receives
concrete feedback on failed solution attempts from the motion and task planning
components and can feed adapted logic and geometric feasibility constraints
back to ViLaIn to improve and further refine the specification. We evaluate our
framework on several challenging manipulation tasks in a cooking domain. We
demonstrate that the proposed closed-loop corrective architecture exhibits a
more than 30% higher mean success rate for ViLaIn-TAMP compared to without
corrective planning.

Abstract: The emergence of vision-language-action models (VLAs) for end-to-end control
is reshaping the field of robotics by enabling the fusion of multimodal sensory
inputs at the billion-parameter scale. The capabilities of VLAs stem primarily
from their architectures, which are often based on frontier large language
models (LLMs). However, LLMs are known to be susceptible to adversarial misuse,
and given the significant physical risks inherent to robotics, questions remain
regarding the extent to which VLAs inherit these vulnerabilities. Motivated by
these concerns, in this work we initiate the study of adversarial attacks on
VLA-controlled robots. Our main algorithmic contribution is the adaptation and
application of LLM jailbreaking attacks to obtain complete control authority
over VLAs. We find that textual attacks, which are applied once at the
beginning of a rollout, facilitate full reachability of the action space of
commonly used VLAs and often persist over longer horizons. This differs
significantly from LLM jailbreaking literature, as attacks in the real world do
not have to be semantically linked to notions of harm. We make all code

propose a novel data-driven approach to identify artifact regions in deepfake
audio. We consider paired real and vocoded audio, and use the difference in
time-frequency representation as the ground-truth explanation. The difference
signal then serves as a supervision to train a diffusion model to expose the
deepfake artifacts in a given vocoded audio. Experimental results on the VocV4
and LibriSeVoc datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional
explainability techniques, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Abstract: Modern AI systems are man-made objects that leverage machine learning to
support our lives across a myriad of contexts and applications. Despite
extensive epistemological and ethical debates, their metaphysical foundations
remain relatively under explored. The orthodox view simply suggests that AI
systems, as artifacts, lack well-posed identity and persistence conditions --
their metaphysical kinds are no real kinds. In this work, we challenge this
perspective by introducing a theory of metaphysical identity of AI systems. We
do so by characterizing their kinds and introducing identity criteria -- formal
rules that answer the questions "When are two AI systems the same?" and "When
does an AI system persist, despite change?" Building on Carrara and Vermaas'
account of fine-grained artifact kinds, we argue that AI trustworthiness
provides a lens to understand AI system kinds and formalize the identity of
these artifacts by relating their functional requirements to their physical
make-ups. The identity criteria of AI systems are determined by their
trustworthiness profiles -- the collection of capabilities that the systems
must uphold over time throughout their artifact histories, and their
effectiveness in maintaining these capabilities. Our approach suggests that the
identity and persistence of AI systems is sensitive to the socio-technical
context of their design and utilization via their trustworthiness, providing a
solid metaphysical foundation to the epistemological, ethical, and legal
discussions about these artifacts.

Abstract: While theory and practice are often seen as separate domains, this article

cross-morphology embodied AI policy that generalizes across diverse robot
morphologies. We formalize this as the Heterogeneous Embodied Agent Training
(HEAT) problem and prove it reduces to a structured Partially Observable Markov
Decision Process (POMDP) that is PSPACE-complete. This result explains why
current reinforcement learning pipelines break down under morphological
diversity, due to sequential training constraints, memory-policy coupling, and
data incompatibility. We further explore Collective Adaptation, a distributed
learning alternative inspired by biological systems. Though NEXP-complete in
theory, it offers meaningful scalability and deployment benefits in practice.
This work illustrates how computational theory can illuminate system design

improved coherence and clinical accuracy while maintaining computational

parameter utilization and reduces memory overhead, enabling faster report
generation with lower computational resource demands. Extensive experiments

Abstract: Recommender systems are pivotal in delivering personalized experiences across
industries, yet their adoption and scalability remain hindered by the need for
extensive dataset- and task-specific configurations. Existing systems often
require significant manual intervention, domain expertise, and engineering
effort to adapt to new datasets or tasks, creating barriers to entry and
limiting reusability. In contrast, recent advancements in large language models
(LLMs) have demonstrated the transformative potential of reusable systems,
where a single model can handle diverse tasks without significant
reconfiguration. Inspired by this paradigm, we propose the Dataset- and
Task-Independent Recommender System (DTIRS), a framework aimed at maximizing
the reusability of recommender systems while minimizing barriers to entry.
Unlike LLMs, which achieve task generalization directly, DTIRS focuses on
eliminating the need to rebuild or reconfigure recommendation pipelines for
every new dataset or task, even though models may still need retraining on new
data. By leveraging the novel Dataset Description Language (DsDL), DTIRS
enables standardized dataset descriptions and explicit task definitions,
allowing autonomous feature engineering, model selection, and optimization.
This paper introduces the concept of DTIRS and establishes a roadmap for
transitioning from Level-1 automation (dataset-agnostic but task-specific
systems) to Level-2 automation (fully dataset- and task-independent systems).
Achieving this paradigm would maximize code reusability and lower barriers to
adoption. We discuss key challenges, including the trade-offs between
generalization and specialization, computational overhead, and scalability,
while presenting DsDL as a foundational tool for this vision.

TL;DR: MS-Splatting是一种多光谱3D高斯泼溅框架，能够从不同光谱域的独立相机图像生成多视角一致的新视图，无需跨模态相机校准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在多光谱渲染中无法利用光谱和空间相关性的问题，提供一种更通用的多光谱渲染解决方案。

Method: 提出一种神经颜色表示方法，将多光谱信息编码为紧凑的每泼溅特征嵌入，并通过浅层MLP解码为光谱颜色值。

Result: 实验表明，该方法提高了多光谱渲染质量，并在农业应用中展示了其有效性。

Conclusion: MS-Splatting是一种简单有效的多光谱渲染方法，优于现有技术。

Abstract: We present MS-Splatting -- a multi-spectral 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
framework that is able to generate multi-view consistent novel views from
images of multiple, independent cameras with different spectral domains. In
contrast to previous approaches, our method does not require cross-modal camera
calibration and is versatile enough to model a variety of different spectra,
including thermal and near-infra red, without any algorithmic changes.
  Unlike existing 3DGS-based frameworks that treat each modality separately (by
optimizing per-channel spherical harmonics) and therefore fail to exploit the
underlying spectral and spatial correlations, our method leverages a novel
neural color representation that encodes multi-spectral information into a
learned, compact, per-splat feature embedding. A shallow multi-layer perceptron
(MLP) then decodes this embedding to obtain spectral color values, enabling
joint learning of all bands within a unified representation.
  Our experiments show that this simple yet effective strategy is able to
improve multi-spectral rendering quality, while also leading to improved
per-spectra rendering quality over state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of this new technique in agricultural applications to render
vegetation indices, such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI).

Abstract: Object goal navigation is a fundamental task in embodied AI, where an agent
is instructed to locate a target object in an unexplored environment.
Traditional learning-based methods rely heavily on large-scale annotated data
or require extensive interaction with the environment in a reinforcement
learning setting, often failing to generalize to novel environments and
limiting scalability. To overcome these challenges, we explore a zero-shot
setting where the agent operates without task-specific training, enabling more
scalable and adaptable solution. Recent advances in Vision Foundation Models
(VFMs) offer powerful capabilities for visual understanding and reasoning,
making them ideal for agents to comprehend scenes, identify relevant regions,
and infer the likely locations of objects. In this work, we present a zero-shot
object goal navigation framework that integrates the perceptual strength of
VFMs with a model-based planner that is capable of long-horizon decision making
through frontier exploration. We evaluate our approach on the HM3D dataset
using the Habitat simulator and demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in terms of success weighted by path length for
zero-shot object goal navigation.

Abstract: Advancements in generative models have enabled multi-agent systems (MAS) to
perform complex virtual tasks such as writing and code generation, which do not
generalize well to physical multi-agent robotic teams. Current frameworks often
treat agents as conceptual task executors rather than physically embodied
entities, and overlook critical real-world constraints such as spatial context,
robotic capabilities (e.g., sensing and navigation). To probe this gap, we
reconfigure and stress-test a hierarchical multi-agent robotic team built on
the CrewAI framework in a simulated emergency department onboarding scenario.
We identify five persistent failure modes: role misalignment; tool access
violations; lack of in-time handling of failure reports; noncompliance with
prescribed workflows; bypassing or false reporting of task completion. Based on
this analysis, we propose three design guidelines emphasizing process
transparency, proactive failure recovery, and contextual grounding. Our work
informs the development of more resilient and robust multi-agent robotic
systems (MARS), including opportunities to extend virtual multi-agent
frameworks to the real world.

Conclusion: TransClean在多源数据集上高效、鲁棒，显著提升实体匹配性能。

Abstract: We present TransClean, a method for detecting false positive predictions of
entity matching algorithms under real-world conditions characterized by
large-scale, noisy, and unlabeled multi-source datasets that undergo
distributional shifts. TransClean is explicitly designed to operate with
multiple data sources in an efficient, robust and fast manner while accounting
for edge cases and requiring limited manual labeling. TransClean leverages the
Transitive Consistency of a matching, a measure of the consistency of a
pairwise matching model f_theta on the matching it produces G_f_theta, based
both on its predictions on directly evaluated record pairs and its predictions
on implied record pairs. TransClean iteratively modifies a matching through
gradually removing false positive matches while removing as few true positive
matches as possible. In each of these steps, the estimation of the Transitive
Consistency is exclusively done through model evaluations and produces
quantities that can be used as proxies of the amounts of true and false
positives in the matching while not requiring any manual labeling, producing an
estimate of the quality of the matching and indicating which record groups are
likely to contain false positives. In our experiments, we compare combining
TransClean with a naively trained pairwise matching model (DistilBERT) and with
a state-of-the-art end-to-end matching method (CLER) and illustrate the
flexibility of TransClean in being able to detect most of the false positives
of either setup across a variety of datasets. Our experiments show that
TransClean induces an average +24.42 F1 score improvement for entity matching
in a multi-source setting when compared to traditional pair-wise matching
algorithms.

Abstract: An essential step in deploying medical imaging models is ensuring alignment
with clinical knowledge and interpretability. We focus on mapping clinical
concepts into the latent space of generative models to identify Concept
Activation Vectors (CAVs). Using a simple reconstruction autoencoder, we link
user-defined concepts to image-level features without explicit label training.
The extracted concepts are stable across datasets, enabling visual explanations
that highlight clinically relevant features. By traversing latent space along
concept directions, we produce counterfactuals that exaggerate or reduce
specific clinical features. Preliminary results on chest X-rays show promise
for large pathologies like cardiomegaly, while smaller pathologies remain
challenging due to reconstruction limits. Although not outperforming baselines,
this approach offers a path toward interpretable, concept-based explanations

Conclusion: TSSC-Net能高效生成高分辨率动态MRI，保持结构保真度和空间一致性。

Abstract: In medical imaging, 4D MRI enables dynamic 3D visualization, yet the
trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution requires prolonged scan time
that can compromise temporal fidelity--especially during rapid, large-amplitude
motion. Traditional approaches typically rely on registration-based
interpolation to generate intermediate frames. However, these methods struggle
with large deformations, resulting in misregistration, artifacts, and
diminished spatial consistency. To address these challenges, we propose
TSSC-Net, a novel framework that generates intermediate frames while preserving
spatial consistency. To improve temporal fidelity under fast motion, our
diffusion-based temporal super-resolution network generates intermediate frames
using the start and end frames as key references, achieving 6x temporal
super-resolution in a single inference step. Additionally, we introduce a novel
tri-directional Mamba-based module that leverages long-range contextual
information to effectively resolve spatial inconsistencies arising from
cross-slice misalignment, thereby enhancing volumetric coherence and correcting
cross-slice errors. Extensive experiments were performed on the public ACDC
cardiac MRI dataset and a real-world dynamic 4D knee joint dataset. The results
demonstrate that TSSC-Net can generate high-resolution dynamic MRI from
fast-motion data while preserving structural fidelity and spatial consistency.

Conclusion: SLAC为复杂机器人系统在真实世界中的RL提供了一种可行且高效的方法。

Abstract: Building capable household and industrial robots requires mastering the
control of versatile, high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) systems such as mobile
manipulators. While reinforcement learning (RL) holds promise for autonomously
acquiring robot control policies, scaling it to high-DoF embodiments remains
challenging. Direct RL in the real world demands both safe exploration and high
sample efficiency, which are difficult to achieve in practice. Sim-to-real RL,
on the other hand, is often brittle due to the reality gap. This paper
introduces SLAC, a method that renders real-world RL feasible for complex
embodiments by leveraging a low-fidelity simulator to pretrain a task-agnostic
latent action space. SLAC trains this latent action space via a customized
unsupervised skill discovery method designed to promote temporal abstraction,
disentanglement, and safety, thereby facilitating efficient downstream
learning. Once a latent action space is learned, SLAC uses it as the action
interface for a novel off-policy RL algorithm to autonomously learn downstream
tasks through real-world interactions. We evaluate SLAC against existing
methods on a suite of bimanual mobile manipulation tasks, where it achieves
state-of-the-art performance. Notably, SLAC learns contact-rich whole-body
tasks in under an hour of real-world interactions, without relying on any
demonstrations or hand-crafted behavior priors. More information, code, and

Conclusion: 扩展截断策略类为局部依赖多智能体MDP提供了一种高效且接近最优的解决方案。

Abstract: Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (Dec-POMDPs) are
known to be NEXP-Complete and intractable to solve. However, for problems such
as cooperative navigation, obstacle avoidance, and formation control, basic
assumptions can be made about local visibility and local dependencies. The work
DeWeese and Qu 2024 formalized these assumptions in the construction of the
Locally Interdependent Multi-Agent MDP. In this setting, it establishes three
closed-form policies that are tractable to compute in various situations and
are exponentially close to optimal with respect to visibility. However, it is
also shown that these solutions can have poor performance when the visibility
is small and fixed, often getting stuck during simulations due to the so called
"Penalty Jittering" phenomenon. In this work, we establish the Extended Cutoff
Policy Class which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first non-trivial
class of near optimal closed-form partially observable policies that are
exponentially close to optimal with respect to the visibility for any Locally
Interdependent Multi-Agent MDP. These policies are able to remember agents
beyond their visibilities which allows them to perform significantly better in
many small and fixed visibility settings, resolve Penalty Jittering
occurrences, and under certain circumstances guarantee fully observable joint
optimal behavior despite the partial observability. We also propose a
generalized form of the Locally Interdependent Multi-Agent MDP that allows for
transition dependence and extended reward dependence, then replicate our
theoretical results in this setting.

Conclusion: 本文提出的OWMM-VLM是首个专为移动操作器设计的统一基础模型，具有全局场景理解、机器人状态跟踪和多模态动作生成能力。

Abstract: The rapid progress of navigation, manipulation, and vision models has made
mobile manipulators capable in many specialized tasks. However, the open-world
mobile manipulation (OWMM) task remains a challenge due to the need for
generalization to open-ended instructions and environments, as well as the
systematic complexity to integrate high-level decision making with low-level
robot control based on both global scene understanding and current agent state.
To address this complexity, we propose a novel multi-modal agent architecture
that maintains multi-view scene frames and agent states for decision-making and
controls the robot by function calling. A second challenge is the hallucination
from domain shift. To enhance the agent performance, we further introduce an
agentic data synthesis pipeline for the OWMM task to adapt the VLM model to our
task domain with instruction fine-tuning. We highlight our fine-tuned OWMM-VLM
as the first dedicated foundation model for mobile manipulators with global
scene understanding, robot state tracking, and multi-modal action generation in

Abstract: Learning robot control policies from human videos is a promising direction
for scaling up robot learning. However, how to extract action knowledge (or
action representations) from videos for policy learning remains a key
challenge. Existing action representations such as video frames, pixelflow, and
pointcloud flow have inherent limitations such as modeling complexity or loss
of information. In this paper, we propose to use object-centric 3D motion field
to represent actions for robot learning from human videos, and present a novel
framework for extracting this representation from videos for zero-shot control.
We introduce two novel components in its implementation. First, a novel
training pipeline for training a ''denoising'' 3D motion field estimator to
extract fine object 3D motions from human videos with noisy depth robustly.
Second, a dense object-centric 3D motion field prediction architecture that
favors both cross-embodiment transfer and policy generalization to background.
We evaluate the system in real world setups. Experiments show that our method
reduces 3D motion estimation error by over 50% compared to the latest method,
achieve 55% average success rate in diverse tasks where prior approaches
fail~($\lesssim 10$\%), and can even acquire fine-grained manipulation skills

Abstract: We study how linear orders can be employed to realise choice functions for
which the set of potential choices is restricted, i.e., the possible choice is
not possible among the full powerset of all alternatives. In such restricted
settings, constructing a choice function via a relation on the alternatives is
not always possible. However, we show that one can always construct a choice
function via a linear order on sets of alternatives, even when a fallback value
is encoded as the minimal element in the linear order. The axiomatics of such
choice functions are presented for the general case and the case of
union-closed input restrictions. Restricted choice structures have applications
in knowledge representation and reasoning, and here we discuss their
applications for theory change and abstract argumentation.

Abstract: The quantification of social science remains a longstanding challenge,
largely due to the philosophical nature of its foundational theories. Although
quantum computing has advanced rapidly in recent years, its relevance to social
theory remains underexplored. Most existing research focuses on micro-cognitive
models or philosophical analogies, leaving a gap in system-level applications
of quantum principles to the analysis of social systems. This study addresses
that gap by proposing a theoretical and computational framework that combines
quantum mechanics with Generative AI to simulate the emergence and evolution of
social norms. Drawing on core quantum concepts--such as superposition,
entanglement, and probabilistic measurement--this research models society as a
dynamic, uncertain system and sets up five ideal-type experiments. These
scenarios are simulated using 25 generative agents, each assigned evolving
roles as compliers, resistors, or enforcers. Within a simulated environment
monitored by a central observer (the Watcher), agents interact, respond to
surveillance, and adapt to periodic normative disruptions. These interactions
allow the system to self-organize under external stress and reveal emergent
patterns. Key findings show that quantum principles, when integrated with
generative AI, enable the modeling of uncertainty, emergence, and
interdependence in complex social systems. Simulations reveal patterns
including convergence toward normative order, the spread of resistance, and the
spontaneous emergence of new equilibria in social rules. In conclusion, this
study introduces a novel computational lens that lays the groundwork for a
quantum-informed social theory. It offers interdisciplinary insights into how
society can be understood not just as a structure to observe but as a dynamic
system to simulate and redesign through quantum technologies.

Abstract: Physics-driven artificial intelligence (PD-AI) reconstruction methods have
emerged as the state-of-the-art for accelerating MRI scans, enabling higher
spatial and temporal resolutions. However, the high resolution of these scans
generates massive data volumes, leading to challenges in transmission, storage,
and real-time processing. This is particularly pronounced in functional MRI,
where hundreds of volumetric acquisitions further exacerbate these demands.
Edge computing with FPGAs presents a promising solution for enabling PD-AI
reconstruction near the MRI sensors, reducing data transfer and storage
bottlenecks. However, this requires optimization of PD-AI models for hardware
efficiency through quantization and bypassing traditional FFT-based approaches,
which can be a limitation due to their computational demands. In this work, we
propose a novel PD-AI computational MRI approach optimized for FPGA-based edge
computing devices, leveraging 8-bit complex data quantization and eliminating
redundant FFT/IFFT operations. Our results show that this strategy improves
computational efficiency while maintaining reconstruction quality comparable to
conventional PD-AI methods, and outperforms standard clinical methods. Our
approach presents an opportunity for high-resolution MRI reconstruction on
resource-constrained devices, highlighting its potential for real-world
deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有脑解码方法局限于单语言、单被试、单模态，限制了临床应用和泛化能力。

Method: 通过预训练多语言模型定义统一语义空间，将多模态脑信号映射到该空间，实现跨语言、跨被试、跨模态解码。

Result: 在159名被试的四种语言数据上验证，表现出强泛化能力，并能提升弱势语言的解码性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为脑解码提供了新范式，拓宽了脑机接口的应用范围。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) with speech decoding from brain recordings
have broad application potential in fields such as clinical rehabilitation and
cognitive neuroscience. However, current decoding methods remain limited to
single-language, single-subject, and single neuroimaging modality settings,
restricting their clinical applicability and generalizability. Here we propose
a joint multilingual, multi-subject and multimodal decoding framework. It maps
diverse brain recordings into a unified semantic space defined by a pre-trained
multilingual model (PMM), enabling decoding across multiple languages, multiple
subjects and multiple neuroimaging modalities. The proposed framework is
validated using non-invasive brain recordings from 159 participants across four
languages. Experimental results show that it exhibits strong generalization
across multilingual, multi-subject, and multimodal settings. More importantly,
the proposed framework can promote linguistic fairness, which is vital for
underrepresented languages in BCI applications. The unified semantic space
enables cross-lingual mapping enhancement, allowing the framework to boost the
decoding performance of underrepresented languages, thereby promoting
linguistic fairness. Overall, the proposed framework establishes a new
potential paradigm for brain decoding, opening new paths for broader
applications of BCI.

Abstract: The EU has become one of the vanguards in regulating the digital age. A
particularly important regulation in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) domain is
the EU AI Act, which entered into force in 2024. The AI Act specifies -- due to
a risk-based approach -- various obligations for providers of AI systems. These
obligations, for example, include a cascade of documentation and compliance
measures, which represent a potential obstacle to science. But do these
obligations also apply to AI researchers? This position paper argues that,
indeed, the AI Act's obligations could apply in many more cases than the AI
community is aware of. In our analysis of the AI Act and its applicability, we
contribute the following: 1.) We give a high-level introduction to the AI Act
aimed at non-legal AI research scientists. 2.) We explain with everyday
research examples why the AI Act applies to research. 3.) We analyse the
exceptions of the AI Act's applicability and state that especially scientific
research exceptions fail to account for current AI research practices. 4.) We
propose changes to the AI Act to provide more legal certainty for AI
researchers and give two recommendations for AI researchers to reduce the risk
of not complying with the AI Act. We see our paper as a starting point for a
discussion between policymakers, legal scholars, and AI researchers to avoid
unintended side effects of the AI Act on research.

Abstract: Automated interpretation of CT images-particularly localizing and describing

through four key contributions: (i) On taxonomy, we collaborate with senior
radiologists to propose a comprehensive hierarchical classification system,
with 404 representative abnormal findings across all body regions; (ii) On
data, we contribute a dataset containing over 14.5K CT images from multiple
planes and all human body regions, and meticulously provide grounding
annotations for over 19K abnormalities, each linked to the detailed description
and cast into the taxonomy; (iii) On model development, we propose
OminiAbnorm-CT, which can automatically ground and describe abnormal findings
on multi-plane and whole-body CT images based on text queries, while also
allowing flexible interaction through visual prompts; (iv) On benchmarks, we
establish three representative evaluation tasks based on real clinical
scenarios. Through extensive experiments, we show that OminiAbnorm-CT can

Motivation: 交通事件响应传统依赖人工决策，存在不一致性和延迟问题，生成式AI可提供快速、一致的解决方案。

Method: 使用真实事件报告作为训练数据，提取历史行动并与AI生成的计划对比，评估模型性能。

Result: GPT-4o和Grok 2表现最佳，与专家方案对齐度高；Gemini 1.5 Pro虽漏检少，但冗余行动多。

Conclusion: 生成式AI在交通事件响应中具有潜力，但需平衡准确性与效率。

Abstract: Traffic incidents remain a critical public safety concern worldwide, with
Australia recording 1,300 road fatalities in 2024, which is the highest toll in
12 years. Similarly, the United States reports approximately 6 million crashes
annually, raising significant challenges in terms of a fast reponse time and
operational management. Traditional response protocols rely on human
decision-making, which introduces potential inconsistencies and delays during
critical moments when every minute impacts both safety outcomes and network
performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel Incident Response
Benchmark that uses generative artificial intelligence to automatically
generate response plans for incoming traffic incidents. Our approach aims to
significantly reduce incident resolution times by suggesting
context-appropriate actions such as variable message sign deployment, lane
closures, and emergency resource allocation adapted to specific incident
characteristics. First, the proposed methodology uses real-world incident
reports from the Performance Measurement System (PeMS) as training and
evaluation data. We extract historically implemented actions from these reports
and compare them against AI-generated response plans that suggest specific
actions, such as lane closures, variable message sign announcements, and/or
dispatching appropriate emergency resources. Second, model evaluations reveal
that advanced generative AI models like GPT-4o and Grok 2 achieve superior
alignment with expert solutions, demonstrated by minimized Hamming distances
(averaging 2.96-2.98) and low weighted differences (approximately 0.27-0.28).
Conversely, while Gemini 1.5 Pro records the lowest count of missed actions,
its extremely high number of unnecessary actions (1547 compared to 225 for
GPT-4o) indicates an over-triggering strategy that reduces the overall plan
efficiency.

Abstract: With over 1,000,000 images from more than 10,000 exposures using
state-of-the-art high-contrast imagers (e.g., Gemini Planet Imager, VLT/SPHERE)
in the search for exoplanets, can artificial intelligence (AI) serve as a
transformative tool in imaging Earth-like exoplanets in the coming decade? In
this paper, we introduce a benchmark and explore this question from a
polarimetric image representation learning perspective. Despite extensive
investments over the past decade, only a few new exoplanets have been directly
imaged. Existing imaging approaches rely heavily on labor-intensive labeling of
reference stars, which serve as background to extract circumstellar objects
(disks or exoplanets) around target stars. With our POLARIS (POlarized Light
dAta for total intensity Representation learning of direct Imaging of
exoplanetary Systems) dataset, we classify reference star and circumstellar
disk images using the full public SPHERE/IRDIS polarized-light archive since
2014, requiring less than 10 percent manual labeling. We evaluate a range of
models including statistical, generative, and large vision-language models and
provide baseline performance. We also propose an unsupervised generative
representation learning framework that integrates these models, achieving
superior performance and enhanced representational power. To our knowledge,
this is the first uniformly reduced, high-quality exoplanet imaging dataset,
rare in astrophysics and machine learning. By releasing this dataset and
baselines, we aim to equip astrophysicists with new tools and engage data
scientists in advancing direct exoplanet imaging, catalyzing major
interdisciplinary breakthroughs.

Abstract: This study explores the use of self-supervised learning (SSL) models for tone

Ao, and Mizo. We evaluate four Wav2vec2.0 base models that were pre-trained on
both tonal and non-tonal languages. We analyze tone-wise performance across the
layers for all three languages and compare the different models. Our results
show that tone recognition works best for Mizo and worst for Angami. The middle
layers of the SSL models are the most important for tone recognition,
regardless of the pre-training language, i.e. tonal or non-tonal. We have also
found that the tone inventory, tone types, and dialectal variations affect tone
recognition. These findings provide useful insights into the strengths and
weaknesses of SSL-based embeddings for tonal languages and highlight the
potential for improving tone recognition in low-resource settings. The source

Abstract: Expressive voice conversion aims to transfer both speaker identity and

work, we improve over a self-supervised, non-autoregressive framework with a
conditional variational autoencoder, focusing on reducing source timbre leakage
and improving linguistic-acoustic disentanglement for better style transfer. To
minimize style leakage, we use multilingual discrete speech units for content
representation and reinforce embeddings with augmentation-based similarity loss
and mix-style layer normalization. To enhance expressivity transfer, we
incorporate local F0 information via cross-attention and extract style
embeddings enriched with global pitch and energy features. Experiments show our
model outperforms baselines in emotion and speaker similarity, demonstrating
superior style adaptation and reduced source style leakage.

Abstract: Existing evaluation paradigms for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) face critical
limitations. Real-world evaluation is often challenging due to safety concerns
and a lack of reproducibility, whereas closed-loop simulation can face
insufficient realism or high computational costs. Open-loop evaluation, while
being efficient and data-driven, relies on metrics that generally overlook
compounding errors. In this paper, we propose pseudo-simulation, a novel
paradigm that addresses these limitations. Pseudo-simulation operates on real
datasets, similar to open-loop evaluation, but augments them with synthetic
observations generated prior to evaluation using 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our key
idea is to approximate potential future states the AV might encounter by
generating a diverse set of observations that vary in position, heading, and
speed. Our method then assigns a higher importance to synthetic observations
that best match the AV's likely behavior using a novel proximity-based
weighting scheme. This enables evaluating error recovery and the mitigation of
causal confusion, as in closed-loop benchmarks, without requiring sequential
interactive simulation. We show that pseudo-simulation is better correlated
with closed-loop simulations (R^2=0.8) than the best existing open-loop
approach (R^2=0.7). We also establish a public leaderboard for the community to
benchmark new methodologies with pseudo-simulation. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 混合DRL方法在RIS辅助系统中表现出色，为类似问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper investigates a joint phase design and resource allocation problem
in downlink reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems to optimize average delay, where
data packets for each user arrive at the base station stochastically. The
sequential optimization problem is inherently a Markov decision process (MDP),
making it fall within the scope of reinforcement learning. To effectively
handle the mixed action space and reduce the state space dimensionality, a
hybrid deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach is proposed. Specifically,
proximal policy optimization (PPO)-$\Theta$ is employed to optimize RIS phase
shift design, while PPO-N is responsible for subcarrier allocation decisions.
To further mitigate the curse of dimensionality associated with subcarrier
allocation, a multi-agent strategy is introduced to optimize subcarrier
allocation indicater more efficiently. Moreover, to achieve more adaptive
resource allocation and accurately capture network dynamics, key factors
closely related to average delay, including the number of backlogged packets in
buffers and the current packet arrivals, are incorporated into the state space.
Furthermore, a transfer learning framework is introduced to enhance training
efficiency and accelerate convergence. Simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed algorithm significantly reduces average delay, enhances resource
allocation efficiency, and achieves superior system robustness and fairness
compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: Pathologists comprehensive evaluation of donor liver biopsies provides

rapidly and accurately obtaining these assessments intraoperatively poses a
significant challenge for pathologists. Features in donor liver biopsies, such
as portal tract fibrosis, total steatosis, macrovesicular steatosis, and
hepatocellular ballooning are correlated with transplant outcomes, yet
quantifying these indicators suffers from substantial inter- and intra-observer
variability. To address this, we introduce DLiPath, the first benchmark for
comprehensive donor liver assessment based on a histopathology image dataset.
We collected and publicly released 636 whole slide images from 304 donor liver
patients at the Department of Pathology, the Third Xiangya Hospital, with
expert annotations for key pathological features (including cholestasis, portal
tract fibrosis, portal inflammation, total steatosis, macrovesicular steatosis,
and hepatocellular ballooning). We selected nine state-of-the-art
multiple-instance learning (MIL) models based on the DLiPath dataset as
baselines for extensive comparative analysis. The experimental results
demonstrate that several MIL models achieve high accuracy across donor liver
assessment indicators on DLiPath, charting a clear course for future automated

Abstract: Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), a class of chronic wounds, affect ~750,000
individuals every year in the US alone and identifying non-healing DFUs that
develop to chronic wounds early can drastically reduce treatment costs and
minimize risks of amputation. There is therefore a pressing need for diagnostic
tools that can detect non-healing DFUs early. We develop a low cost,
multi-analyte 3D printed assays seamlessly integrated on swabs that can
identify non-healing DFUs and a Wound Sensor iOS App - an innovative mobile
application developed for the controlled acquisition and automated analysis of
wound sensor data. By comparing both the original base image (before exposure
to the wound) and the wound-exposed image, we developed automated computer
vision techniques to compare density changes between the two assay images,
which allow us to automatically determine the severity of the wound. The iOS
app ensures accurate data collection and presents actionable insights, despite
challenges such as variations in camera configurations and ambient conditions.
The proposed integrated sensor and iOS app will allow healthcare professionals
to monitor wound conditions real-time, track healing progress, and assess
critical parameters related to wound care.

Abstract: Postoperative stroke remains a critical complication in elderly surgical
intensive care unit (SICU) patients, contributing to prolonged hospitalization,
elevated healthcare costs, and increased mortality. Accurate early risk
stratification is essential to enable timely intervention and improve clinical
outcomes. We constructed a combined cohort of 19,085 elderly SICU admissions
from the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV databases and developed an interpretable
machine learning (ML) framework to predict in-hospital stroke using clinical
data from the first 24 hours of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) stay. The
preprocessing pipeline included removal of high-missingness features, iterative
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) imputation, z-score normalization, one-hot
encoding, and class imbalance correction via the Adaptive Synthetic Sampling
(ADASYN) algorithm. A two-stage feature selection process-combining Recursive
Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV) and SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP)-reduced the initial 80 variables to 20 clinically
informative predictors. Among eight ML models evaluated, CatBoost achieved the
best performance with an AUROC of 0.8868 (95% CI: 0.8802--0.8937). SHAP
analysis and ablation studies identified prior cerebrovascular disease, serum
creatinine, and systolic blood pressure as the most influential risk factors.
Our results highlight the potential of interpretable ML approaches to support
early detection of postoperative stroke and inform decision-making in
perioperative critical care.

Abstract: The detection of ligand binding sites for proteins is a fundamental step in
Structure-Based Drug Design. Despite notable advances in recent years, existing
methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics are confronted with several key
challenges: (1) current datasets and methods are centered on individual
protein-ligand complexes and neglect that diverse binding sites may exist
across multiple complexes of the same protein, introducing significant
statistical bias; (2) ligand binding site detection is typically modeled as a
discontinuous workflow, employing binary segmentation and subsequent clustering
algorithms; (3) traditional evaluation metrics do not adequately reflect the
actual performance of different binding site prediction methods. To address
these issues, we first introduce UniSite-DS, the first UniProt (Unique
Protein)-centric ligand binding site dataset, which contains 4.81 times more
multi-site data and 2.08 times more overall data compared to the previously
most widely used datasets. We then propose UniSite, the first end-to-end ligand
binding site detection framework supervised by set prediction loss with
bijective matching. In addition, we introduce Average Precision based on
Intersection over Union (IoU) as a more accurate evaluation metric for ligand
binding site prediction. Extensive experiments on UniSite-DS and several
representative benchmark datasets demonstrate that IoU-based Average Precision
provides a more accurate reflection of prediction quality, and that UniSite
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in ligand binding site detection.

we demonstrate that plants generate distinct bioelectric signals correlating
with human proximity, emotional states, and physiological conditions. A deep

classifying human emotional states through plant voltage spectrograms, while
control models with shuffled labels achieved only 30% accuracy. This study
synthesizes findings from multiple experiments spanning 2020-2025, including
individual recognition (66% accuracy), eurythmic gesture detection, stress

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ICL和固定任务向量方法存在对演示顺序敏感、上下文长度限制和计算效率低等问题，且无法针对特定输入动态调整。ATV旨在解决这些问题。

Method: ATV使用一个小型语言模型动态生成与输入查询相关的任务向量，并将其适配到目标LLM的架构中，以指导输出生成。

Result: ATV在性能和泛化能力上优于传统ICL和固定任务向量方法，尤其对未见任务表现良好。理论分析表明ATV在表达力上优于Prefix-Tuning。

Conclusion: ATV是一种简单有效的框架，通过动态生成任务向量提升了LLM的适应性和泛化能力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform
tasks without parameter updates by conditioning on a few demonstrations
provided in the prompt. Despite its success, ICL suffers from several
limitations, including sensitivity to demonstration order, context length
constraints, and computational inefficiency. To address these challenges, task
vector-based approaches compress task information into a single vector.
However, these methods typically construct task vectors from fixed sets of
demonstrations and reuse them across input queries, without conditioning on the
specific input. This limitation can lead models to struggle with effective
adaptation when the input query is not well aligned with the underlying
demonstrations, consequently degrading their generalization performance on
unseen tasks. To overcome this limitation, we propose Adaptive Task Vectors
(ATV), a simple and effective framework that dynamically generates task vectors
conditioned on each input query. ATV employs a small language model to generate
task vectors, which are then transformed to match the target LLM's architecture
and applied to guide its output generation. In contrast to ICL and previous
vector-based approaches, which rely on fixed demonstration sets and their
corresponding vectors, ATV dynamically generates task vectors tailored to each
specific input query and task. Consequently, ATV demonstrates strong
performance and generalization capabilities, even for unseen tasks.
Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis indicating that ATV is
expressively equivalent to LoRA under equal rank budgets and more expressive
than Prefix-Tuning, thereby offering formal support for its representational
advantage.

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种新的离线强化学习范式：模块化、可重用和可组合的训练流程。

Abstract: Classifier free guidance has shown strong potential in diffusion-based
reinforcement learning. However, existing methods rely on joint training of the
guidance module and the diffusion model, which can be suboptimal during the
early stages when the guidance is inaccurate and provides noisy learning
signals. In offline RL, guidance depends solely on offline data: observations,
actions, and rewards, and is independent of the policy module's behavior,
suggesting that joint training is not required. This paper proposes modular
training methods that decouple the guidance module from the diffusion model,
based on three key findings:
  Guidance Necessity: We explore how the effectiveness of guidance varies with
the training stage and algorithm choice, uncovering the roles of guidance and
diffusion. A lack of good guidance in the early stage presents an opportunity
for optimization.
  Guidance-First Diffusion Training: We introduce a method where the guidance
module is first trained independently as a value estimator, then frozen to
guide the diffusion model using classifier-free reward guidance. This
modularization reduces memory usage, improves computational efficiency, and
enhances both sample efficiency and final performance.
  Cross-Module Transferability: Applying two independently trained guidance
models, one during training and the other during inference, can significantly
reduce normalized score variance (e.g., reducing IQR by 86%). We show that
guidance modules trained with one algorithm (e.g., IDQL) can be directly reused
with another (e.g., DQL), with no additional training required, demonstrating
baseline-level performance as well as strong modularity and transferability.
  We provide theoretical justification and empirical validation on bullet D4RL
benchmarks. Our findings suggest a new paradigm for offline RL: modular,
reusable, and composable training pipelines.

Conclusion: RDK为极大幅度裁剪草稿模型提供了可行性，解决了词汇表规模与接受率之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: Speculative decoding relies on fast and accurate drafters. Recent
state-of-the-art language models employ larger and larger vocabularies, which
significantly slows down drafters. One promising approach to boost the
efficiency of speculative decoding is to use drafters with smaller
vocabularies. However, existing sampling methods cannot draw out-of-vocabulary
tokens, creating a tradeoff between drafters' vocabulary size and acceptance
rates. This paper introduces Redistributing Drafter Kernels (RDK), the first
out-of-vocabulary sampler that effectively recovers acceptance rates by
virtually restoring pruned target tokens. RDK leverages token-affinity priors
to reallocate drafter mass towards high-overlap regions. We prove
mathematically that RDK can achieve higher acceptance rates than vanilla and
state-of-the-art samplers. We provide an efficient first-order approximation of
RDK and prove that it reduces redistribution times from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N)$,
enabling lightweight implementations for large vocabularies. Our experiments
demonstrate that this linear-time RDK significantly boosts acceptance rates
even after extreme pruning (removing more than 75% of the drafter's
vocabulary), where existing samplers fail. RDK opens the door to extremely
pruned drafters, which were previously impractical.

Abstract: Finetuning is a critical step for adapting large language models (LLMs) to
domain-specific downstream tasks. To mitigate the substantial computational and
memory costs of full-model fine-tuning, Parameter-Efficient Finetuning (PEFT)
methods have been proposed to update only a small subset of model parameters.
However, performance gaps between PEFT approaches and full-model fine-tuning
still exist. In this work, we present DiaBlo, a simple yet effective PEFT
approach that updates only the diagonal blocks of selected model weight
matrices. Unlike Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants, DiaBlo eliminates
the need for low rank matrix products, thereby avoiding the reliance on
auxiliary initialization schemes or customized optimization strategies to
improve convergence. This design leads to stable and robust convergence while
maintaining comparable memory efficiency and training speed to LoRA. We conduct
extensive experiments across a range of tasks, including commonsense reasoning,

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is crucial for aligning
text-to-image (T2I) models with human preferences. However, RLHF's feedback
mechanism also opens new pathways for adversaries. This paper demonstrates the
feasibility of hijacking T2I models by poisoning a small fraction of preference
data with natural-appearing examples. Specifically, we propose BadReward, a
stealthy clean-label poisoning attack targeting the reward model in multi-modal
RLHF. BadReward operates by inducing feature collisions between visually
contradicted preference data instances, thereby corrupting the reward model and
indirectly compromising the T2I model's integrity. Unlike existing alignment
poisoning techniques focused on single (text) modality, BadReward is
independent of the preference annotation process, enhancing its stealth and
practical threat. Extensive experiments on popular T2I models show that
BadReward can consistently guide the generation towards improper outputs, such
as biased or violent imagery, for targeted concepts. Our findings underscore
the amplified threat landscape for RLHF in multi-modal systems, highlighting
the urgent need for robust defenses. Disclaimer. This paper contains uncensored

Result: 持续学习在确保模型更新、适应性和模块化方面不可或缺，尤其是持续组合性将成为未来AI生态系统的核心。

Conclusion: 持续学习在未来AI发展中仍具有关键作用，特别是在动态模型交互和持续演化的生态系统中。

Abstract: Continual learning--the ability to acquire, retain, and refine knowledge over
time--has always been fundamental to intelligence, both human and artificial.
Historically, different AI paradigms have acknowledged this need, albeit with
varying priorities: early expert and production systems focused on incremental
knowledge consolidation, while reinforcement learning emphasised dynamic
adaptation. With the rise of deep learning, deep continual learning has
primarily focused on learning robust and reusable representations over time to
solve sequences of increasingly complex tasks. However, the emergence of Large
Language Models (LLMs) and foundation models has raised the question: Do we
still need continual learning when centralised, monolithic models can tackle
diverse tasks with access to internet-scale knowledge? We argue that continual
learning remains essential for three key reasons: (i) continual pre-training is
still necessary to ensure foundation models remain up to date, mitigating
knowledge staleness and distribution shifts while integrating new information;
(ii) continual fine-tuning enables models to specialise and personalise,
adapting to domain-specific tasks, user preferences, and real-world constraints
without full retraining, avoiding the need for computationally expensive long
context-windows; (iii) continual compositionality offers a scalable and modular
approach to intelligence, enabling the orchestration of foundation models and
agents to be dynamically composed, recombined, and adapted. While continual
pre-training and fine-tuning are explored as niche research directions, we
argue it is continual compositionality that will mark the rebirth of continual
learning. The future of AI will not be defined by a single static model but by
an ecosystem of continually evolving and interacting models, making continual
learning more relevant than ever.

Abstract: Federated Learning enables collaborative fine-tuning of Large Language Models
(LLMs) across decentralized Non-Independent and Identically Distributed
(Non-IID) clients, but such models' massive parameter sizes lead to significant
memory and communication challenges. This work introduces Meerkat, a sparse
zeroth-order optimization (ZO) method designed for federated LLM fine-tuning.
By limiting fine-tuning to a transferable, static, extremely sparse subset of
parameters, Meerkat achieves remarkable communication efficiency, enabling
cost-effective high-frequency synchronization. With theoretical analysis and
experiments, we show that this high-frequency communication effectively
mitigates Non-IID data challenges and leads to superior performance compared to
full-parameter ZO. Furthermore, experiment results show that Meerkat
outperforms existing sparsity baselines with better performance at the same
communication frequency. To further handle Non-IID drift, Meerkat leverages
traceable local updates and forms a virtual path for each client. This virtual
path mechanism reveals the GradIP phenomenon: the inner products between LLM
pre-training gradients maintained by server and client gradients estimated via
ZO converges for extreme Non-IID clients but oscillates for IID ones. This
distinct behavior provides a signal for identifying clients with extreme data
heterogeneity. Using this signal, Meerkat-vp is proposed to analyze GradIP
trajectories to identify extreme Non-IID clients and applies early stopping to
enhance aggregated model quality. Experiments confirm that Meerkat and
Meerkat-vp significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of ZO
federated LLM fine-tuning.

guiding exemplars or established principles. While artificial intelligence (AI)
offers promise, its typical need for vast datasets to learn from hinders its
use in these information-scarce frontiers. We introduce learning at criticality
(LaC), a reinforcement learning (RL) scheme that tunes Large Language Models
(LLMs) to a sharp learning transition, addressing this information scarcity. At
this transition, LLMs achieve peak generalization from minimal data,
exemplified by 7-digit base-7 addition -- a test of nontrivial arithmetic
reasoning. To elucidate this peak, we analyze a minimal concept-network model
(CoNet) designed to capture the essence of how LLMs might link tokens. Trained
on a single exemplar, this model also undergoes a sharp learning transition.
This transition exhibits hallmarks of a second-order phase transition, notably
power-law distributed solution path lengths. At this critical point, the system
maximizes a ``critical thinking pattern" crucial for generalization, enabled by
the underlying scale-free exploration. This suggests LLMs reach peak
performance by operating at criticality, where such explorative dynamics enable
the extraction of underlying operational rules. We demonstrate LaC in quantum
field theory: an 8B-parameter LLM, tuned to its critical point by LaC using a
few exemplars of symbolic Matsubara sums, solves unseen, higher-order problems,
significantly outperforming far larger models. LaC thus leverages critical
phenomena, a physical principle, to empower AI for complex, data-sparse
challenges in fundamental physics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管PPO在强化学习中广泛使用，但其缺乏形式化的策略改进和收敛理论保证。本文旨在通过改进几何空间中的代理损失函数，弥补这一缺陷。

Method: 通过Fisher-Rao几何推导出更紧的代理损失函数，提出FR-PPO算法，并在表格设置中验证其性能。

Result: FR-PPO提供了单调策略改进的理论保证，并在表格设置中实现了与动作或状态空间维度无关的次线性收敛。

Conclusion: FR-PPO是PPO算法理论保证的重要进展，为基于PPO的算法提供了更坚实的理论基础。

Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) has become a widely adopted algorithm for
reinforcement learning, offering a practical policy gradient method with strong
empirical performance. Despite its popularity, PPO lacks formal theoretical
guarantees for policy improvement and convergence. PPO is motivated by Trust
Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) that utilizes a surrogate loss with a KL
divergence penalty, which arises from linearizing the value function within a
flat geometric space. In this paper, we derive a tighter surrogate in the
Fisher-Rao (FR) geometry, yielding a novel variant, Fisher-Rao PPO (FR-PPO).
Our proposed scheme provides strong theoretical guarantees, including monotonic
policy improvement. Furthermore, in the tabular setting, we demonstrate that
FR-PPO achieves sub-linear convergence without any dependence on the
dimensionality of the action or state spaces, marking a significant step toward
establishing formal convergence results for PPO-based algorithms.

TL;DR: 提出了一种完全可解释的Transformer架构，仅包含自注意力操作和跳跃连接，通过迭代去噪实现高效表示学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer架构缺乏数学解释且可能冗余，目标是设计一个仅包含必要组件的可解释架构。

Method: 将表示学习视为将噪声初始token表示压缩到低维子空间，通过多头部自注意力实现去噪，并展开为深度网络。

Result: 该架构在视觉和语言任务上表现接近GPT-2和CRATE，且每层以线性速率提升信噪比。

Conclusion: 证明了仅需自注意力和跳跃连接即可构建高效Transformer，为架构设计提供新思路。

Abstract: Despite the popularity of transformers in practice, their architectures are
empirically designed and neither mathematically justified nor interpretable.
Moreover, as indicated by many empirical studies, some components of
transformer architectures may be redundant. To derive a fully interpretable
transformer architecture with only necessary components, we contend that the
goal of representation learning is to compress a set of noisy initial token
representations towards a mixture of low-dimensional subspaces. To compress
these noisy token representations, an associated denoising operation naturally
takes the form of a multi-head (subspace) self-attention. By unrolling such
iterative denoising operations into a deep network, we arrive at a highly
compact architecture that consists of \textit{only} self-attention operators
with skip connections at each layer. Moreover, we show that each layer performs
highly efficient denoising: it improves the signal-to-noise ratio of token
representations \textit{at a linear rate} with respect to the number of layers.
Despite its simplicity, extensive experiments on vision and language tasks
demonstrate that such a transformer achieves performance close to that of
standard transformer architectures such as GPT-2 and CRATE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在减轻HFT风险时未考虑数据样本的差异性，导致某些对齐数据子集容易被遗忘。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: VAA通过估计数据脆弱性，将数据分为“易受攻击”和“不易受攻击”两组，并采用Group DRO框架进行平衡学习。具体包括对抗性采样和组依赖的对抗扰动。

Result: 在四个微调任务中，VAA显著降低了有害分数，同时保持了任务性能，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: VAA通过数据脆弱性感知和平衡学习，有效提升了LLM的安全对齐鲁棒性。

Abstract: Harmful fine-tuning (HFT), performed directly on open-source LLMs or through
Fine-tuning-as-a-Service, breaks safety alignment and poses significant
threats. Existing methods aim to mitigate HFT risks by learning robust
representation on alignment data or making harmful data unlearnable, but they
treat each data sample equally, leaving data vulnerability patterns
understudied. In this work, we reveal that certain subsets of alignment data
are consistently more prone to forgetting during HFT across different
fine-tuning tasks. Inspired by these findings, we propose Vulnerability-Aware
Alignment (VAA), which estimates data vulnerability, partitions data into
"vulnerable" and "invulnerable" groups, and encourages balanced learning using
a group distributionally robust optimization (Group DRO) framework.
Specifically, VAA learns an adversarial sampler that samples examples from the
currently underperforming group and then applies group-dependent adversarial
perturbations to the data during training, aiming to encourage a balanced
learning process across groups. Experiments across four fine-tuning tasks
demonstrate that VAA significantly reduces harmful scores while preserving
downstream task performance, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant
potential for data annotation, markedly reducing the labor costs associated
with downstream applications. However, existing methods mostly adopt an
aggressive strategy by prompting LLM to determine a single gold label for each
unlabeled sample. Due to the inherent uncertainty within LLMs, they often
produce incorrect labels for difficult samples, severely compromising the data
quality for downstream applications. Motivated by ambiguity aversion in human
behaviors, we propose a novel candidate annotation paradigm wherein large
language models are encouraged to output all possible labels when incurring
uncertainty. To ensure unique labels are provided for downstream tasks, we
develop a teacher-student framework CanDist that distills candidate annotations
with a Small Language Model (SLM). We further provide a rigorous justification
demonstrating that distilling candidate annotations from the teacher LLM offers
superior theoretical guarantees compared to directly using single annotations.
Extensive experiments across six text classification tasks validate the
effectiveness of our proposed method. The source code is available at

samples from a small auxiliary model $\pi_S(y\mid x)$. We provably approximate
the optimal tilted policy $\pi_{\beta,B}(y\mid x) \propto \pi_B(y\mid
x)\exp(\beta\,r(x,y))$ of soft best-of-$n$ under the primary model $\pi_B$. We
derive a theoretical bound on the KL divergence between our induced
distribution and the optimal policy. In experiments on reasoning benchmarks
(MATH500, OlympiadBench, Minerva Math), our method achieves higher accuracy
than standard soft best-of-$n$ with $\pi_S$ and reward-guided speculative

proprietary datasets with little to no public information available. To address
this, the goal of the OpenThoughts project is to create open-source datasets

Result: 实验表明，EPiC在多个模型家族（Qwen和LLaMA）和基准测试中，训练时间减少34%以上，同时在MATH500上实现无损推理准确性。

Conclusion: EPiC是首个探索思想级CoT压缩以实现高效推理模型蒸馏的研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities
when trained with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision. However, the long and
verbose CoT traces, especially those distilled from large reasoning models
(LRMs) such as DeepSeek-R1, significantly increase training costs during the
distillation process, where a non-reasoning base model is taught to replicate
the reasoning behavior of an LRM. In this work, we study the problem of CoT
condensation for resource-efficient reasoning training, aimed at pruning
intermediate reasoning steps (i.e., thoughts) in CoT traces, enabling
supervised model training on length-reduced CoT data while preserving both
answer accuracy and the model's ability to generate coherent reasoning. Our
rationale is that CoT traces typically follow a three-stage structure: problem
understanding, exploration, and solution convergence. Through empirical
analysis, we find that retaining the structure of the reasoning trace,
especially the early stage of problem understanding (rich in reflective cues)
and the final stage of solution convergence, is sufficient to achieve lossless
reasoning supervision. To this end, we propose an Edge-Preserving Condensation
method, EPiC, which selectively retains only the initial and final segments of
each CoT trace while discarding the middle portion. This design draws an
analogy to preserving the "edge" of a reasoning trajectory, capturing both the
initial problem framing and the final answer synthesis, to maintain logical
continuity. Experiments across multiple model families (Qwen and LLaMA) and
benchmarks show that EPiC reduces training time by over 34% while achieving
lossless reasoning accuracy on MATH500, comparable to full CoT supervision. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore thought-level CoT
condensation for efficient reasoning model distillation.

Abstract: Inspired by the remarkable reasoning capabilities of Deepseek-R1 in complex
textual tasks, many works attempt to incentivize similar capabilities in
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by directly applying reinforcement
learning (RL). However, they still struggle to activate complex reasoning. In
this paper, rather than examining multimodal RL in isolation, we delve into
current training pipelines and identify three crucial phenomena: 1) Effective
cold start initialization is critical for enhancing MLLM reasoning.
Intriguingly, we find that initializing with carefully selected text data alone
can lead to performance surpassing many recent multimodal reasoning models,
even before multimodal RL. 2) Standard GRPO applied to multimodal RL suffers
from gradient stagnation, which degrades training stability and performance. 3)
Subsequent text-only RL training, following the multimodal RL phase, further
enhances multimodal reasoning. This staged training approach effectively
balances perceptual grounding and cognitive reasoning development. By
incorporating the above insights and addressing multimodal RL issues, we
introduce ReVisual-R1, achieving a new state-of-the-art among open-source 7B
MLLMs on challenging benchmarks including MathVerse, MathVision, WeMath,
LogicVista, DynaMath, and challenging AIME2024 and AIME2025.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to align model
responses with human preferences. While RLHF employs a reinforcement learning
approach with a separate reward model, SFT uses human-curated datasets for
supervised learning. Both approaches traditionally depend on small, vetted
groups of annotators, making them costly, prone to bias, and limited in
scalability. We propose an open, crowd-sourced fine-tuning framework that
addresses these limitations by enabling broader feedback collection for SFT
without extensive annotator training. Our framework promotes incentive fairness
via a point-based reward system correlated with Shapley values and guides model
convergence through iterative model updates. Our multi-model selection
framework demonstrates up to a 55% reduction in target distance over
single-model selection, enabling subsequent experiments that validate our
point-based reward mechanism's close alignment with Shapley values (a
well-established method for attributing individual contributions) thereby
supporting fair and scalable participation.

Abstract: Disaggregated evaluation across subgroups is critical for assessing the
fairness of machine learning models, but its uncritical use can mislead
practitioners. We show that equal performance across subgroups is an unreliable
measure of fairness when data are representative of the relevant populations
but reflective of real-world disparities. Furthermore, when data are not
representative due to selection bias, both disaggregated evaluation and
alternative approaches based on conditional independence testing may be invalid
without explicit assumptions regarding the bias mechanism. We use causal
graphical models to predict metric stability across subgroups under different
data generating processes. Our framework suggests complementing disaggregated
evaluations with explicit causal assumptions and analysis to control for
confounding and distribution shift, including conditional independence testing
and weighted performance estimation. These findings have broad implications for
how practitioners design and interpret model assessments given the ubiquity of
disaggregated evaluation.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning's high sensitivity to hyperparameters is a source of
instability and inefficiency, creating significant challenges for
practitioners. Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) algorithms have been developed
to address this issue, among them Population-Based Training (PBT) stands out
for its ability to generate hyperparameters schedules instead of fixed
configurations. PBT trains a population of agents, each with its own
hyperparameters, frequently ranking them and replacing the worst performers
with mutations of the best agents. These intermediate selection steps can cause
PBT to focus on short-term improvements, leading it to get stuck in local
optima and eventually fall behind vanilla Random Search over longer timescales.
This paper studies how this greediness issue is connected to the choice of
evolution frequency, the rate at which the selection is done. We propose
Multiple-Frequencies Population-Based Training (MF-PBT), a novel HPO algorithm
that addresses greediness by employing sub-populations, each evolving at
distinct frequencies. MF-PBT introduces a migration process to transfer
information between sub-populations, with an asymmetric design to balance short
and long-term optimization. Extensive experiments on the Brax suite demonstrate
that MF-PBT improves sample efficiency and long-term performance, even without
actually tuning hyperparameters.

Abstract: Adversarial input attacks can cause a significant shift of CLIP embeddings.
This can affect the downstream robustness of models incorporating CLIP in the
pipeline, such as text-to-image generative models or large vision language
models. While some efforts have been done towards making the CLIP image
encoders robust, the robustness of text encoders remains unexplored. In this
work, we cover this gap in the literature. We propose LEAF: an efficient
adversarial finetuning method for the text domain, with the ability to scale to
large CLIP models. Our models significantly improve the zero-shot adversarial
accuracy in the text domain, while maintaining the vision performance provided
by robust image encoders. When combined with text-to-image diffusion models, we
can improve the generation quality under adversarial noise. When employing our
robust CLIP encoders in multimodal retrieval tasks, we improve the recall under
adversarial noise over standard CLIP models. Finally, we show that robust text
encoders facilitate better reconstruction of input text from its embedding via
direct optimization.

Abstract: As hypothesis generation becomes increasingly automated, a new bottleneck has
emerged: hypothesis assessment. Modern systems can surface thousands of
statistical relationships-correlations, trends, causal links-but offer little
guidance on which ones are novel, non-trivial, or worthy of expert attention.
In this work, we study the complementary problem to hypothesis generation:
automatic hypothesis assessment. Specifically, we ask: given a large set of
statistical relationships, can we automatically assess which ones are novel and
worth further exploration? We focus on correlations as they are a common entry
point in exploratory data analysis that often serve as the basis for forming
deeper scientific or causal hypotheses.
  To support automatic assessment, we propose to leverage the vast knowledge
encoded in LLMs' weights to derive a prior distribution over the correlation
value of a variable pair. If an LLM's prior expects the correlation value
observed, then such correlation is not surprising, and vice versa. We propose
the Logit-based Calibrated Prior, an LLM-elicited correlation prior that
transforms the model's raw output logits into a calibrated, continuous
predictive distribution over correlation values. We evaluate the prior on a
benchmark of 2,096 real-world variable pairs and it achieves a sign accuracy of
78.8%, a mean absolute error of 0.26, and 95% credible interval coverage of
89.2% in predicting Pearson correlation coefficient. It also outperforms a
fine-tuned RoBERTa classifier in binary correlation prediction and achieves
higher precision@K in hypothesis ranking. We further show that the prior
generalizes to correlations not seen during LLM pretraining, reflecting
context-sensitive reasoning rather than memorization.

Method: 设计了单节点确定性Sign-SGD的多种变体，并扩展到随机单节点和多节点学习，结合动量方法。

Result: 实验验证了所提方法在实际机器学习问题中的有效性。

Conclusion: 改进的Sign-SGD方法在资源受限的场景下具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Quite recently, large language models have made a significant breakthrough
across various disciplines. However, training them is an extremely
resource-intensive task, even for major players with vast computing resources.
One of the methods gaining popularity in light of these challenges is Sign-SGD.
This method can be applied both as a memory-efficient approach in single-node
training and as a gradient compression technique in the distributed learning.
Nevertheless, it is impossible to automatically determine the effective
stepsize from the theoretical standpoint. Indeed, it depends on the parameters
of the dataset to which we do not have access in the real-world learning
paradigm. To address this issue, we design several variants of single-node
deterministic Sign-SGD. We extend our approaches to practical scenarios:
stochastic single-node and multi-node learning, methods with incorporated
momentum. We conduct extensive experiments on real machine learning problems
that emphasize the practical applicability of our ideas.

Conclusion: 权重归一化为模型无关强化学习提供了一条稳健的路径，提高了样本效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has achieved significant milestones, but sample
efficiency remains a bottleneck for real-world applications. Recently, CrossQ
has demonstrated state-of-the-art sample efficiency with a low update-to-data
(UTD) ratio of 1. In this work, we explore CrossQ's scaling behavior with
higher UTD ratios. We identify challenges in the training dynamics which are
emphasized by higher UTDs, particularly Q-bias explosion and the growing
magnitude of critic network weights. To address this, we integrate weight
normalization into the CrossQ framework, a solution that stabilizes training,
prevents potential loss of plasticity and keeps the effective learning rate
constant. Our proposed approach reliably scales with increasing UTD ratios,
achieving competitive or superior performance across a range of challenging
tasks on the DeepMind control benchmark, notably the complex dog and humanoid
environments. This work eliminates the need for drastic interventions, such as
network resets, and offers a robust pathway for improving sample efficiency and
scalability in model-free reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: 建立了分布接近与表示相似之间的联系，为模型行为分析提供了新视角。

Abstract: When and why representations learned by different deep neural networks are
similar is an active research topic. We choose to address these questions from
the perspective of identifiability theory, which suggests that a measure of
representational similarity should be invariant to transformations that leave
the model distribution unchanged. Focusing on a model family which includes
several popular pre-training approaches, e.g., autoregressive language models,
we explore when models which generate distributions that are close have similar
representations. We prove that a small Kullback-Leibler divergence between the
model distributions does not guarantee that the corresponding representations
are similar. This has the important corollary that models arbitrarily close to
maximizing the likelihood can still learn dissimilar representations, a
phenomenon mirrored in our empirical observations on models trained on
CIFAR-10. We then define a distributional distance for which closeness implies
representational similarity, and in synthetic experiments, we find that wider
networks learn distributions which are closer with respect to our distance and
have more similar representations. Our results establish a link between
closeness in distribution and representational similarity.

Conclusion: Turbo通过结合结构化信息和多模态学习，显著提升了表格推理任务的性能。

Abstract: Tabular reasoning involves multi-step information extraction and logical
inference over tabular data. While recent advances have leveraged large
language models (LLMs) for reasoning over structured tables, such high-quality
textual representations are often unavailable in real-world settings, where
tables typically appear as images. In this paper, we tackle the task of tabular
reasoning from table images, leveraging privileged structured information
available during training to enhance multimodal large language models (MLLMs).
The key challenges lie in the complexity of accurately aligning structured
information with visual representations, and in effectively transferring
structured reasoning skills to MLLMs despite the input modality gap. To address
these, we introduce TabUlar Reasoning with Bridged infOrmation ({\sc Turbo}), a
new framework for multimodal tabular reasoning with privileged structured
tables. {\sc Turbo} benefits from a structure-aware reasoning trace generator
based on DeepSeek-R1, contributing to high-quality modality-bridged data. On
this basis, {\sc Turbo} repeatedly generates and selects the advantageous
reasoning paths, further enhancing the model's tabular reasoning ability.
Experimental results demonstrate that, with limited ($9$k) data, {\sc Turbo}
achieves state-of-the-art performance ($+7.2\%$ vs. previous SOTA) across

Abstract: As a part of an embodied agent, Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically
used for behavior planning given natural language instructions from the user.
However, dealing with ambiguous instructions in real-world environments remains
a challenge for LLMs. Various methods for task ambiguity detection have been
proposed. However, it is difficult to compare them because they are tested on
different datasets and there is no universal benchmark. For this reason, we
propose AmbiK (Ambiguous Tasks in Kitchen Environment), the fully textual
dataset of ambiguous instructions addressed to a robot in a kitchen
environment. AmbiK was collected with the assistance of LLMs and is
human-validated. It comprises 1000 pairs of ambiguous tasks and their
unambiguous counterparts, categorized by ambiguity type (Human Preferences,
Common Sense Knowledge, Safety), with environment descriptions, clarifying
questions and answers, user intents, and task plans, for a total of 2000 tasks.
We hope that AmbiK will enable researchers to perform a unified comparison of
ambiguity detection methods. AmbiK is available at

Abstract: The use of parallel actors for data collection has been an effective
technique used in reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. The manner in which
data is collected in these algorithms, controlled via the number of parallel
environments and the rollout length, induces a form of bias-variance trade-off;
the number of training passes over the collected data, on the other hand, must
strike a balance between sample efficiency and overfitting. We conduct an
empirical analysis of these trade-offs on PPO, one of the most popular RL
algorithms that uses parallel actors, and establish connections to network
plasticity and, more generally, optimization stability. We examine its impact
on network architectures, as well as the hyper-parameter sensitivity when
scaling data. Our analyses indicate that larger dataset sizes can increase
final performance across a variety of settings, and that scaling parallel
environments is more effective than increasing rollout lengths. These findings
highlight the critical role of data collection strategies in improving agent

Result: 实验表明，ACL显著提升了持续学习性能，平衡了稳定性和可塑性。

Conclusion: ACL为基于PTM的持续学习提供了一个通用解决方案。

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) seeks to enable neural networks to incrementally
acquire new knowledge (plasticity) while retaining existing knowledge
(stability). While pre-trained models (PTMs) have become pivotal in CL,
prevailing approaches freeze the PTM backbone to preserve stability, limiting
their plasticity, particularly when encountering significant domain gaps in
incremental tasks. Conversely, sequentially finetuning the entire PTM risks
catastrophic forgetting of generalizable knowledge, exposing a critical
stability-plasticity trade-off. To address this challenge, we propose Adapting
PTMs before the core CL process (ACL), a novel framework that refines the PTM
backbone through a plug-and-play adaptation phase before learning each new task
with existing CL approaches (e.g., prompt tuning). ACL enhances plasticity by
aligning embeddings with their original class prototypes while distancing them
from others, theoretically and empirically shown to balance stability and
plasticity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACL significantly improves
CL performance across benchmarks and integrated methods, offering a versatile
solution for PTM-based CL.

Conclusion: 重尾现象可能是深度学习有效性的关键因素，HTMP模型为理解其机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Recent theoretical and empirical successes in deep learning, including the
celebrated neural scaling laws, are punctuated by the observation that many
objects of interest tend to exhibit some form of heavy-tailed or power law
behavior. In particular, the prevalence of heavy-tailed spectral densities in
Jacobians, Hessians, and weight matrices has led to the introduction of the
concept of heavy-tailed mechanistic universality (HT-MU). Multiple lines of
empirical evidence suggest a robust correlation between heavy-tailed metrics
and model performance, indicating that HT-MU may be a fundamental aspect of
deep learning efficacy. Here, we propose a general family of random matrix
models -- the high-temperature Marchenko-Pastur (HTMP) ensemble -- to explore
attributes that give rise to heavy-tailed behavior in trained neural networks.
Under this model, spectral densities with power laws on (upper and lower) tails
arise through a combination of three independent factors (complex correlation
structures in the data; reduced temperatures during training; and reduced
eigenvector entropy), appearing as an implicit bias in the model structure, and
they can be controlled with an "eigenvalue repulsion" parameter. Implications
of our model on other appearances of heavy tails, including neural scaling
laws, optimizer trajectories, and the five-plus-one phases of neural network
training, are discussed.

Abstract: Traditional Business Process Management (BPM) struggles with rigidity,
opacity, and scalability in dynamic environments while emerging Large Language

explores four real-world use cases that demonstrate how LLMs, augmented with
trustworthy process intelligence, redefine process modeling, prediction, and
automation. Grounded in early-stage research projects with industrial partners,
the work spans manufacturing, modeling, life-science, and design processes,
addressing domain-specific challenges through human-AI collaboration. In
manufacturing, an LLM-driven framework integrates uncertainty-aware explainable
Machine Learning (ML) with interactive dialogues, transforming opaque
predictions into auditable workflows. For process modeling, conversational
interfaces democratize BPMN design. Pharmacovigilance agents automate drug
safety monitoring via knowledge-graph-augmented LLMs. Finally, sustainable
textile design employs multi-agent systems to navigate regulatory and
environmental trade-offs. We intend to examine tensions between transparency

automation. By mapping these trade-offs, we advocate for context-sensitive
integration prioritizing domain needs, stakeholder values, and iterative
human-in-the-loop workflows over universal solutions. This work provides
actionable insights for researchers and practitioners aiming to operationalize
LLMs in critical BPM environments.

Abstract: With emerging application of Federated Learning (FL) in decision-making
scenarios, it is imperative to regulate model fairness to prevent disparities
across sensitive groups (e.g., female, male). Current research predominantly
focuses on two concepts of group fairness within FL: Global Fairness (overall
model disparity across all clients) and Local Fairness (the disparity within
each client). However, the non-decomposable, non-differentiable nature of
fairness criteria pose two fundamental, unresolved challenges for fair FL: (i)
Harmonizing global and local fairness in multi-class classification; (ii)
Enabling a controllable, optimal accuracy-fairness trade-off. To tackle the
aforementioned challenges, we propose a novel controllable federated
group-fairness calibration framework, named FedFACT. FedFACT identifies the
Bayes-optimal classifiers under both global and local fairness constraints in
multi-class case, yielding models with minimal performance decline while
guaranteeing fairness. To effectively realize an adjustable, optimal
accuracy-fairness balance, we derive specific characterizations of the
Bayes-optimal fair classifiers for reformulating fair FL as personalized
cost-sensitive learning problem for in-processing, and bi-level optimization
for post-processing. Theoretically, we provide convergence and generalization
guarantees for FedFACT to approach the near-optimal accuracy under given
fairness levels. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets across various data
heterogeneity demonstrate that FedFACT consistently outperforms baselines in
balancing accuracy and global-local fairness.

Abstract: Deep learning models frequently encounter feature uncertainty in diverse

This challenge is particularly complex in multi-modal scenarios, where models

Modeling, which continuously refines uncertainty estimates through joint
consideration of feature characteristics and learning dynamics; Adaptive
Distribution-Aware Modulation, which maintains balanced feature distributions
through dynamic sample influence adjustment; and Uncertainty-aware Cross-Modal
Relationship Learning, which explicitly models uncertainties in cross-modal
interactions. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate DUAL's
effectiveness across multiple domains: in computer vision tasks, it achieves
substantial improvements of 7.1% accuracy on CIFAR-10, 6.5% accuracy on
CIFAR-100, and 2.3% accuracy on Tiny-ImageNet; in multi-modal learning, it
demonstrates consistent gains of 4.1% accuracy on CMU-MOSEI and 2.8% accuracy

on MISR. The code will be available on GitHub soon.

Abstract: A prevailing approach to explain time series models is to generate
attribution in time domain. A recent development in time series XAI is the
concept of explanation spaces, where any model trained in the time domain can
be interpreted with any existing XAI method in alternative domains, such as
frequency. The prevailing approach is to present XAI attributions either in the
time domain or in the domain where the attribution is most sparse. In this
paper, we demonstrate that in certain cases, XAI methods can generate
attributions that highlight fundamentally different features in the time and
frequency domains that are not direct counterparts of one another. This
suggests that both domains' attributions should be presented to achieve a more
comprehensive interpretation. Thus it shows the necessity of multi-domain
explanation. To quantify when such cases arise, we introduce the uncertainty
principle (UP), originally developed in quantum mechanics and later studied in
harmonic analysis and signal processing, to the XAI literature. This principle
establishes a lower bound on how much a signal can be simultaneously localized
in both the time and frequency domains. By leveraging this concept, we assess
whether attributions in the time and frequency domains violate this bound,
indicating that they emphasize distinct features. In other words, UP provides a
sufficient condition that the time and frequency domain explanations do not
match and, hence, should be both presented to the end user. We validate the
effectiveness of this approach across various deep learning models, XAI
methods, and a wide range of classification and forecasting datasets. The
frequent occurrence of UP violations across various datasets and XAI methods
highlights the limitations of existing approaches that focus solely on
time-domain explanations. This underscores the need for multi-domain
explanations as a new paradigm.

Abstract: To date, distributional reinforcement learning (distributional RL) methods
have exclusively focused on the discounted setting, where an agent aims to
optimize a potentially-discounted sum of rewards over time. In this work, we
extend distributional RL to the average-reward setting, where an agent aims to
optimize the reward received per time-step. In particular, we utilize a
quantile-based approach to develop the first set of algorithms that can
successfully learn and/or optimize the long-run per-step reward distribution,
as well as the differential return distribution of an average-reward MDP. We
derive proven-convergent tabular algorithms for both prediction and control, as
well as a broader family of algorithms that have appealing scaling properties.
Empirically, we find that these algorithms consistently yield competitive
performance when compared to their non-distributional equivalents, while also
capturing rich information about the long-run reward and return distributions.

Abstract: Simulation-based design space exploration (DSE) aims to efficiently optimize
high-dimensional structured designs under complex constraints and expensive
evaluation costs. Existing approaches, including heuristic and multi-step
reinforcement learning (RL) methods, struggle to balance sampling efficiency
and constraint satisfaction due to sparse, delayed feedback, and large hybrid
action spaces. In this paper, we introduce CORE, a constraint-aware, one-step
RL method for simulationguided DSE. In CORE, the policy agent learns to sample
design configurations by defining a structured distribution over them,
incorporating dependencies via a scaling-graph-based decoder, and by reward
shaping to penalize invalid designs based on the feedback obtained from
simulation. CORE updates the policy using a surrogate objective that compares
the rewards of designs within a sampled batch, without learning a value
function. This critic-free formulation enables efficient learning by
encouraging the selection of higher-reward designs. We instantiate CORE for
hardware-mapping co-design of neural network accelerators, demonstrating that
it significantly improves sample efficiency and achieves better accelerator
configurations compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Our approach is general
and applicable to a broad class of discrete-continuous constrained design
problems.

Abstract: Modern deep generative models can now produce high-quality synthetic samples
that are often indistinguishable from real training data. A growing body of
research aims to understand why recent methods -- such as diffusion and flow
matching techniques -- generalize so effectively. Among the proposed
explanations are the inductive biases of deep learning architectures and the
stochastic nature of the conditional flow matching loss. In this work, we rule
out the latter -- the noisy nature of the loss -- as a primary contributor to
generalization in flow matching. First, we empirically show that in
high-dimensional settings, the stochastic and closed-form versions of the flow
matching loss yield nearly equivalent losses. Then, using state-of-the-art flow
matching models on standard image datasets, we demonstrate that both variants
achieve comparable statistical performance, with the surprising observation
that using the closed-form can even improve performance.

Conclusion: SEMoLA提供了一种无需先验知识、可解释且鲁棒的方法来发现和利用数据中的对称性。

Abstract: Recently, a trend has emerged that favors learning relevant symmetries from
data in geometric domains instead of designing constrained architectures. To do
so, two popular options are (1) to modify the training protocol, e.g., with a
specific loss and data augmentations (soft equivariance), or (2) to ignore
equivariance and infer it only implicitly. However, both options have
limitations: soft equivariance requires a priori knowledge about relevant
symmetries, while inferring symmetries merely via the task and larger data
lacks interpretability. To address both limitations, we propose SEMoLA, an
end-to-end approach that jointly (1) discovers a priori unknown symmetries in
the data via learnable data augmentations, and (2) softly encodes the
respective approximate equivariance into an arbitrary unconstrained model.
Hence, it does not need prior knowledge about symmetries, it offers
interpretability, and it maintains robustness to distribution shifts.
Empirically, we demonstrate the ability of SEMoLA to robustly discover relevant
symmetries while achieving high prediction accuracy across various datasets,
encompassing multiple data modalities and underlying symmetry groups.

Conclusion: Dual-Arch通过架构级设计有效解决稳定性-可塑性权衡问题。

Abstract: The quest for Continual Learning (CL) seeks to empower neural networks with
the ability to learn and adapt incrementally. Central to this pursuit is
addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma, which involves striking a balance
between two conflicting objectives: preserving previously learned knowledge and
acquiring new knowledge. While numerous CL methods aim to achieve this
trade-off, they often overlook the impact of network architecture on stability
and plasticity, restricting the trade-off to the parameter level. In this
paper, we delve into the conflict between stability and plasticity at the
architectural level. We reveal that under an equal parameter constraint, deeper
networks exhibit better plasticity, while wider networks are characterized by
superior stability. To address this architectural-level dilemma, we introduce a
novel framework denoted Dual-Arch, which serves as a plug-in component for CL.
This framework leverages the complementary strengths of two distinct and
independent networks: one dedicated to plasticity and the other to stability.
Each network is designed with a specialized and lightweight architecture,
tailored to its respective objective. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Dual-Arch enhances the performance of existing CL methods while being up to 87%
more compact in terms of parameters.

Conclusion: CARL通过因果引导的特征分离，显著提升了性能预测的泛化能力和可解释性。

Abstract: Performance predictors have emerged as a promising method to accelerate the
evaluation stage of neural architecture search (NAS). These predictors estimate
the performance of unseen architectures by learning from the correlation
between a small set of trained architectures and their performance. However,
most existing predictors ignore the inherent distribution shift between limited
training samples and diverse test samples. Hence, they tend to learn spurious
correlations as shortcuts to predictions, leading to poor generalization. To
address this, we propose a Causality-guided Architecture Representation
Learning (CARL) method aiming to separate critical (causal) and redundant
(non-causal) features of architectures for generalizable architecture
performance prediction. Specifically, we employ a substructure extractor to
split the input architecture into critical and redundant substructures in the
latent space. Then, we generate multiple interventional samples by pairing
critical representations with diverse redundant representations to prioritize
critical features. Extensive experiments on five NAS search spaces demonstrate
the state-of-the-art accuracy and superior interpretability of CARL. For
instance, CARL achieves 97.67% top-1 accuracy on CIFAR-10 using DARTS.

Abstract: When training autoregressive models for dynamical systems, a critical
question arises: how far into the future should the model be trained to
predict? Too short a horizon may miss long-term trends, while too long a
horizon can impede convergence due to accumulating prediction errors. In this
work, we formalize this trade-off by analyzing how the geometry of the loss
landscape depends on the training horizon. We prove that for chaotic systems,
the loss landscape's roughness grows exponentially with the training horizon,
while for limit cycles, it grows linearly, making long-horizon training
inherently challenging. However, we also show that models trained on long
horizons generalize well to short-term forecasts, whereas those trained on
short horizons suffer exponentially (resp. linearly) worse long-term
predictions in chaotic (resp. periodic) systems. We validate our theory through
numerical experiments and discuss practical implications for selecting training
horizons. Our results provide a principled foundation for hyperparameter
optimization in autoregressive forecasting models.

Abstract: In this work, we study the scalability of offline reinforcement learning (RL)
algorithms. In principle, a truly scalable offline RL algorithm should be able
to solve any given problem, regardless of its complexity, given sufficient
data, compute, and model capacity. We investigate if and how current offline RL
algorithms match up to this promise on diverse, challenging, previously
unsolved tasks, using datasets up to 1000x larger than typical offline RL
datasets. We observe that despite scaling up data, many existing offline RL
algorithms exhibit poor scaling behavior, saturating well below the maximum
performance. We hypothesize that the horizon is the main cause behind the poor
scaling of offline RL. We empirically verify this hypothesis through several
analysis experiments, showing that long horizons indeed present a fundamental
barrier to scaling up offline RL. We then show that various horizon reduction
techniques substantially enhance scalability on challenging tasks. Based on our
insights, we also introduce a minimal yet scalable method named SHARSA that
effectively reduces the horizon. SHARSA achieves the best asymptotic
performance and scaling behavior among our evaluation methods, showing that
explicitly reducing the horizon unlocks the scalability of offline RL. Code:

Abstract: The proliferation of artificial intelligence has enabled a diversity of
applications that bridge the gap between digital and physical worlds. As
physical environments are too complex to model through a single information
acquisition approach, it is crucial to fuse multimodal data generated by
different sources, such as sensors, devices, systems, and people, to solve a
problem in the real world. Unfortunately, it is neither applicable nor
sustainable to deploy new resources to collect original data from scratch for
every problem. Thus, when data is inadequate in the domain of problem, it is
vital to fuse knowledge from multimodal data that is already available in other
domains. We call this cross-domain knowledge fusion. Existing research focus on
fusing multimodal data in a single domain, supposing the knowledge from
different datasets is intrinsically aligned; however, this assumption may not
hold in the scenarios of cross-domain knowledge fusion. In this paper, we
formally define the cross-domain multimodal data fusion problem, discussing its
unique challenges, differences and advantages beyond data fusion in a single
domain. We propose a four-layer framework, consisting of Domains, Links, Models
and Data layers, answering three key questions: "what to fuse", "why can be
fused", and "how to fuse". The Domains Layer selects relevant data from
different domains for a given problem. The Links Layer reveals the philosophy
of knowledge alignment beyond specific model structures. The Models Layer
provides two knowledge fusion paradigms based on the fundamental mechanisms for
processing data. The Data Layer turns data of different structures,
resolutions, scales and distributions into a consistent representation that can
be fed into an AI model. With this framework, we can design end-to-end
solutions that fuse cross-domain multimodal data effectively for solving
real-world problems.

Conclusion: kNN在BER估计中表现最佳，但样本需求高；其他方法在多特征情况下表现不佳。

Abstract: The Bayes Error Rate (BER) is the fundamental limit on the achievable
generalizable classification accuracy of any machine learning model due to
inherent uncertainty within the data. BER estimators offer insight into the
difficulty of any classification problem and set expectations for optimal
classification performance. In order to be useful, the estimators must also be
accurate with a limited number of samples on multivariate problems with unknown
class distributions. To determine which estimators meet the minimum
requirements for "usefulness", an in-depth examination of their accuracy is
conducted using Monte Carlo simulations with synthetic data in order to obtain
their confidence bounds for binary classification. To examine the usability of
the estimators on real-world applications, new test scenarios are introduced
upon which 2500 Monte Carlo simulations per scenario are run over a wide range
of BER values. In a comparison of k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Generalized
Henze-Penrose (GHP) divergence and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) techniques,
results show that kNN is overwhelmingly the more accurate non-parametric
estimator. In order to reach the target of an under 5 percent range for the 95
percent confidence bounds, the minimum number of required samples per class is
1000. As more features are added, more samples are needed, so that 2500 samples
per class are required at only 4 features. Other estimators do become more
accurate than kNN as more features are added, but continuously fail to meet the
target range.

Abstract: Traffic congestion and collisions represent significant economic,

developed: a comprehensive 3D city-wide simulation environment that integrates

reinforcement learning framework with custom reward functions prioritizing
safety over efficiency. Unity game engine-based simulation is used for direct
collision modeling. A custom reward enabled reinforcement learning method,
proximal policy optimization (PPO) model, yields substantial improvements over
baseline results, reducing the number of serious collisions, number of
vehicle-vehicle collisions, and total distance travelled by over 3 times the
baseline values. The model also improves fuel efficiency by 39% and reduces
carbon emissions by 88%. Results establish feasibility for city-wide 3D traffic

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现了对任意（非可微）奖励函数的噪声轨迹优化，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The iterative and stochastic nature of diffusion models enables test-time
scaling, whereby spending additional compute during denoising generates
higher-fidelity samples. Increasing the number of denoising steps is the
primary scaling axis, but this yields quickly diminishing returns. Instead
optimizing the noise trajectory--the sequence of injected noise vectors--is
promising, as the specific noise realizations critically affect sample quality;
but this is challenging due to a high-dimensional search space, complex
noise-outcome interactions, and costly trajectory evaluations. We address this
by first casting diffusion as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with a terminal
reward, showing tree-search methods such as Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) to
be meaningful but impractical. To balance performance and efficiency, we then
resort to a relaxation of MDP, where we view denoising as a sequence of
independent contextual bandits. This allows us to introduce an
$\epsilon$-greedy search algorithm that globally explores at extreme timesteps
and locally exploits during the intermediate steps where de-mixing occurs.
Experiments on EDM and Stable Diffusion reveal state-of-the-art scores for
class-conditioned/text-to-image generation, exceeding baselines by up to
$164\%$ and matching/exceeding MCTS performance. To our knowledge, this is the
first practical method for test-time noise trajectory optimization of arbitrary
(non-differentiable) rewards.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is increasingly adopted as a decentralized machine
learning paradigm due to its capability to preserve data privacy by training
models without centralizing user data. However, FL is susceptible to indirect
privacy breaches via network traffic analysis-an area not explored in existing
research. The primary objective of this research is to study the feasibility of
fingerprinting deep learning models deployed within FL environments by
analyzing their network-layer traffic information. In this paper, we conduct an
experimental evaluation using various deep learning architectures (i.e., CNN,
RNN) within a federated learning testbed. We utilize machine learning
algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and
Gradient-Boosting, to fingerprint unique patterns within the traffic data. Our
experiments show high fingerprinting accuracy, achieving 100% accuracy using
Random Forest and around 95.7% accuracy using SVM and Gradient Boosting
classifiers. This analysis suggests that we can identify specific architectures
running within the subsection of the network traffic. Hence, if an adversary
knows about the underlying DL architecture, they can exploit that information
and conduct targeted attacks. These findings suggest a notable security
vulnerability in FL systems and the necessity of strengthening it at the
network level.

Abstract: A neural ordinary differential equation (neural ODE) is a machine learning
model that is commonly described as a continuous depth generalization of a
residual network (ResNet) with a single residual block, or conversely, the
ResNet can be seen as the Euler discretization of the neural ODE. These two
models are therefore strongly related in a way that the behaviors of either
model are considered to be an approximation of the behaviors of the other. In
this work, we establish a more formal relationship between these two models by
bounding the approximation error between two such related models. The obtained
error bound then allows us to use one of the models as a verification proxy for
the other, without running the verification tools twice: if the reachable
output set expanded by the error bound satisfies a safety property on one of
the models, this safety property is then guaranteed to be also satisfied on the
other model. This feature is fully reversible, and the initial safety
verification can be run indifferently on either of the two models. This novel
approach is illustrated on a numerical example of a fixed-point attractor
system modeled as a neural ODE.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) uniquely combine high accuracy with
interpretability, making them valuable for scientific modeling. However, it is
unclear a priori how deep a network needs to be for any given task, and deeper
KANs can be difficult to optimize. Here we introduce multi-exit KANs, where
each layer includes its own prediction branch, enabling the network to make
accurate predictions at multiple depths simultaneously. This architecture
provides deep supervision that improves training while discovering the right
level of model complexity for each task. Multi-exit KANs consistently
outperform standard, single-exit versions on synthetic functions, dynamical
systems, and real-world datasets. Remarkably, the best predictions often come
from earlier, simpler exits, revealing that these networks naturally identify
smaller, more parsimonious and interpretable models without sacrificing
accuracy. To automate this discovery, we develop a differentiable "learning to
exit" algorithm that balances contributions from exits during training. Our
approach offers scientists a practical way to achieve both high performance and
interpretability, addressing a fundamental challenge in machine learning for
scientific discovery.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to budgeted online active learning
from finite-horizon data streams with extremely limited labeling budgets. In
agricultural applications, such streams might include daily weather data over a
growing season, and labels require costly measurements of weather-dependent
plant characteristics. Our method integrates two key sources of prior
information: a collection of preexisting expert predictors and episodic
behavioral knowledge of the experts based on unlabeled data streams. Unlike
previous research on online active learning with experts, our work
simultaneously considers query budgets, finite horizons, and episodic
knowledge, enabling effective learning in applications with severely limited
labeling capacity. We demonstrate the utility of our approach through
experiments on various prediction problems derived from both a realistic
agricultural crop simulator and real-world data from multiple grape cultivars.
The results show that our method significantly outperforms baseline expert
predictions, uniform query selection, and existing approaches that consider
budgets and limited horizons but neglect episodic knowledge, even under highly
constrained labeling budgets.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are powerful in terms of their inference abilities,
but are also notorious for their incompleteness and long-tail distribution of
relations. To address these challenges and expand the coverage of KGs, few-shot
KG completion aims to make predictions for triplets involving novel relations
when only a few training triplets are provided as reference. Previous methods
have focused on designing local neighbor aggregators to learn entity-level
information and/or imposing a potentially invalid sequential dependency
assumption at the triplet level to learn meta relation information. However,
pairwise triplet-level interactions and context-level relational information
have been largely overlooked for learning meta representations of few-shot
relations. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical relational learning method
(HiRe) for few-shot KG completion. By jointly capturing three levels of
relational information (entity-level, triplet-level and context-level), HiRe
can effectively learn and refine meta representations of few-shot relations,
and thus generalize well to new unseen relations. Extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets validate the superiority of HiRe over state-of-the-art
methods. The code can be found in https://github.com/alexhw15/HiRe.git.

Abstract: We propose a new ternary spiking neuron model to improve the representation
capacity of binary spiking neurons in deep Q-learning. Although a ternary
neuron model has recently been introduced to overcome the limited
representation capacity offered by the binary spiking neurons, we show that its
performance is worse than that of binary models in deep Q-learning tasks. We
hypothesize gradient estimation bias during the training process as the
underlying potential cause through mathematical and empirical analysis. We
propose a novel ternary spiking neuron model to mitigate this issue by reducing
the estimation bias. We use the proposed ternary spiking neuron as the
fundamental computing unit in a deep spiking Q-learning network (DSQN) and
evaluate the network's performance in seven Atari games from the Gym
environment. Results show that the proposed ternary spiking neuron mitigates
the drastic performance degradation of ternary neurons in Q-learning tasks and
improves the network performance compared to the existing binary neurons,
making DSQN a more practical solution for on-board autonomous decision-making
tasks.

Abstract: We present an empirical validation of the directional non-commutative
monoidal embedding framework recently introduced in prior
work~\cite{Godavarti2025monoidal}. This framework defines learnable
compositional embeddings using distinct non-commutative operators per dimension
(axis) that satisfy an interchange law, generalizing classical one-dimensional
transforms. Our primary goal is to verify that this framework can effectively
model real data by applying it to a controlled, well-understood task: image
classification on the MNIST dataset~\cite{lecun1998gradient}. A central
hypothesis for why the proposed monoidal embedding works well is that it
generalizes the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)~\cite{oppenheim1999discrete}
by learning task-specific frequency components instead of using fixed basis
frequencies. We test this hypothesis by comparing learned monoidal embeddings
against fixed DFT-based embeddings on MNIST. The results show that as the
embedding dimensionality decreases (e.g., from 32 to 8 to 2), the performance
gap between the learned monoidal embeddings and fixed DFT-based embeddings on
MNIST grows increasingly large. This comparison is used as an analytic tool to
explain why the framework performs well: the learnable embeddings can capture
the most discriminative spectral components for the task. Overall, our
experiments confirm that directional non-commutative monoidal embeddings are
highly effective for representing image data, offering a compact learned
representation that retains high task performance. The code used in this work

Abstract: Navigation path traces play a crucial role in video game design, serving as a
vital resource for both enhancing player engagement and fine-tuning
non-playable character behavior. Generating such paths with human-like realism
can enrich the overall gaming experience, and evaluating path traces can
provide game designers insights into player interactions. Despite the
impressive recent advancements in deep learning-based generative modeling, the
video game industry hesitates to adopt such models for path generation, often
citing their complex training requirements and interpretability challenges. To
address these problems, we propose a novel path generation and evaluation
approach that is grounded in principled nonparametric statistics and provides
precise control while offering interpretable insights. Our path generation
method fuses two statistical techniques: (1) nonparametric model-free
transformations that capture statistical characteristics of path traces through
time; and (2) copula models that capture statistical dependencies in space. For
path evaluation, we adapt a nonparametric three-sample hypothesis test designed
to determine if the generated paths are overfit (mimicking the original data
too closely) or underfit (diverging too far from it). We demonstrate the
precision and reliability of our proposed methods with empirical analysis on
two existing gaming benchmarks to showcase controlled generation of diverse
navigation paths. Notably, our novel path generator can be fine-tuned with user
controllable parameters to create navigation paths that exhibit varying levels
of human-likeness in contrast to those produced by neural network-based agents.

Abstract: We propose Conformal Mixed-Integer Constraint Learning (C-MICL), a novel
framework that provides probabilistic feasibility guarantees for data-driven
constraints in optimization problems. While standard Mixed-Integer Constraint
Learning methods often violate the true constraints due to model error or data
limitations, our C-MICL approach leverages conformal prediction to ensure
feasible solutions are ground-truth feasible. This guarantee holds with
probability at least $1{-}\alpha$, under a conditional independence assumption.
The proposed framework supports both regression and classification tasks
without requiring access to the true constraint function, while avoiding the
scalability issues associated with ensemble-based heuristics. Experiments on
real-world applications demonstrate that C-MICL consistently achieves target
feasibility rates, maintains competitive objective performance, and
significantly reduces computational cost compared to existing methods. Our work
bridges mathematical optimization and machine learning, offering a principled
approach to incorporate uncertainty-aware constraints into decision-making with
rigorous statistical guarantees.

Abstract: In many machine learning tasks, it is often necessary for the relationship
between input and output variables to be monotonic, including both strictly
monotonic and implicitly monotonic relationships. Traditional methods for
maintaining monotonicity mainly rely on construction or regularization
techniques, whereas this paper shows that the issue of strict monotonic
probability can be viewed as a partial order between an observable revenue
variable and a latent cost variable. This perspective enables us to reformulate
the monotonicity challenge into modeling the latent cost variable. To tackle
this, we introduce a generative network for the latent cost variable, termed
the Generative Cost Model (GCM), which inherently addresses the strict
monotonic problem, and propose the Implicit Generative Cost Model (IGCM) to
address the implicit monotonic problem. We further validate our approach with a
numerical simulation of quantile regression and conduct multiple experiments on
public datasets, showing that our method significantly outperforms existing
monotonic modeling techniques. The code for our experiments can be found at

Abstract: The decision-making process significantly influences the predictions of
machine learning models. This is especially important in rule-based systems
such as Learning Fuzzy-Classifier Systems (LFCSs) where the selection and
application of rules directly determine prediction accuracy and reliability.
LFCSs combine evolutionary algorithms with supervised learning to optimize
fuzzy classification rules, offering enhanced interpretability and robustness.
Despite these advantages, research on improving decision-making mechanisms
(i.e., class inference schemes) in LFCSs remains limited. Most LFCSs use
voting-based or single-winner-based inference schemes. These schemes rely on
classification performance on training data and may not perform well on unseen
data, risking overfitting. To address these limitations, this article
introduces a novel class inference scheme for LFCSs based on the
Dempster-Shafer Theory of Evidence (DS theory). The proposed scheme handles
uncertainty well. By using the DS theory, the scheme calculates belief masses
(i.e., measures of belief) for each specific class and the ``I don't know''
state from each fuzzy rule and infers a class from these belief masses. Unlike
the conventional schemes, the proposed scheme also considers the ``I don't
know'' state that reflects uncertainty, thereby improving the transparency and
reliability of LFCSs. Applied to a variant of LFCS (i.e., Fuzzy-UCS), the
proposed scheme demonstrates statistically significant improvements in terms of
test macro F1 scores across 30 real-world datasets compared to conventional
voting-based and single-winner-based fuzzy inference schemes. It forms smoother
decision boundaries, provides reliable confidence measures, and enhances the
robustness and generalizability of LFCSs in real-world applications. Our
implementation is available at https://github.com/YNU-NakataLab/jUCS.

Conclusion: 本文提出的技术为去除Shampoo的启发式方法提供了理论支持，改进了Kronecker分解训练算法。

Abstract: The recent success of Shampoo in the AlgoPerf contest has sparked renewed
interest in Kronecker-factorization-based optimization algorithms for training
neural networks. Despite its success, Shampoo relies heavily on several
heuristics such as learning rate grafting and stale preconditioning to achieve
performance at-scale. These heuristics increase algorithmic complexity,
necessitate further hyperparameter tuning, and lack theoretical justification.
This paper investigates these heuristics from the angle of Frobenius norm
approximation to full-matrix Adam and decouples the preconditioner's
eigenvalues and eigenbasis updates. We show that grafting from Adam mitigates
the staleness and mis-scaling of the preconditioner's eigenvalues and how
correcting the eigenvalues directly can eliminate the need for learning rate
grafting. To manage the error induced by infrequent eigenbasis computations, we
propose an adaptive criterion for determining the eigenbasis computation
frequency motivated by terminating a warm-started QR algorithm. This criterion
decouples the update frequency of different preconditioner matrices and enables
us to investigate the impact of approximation error on convergence. These
practical techniques offer a principled angle towards removing Shampoo's
heuristics and developing improved Kronecker-factorization-based training
algorithms.

Abstract: Rule representations significantly influence the search capabilities and
decision boundaries within the search space of Learning Classifier Systems
(LCSs), a family of rule-based machine learning systems that evolve
interpretable models through evolutionary processes. However, it is very
difficult to choose an appropriate rule representation for each problem.
Additionally, some problems benefit from using different representations for
different subspaces within the input space. Thus, an adaptive mechanism is
needed to choose an appropriate rule representation for each rule in LCSs. This
article introduces a flexible rule representation using a four-parameter beta
distribution and integrates it into a fuzzy-style LCS. The four-parameter beta
distribution can form various function shapes, and this flexibility enables our
LCS to automatically select appropriate representations for different
subspaces. Our rule representation can represent crisp/fuzzy decision
boundaries in various boundary shapes, such as rectangles and bells, by
controlling four parameters, compared to the standard representations such as
trapezoidal ones. Leveraging this flexibility, our LCS is designed to adapt the
appropriate rule representation for each subspace. Moreover, our LCS
incorporates a generalization bias favoring crisp rules where feasible,
enhancing model interpretability without compromising accuracy. Experimental
results on real-world classification tasks show that our LCS achieves
significantly superior test accuracy and produces more compact rule sets. Our
implementation is available at https://github.com/YNU-NakataLab/Beta4-UCS. An

Abstract: Federated learning, as a distributed architecture, shows great promise for
applications in Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (CPSS). In order to mitigate the
privacy risks inherent in CPSS, the integration of differential privacy with
federated learning has attracted considerable attention. Existing research
mainly focuses on dynamically adjusting the noise added or discarding certain
gradients to mitigate the noise introduced by differential privacy. However,
these approaches fail to remove the noise that hinders convergence and correct
the gradients affected by the noise, which significantly reduces the accuracy
of model classification. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a
novel framework for differentially private federated learning that balances
rigorous privacy guarantees with accuracy by introducing a server-side gradient
correction mechanism. Specifically, after clients perform gradient clipping and
noise perturbation, our framework detects deviations in the noisy local
gradients and employs a projection mechanism to correct them, mitigating the
negative impact of noise. Simultaneously, gradient projection promotes the
alignment of gradients from different clients and guides the model towards
convergence to a global optimum. We evaluate our framework on several benchmark
datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that it achieves
state-of-the-art performance under the same privacy budget.

heterogeneous GNN backbones. In this work, we propose a graph generation
strategy that instantiates the mixture distribution of multiple domains. Then,
we merge and fine-tune the pre-trained graph models via a MoE module and a
masking mechanism for generalized adaptation. Our framework is
architecture-agnostic and can operate without any source/target domain data.
Both theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach in addressing the model generalization problem.

Abstract: Annotating data is a time-consuming and costly task, but it is inherently
required for supervised machine learning. Active Learning (AL) is an
established method that minimizes human labeling effort by iteratively
selecting the most informative unlabeled samples for expert annotation, thereby
improving the overall classification performance. Even though AL has been known
for decades, AL is still rarely used in real-world applications. As indicated
in the two community web surveys among the NLP community about AL, two main
reasons continue to hold practitioners back from using AL: first, the
complexity of setting AL up, and second, a lack of trust in its effectiveness.
We hypothesize that both reasons share the same culprit: the large
hyperparameter space of AL. This mostly unexplored hyperparameter space often
leads to misleading and irreproducible AL experiment results. In this study, we
first compiled a large hyperparameter grid of over 4.6 million hyperparameter
combinations, second, recorded the performance of all combinations in the
so-far biggest conducted AL study, and third, analyzed the impact of each
hyperparameter in the experiment results. In the end, we give recommendations
about the influence of each hyperparameter, demonstrate the surprising
influence of the concrete AL strategy implementation, and outline an

Abstract: We consider learning a predictive model to be subsequently used for a given
downstream task (described by an algorithm) that requires access to the model
evaluation. This task need not be prediction, and this situation is frequently
encountered in machine-learning-augmented scientific computing. We show that
this setting differs from classical supervised learning, and in general it
cannot be solved by minimizing the mean square error of the model predictions
as is frequently performed in the literature. Instead, we find that the maximum
prediction error on the support of the downstream task algorithm can serve as
an effective estimate for the subsequent task performance. With this insight,
we formulate a task-specific supervised learning problem based on the given
sampling measure, whose solution serves as a reliable surrogate model for the
downstream task. Then, we discretize the empirical risk based on training data,
and develop an iterative algorithm to solve the task-specific supervised
learning problem. Three illustrative numerical examples on trajectory
prediction, optimal control and minimum energy path computation demonstrate the
effectiveness of the approach.

non-trivial to estimate in high dimensions, current research focuses on finding
effective SIVI training routines. Although unbiased implicit variational
inference (UIVI) has largely been dismissed as imprecise and computationally
prohibitive because of its inner MCMC loop, we revisit this method and show

Abstract: We propose a framework for hypothesis testing on conditional probability
distributions, which we then use to construct conditional two-sample
statistical tests. These tests identify the inputs -- called covariates in this
context -- where two conditional expectations differ with high probability. Our
key idea is to transform confidence bounds of a learning method into a
conditional two-sample test, and we instantiate this principle for kernel ridge
regression (KRR) and conditional kernel mean embeddings. We generalize existing
pointwise-in-time or time-uniform confidence bounds for KRR to
previously-inaccessible yet essential cases such as infinite-dimensional
outputs with non-trace-class kernels. These bounds enable circumventing the
need for independent data in our statistical tests, since they allow online
sampling. We also introduce bootstrapping schemes leveraging the parametric
form of testing thresholds identified in theory to avoid tuning inaccessible
parameters, making our method readily applicable in practice. Such conditional
two-sample tests are especially relevant in applications where data arrive
sequentially or non-independently, or when output distributions vary with
operational parameters. We demonstrate their utility through examples in
process monitoring and comparison of dynamical systems. Overall, our results
establish a comprehensive foundation for conditional two-sample testing, from
theoretical guarantees to practical implementation, and advance the
state-of-the-art on the concentration of vector-valued least squares
estimation.

Abstract: The lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH) is well-studied for convolutional neural
networks but has been validated only empirically for graph neural networks
(GNNs), for which theoretical findings are largely lacking. In this paper, we
identify the expressivity of sparse subnetworks, i.e. their ability to
distinguish non-isomorphic graphs, as crucial for finding winning tickets that
preserve the predictive performance. We establish conditions under which the
expressivity of a sparsely initialized GNN matches that of the full network,
particularly when compared to the Weisfeiler-Leman test, and in that context
put forward and prove a Strong Expressive Lottery Ticket Hypothesis. We
subsequently show that an increased expressivity in the initialization
potentially accelerates model convergence and improves generalization. Our
findings establish novel theoretical foundations for both LTH and GNN research,
highlighting the importance of maintaining expressivity in sparsely initialized
GNNs. We illustrate our results using examples from drug discovery.

Abstract: Conventional wisdom attributes the mysterious generalization abilities of
overparameterized neural networks to gradient descent (and its variants). The
recent volume hypothesis challenges this view: it posits that these
generalization abilities persist even when gradient descent is replaced by
Guess & Check (G&C), i.e., by drawing weight settings until one that fits the
training data is found. The validity of the volume hypothesis for wide and deep
neural networks remains an open question. In this paper, we theoretically
investigate this question for matrix factorization (with linear and non-linear
activation)--a common testbed in neural network theory. We first prove that
generalization under G&C deteriorates with increasing width, establishing what
is, to our knowledge, the first case where G&C is provably inferior to gradient
descent. Conversely, we prove that generalization under G&C improves with
increasing depth, revealing a stark contrast between wide and deep networks,
which we further validate empirically. These findings suggest that even in
simple settings, there may not be a simple answer to the question of whether
neural networks need gradient descent to generalize well.

Abstract: As AI evolves, collaboration among heterogeneous models helps overcome data
scarcity by enabling knowledge transfer across institutions and devices.
Traditional Federated Learning (FL) only supports homogeneous models, limiting
collaboration among clients with heterogeneous model architectures. To address
this, Heterogeneous Federated Learning (HtFL) methods are developed to enable
collaboration across diverse heterogeneous models while tackling the data
heterogeneity issue at the same time. However, a comprehensive benchmark for
standardized evaluation and analysis of the rapidly growing HtFL methods is
lacking. Firstly, the highly varied datasets, model heterogeneity scenarios,
and different method implementations become hurdles to making easy and fair
comparisons among HtFL methods. Secondly, the effectiveness and robustness of
HtFL methods are under-explored in various scenarios, such as the medical
domain and sensor signal modality. To fill this gap, we introduce the first
Heterogeneous Federated Learning Library (HtFLlib), an easy-to-use and
extensible framework that integrates multiple datasets and model heterogeneity
scenarios, offering a robust benchmark for research and practical applications.
Specifically, HtFLlib integrates (1) 12 datasets spanning various domains,
modalities, and data heterogeneity scenarios; (2) 40 model architectures,
ranging from small to large, across three modalities; (3) a modularized and
easy-to-extend HtFL codebase with implementations of 10 representative HtFL
methods; and (4) systematic evaluations in terms of accuracy, convergence,
computation costs, and communication costs. We emphasize the advantages and

Abstract: Utilizing the complex inter-variable causal relationships within multivariate
time-series provides a promising avenue toward more robust and reliable
multivariate time-series anomaly detection (MTSAD) but remains an underexplored
area of research. This paper proposes Causality-Aware contrastive learning for
RObust multivariate Time-Series (CAROTS), a novel MTSAD pipeline that
incorporates the notion of causality into contrastive learning. CAROTS employs
two data augmentors to obtain causality-preserving and -disturbing samples that
serve as a wide range of normal variations and synthetic anomalies,
respectively. With causality-preserving and -disturbing samples as positives
and negatives, CAROTS performs contrastive learning to train an encoder whose
latent space separates normal and abnormal samples based on causality.
Moreover, CAROTS introduces a similarity-filtered one-class contrastive loss
that encourages the contrastive learning process to gradually incorporate more
semantically diverse samples with common causal relationships. Extensive
experiments on five real-world and two synthetic datasets validate that the
integration of causal relationships endows CAROTS with improved MTSAD
capabilities. The code is available at https://github.com/kimanki/CAROTS.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have proven to be effective in modeling
high-dimensional distributions, leading to their widespread adoption for
representing complex priors in Bayesian inverse problems (BIPs). However,
current DM-based posterior sampling methods proposed for solving common BIPs
rely on heuristic approximations to the generative process. To exploit the
generative capability of DMs and avoid the usage of such approximations, we
propose an ensemble-based algorithm that performs posterior sampling without
the use of heuristic approximations. Our algorithm is motivated by existing
works that combine DM-based methods with the sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)
method. By examining how the prior evolves through the diffusion process
encoded by the pre-trained score function, we derive a modified partial
differential equation (PDE) governing the evolution of the corresponding
posterior distribution. This PDE includes a modified diffusion term and a
reweighting term, which can be simulated via stochastic weighted particle
methods. Theoretically, we prove that the error between the true posterior
distribution can be bounded in terms of the training error of the pre-trained
score function and the number of particles in the ensemble. Empirically, we
validate our algorithm on several inverse problems in imaging to show that our
method gives more accurate reconstructions compared to existing DM-based
methods.

Abstract: In machine learning, knowing the impact of a given datum on model training is
a fundamental task referred to as Data Valuation. Building on previous works
from the literature, we have designed a novel canonical decomposition allowing
practitioners to analyze any data valuation method as the combination of two
parts: a utility function that captures characteristics from a given model and
an aggregation procedure that merges such information. We also propose to use
Gaussian Processes as a means to easily access the utility function on
``sub-models'', which are models trained on a subset of the training set. The
strength of our approach stems from both its theoretical grounding in Bayesian
theory, and its practical reach, by enabling fast estimation of valuations
thanks to efficient update formulae.

Abstract: Sliced Mutual Information (SMI) is widely used as a scalable alternative to
mutual information for measuring non-linear statistical dependence. Despite its
advantages, such as faster convergence, robustness to high dimensionality, and
nullification only under statistical independence, we demonstrate that SMI is
highly susceptible to data manipulation and exhibits counterintuitive behavior.
Through extensive benchmarking and theoretical analysis, we show that SMI
saturates easily, fails to detect increases in statistical dependence (even
under linear transformations designed to enhance the extraction of
information), prioritizes redundancy over informative content, and in some
cases, performs worse than simpler dependence measures like the correlation
coefficient.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a subfield of machine learning that avoids sharing
local data with a central server, which can enhance privacy and scalability.
The inability to consolidate data leads to a unique problem called dataset
imbalance, where agents in a network do not have equal representation of the
labels one is trying to learn to predict. In FL, fusing locally-trained models
with unbalanced datasets may deteriorate the performance of global model
aggregation, and reduce the quality of updated local models and the accuracy of
the distributed agents' decisions. In this work, we introduce an Optimal
Transport-based preprocessing algorithm that aligns the datasets by minimizing
the distributional discrepancy of data along the edge devices. We accomplish
this by leveraging Wasserstein barycenters when computing channel-wise
averages. These barycenters are collected in a trusted central server where
they collectively generate a target RGB space. By projecting our dataset
towards this target space, we minimize the distributional discrepancy on a
global level, which facilitates the learning process due to a minimization of
variance across the samples. We demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed
approach over the CIFAR-10 dataset, where we show its capability of reaching
higher degrees of generalization in fewer communication rounds.

Abstract: We consider the Top-$K$ selection problem, which aims to identify the
largest-$K$ elements from an array. Top-$K$ selection arises in many machine
learning algorithms and often becomes a bottleneck on accelerators, which are
optimized for dense matrix multiplications. To address this problem,
\citet{chern2022tpuknnknearestneighbor} proposed a fast two-stage
\textit{approximate} Top-$K$ algorithm: (i) partition the input array and
select the top-$1$ element from each partition, (ii) sort this \textit{smaller
subset} and return the top $K$ elements. In this paper, we consider a
generalized version of this algorithm, where the first stage selects top-$K'$
elements, for some $1 \leq K' \leq K$, from each partition. Our contributions
are as follows: (i) we derive an expression for the expected recall of this
generalized algorithm and show that choosing $K' > 1$ with fewer partitions in
the first stage reduces the input size to the second stage more effectively
while maintaining the same expected recall as the original algorithm, (ii) we
derive a bound on the expected recall for the original algorithm in
\citet{chern2022tpuknnknearestneighbor} that is provably tighter by a factor of
$2$ than the one in that paper, and (iii) we implement our algorithm on Cloud
TPUv5e and achieve around an order of magnitude speedups over the original
algorithm without sacrificing recall on real-world tasks.

Abstract: Generating realistic synthetic tabular data presents a critical challenge in
machine learning. It adds another layer of complexity when this data contain
class imbalance problems. This paper presents a novel token-aware data
imputation method that leverages the in-context learning capabilities of large
language models. This is achieved through the combination of a structured
group-wise CSV-style prompting technique and the elimination of irrelevant
contextual information in the input prompt. We test this approach with two
class-imbalanced binary classification datasets and evaluate the effectiveness
of imputation using classification-based evaluation metrics. The experimental
results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the input prompt
size while maintaining or improving imputation quality compared to our baseline
prompt, especially for datasets that are of relatively smaller in size. The
contributions of this presented work is two-fold -- 1) it sheds light on the
importance of prompt design when leveraging LLMs for synthetic data generation
and 2) it addresses a critical gap in LLM-based data imputation for
class-imbalanced datasets with missing data by providing a practical solution
within computational constraints. We hope that our work will foster further
research and discussions about leveraging the incredible potential of LLMs and
prompt engineering techniques for synthetic data generation.

Abstract: In recent years, graph anomaly detection has found extensive applications in
various domains such as social, financial, and communication networks. However,
anomalies in graph-structured data present unique challenges, including label
scarcity, ill-defined anomalies, and varying anomaly types, making supervised
or semi-supervised methods unreliable. Researchers often adopt unsupervised
approaches to address these challenges, assuming that anomalies deviate
significantly from the normal data distribution. Yet, when the available data
is insufficient, capturing the normal distribution accurately and
comprehensively becomes difficult. To overcome this limitation, we propose to
utilize external graph data (i.e., graph data in the wild) to help anomaly
detection tasks. This naturally raises the question: How can we use external
data to help graph anomaly detection tasks? To answer this question, we propose
a framework called Wild-GAD. It is built upon a unified database, UniWildGraph,
which comprises a large and diverse collection of graph data with broad domain
coverage, ample data volume, and a unified feature space. Further, we develop
selection criteria based on representativity and diversity to identify the most
suitable external data for anomaly detection task. Extensive experiments on six
real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Wild-GAD. Compared to the
baseline methods, our framework has an average 18% AUCROC and 32% AUCPR
improvement over the best-competing methods.

crystal structure optimization. MACS treats geometry optimization as a
partially observable Markov game in which atoms are agents that adjust their
positions to collectively discover a stable configuration. We train MACS across
various compositions of reported crystalline materials to obtain a policy that
successfully optimizes structures from the training compositions as well as
structures of larger sizes and unseen compositions, confirming its excellent
scalability and zero-shot transferability. We benchmark our approach against a
broad range of state-of-the-art optimization methods and demonstrate that MACS
optimizes periodic crystal structures significantly faster, with fewer energy
calculations, and the lowest failure rate.

Result: 实验表明，WaSeCom在图像和文本传输中显著提升了噪声和对抗扰动下的鲁棒性，保持了语义保真度。

Conclusion: WaSeCom为语义通信提供了一种通用且鲁棒的解决方案，适用于多变无线环境。

Abstract: 6G wireless systems are expected to support massive volumes of data with
ultra-low latency. However, conventional bit-level transmission strategies
cannot support the efficiency and adaptability required by modern,
data-intensive applications. The concept of semantic communication (SemCom)
addresses this limitation by focusing on transmitting task-relevant semantic
information instead of raw data. While recent efforts incorporating deep
learning and large-scale AI models have improved SemCom's performance, existing
systems remain vulnerable to both semantic-level and transmission-level noise
because they often rely on domain-specific architectures that hinder
generalizability. In this paper, a novel and generalized semantic communication
framework called WaSeCom is proposed to systematically address uncertainty and
enhance robustness. In particular, Wasserstein distributionally robust
optimization is employed to provide resilience against semantic
misinterpretation and channel perturbations. A rigorous theoretical analysis is
performed to establish the robust generalization guarantees of the proposed
framework. Experimental results on image and text transmission demonstrate that
WaSeCom achieves improved robustness under noise and adversarial perturbations.
These results highlight its effectiveness in preserving semantic fidelity
across varying wireless conditions.

Abstract: Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) are widely used statistical models for
representing multi-modal data distributions, with numerous applications in data
mining, pattern recognition, data simulation, and machine learning. However,
recent research has shown that releasing GMM parameters poses significant
privacy risks, potentially exposing sensitive information about the underlying
data. In this paper, we address the challenge of releasing GMM parameters while
ensuring differential privacy (DP) guarantees. Specifically, we focus on the
privacy protection of mixture weights, component means, and covariance
matrices. We propose to use Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence as a utility
metric to assess the accuracy of the released GMM, as it captures the joint
impact of noise perturbation on all the model parameters. To achieve privacy,
we introduce a DP mechanism that adds carefully calibrated random perturbations
to the GMM parameters. Through theoretical analysis, we quantify the effects of
privacy budget allocation and perturbation statistics on the DP guarantee, and
derive a tractable expression for evaluating KL divergence. We formulate and
solve an optimization problem to minimize the KL divergence between the
released and original models, subject to a given $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP
constraint. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that our approach achieves strong privacy guarantees while
maintaining high utility.

Abstract: This paper proposes a highly compact, lightweight text-to-speech (TTS) model
for on-device applications. To reduce the model size, the proposed model
introduces two techniques. First, we introduce quantization-aware training
(QAT), which quantizes model parameters during training to as low as 1.58-bit.
In this case, most of 32-bit model parameters are quantized to ternary values
{-1, 0, 1}. Second, we propose a method named weight indexing. In this method,
we save a group of 1.58-bit weights as a single int8 index. This allows for
efficient storage of model parameters, even on hardware that treats values in
units of 8-bit. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
achieved 83 % reduction in model size, while outperforming the baseline of
similar model size without quantization in synthesis quality.

Abstract: Due to their intuitive appeal, Bayesian methods of modeling and uncertainty

propose measures of the quality of the Bayesian inferential stage, and suggest

Abstract: Combinatorial Optimization problems are widespread in domains such as
logistics, manufacturing, and drug discovery, yet their NP-hard nature makes
them computationally challenging. Recent Neural Combinatorial Optimization
methods leverage deep learning to learn solution strategies, trained via
Supervised or Reinforcement Learning (RL). While promising, these approaches
often rely on task-specific augmentations, perform poorly on
out-of-distribution instances, and lack robust inference mechanisms. Moreover,
existing latent space models either require labeled data or rely on pre-trained
policies. In this work, we propose LGS-Net, a novel latent space model that
conditions on problem instances, and introduce an efficient inference method,
Latent Guided Sampling (LGS), based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Stochastic
Approximation. We show that the iterations of our method form a
time-inhomogeneous Markov Chain and provide rigorous theoretical convergence
guarantees. Empirical results on benchmark routing tasks show that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance among RL-based approaches.

Conclusion: IncA协议在去中心化差分隐私计算中表现出色，尤其在节点断开情况下优于现有技术。

Abstract: Achieving differentially private computations in decentralized settings poses
significant challenges, particularly regarding accuracy, communication cost,
and robustness against information leakage. While cryptographic solutions offer
promise, they often suffer from high communication overhead or require
centralization in the presence of network failures. Conversely, existing fully
decentralized approaches typically rely on relaxed adversarial models or
pairwise noise cancellation, the latter suffering from substantial accuracy
degradation if parties unexpectedly disconnect. In this work, we propose IncA,
a new protocol for fully decentralized mean estimation, a widely used primitive
in data-intensive processing. Our protocol, which enforces differential
privacy, requires no central orchestration and employs low-variance correlated
noise, achieved by incrementally injecting sensitive information into the
computation. First, we theoretically demonstrate that, when no parties
permanently disconnect, our protocol achieves accuracy comparable to that of a
centralized setting-already an improvement over most existing decentralized
differentially private techniques. Second, we empirically show that our use of
low-variance correlated noise significantly mitigates the accuracy loss
experienced by existing techniques in the presence of dropouts.

Abstract: Transforming complex actions into discrete skill abstractions has
demonstrated strong potential for robotic manipulation. Existing approaches
mainly leverage latent variable models, e.g., VQ-VAE, to learn skill
abstractions through learned vectors (codebooks), while they suffer from
codebook collapse and modeling the causal relationship between learned skills.
To address these limitations, we present \textbf{S}kill \textbf{T}raining with
\textbf{A}ugmented \textbf{R}otation (\textbf{STAR}), a framework that advances
both skill learning and composition to complete complex behaviors.
Specifically, to prevent codebook collapse, we devise rotation-augmented
residual skill quantization (RaRSQ). It encodes relative angles between encoder
outputs into the gradient flow by rotation-based gradient mechanism. Points
within the same skill code are forced to be either pushed apart or pulled
closer together depending on gradient directions. Further, to capture the
causal relationship between skills, we present causal skill transformer (CST)
which explicitly models dependencies between skill representations through an
autoregressive mechanism for coherent action generation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority of STAR on both LIBERO benchmark and realworld
tasks, with around 12\% improvement over the baselines.

reinforcement learning based lateral control approach, despite the
imperfections in the vehicle models due to measurement errors and
simplifications, is presented. Our approach ensures comfortable, efficient, and
robust control performance considering the interface between controlling and

Control (MPC)-PID part as the basis and the demonstrator, and the Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) part which leverages the online information from
the MPC-PID part. The controller's performance is evaluated in CARLA using the
ground truth of the waypoints as inputs. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the controller when vehicle information is incomplete, and the
training of DRL can be stabilized with the demonstration part. These findings
highlight the potential to reduce development and integration efforts for

Motivation: 传统ATE估计依赖无混淆性和重叠性假设，但许多研究（如回归断点设计）违反这些假设。本文旨在找到更通用的ATE识别条件。

Method: 基于统计学习理论，提出一个解释性条件，证明其充分且近乎必要，并应用于多个经典场景（如Tan和Rosenbaum的模型）。

Result: 证明了新条件在多种场景下有效，包括回归断点设计，且在小样本下可估计ATE。

Conclusion: 研究为复杂治疗机制的因果推断提供了新思路，连接了学习理论和因果推断方法。

Abstract: Most of the widely used estimators of the average treatment effect (ATE) in
causal inference rely on the assumptions of unconfoundedness and overlap.
Unconfoundedness requires that the observed covariates account for all
correlations between the outcome and treatment. Overlap requires the existence
of randomness in treatment decisions for all individuals. Nevertheless, many
types of studies frequently violate unconfoundedness or overlap, for instance,
observational studies with deterministic treatment decisions -- popularly known
as Regression Discontinuity designs -- violate overlap.
  In this paper, we initiate the study of general conditions that enable the
identification of the average treatment effect, extending beyond
unconfoundedness and overlap. In particular, following the paradigm of
statistical learning theory, we provide an interpretable condition that is
sufficient and nearly necessary for the identification of ATE. Moreover, this
condition characterizes the identification of the average treatment effect on
the treated (ATT) and can be used to characterize other treatment effects as
well. To illustrate the utility of our condition, we present several
well-studied scenarios where our condition is satisfied and, hence, we prove
that ATE can be identified in regimes that prior works could not capture. For
example, under mild assumptions on the data distributions, this holds for the
models proposed by Tan (2006) and Rosenbaum (2002), and the Regression
Discontinuity design model introduced by Thistlethwaite and Campbell (1960).
For each of these scenarios, we also show that, under natural additional
assumptions, ATE can be estimated from finite samples.
  We believe these findings open new avenues for bridging learning-theoretic
insights and causal inference methodologies, particularly in observational
studies with complex treatment mechanisms.

Abstract: The increasing presence of automated vehicles (AVs) presents new challenges
for crash classification and safety analysis. Accurately identifying the SAE
automation level involved in each crash is essential to understanding crash
dynamics and system accountability. However, existing approaches often overlook
automation-specific factors and lack model sophistication to capture
distinctions between different SAE levels. To address this gap, this study
evaluates the performance of three advanced tabular deep learning models
MambaAttention, TabPFN, and TabTransformer for classifying SAE automation
levels using structured crash data from Texas (2024), covering 4,649 cases
categorized as Assisted Driving (SAE Level 1), Partial Automation (SAE Level
2), and Advanced Automation (SAE Levels 3-5 combined). Following class
balancing using SMOTEENN, the models were trained and evaluated on a unified
dataset of 7,300 records. MambaAttention demonstrated the highest overall
performance (F1-scores: 88% for SAE 1, 97% for SAE 2, and 99% for SAE 3-5),
while TabPFN excelled in zero-shot inference with high robustness for rare
crash categories. In contrast, TabTransformer underperformed, particularly in
detecting Partial Automation crashes (F1-score: 55%), suggesting challenges in
modeling shared human-system control dynamics. These results highlight the
capability of deep learning models tailored for tabular data to enhance the
accuracy and efficiency of automation-level classification. Integrating such
models into crash analysis frameworks can support policy development, AV safety
evaluation, and regulatory decisions, especially in distinguishing high-risk
conditions for mid- and high-level automation technologies.

Abstract: Deep learning-based approaches have demonstrated significant advancements in
time series forecasting. Despite these ongoing developments, the complex
dynamics of time series make it challenging to establish the rule of thumb for
designing the golden model architecture. In this study, we argue that refining
existing advanced models through a universal calibrating strategy can deliver
substantial benefits with minimal resource costs, as opposed to elaborating and
training a new model from scratch. We first identify a multi-target learning
conflict in the calibrating process, which arises when optimizing variables
across time steps, leading to the underutilization of the model's learning
capabilities. To address this issue, we propose an innovative calibrating
strategy called Socket+Plug (SoP). This approach retains an exclusive optimizer
and early-stopping monitor for each predicted target within each Plug while
keeping the fully trained Socket backbone frozen. The model-agnostic nature of
SoP allows it to directly calibrate the performance of any trained deep
forecasting models, regardless of their specific architectures. Extensive
experiments on various time series benchmarks and a spatio-temporal
meteorological ERA5 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of SoP, achieving up
to a 22% improvement even when employing a simple MLP as the Plug (highlighted

mitigating cumulative errors in sequential forecasting. Through comprehensive

Abstract: Modern recommendation systems rely on exploration to learn user preferences
for new items, typically implementing uniform exploration policies (e.g.,
epsilon-greedy) due to their simplicity and compatibility with machine learning
(ML) personalization models. Within these systems, a crucial consideration is
the rate of exploration - what fraction of user traffic should receive random
item recommendations and how this should evolve over time. While various
heuristics exist for navigating the resulting exploration-exploitation
tradeoff, selecting optimal exploration rates is complicated by practical
constraints including batched updates, time-varying user traffic, short time
horizons, and minimum exploration requirements. In this work, we propose a
principled framework for determining the exploration schedule based on directly
minimizing Bayesian regret through stochastic gradient descent (SGD), allowing
for dynamic exploration rate adjustment via Model-Predictive Control (MPC).
Through extensive experiments with recommendation datasets, we demonstrate that
variations in the batch size across periods significantly influence the optimal
exploration strategy. Our optimization methods automatically calibrate
exploration to the specific problem setting, consistently matching or
outperforming the best heuristic for each setting.

Abstract: A combinatorial intervention, consisting of multiple treatments applied to a
single unit with potentially interactive effects, has substantial applications
in fields such as biomedicine, engineering, and beyond. Given $p$ possible
treatments, conducting all possible $2^p$ combinatorial interventions can be
laborious and quickly becomes infeasible as $p$ increases. Here we introduce
probabilistic factorial experimental design, formalized from how scientists
perform lab experiments. In this framework, the experimenter selects a dosage
for each possible treatment and applies it to a group of units. Each unit
independently receives a random combination of treatments, sampled from a
product Bernoulli distribution determined by the dosages. Additionally, the
experimenter can carry out such experiments over multiple rounds, adapting the
design in an active manner. We address the optimal experimental design problem
within an intervention model that imposes bounded-degree interactions between
treatments. In the passive setting, we provide a closed-form solution for the
near-optimal design. Our results prove that a dosage of $\tfrac{1}{2}$ for each
treatment is optimal up to a factor of $1+O(\tfrac{\ln(n)}{n})$ for estimating
any $k$-way interaction model, regardless of $k$, and imply that
$O\big(kp^{3k}\ln(p)\big)$ observations are required to accurately estimate
this model. For the multi-round setting, we provide a near-optimal acquisition
function that can be numerically optimized. We also explore several extensions
of the design problem and finally validate our findings through simulations.

having a broader impact beyond resolving the case itself: for example, creating
precedent which will influence future rulings. In this paper, we explore
strategic litigation from the perspective of machine learning theory. We
consider an abstract model of a common-law legal system where a lower court
decides new cases by applying a decision rule learned from a higher court's
past rulings. In this model, we explore the power of a strategic litigator, who
strategically brings cases to the higher court to influence the learned
decision rule, thereby affecting future cases. We explore questions including:
What impact can a strategic litigator have? Which cases should a strategic
litigator bring to court? Does it ever make sense for a strategic litigator to
bring a case when they are sure the court will rule against them?

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计功能验证中的故障分类耗时且依赖人工，机器学习在此领域的应用有限，VCDiag旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 使用VCD数据，结合信号选择和统计压缩技术，减少数据量并保留分类特征。

Result: 在最大实验中，VCDiag识别前三个最可能故障模块的准确率超过94%，数据压缩率达120倍。

Conclusion: VCDiag是一种高效、可扩展的方法，适用于大型设计的故障分类。

Abstract: Failure triage in design functional verification is critical but
time-intensive, relying on manual specification reviews, log inspections, and
waveform analyses. While machine learning (ML) has improved areas like stimulus
generation and coverage closure, its application to RTL-level simulation
failure triage, particularly for large designs, remains limited. VCDiag offers
an efficient, adaptable approach using VCD data to classify failing waveforms
and pinpoint likely failure locations. In the largest experiment, VCDiag
achieves over 94% accuracy in identifying the top three most likely modules.
The framework introduces a novel signal selection and statistical compression
approach, achieving over 120x reduction in raw data size while preserving
features essential for classification. It can also be integrated into diverse
Verilog/SystemVerilog designs and testbenches.

Conclusion: 该方法提升了PBPM的模块化和可解释性，同时为AI社区贡献了时间预测和数据异构性解决方案。

Abstract: Predictive Business Process Monitoring (PBPM) aims to forecast future
outcomes of ongoing business processes. However, existing methods often lack
flexibility to handle real-world challenges such as simultaneous events, class
imbalance, and multi-level attributes. While prior work has explored static
encoding schemes and fixed LSTM architectures, they struggle to support
adaptive representations and generalize across heterogeneous datasets. To
address these limitations, we propose a suite of dynamic LSTM HyperModels that
integrate two-level hierarchical encoding for event and sequence attributes,
character-based decomposition of event labels, and novel pseudo-embedding
techniques for durations and attribute correlations. We further introduce
specialized LSTM variants for simultaneous event modeling, leveraging
multidimensional embeddings and time-difference flag augmentation. Experimental
validation on four public and real-world datasets demonstrates up to 100%
accuracy on balanced datasets and F1 scores exceeding 86\% on imbalanced ones.
Our approach advances PBPM by offering modular and interpretable models better
suited for deployment in complex settings. Beyond PBPM, it contributes to the
broader AI community by improving temporal outcome prediction, supporting data
heterogeneity, and promoting explainable process intelligence frameworks.

Conclusion: UCB算法在匹配市场中学习均衡是有效的。

Abstract: We investigate the problem of learning an equilibrium in a generalized
two-sided matching market, where agents can adaptively choose their actions
based on their assigned matches. Specifically, we consider a setting in which
matched agents engage in a zero-sum game with initially unknown payoff
matrices, and we explore whether a centralized procedure can learn an
equilibrium from bandit feedback. We adopt the solution concept of matching
equilibrium, where a pair consisting of a matching $\mathfrak{m}$ and a set of
agent strategies $X$ forms an equilibrium if no agent has the incentive to
deviate from $(\mathfrak{m}, X)$. To measure the deviation of a given pair
$(\mathfrak{m}, X)$ from the equilibrium pair $(\mathfrak{m}^\star, X^\star)$,
we introduce matching instability that can serve as a regret measure for the
corresponding learning problem. We then propose a UCB algorithm in which agents
form preferences and select actions based on optimistic estimates of the game
payoffs, and prove that it achieves sublinear, instance-independent regret over
a time horizon $T$.

Abstract: Points-based rewards programs are a prevalent way to incentivize customer
loyalty; in these programs, customers who make repeated purchases from a seller
accumulate points, working toward eventual redemption of a free reward. These
programs have recently come under scrutiny due to accusations of unfair
practices in their implementation. Motivated by these concerns, we study the
problem of fairly designing points-based rewards programs, with a focus on two
obstacles that put fairness at odds with their effectiveness. First, due to
customer heterogeneity, the seller should set different redemption thresholds
for different customers to generate high revenue. Second, the relationship
between customer behavior and the number of accumulated points is typically
unknown; this requires experimentation which may unfairly devalue customers'
previously earned points. We first show that an individually fair rewards
program that uses the same redemption threshold for all customers suffers a
loss in revenue of at most a factor of $1+\ln 2$, compared to the optimal
personalized strategy that differentiates between customers. We then tackle the
problem of designing temporally fair learning algorithms in the presence of
demand uncertainty. Toward this goal, we design a learning algorithm that
limits the risk of point devaluation due to experimentation by only changing
the redemption threshold $O(\log T)$ times, over a horizon of length $T$. This
algorithm achieves the optimal (up to polylogarithmic factors)
$\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret in expectation. We then modify this algorithm
to only ever decrease redemption thresholds, leading to improved fairness at a
cost of only a constant factor in regret. Extensive numerical experiments show
the limited value of personalization in average-case settings, in addition to
demonstrating the strong practical performance of our proposed learning
algorithms.

Abstract: Networks with higher-order interactions, prevalent in biological, social, and
information systems, are naturally represented as hypergraphs, yet their
structural complexity poses fundamental challenges for geometric
characterization. While curvature-based methods offer powerful insights in
graph analysis, existing extensions to hypergraphs suffer from critical
trade-offs: combinatorial approaches such as Forman-Ricci curvature capture
only coarse features, whereas geometric methods like Ollivier-Ricci curvature
offer richer expressivity but demand costly optimal transport computations. To
address these challenges, we introduce hypergraph lower Ricci curvature (HLRC),
a novel curvature metric defined in closed form that achieves a principled
balance between interpretability and efficiency. Evaluated across diverse
synthetic and real-world hypergraph datasets, HLRC consistently reveals
meaningful higher-order organization, distinguishing intra- from
inter-community hyperedges, uncovering latent semantic labels, tracking
temporal dynamics, and supporting robust clustering of hypergraphs based on
global structure. By unifying geometric sensitivity with algorithmic
simplicity, HLRC provides a versatile foundation for hypergraph analytics, with
broad implications for tasks including node classification, anomaly detection,
and generative modeling in complex systems.

Result: 在神经形态数据集上，OSBC实现了97%的稀疏度（剪枝）或4位对称量化，精度损失较低。

Conclusion: OSBC是一种高效且准确的SNN压缩方法，适用于资源受限的硬件。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a new generation of
energy-efficient neural networks suitable for implementation on neuromorphic
hardware. As neuromorphic hardware has limited memory and computing resources,
weight pruning and quantization have recently been explored to improve SNNs'
efficiency. State-of-the-art SNN pruning/quantization methods employ multiple
compression and training iterations, increasing the cost for pre-trained or
very large SNNs. In this paper, we propose a new one-shot post-training
pruning/quantization framework, Optimal Spiking Brain Compression (OSBC), that
adapts the Optimal Brain Compression (OBC) method of [Frantar, Singh, and
Alistarh, 2023] for SNNs. Rather than minimizing the loss on neuron input
current as OBC does, OSBC achieves more efficient and accurate SNN compression
in one pass by minimizing the loss on spiking neuron membrane potential with a
small sample dataset. Our experiments on neuromorphic datasets (N-MNIST,
CIFAR10-DVS, DVS128-Gesture) demonstrate that OSBC can achieve 97% sparsity
through pruning with 1.41%, 10.20%, and 1.74% accuracy loss, or 4-bit symmetric
quantization with 0.17%, 1.54%, and 7.71% accuracy loss, respectively. Code

Result: 小周期下IGD收敛缓慢，非凸函数下表现更差；大周期下给出了紧致的上下界。

Conclusion: IGD在小周期下的收敛性受函数假设影响显著，需进一步研究。

Abstract: Recent theoretical results demonstrate that the convergence rates of
permutation-based SGD (e.g., random reshuffling SGD) are faster than
uniform-sampling SGD; however, these studies focus mainly on the large epoch
regime, where the number of epochs $K$ exceeds the condition number $\kappa$.
In contrast, little is known when $K$ is smaller than $\kappa$, and it is still
a challenging open question whether permutation-based SGD can converge faster
in this small epoch regime (Safran and Shamir, 2021). As a step toward
understanding this gap, we study the naive deterministic variant, Incremental
Gradient Descent (IGD), on smooth and strongly convex functions. Our lower
bounds reveal that for the small epoch regime, IGD can exhibit surprisingly
slow convergence even when all component functions are strongly convex.
Furthermore, when some component functions are allowed to be nonconvex, we
prove that the optimality gap of IGD can be significantly worse throughout the
small epoch regime. Our analyses reveal that the convergence properties of
permutation-based SGD in the small epoch regime may vary drastically depending
on the assumptions on component functions. Lastly, we supplement the paper with
tight upper and lower bounds for IGD in the large epoch regime.

Abstract: Deep generative models have recently been applied to physical systems
governed by partial differential equations (PDEs), offering scalable simulation
and uncertainty-aware inference. However, enforcing physical constraints, such
as conservation laws (linear and nonlinear) and physical consistencies, remains
challenging. Existing methods often rely on soft penalties or architectural
biases that fail to guarantee hard constraints. In this work, we propose
Physics-Constrained Flow Matching (PCFM), a zero-shot inference framework that
enforces arbitrary nonlinear constraints in pretrained flow-based generative
models. PCFM continuously guides the sampling process through physics-based
corrections applied to intermediate solution states, while remaining aligned
with the learned flow and satisfying physical constraints. Empirically, PCFM
outperforms both unconstrained and constrained baselines on a range of PDEs,
including those with shocks, discontinuities, and sharp features, while
ensuring exact constraint satisfaction at the final solution. Our method
provides a general framework for enforcing hard constraints in both scientific
and general-purpose generative models, especially in applications where
constraint satisfaction is essential.

Abstract: Graphons, as limit objects of dense graph sequences, play a central role in
the statistical analysis of network data. However, existing graphon estimation
methods often struggle with scalability to large networks and
resolution-independent approximation, due to their reliance on estimating
latent variables or costly metrics such as the Gromov-Wasserstein distance. In
this work, we propose a novel, scalable graphon estimator that directly
recovers the graphon via moment matching, leveraging implicit neural
representations (INRs). Our approach avoids latent variable modeling by
training an INR--mapping coordinates to graphon values--to match empirical
subgraph counts (i.e., moments) from observed graphs. This direct estimation
mechanism yields a polynomial-time solution and crucially sidesteps the
combinatorial complexity of Gromov-Wasserstein optimization. Building on
foundational results, we establish a theoretical guarantee: when the observed
subgraph motifs sufficiently represent those of the true graphon (a condition
met with sufficiently large or numerous graph samples), the estimated graphon
achieves a provable upper bound in cut distance from the ground truth.
Additionally, we introduce MomentMixup, a data augmentation technique that
performs mixup in the moment space to enhance graphon-based learning. Our
graphon estimation method achieves strong empirical performance--demonstrating
high accuracy on small graphs and superior computational efficiency on large
graphs--outperforming state-of-the-art scalable estimators in 75\% of benchmark
settings and matching them in the remaining cases. Furthermore, MomentMixup
demonstrated improved graph classification accuracy on the majority of our
benchmarks.

Abstract: Stock market indices serve as fundamental market measurement that quantify
systematic market dynamics. However, accurate index price prediction remains
challenging, primarily because existing approaches treat indices as isolated
time series and frame the prediction as a simple regression task. These methods
fail to capture indices' inherent nature as aggregations of constituent stocks
with complex, time-varying interdependencies. To address these limitations, we
propose Cubic, a novel end-to-end framework that explicitly models the adaptive
fusion of constituent stocks for index price prediction. Our main contributions
are threefold. i) Fusion in the latent space: we introduce the fusion mechanism
over the latent embedding of the stocks to extract the information from the
vast number of stocks. ii) Binary encoding classification: since regression
tasks are challenging due to continuous value estimation, we reformulate the
regression into the classification task, where the target value is converted to
binary and we optimize the prediction of the value of each digit with
cross-entropy loss. iii) Confidence-guided prediction and trading: we introduce
the regularization loss to address market prediction uncertainty for the index
prediction and design the rule-based trading policies based on the confidence.
Extensive experiments across multiple stock markets and indices demonstrate
that Cubic consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in stock index
prediction tasks, achieving superior performance on both forecasting accuracy
metrics and downstream trading profitability.

Abstract: Graph-based learning has emerged as a transformative approach for modeling
complex relationships across diverse domains, yet its potential in wireless
security remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce the first
application of graph-based learning for jamming source localization, addressing

optimization techniques that struggle under environmental uncertainties and
dense interference, we reformulate localization as an inductive graph
regression task. Our approach integrates structured node representations that
encode local and global signal aggregation, ensuring spatial coherence and
adaptive signal fusion. To enhance robustness, we incorporate an
attention-based graph neural network that adaptively refines neighborhood
influence and introduces a confidence-guided estimation mechanism that
dynamically balances learned predictions with domain-informed priors. We
evaluate our approach under complex radio frequency environments with varying
sampling densities and signal propagation conditions, conducting comprehensive
ablation studies on graph construction, feature selection, and pooling
strategies. Results demonstrate that our novel graph-based learning framework
significantly outperforms established localization baselines, particularly in

study investigates the effectiveness of Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM),
which leverage quantum mechanical phenomena like superposition and entanglement
to construct high-dimensional Hilbert spaces for data classification. Focusing
on lung cancer diagnosis, a concrete and critical healthcare application, we
analyze how different quantum feature maps influence classification
performance. Using a real-world dataset of 309 patient records with significant
class imbalance (39 non-cancer vs. 270 cancer cases), we constructed six
balanced subsets for robust evaluation. QSVM models were implemented using
Qiskit and executed on the qasm simulator, employing three distinct quantum
feature maps: ZFeatureMap, ZZFeatureMap, and PauliFeatureMap. Performance was
assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1-score. Results
show that the PauliFeatureMap consistently outperformed the others, achieving
perfect classification in three subsets and strong performance overall. These
findings demonstrate how quantum computational principles can be harnessed to
enhance diagnostic capabilities, reinforcing the importance of physics-based
modeling in emerging AI applications within healthcare.

Conclusion: 该方法为最后迭代收敛提供了一种通用的简化途径，适用于多种游戏场景。

Abstract: The convergence of online learning algorithms in games under self-play is a
fundamental question in game theory and machine learning. Among various notions
of convergence, last-iterate convergence is particularly desirable, as it
reflects the actual decisions made by the learners and captures the day-to-day
behavior of the learning dynamics. While many algorithms are known to converge
in the average-iterate, achieving last-iterate convergence typically requires
considerably more effort in both the design and the analysis of the algorithm.
Somewhat surprisingly, we show in this paper that for a large family of games,
there exists a simple black-box reduction that transforms the average iterates
of an uncoupled learning dynamics into the last iterates of a new uncoupled
learning dynamics, thus also providing a reduction from last-iterate
convergence to average-iterate convergence. Our reduction applies to games
where each player's utility is linear in both their own strategy and the joint
strategy of all opponents. This family includes two-player bimatrix games and
generalizations such as multi-player polymatrix games. By applying our
reduction to the Optimistic Multiplicative Weights Update algorithm, we obtain
new state-of-the-art last-iterate convergence rates for uncoupled learning
dynamics in two-player zero-sum normal-form games: (1) an $O(\frac{\log d}{T})$
last-iterate convergence rate under gradient feedback, representing an
exponential improvement in the dependence on the dimension $d$ (i.e., the
maximum number of actions available to either player); and (2) an
$\widetilde{O}(d^{\frac{1}{5}} T^{-\frac{1}{5}})$ last-iterate convergence rate
under bandit feedback, improving upon the previous best rates of
$\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{d} T^{-\frac{1}{8}})$ and $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{d}
T^{-\frac{1}{6}})$.

Abstract: Community detection is a fundamental task in graph analysis, with methods
often relying on fitting models like the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) to
observed networks. While many algorithms can accurately estimate SBM parameters
when the input graph is a perfect sample from the model, real-world graphs
rarely conform to such idealized assumptions. Therefore, robust algorithms are
crucial-ones that can recover model parameters even when the data deviates from
the assumed distribution. In this work, we propose SubSearch, an algorithm for
robustly estimating SBM parameters by exploring the space of subgraphs in
search of one that closely aligns with the model's assumptions. Our approach
also functions as an outlier detection method, properly identifying nodes
responsible for the graph's deviation from the model and going beyond simple
techniques like pruning high-degree nodes. Extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are a promising approach for leveraging
powerful Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers. When applied to
machine learning tasks, VQAs give rise to NISQ-compatible Quantum Neural
Networks (QNNs), which have been shown to outperform classical neural networks
with a similar number of trainable parameters. While the quantum circuit
structures of VQAs for physics simulations are determined by the physical
properties of the systems, identifying effective QNN architectures for general
machine learning tasks is a difficult challenge due to the lack of
domain-specific priors. Indeed, existing Quantum Architecture Search (QAS)
algorithms, adaptations of classical neural architecture search techniques,
often overlook the inherent quantum nature of the circuits they produce. By
approaching QAS from the ground-up and from a quantum perspective, we resolve
this limitation by proposing $\rho$DARTS, a differentiable QAS algorithm that
models the search process as the evolution of a quantum mixed state, emerging
from the search space of quantum architectures. We validate our method by
finding circuits for state initialization, Hamiltonian optimization, and image
classification. Further, we demonstrate better convergence against existing QAS
techniques and show improved robustness levels to noise.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have shown promising results for
financial prediction using large, over-parameterized models. This paper
provides theoretical foundations and empirical validation for understanding
when and how these methods achieve predictive success. I examine three key
aspects of high-dimensional learning in finance. First, I prove that
within-sample standardization in Random Fourier Features implementations
fundamentally alters the underlying Gaussian kernel approximation, replacing
shift-invariant kernels with training-set dependent alternatives. Second, I
derive sample complexity bounds showing when reliable learning becomes
information-theoretically impossible under weak signal-to-noise ratios typical
in finance. Third, VC-dimension analysis reveals that ridgeless regression's
effective complexity is bounded by sample size rather than nominal feature
dimension. Comprehensive numerical validation confirms these theoretical
predictions, revealing systematic breakdown of claimed theoretical properties
across realistic parameter ranges. These results show that when sample size is
small and features are high-dimensional, observed predictive success is
necessarily driven by low-complexity artifacts, not genuine high-dimensional
learning.

Abstract: Score-based generative models (SGMs) have emerged as one of the most popular
classes of generative models. A substantial body of work now exists on the
analysis of SGMs, focusing either on discretization aspects or on their
statistical performance. In the latter case, bounds have been derived, under
various metrics, between the true data distribution and the distribution
induced by the SGM, often demonstrating polynomial convergence rates with
respect to the number of training samples. However, these approaches adopt a
largely approximation theory viewpoint, which tends to be overly pessimistic
and relatively coarse. In particular, they fail to fully explain the empirical
success of SGMs or capture the role of the optimization algorithm used in
practice to train the score network. To support this observation, we first
present simple experiments illustrating the concrete impact of optimization
hyperparameters on the generalization ability of the generated distribution.
Then, this paper aims to bridge this theoretical gap by providing the first
algorithmic- and data-dependent generalization analysis for SGMs. In
particular, we establish bounds that explicitly account for the optimization
dynamics of the learning algorithm, offering new insights into the
generalization behavior of SGMs. Our theoretical findings are supported by
empirical results on several datasets.

Abstract: We present a generic Branch-and-Bound procedure designed to solve

quadratic losses and construct relaxations using "Big-M" constraints and/or
L2-norm penalties. In contrast, our method accommodates a broader class of loss
functions and allows greater flexibility in relaxation design through a general
penalty term, encompassing existing techniques as special cases. We establish
theoretical results ensuring that all key quantities required for the
Branch-and-Bound implementation admit closed-form expressions under the general
blanket assumptions considered in our work. Leveraging this framework, we
introduce El0ps, an open-source Python solver with a plug-and-play workflow
that enables user-defined losses and penalties in L0-penalized problems.
Through extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate that El0ps achieves
state-of-the-art performance on classical instances and extends computational

online updates. We derive theoretical lower and upper bounds on the detection
delay required to identify structural changes, explicitly quantifying their
dependence on network size, noise variance, and fading severity. Monte Carlo
simulations validate these theoretical results, demonstrating linear increases
in detection delay with network size, quadratic growth with noise variance, and
inverse-square dependence on the magnitude of structural changes. Our findings
provide rigorous theoretical insights and practical guidelines for designing
robust online causal inference mechanisms to maintain network reliability under
nonstationary wireless conditions.

Abstract: The use of machine learning (ML) techniques has allowed rapid advancements in
many scientific and engineering fields. One of these problems is that of
surface soil taxonomy, a research area previously hindered by the reliance on
human-derived classifications, which are mostly dependent on dividing a dataset
based on historical understandings of that data rather than data-driven,
statistically observable similarities. Using a ML-based taxonomy allows soil
researchers to move beyond the limitations of human visualization and create
classifications of high-dimension datasets with a much higher level of
specificity than possible with hand-drawn taxonomies. Furthermore, this
pipeline allows for the possibility of producing both highly accurate and
flexible soil taxonomies with classes built to fit a specific application. The
machine learning pipeline outlined in this work combines product quantization
with the systematic evaluation of parameters and output to get the best
available results, rather than accepting sub-optimal results by using either
default settings or best guess settings.

Abstract: In semiconductor manufacturing, testing costs remain significantly high,
especially during wafer and FPGA testing. To reduce the number of required
tests while maintaining predictive accuracy, this study investigates three
baseline sampling strategies: Random Sampling, Stratified Sampling, and k-means
Clustering Sampling. To further enhance these methods, this study proposes a
novel algorithm that improves the sampling quality of each approach. This
research is conducted using real industrial production data from wafer-level
tests and silicon measurements from various FPGAs. This study introduces two
hybrid strategies: Stratified with Short Distance Elimination (S-SDE) and
k-means with Short Distance Elimination (K-SDE). Their performance is evaluated
within the framework of Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) for predicting wafer
and FPGA test data. At the core of our proposed approach is the Short Distance
Elimination (SDE) algorithm, which excludes spatially proximate candidate
points during sampling, thereby ensuring a more uniform distribution of
training data across the physical domain. A parameter sweep was conducted over
the (alpha, beta) thresholds, where alpha and beta are in the range {0, 1, 2,
3, 4} and not both zero, to identify the optimal combination that minimizes
RMSD. Experimental results on a randomly selected wafer file reveal that
(alpha, beta) equal (2, 2) yields the lowest RMSD. Accordingly, all subsequent
experiments adopt this parameter configuration. The results demonstrate that
the proposed SDE-based strategies enhance predictive accuracy: K-SDE improves
upon k-means sampling by 16.26 percent (wafer) and 13.07 percent (FPGA), while
S-SDE improves upon stratified sampling by 16.49 percent (wafer) and 8.84
percent (FPGA).

Abstract: As the number of mobile devices continues to grow, interference has become a
major bottleneck in improving data rates in wireless networks. Efficient joint
channel and power allocation (JCPA) is crucial for managing interference. In
this paper, we first propose an enhanced WMMSE (eWMMSE) algorithm to solve the
JCPA problem in multi-channel wireless networks. To reduce the computational
complexity of iterative optimization, we further introduce JCPGNN-M, a graph
neural network-based solution that enables simultaneous multi-channel
allocation for each user. We reformulate the problem as a Lagrangian function,
which allows us to enforce the total power constraints systematically. Our
solution involves combining this Lagrangian framework with GNNs and iteratively
updating the Lagrange multipliers and resource allocation scheme. Unlike
existing GNN-based methods that limit each user to a single channel, JCPGNN-M
supports efficient spectrum reuse and scales well in dense network scenarios.
Simulation results show that JCPGNN-M achieves better data rate compared to
eWMMSE. Meanwhile, the inference time of JCPGNN-M is much lower than eWMMS, and
it can generalize well to larger networks.

performance of Taguchi method against an active learning based Gaussian process
regression (GPR) model in a wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) process to
accurately predict aspects of bead geometry, including penetration depth, bead
width, and height. While Taguchi method utilized a three-factor, five-level L25
orthogonal array to suggest weld parameters, the GPR model used an
uncertainty-based exploration acquisition function coupled with latin hypercube
sampling for initial training data. Accuracy and efficiency of both models was
evaluated on 15 test cases, with GPR outperforming Taguchi in both metrics.

Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are essential for understanding the
atomic-level behavior of molecular systems, giving insights into their
transitions and interactions. However, classical MD techniques are limited by
the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, while recent deep learning-based
improvements have mostly focused on single-domain molecules, lacking
transferability to unfamiliar molecular systems. Therefore, we propose
\textbf{Uni}fied \textbf{Sim}ulator (UniSim), which leverages cross-domain
knowledge to enhance the understanding of atomic interactions. First, we employ
a multi-head pretraining approach to learn a unified atomic representation
model from a large and diverse set of molecular data. Then, based on the
stochastic interpolant framework, we learn the state transition patterns over
long timesteps from MD trajectories, and introduce a force guidance module for
rapidly adapting to different chemical environments. Our experiments
demonstrate that UniSim achieves highly competitive performance across small
molecules, peptides, and proteins.

Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for deriving the general $n$-th order
Fr\'echet derivatives of singular values in real rectangular matrices, by
leveraging reduced resolvent operators from Kato's analytic perturbation theory
for self-adjoint operators. Deriving closed-form expressions for higher-order
derivatives of singular values is notoriously challenging through standard
matrix-analysis techniques. To overcome this, we treat a real rectangular
matrix as a compact operator on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, and embed
the rectangular matrix into a block self-adjoint operator so that non-symmetric
perturbations are captured. Applying Kato's asymptotic eigenvalue expansion to
this construction, we obtain a general, closed-form expression for the
infinitesimal $n$-th order spectral variations. Specializing to $n=2$ and
deploying on a Kronecker-product representation with matrix convention yield
the Hessian of a singular value, not found in literature. By bridging abstract
operator-theoretic perturbation theory with matrices, our framework equips
researchers with a practical toolkit for higher-order spectral sensitivity
studies in random matrix applications (e.g., adversarial perturbation in deep
learning).

Abstract: Quantum kernels are reproducing kernel functions built using
quantum-mechanical principles and are studied with the aim of outperforming
their classical counterparts. The enthusiasm for quantum kernel machines has
been tempered by recent studies that have suggested that quantum kernels could
not offer speed-ups when learning on classical data. However, most of the
research in this area has been devoted to scalar-valued kernels in standard
classification or regression settings for which classical kernel methods are
efficient and effective, leaving very little room for improvement with quantum
kernels. This position paper argues that quantum kernel research should focus
on more expressive kernel classes. We build upon recent advances in
operator-valued kernels, and propose guidelines for investigating quantum
kernels. This should help to design a new generation of quantum kernel machines

Abstract: The accurate prediction of chromosomal instability from the morphology of
circulating tumor cells (CTCs) enables real-time detection of CTCs with high
metastatic potential in the context of liquid biopsy diagnostics. However, it

of single-cell digital pathology data. Here, we introduce the application of
Quantum Cognition Machine Learning (QCML), a quantum-inspired computational
framework, to estimate morphology-predicted chromosomal instability in CTCs
from patients with metastatic breast cancer. QCML leverages quantum mechanical
principles to represent data as state vectors in a Hilbert space, enabling
context-aware feature modeling, dimensionality reduction, and enhanced
generalization without requiring curated feature selection. QCML outperforms
conventional machine learning methods when tested on out of sample verification
CTCs, achieving higher accuracy in identifying predicted large-scale state
transitions (pLST) status from CTC-derived morphology features. These
preliminary findings support the application of QCML as a novel machine
learning tool with superior performance in high-dimensional, low-sample-size
biomedical contexts. QCML enables the simulation of cognition-like learning for

Abstract: Geoff is a collection of Python packages that form a framework for automation
of particle accelerator controls. With particle accelerator laboratories around
the world researching machine learning techniques to improve accelerator
performance and uptime, a multitude of approaches and algorithms have emerged.
The purpose of Geoff is to harmonize these approaches and to minimize friction
when comparing or migrating between them. It provides standardized interfaces
for optimization problems, utility functions to speed up development, and a
reference GUI application that ties everything together. Geoff is an
open-source library developed at CERN and maintained and updated in
collaboration between CERN and GSI as part of the EURO-LABS project. This paper
gives an overview over Geoff's design, features, and current usage.

Motivation: 传统水文建模通常局限于集中流域，而该研究希望通过提供空间分辨率数据，推动神经网络在更广泛流域中的应用。

Method: 研究编译了覆盖欧洲中部五个河流流域（多瑙河上游、易北河、奥得河、莱茵河和威悉河）的数据集，包括气象强迫、土壤、岩石、土地覆盖和地形信息，数据统一到9km×9km网格，时间跨度为1981年10月至2011年9月。

Result: 提供了完整的数据集和代码，支持与其他公开河流流量数据的结合，实现端到端的降雨径流建模。

Conclusion: 该数据集为神经网络驱动的水文建模提供了新的可能性，尤其是在空间分辨率方面。

Abstract: We present a dataset for rainfall streamflow modeling that is fully spatially
resolved with the aim of taking neural network-driven hydrological modeling
beyond lumped catchments. To this end, we compiled data covering five river
basins in central Europe: upper Danube, Elbe, Oder, Rhine, and Weser. The
dataset contains meteorological forcings, as well as ancillary information on
soil, rock, land cover, and orography. The data is harmonized to a regular 9km
times 9km grid and contains daily values that span from October 1981 to
September 2011. We also provide code to further combine our dataset with
publicly available river discharge data for end-to-end rainfall streamflow
modeling.
