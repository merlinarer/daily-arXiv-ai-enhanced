### [1] [Toward Purpose-oriented Topic Model Evaluation enabled by Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07142)
*Zhiyin Tan,Jennifer D'Souza*

Main category: cs.CL

Relevance: 85.0

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于大语言模型的动态主题模型自动评估框架，包含9个LLM评估指标，覆盖词汇有效性、主题内语义一致性、主题间结构一致性和文档-主题对齐四个维度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主题模型评估指标（如连贯性和多样性）只能捕捉狭窄的统计模式，无法解释语义层面的失败，需要更智能、可解释的评估方法

Method: 开发了基于LLM的评估框架，包含9个指标，通过对抗性和采样验证协议，在新闻文章、学术出版物和社交媒体数据上测试多种主题建模方法和开源LLM

Result: LLM评估指标提供了可解释、鲁棒且任务相关的评估，能够发现传统指标遗漏的关键弱点，如冗余和语义漂移

Conclusion: 支持开发可扩展的细粒度评估工具，用于维护动态数据集中的主题相关性

Abstract: This study presents a framework for automated evaluation of dynamically
evolving topic models using Large Language Models (LLMs). Topic modeling is
essential for organizing and retrieving scholarly content in digital library
systems, helping users navigate complex and evolving knowledge domains.
However, widely used automated metrics, such as coherence and diversity, often
capture only narrow statistical patterns and fail to explain semantic failures
in practice. We introduce a purpose-oriented evaluation framework that employs
nine LLM-based metrics spanning four key dimensions of topic quality: lexical
validity, intra-topic semantic soundness, inter-topic structural soundness, and
document-topic alignment soundness. The framework is validated through
adversarial and sampling-based protocols, and is applied across datasets
spanning news articles, scholarly publications, and social media posts, as well
as multiple topic modeling methods and open-source LLMs. Our analysis shows
that LLM-based metrics provide interpretable, robust, and task-relevant
assessments, uncovering critical weaknesses in topic models such as redundancy
and semantic drift, which are often missed by traditional metrics. These
results support the development of scalable, fine-grained evaluation tools for
maintaining topic relevance in dynamic datasets. All code and data supporting

### [2] [Rule-Based Moral Principles for Explaining Uncertainty in Natural Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07190)
*Zahra Atf,Peter R Lewis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了基于规则道德原则的框架来处理LLM生成文本中的不确定性，使用Prolog引擎编码道德规则，通过场景模拟评估规则覆盖度、公平性和信任校准


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在关键决策场景中应用日益广泛，但概率方法往往不透明且与透明度期望不符，需要更透明的不确定性处理方法

Method: 基于道德心理学和美德伦理学定义预防、尊重、责任等道德规则，在轻量级Prolog引擎中编码不确定性级别（低、中、高）触发相应系统动作并提供自然语言解释

Result: 通过临床和法律领域的用例场景模拟，展示了道德推理如何提高信任度和可解释性，为社会责任性自然语言生成提供透明轻量级方案

Conclusion: 该框架为概率模型提供了透明、轻量级的替代方案，能够改善LLM在不确定性情况下的可信度和可解释性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in high-stakes settings,
where explaining uncertainty is both technical and ethical. Probabilistic
methods are often opaque and misaligned with expectations of transparency. We
propose a framework based on rule-based moral principles for handling
uncertainty in LLM-generated text. Using insights from moral psychology and
virtue ethics, we define rules such as precaution, deference, and
responsibility to guide responses under epistemic or aleatoric uncertainty.
These rules are encoded in a lightweight Prolog engine, where uncertainty
levels (low, medium, high) trigger aligned system actions with plain-language
rationales. Scenario-based simulations benchmark rule coverage, fairness, and
trust calibration. Use cases in clinical and legal domains illustrate how moral
reasoning can improve trust and interpretability. Our approach offers a
transparent, lightweight alternative to probabilistic models for socially
responsible natural language generation.

### [3] [Causal Attention with Lookahead Keys](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07301)
*Zhuoqing Song,Peng Sun,Huizhuo Yuan,Quanquan Gu*

Main category: cs.CL

Relevance: 85.0

TL;DR: CASTLE是一种新的因果注意力机制，通过动态更新每个token的key来整合后续上下文信息，同时保持自回归特性，在语言建模基准上表现优于标准因果注意力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准因果注意力中每个token的QKV是静态的，只编码前文信息，限制了模型利用完整上下文的能力。CASTLE旨在让早期位置的token能够整合后续信息，提升语言建模性能

Method: 提出CASTLE注意力机制，持续更新每个token的key（称为lookahead keys），通过数学等价性实现并行训练，避免显式存储每个位置的lookahead keys

Result: 在语言建模基准测试中，CASTLE在不同模型规模下均优于标准因果注意力，降低了验证困惑度，并在多个下游任务上表现更好

Conclusion: CASTLE通过动态更新key来整合后续上下文信息，是一种有效的注意力机制改进，能够提升语言模型性能

Abstract: In standard causal attention, each token's query, key, and value (QKV) are
static and encode only preceding context. We introduce CAuSal aTtention with
Lookahead kEys (CASTLE), an attention mechanism that continually updates each
token's keys as the context unfolds. We term these updated keys lookahead keys
because they belong to earlier positions yet integrate information from tokens
that appear later relative to those positions, while strictly preserving the
autoregressive property. Although the mechanism appears sequential, we derive a
mathematical equivalence that avoids explicitly materializing lookahead keys at
each position and enables efficient parallel training. On language modeling
benchmarks, CASTLE consistently outperforms standard causal attention across
model scales, reducing validation perplexity and improving performance on a
range of downstream tasks.

Relevance: 85.0

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于长文本生成任务实例级性能预测的新基准，支持多维度细粒度质量指标，仅需黑盒模型输入输出即可预测连续评估分数，并包含不确定性量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长文本生成任务需要多维度细粒度评估，但人工评估成本高昂。需要开发能够预测模型性能的方法，仅基于黑盒输入输出就能准确预测各种评估指标的分数。

Method: 任务、模型和指标无关的框架，仅使用黑盒模型的输入和输出预测连续评估指标分数。除了点估计外，还需要推断预测区间来量化不确定性。在11个长文本数据集/任务上进行评估，每个任务使用多个LLM、基线和指标。

Result: 研究表明，仅需16个训练样本就能有效预测长文本生成任务的分数。基准测试显示该方法在不同任务和模型上都具有良好的预测性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作引入了一个新颖且实用的任务，提供了一个有价值的基准来推动进展，并提供了可立即实际采用的基线方法。

Abstract: We motivate and share a new benchmark for instance-level performance
prediction of long-form generation tasks having multi-faceted, fine-grained
quality metrics. Our task-, model- and metric-agnostic formulation predicts
continuous evaluation metric scores given only black-box model inputs and
outputs. Beyond predicting point estimates of metric scores, the benchmark also
requires inferring prediction intervals to quantify uncertainty around point
estimates. Evaluation spans 11 long-form datasets/tasks with multiple LLMs,
baselines, and metrics per task. We show that scores can be effectively
predicted across long-form generation tasks using as few as 16 training
examples. Overall, we introduce a novel and useful task, a valuable benchmark
to drive progress, and baselines ready for practical adoption today.

TL;DR: KAMIR：基于模型内部表示的知识分析方法，通过分析隐藏状态相似度来选择SFT训练数据，无需提示工程即可评估模型对输入的熟悉程度，在多种任务上证明选择不熟悉数据能提升泛化性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SFT训练数据选择缺乏明确方法的问题，现有基于知识的选择方法依赖提示工程且成本高，需要更高效可靠的数据选择方法

Method: KAMIR方法通过计算每层隐藏状态与最终隐藏状态的相似度来评估数据，基于模型对输入的熟悉程度选择训练数据，使用简单分类器架构

Result: 实验表明，使用KAMIR选择的不熟悉数据进行训练能获得更好的泛化性能，方法适用于机器阅读理解、摘要生成等多种任务

Conclusion: KAMIR提供了一种有效的数据选择方法，通过模型内部表示分析实现高效数据筛选，为SFT训练数据选择提供了新思路

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have been driven by
pretraining, supervised fine tuning (SFT), and alignment tuning. Among these,
SFT plays a crucial role in transforming a model 's general knowledge into
structured responses tailored to specific tasks. However, there is no clearly
established methodology for effective training data selection. Simply
increasing the volume of data does not guarantee performance improvements,
while preprocessing, sampling, and validation require substantial time and
cost.
  To address this issue, a variety of data selection methods have been
proposed. Among them, knowledge based selection approaches identify suitable
training data by analyzing the model 's responses. Nevertheless, these methods
typically rely on prompt engineering, making them sensitive to variations and
incurring additional costs for prompt design.
  In this study, we propose Knowledge Analysis via Model Internal
Representations (KAMIR), a novel approach that overcomes these limitations by
analyzing data based on the model 's internal representations. KAMIR computes
similarities between the hidden states of each layer (block) and the final
hidden states for a given input to assess the data. Unlike prior methods that
were largely limited to multiple choice tasks, KAMIR can be applied to a wide
range of tasks such as machine reading comprehension and summarization.
Moreover, it selects data useful for training based on the model 's familiarity
with the input, even with a small dataset and a simple classifier architecture.
Experiments across diverse task datasets demonstrate that training with less
familiar data leads to better generalization performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer自注意力机制中的局部化问题，即注意力集中在有限token子集而无法捕获长距离依赖关系。

Method: 提出Self-Attention One-step Belief Propagation (SAOBP)框架，通过信念传播过程注入多跳关系；引入Global Token Dependency (GTD)指标来量化和解释多跳连接在注意力图中的相对贡献。

Result: SAOBP有助于防止深层网络中的熵崩溃，自适应地将GTD维持在任务适当水平，从而支持模型性能提升；在小型模型中观察到有竞争力的增益，显示出在资源受限场景中改善推理质量的潜力。

Conclusion: SAOBP框架有效解决了自注意力的局部化问题，通过多跳关系注入和GTD量化，提升了模型的长距离依赖捕获能力和整体性能，特别适合资源受限环境。

Abstract: Transformer-based self-attention mechanism serves as the core of modern
language models, yet it often suffers from localization, where attentions
collapse onto a limited subset of tokens and fail to capture long-range
dependencies. To address this issue, we propose Self-Attention One-step Belief
Propagation (SAOBP), a refinement framework that injects multi-hop
relationships through a belief propagation process. To interpret and quantify
these interactions, we introduce Global Token Dependency (GTD) that captures
the relative contribution of multihop connections within the attention graph.
Empirical results indicate that SAOBP helps prevent entropy collapse in deeper
layers and adaptively maintains GTD at task-appropriate levels, thereby
supporting improvements in model performance. Importantly, we observe
competitive gains in small-scale models, highlighting its potential for
improving inference quality in resource-constrained scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在现实对话中表现出情感感知和社交能力方面的局限性，无法根据不同社交和任务情境调整沟通风格和情感表达。

Method: 基于特质激活理论和Big Five人格模型，采用混合专家架构，结合个性适配器和动态路由网络，实现情境化特质表达。

Result: 在多维度社交情感智能评估中显著优于基线模型，在下游人本应用（如心理健康咨询和客户服务）中表现一致提升，人类偏好评估显示与大型LLM竞争性响应质量。

Conclusion: PersonaFuse提供了一个理论基础扎实且实用的方法，用于开发社交情感增强的LLM，是迈向更人本AI系统的重要进展。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities across various fields. These developments have led to more direct
communication between humans and LLMs in various situations, such as social
companionship and psychological support. However, LLMs often exhibit
limitations in emotional perception and social competence during real-world
conversations. These limitations partly originate from their inability to adapt
their communication style and emotional expression to different social and task
contexts. In this work, we introduce PersonaFuse, a novel LLM post-training
framework that enables LLMs to adapt and express different personalities for
varying situations. Inspired by Trait Activation Theory and the Big Five
personality model, PersonaFuse employs a Mixture-of-Expert architecture that
combines persona adapters with a dynamic routing network, enabling contextual
trait expression. Experimental results show that PersonaFuse substantially
outperforms baseline models across multiple dimensions of social-emotional
intelligence. Importantly, these gains are achieved without sacrificing general
reasoning ability or model safety, which remain common limitations of direct
prompting and supervised fine-tuning approaches. PersonaFuse also delivers
consistent improvements in downstream human-centered applications, such as
mental health counseling and review-based customer service. Finally, human
preference evaluations against leading LLMs, including GPT-4o and DeepSeek,
demonstrate that PersonaFuse achieves competitive response quality despite its
comparatively smaller model size. These findings demonstrate that
PersonaFuse~offers a theoretically grounded and practical approach for
developing social-emotional enhanced LLMs, marking a significant advancement
toward more human-centric AI systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要评估LLM的语言能力（词汇学习、语法归纳等），但缺乏对通过交互反馈学习新语言能力的评估，这是人类语言习得的核心特征。

Method: 构建了一个实验框架，让LLM代理与只懂新构造语言Tinkatongue的机器人进行对话，评估其学习和使用新语言的能力。

Result: LLM代理在100次响应内无法成功建立对话，但表现出类似人类语言学习的策略模式。

Conclusion: 结果为评估基准提供了新方向，并为设计能更有效从交互反馈中学习的模型开辟了途径。

Abstract: Existing evaluation studies on linguistic competence of large language models
(LLM agents) have focused primarily on vocabulary learning, morphological rule
induction, syntactic generalization, pragmatic inference, and cross-linguistic
transfer. However, none assess whether LLM agents can acquire a language
through pattern recognition and interactive feedback, a central feature of
human language acquisition. We propose a novel experimental framework in which
an LLM agent is evaluated on its ability to acquire and use a newly constructed
language (Tinkatongue) in conversation with a bot that understands only
Tinkatongue. Our findings show that LLM agents fail to establish a conversation
within 100 responses, yet they adopt distinct strategies that mirror human
approaches to language learning. The results suggest a new direction for
evaluation benchmarks and open pathways to model designs that learn more
effectively from interactive feedback.

Result: 实验结果表明，RAG和CoEM方法在大多数长上下文任务中持续提升了情感智能相关性能，推动了LLM向更实用和真实世界的情感智能应用发展。

Conclusion: LongEmotion基准填补了长上下文情感智能评估的空白，提出的RAG和CoEM方法有效提升了LLM在现实长上下文场景中的情感理解能力，为实际应用提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) make significant progress in Emotional
Intelligence (EI) and long-context understanding. However, existing benchmarks
tend to overlook certain aspects of EI in long-context scenarios, especially
under realistic, practical settings where interactions are lengthy, diverse,
and often noisy. To move towards such realistic settings, we present
LongEmotion, a benchmark specifically designed for long-context EI tasks. It
covers a diverse set of tasks, including Emotion Classification, Emotion
Detection, Emotion QA, Emotion Conversation, Emotion Summary, and Emotion
Expression. On average, the input length for these tasks reaches 8,777 tokens,
with long-form generation required for Emotion Expression. To enhance
performance under realistic constraints, we incorporate Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) and Collaborative Emotional Modeling (CoEM), and compare them
with standard prompt-based methods. Unlike conventional approaches, our RAG
method leverages both the conversation context and the large language model
itself as retrieval sources, avoiding reliance on external knowledge bases. The
CoEM method further improves performance by decomposing the task into five
stages, integrating both retrieval augmentation and limited knowledge
injection. Experimental results show that both RAG and CoEM consistently
enhance EI-related performance across most long-context tasks, advancing LLMs
toward more practical and real-world EI applications. Furthermore, we conducted
a comparative case study experiment on the GPT series to demonstrate the
differences among various models in terms of EI. Code is available on GitHub at

Abstract: Detecting content that contradicts or is unsupported by a given source text

We introduce HALT-RAG, a post-hoc verification system designed to identify
hallucinations in the outputs of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipelines. Our flexible and task-adaptable framework uses a universal feature
set derived from an ensemble of two frozen, off-the-shelf Natural Language
Inference (NLI) models and lightweight lexical signals. These features are used
to train a simple, calibrated, and task-adapted meta-classifier. Using a
rigorous 5-fold out-of-fold (OOF) training protocol to prevent data leakage and
produce unbiased estimates, we evaluate our system on the HaluEval benchmark.
By pairing our universal feature set with a lightweight, task-adapted
classifier and a precision-constrained decision policy, HALT-RAG achieves
strong OOF F1-scores of 0.7756, 0.9786, and 0.7391 on the summarization, QA,

enable a practical abstention mechanism, providing a reliable tool for

Method: 提出迭代检索增强知识编辑方法(IRAKE)，通过单编辑事实和完整编辑案例的引导进行问题分解，采用迭代检索策略解决粒度不匹配问题

Result: 实验结果表明IRAKE有效缓解了编辑跳过导致的编辑失败，在多跳问答知识编辑任务上优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: IRAKE通过引导分解和迭代检索解决了多跳问答中的知识编辑挑战，为大规模语言模型的知识更新提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: In a rapidly evolving world where information updates swiftly, knowledge in
large language models (LLMs) becomes outdated quickly. Retraining LLMs is not a
cost-effective option, making knowledge editing (KE) without modifying
parameters particularly necessary. We find that although existing
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based KE methods excel at editing simple
knowledge, they struggle with KE in multi-hop question answering due to the
issue of "edit skipping", which refers to skipping the relevant edited fact in
inference. In addition to the diversity of natural language expressions of
knowledge, edit skipping also arises from the mismatch between the granularity
of LLMs in problem-solving and the facts in the edited memory. To address this
issue, we propose a novel Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Knowledge Editing
method with guided decomposition (IRAKE) through the guidance from single
edited facts and entire edited cases. Experimental results demonstrate that
IRAKE mitigates the failure of editing caused by edit skipping and outperforms
state-of-the-art methods for KE in multi-hop question answering.

Motivation: 传统方法将文档转为文本处理会丢失多模态信息（如图表），而大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）受限于输入长度无法处理多页文档。现有的检索增强生成（RAG）方法仅依赖语义相关性，忽略了页面间的逻辑连接关系。

Conclusion: MoLoRAG通过结合语义和逻辑相关性检索，有效解决了多模态多页文档理解中的关键限制，显著提升了文档问答性能。

Abstract: Document Understanding is a foundational AI capability with broad
applications, and Document Question Answering (DocQA) is a key evaluation task.
Traditional methods convert the document into text for processing by Large
Language Models (LLMs), but this process strips away critical multi-modal
information like figures. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) address
this limitation, their constrained input size makes multi-page document
comprehension infeasible. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods mitigate
this by selecting relevant pages, but they rely solely on semantic relevance,
ignoring logical connections between pages and the query, which is essential
for reasoning.
  To this end, we propose MoLoRAG, a logic-aware retrieval framework for
multi-modal, multi-page document understanding. By constructing a page graph
that captures contextual relationships between pages, a lightweight VLM
performs graph traversal to retrieve relevant pages, including those with
logical connections often overlooked. This approach combines semantic and
logical relevance to deliver more accurate retrieval. After retrieval, the
top-$K$ pages are fed into arbitrary LVLMs for question answering. To enhance
flexibility, MoLoRAG offers two variants: a training-free solution for easy
deployment and a fine-tuned version to improve logical relevance checking.
Experiments on four DocQA datasets demonstrate average improvements of 9.68% in
accuracy over LVLM direct inference and 7.44% in retrieval precision over
baselines. Codes and datasets are released at

Method: 提出了一个专门针对医学领域的评估流程，结合使用GPT-Judger和人工验证，引入了事实性加权分数(FWS)进行综合评估

Result: 现有水印方法在医学领域导致事实性显著降低，熵性偏移影响医学实体表达

Conclusion: 需要发展领域知识相关的水印方法，以保持医学内容的完整性

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) adapted to sensitive domains such as
medicine, their fluency raises safety risks, particularly regarding provenance
and accountability. Watermarking embeds detectable patterns to mitigate these
risks, yet its reliability in medical contexts remains untested. Existing
benchmarks focus on detection-quality tradeoffs, overlooking factual risks
under low-entropy settings often exploited by watermarking's reweighting
strategy. We propose a medical-focused evaluation workflow that jointly
assesses factual accuracy and coherence. Using GPT-Judger and further human
validation, we introduce the Factuality-Weighted Score (FWS), a composite
metric prioritizing factual accuracy beyond coherence to guide watermarking
deployment in medical domains. Our evaluation shows current watermarking
methods substantially compromise medical factuality, with entropy shifts
degrading medical entity representation. These findings underscore the need for
domain-aware watermarking approaches that preserve the integrity of medical
content.

Motivation: 研究LLM输出不稳定性的来源，特别是提示词脆弱性是否是人类标注中已存在的现象，还是LLM特有的问题。

Method: 通过文本分类任务，对LLM和人类标注者使用相同的指令修改，系统比较两者对提示词变化的敏感性。

Result: 人类和LLM都对标签集和标签格式的变化表现出脆弱性，但人类对拼写错误和标签顺序反转的敏感性低于LLM。

Conclusion: 提示词脆弱性部分反映了人类标注的方差，不应完全视为LLM特有的问题，但LLM在某些类型的提示修改上表现出更强的敏感性。

Abstract: The output of large language models (LLM) is unstable, due to both
non-determinism of the decoding process as well as to prompt brittleness. While
the intrinsic non-determinism of LLM generation may mimic existing uncertainty
in human annotations through distributional shifts in outputs, it is largely
assumed, yet unexplored, that the prompt brittleness effect is unique to LLMs.
This raises the question: do human annotators show similar sensitivity to
instruction changes? If so, should prompt brittleness in LLMs be considered
problematic? One may alternatively hypothesize that prompt brittleness
correctly reflects human annotation variances. To fill this research gap, we
systematically compare the effects of prompt modifications on LLMs and
identical instruction modifications for human annotators, focusing on the
question of whether humans are similarly sensitive to prompt perturbations. To
study this, we prompt both humans and LLMs for a set of text classification
tasks conditioned on prompt variations. Our findings indicate that both humans
and LLMs exhibit increased brittleness in response to specific types of prompt
modifications, particularly those involving the substitution of alternative
label sets or label formats. However, the distribution of human judgments is
less affected by typographical errors and reversed label order than that of
LLMs.

Motivation: 现有不确定性估计方法忽视语义依赖关系，仅依赖词级概率度量，无法捕捉生成文本中的结构关系，限制了在高风险应用中的可靠性

Method: 提出GENUINE框架，利用依赖解析树构建图结构，采用层次图池化技术，结合监督学习来建模语义和结构关系

Result: 在多个NLP任务上，GENUINE相比基于语义熵的方法AUROC提升高达29%，校准误差降低超过15%

Conclusion: 基于图结构的不确定性建模能有效提升LLM的置信度评估，证明了结构感知方法在不确定性估计中的有效性

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is essential for enhancing the reliability of Large
Language Models (LLMs), particularly in high-stakes applications. Existing
methods often overlook semantic dependencies, relying on token-level
probability measures that fail to capture structural relationships within the
generated text. We propose GENUINE: Graph ENhanced mUlti-level uncertaINty
Estimation for Large Language Models, a structure-aware framework that
leverages dependency parse trees and hierarchical graph pooling to refine
uncertainty quantification. By incorporating supervised learning, GENUINE
effectively models semantic and structural relationships, improving confidence
assessments. Extensive experiments across NLP tasks show that GENUINE achieves
up to 29% higher AUROC than semantic entropy-based approaches and reduces
calibration errors by over 15%, demonstrating the effectiveness of graph-based
uncertainty modeling. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖监督微调合成数据，鼓励教师强制模仿而非探索和泛化，难以有效训练并行思考能力

Method: 采用渐进式课程：先用SFT在简单任务上培养并行思考能力，然后转向RL在困难问题上探索和泛化该技能

Result: 在MATH、AMC23、AIME等数学基准上提升8.4%准确率，并行思考作为中期探索支架可带来42.9%的性能提升

Conclusion: 并行思考是有效的探索策略和多视角验证工具，RL框架成功培养了这种能力并显著提升推理性能

Abstract: Parallel thinking has emerged as a novel approach for enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by exploring multiple reasoning
paths concurrently. However, activating such capabilities through training
remains challenging, as existing methods predominantly rely on supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) over synthetic data, which encourages teacher-forced
imitation rather than exploration and generalization. Different from them, we
propose \textbf{Parallel-R1}, the first reinforcement learning (RL) framework
that enables parallel thinking behaviors for complex real-world reasoning
tasks. Our framework employs a progressive curriculum that explicitly addresses
the cold-start problem in training parallel thinking with RL. We first use SFT
on prompt-generated trajectories from easier tasks to instill the parallel
thinking ability, then transition to RL to explore and generalize this skill on
harder problems. Experiments on various math benchmarks, including MATH, AMC23,
and AIME, show that Parallel-R1 successfully instills parallel thinking,
leading to 8.4% accuracy improvements over the sequential thinking model
trained directly on challenging tasks with RL. Further analysis reveals a clear
shift in the model's thinking behavior: at an early stage, it uses parallel
thinking as an exploration strategy, while in a later stage, it uses the same
capability for multi-perspective verification. Most significantly, we validate
parallel thinking as a \textbf{mid-training exploration scaffold}, where this
temporary exploratory phase unlocks a higher performance ceiling after RL,
yielding a 42.9% improvement over the baseline on AIME25. Our model, data, and
code will be open-source at https://github.com/zhengkid/Parallel-R1.

Abstract: Integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) into the reasoning processes of large
language models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate
hallucination. However, existing work in this area often relies on proprietary
or extremely large models, limiting accessibility and scalability. In this
study, we investigate the capabilities of existing integration methods for
small language models (SLMs) in KG-based question answering and observe that
their performance is often constrained by their limited ability to traverse and
reason over knowledge graphs. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging
simple and efficient exploration modules to handle knowledge graph traversal in
place of the language model itself. Experiment results demonstrate that these
lightweight modules effectively improve the performance of small language
models on knowledge graph question answering tasks. Source code:

Abstract: The spread of fake news, polarizing, politically biased, and harmful content

becoming a promising approach, however, no study has properly benchmarked their
performance across different models, usage methods, and languages. This study

from parameter efficient Fine-Tuning of language models to a variety of
different In-Context Learning strategies and prompts. These included zero-shot
prompts, codebooks, few-shot (with both randomly-selected and
diversely-selected examples using Determinantal Point Processes), and
Chain-of-Thought. We discovered that In-Context Learning often underperforms
when compared to Fine-Tuning a model. This main finding highlights the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的检索-重排序管道存在两个关键限制：受限于初始检索的top-k文档质量，以及基于LLM的重排序器计算需求增长限制了可处理的文档数量。需要一种更高效的方法来在有限计算预算下提升检索准确性。

Method: 提出Reranker-Guided-Search (RGS)方法，使用近似最近邻算法生成的邻近图进行贪婪搜索，基于文档相似性策略性地优先选择有前景的文档进行重排序，而不是传统的顺序重排序方法。

Result: 在多个基准测试中取得显著性能提升：BRIGHT提升3.5分，FollowIR提升2.9分，M-BEIR提升5.1分，所有结果都在100个文档的重排序预算约束下实现。

Conclusion: 在固定的嵌入和重排序器模型对条件下，策略性地选择要重排序的文档可以在有限的重排序预算下显著提高检索准确性。

Abstract: The widely used retrieve-and-rerank pipeline faces two critical limitations:
they are constrained by the initial retrieval quality of the top-k documents,
and the growing computational demands of LLM-based rerankers restrict the
number of documents that can be effectively processed. We introduce
Reranker-Guided-Search (RGS), a novel approach that bypasses these limitations
by directly retrieving documents according to reranker preferences rather than
following the traditional sequential reranking method. Our method uses a greedy
search on proximity graphs generated by approximate nearest neighbor
algorithms, strategically prioritizing promising documents for reranking based
on document similarity. Experimental results demonstrate substantial
performance improvements across multiple benchmarks: 3.5 points on BRIGHT, 2.9
on FollowIR, and 5.1 on M-BEIR, all within a constrained reranker budget of 100
documents. Our analysis suggests that, given a fixed pair of embedding and
reranker models, strategically selecting documents to rerank can significantly
improve retrieval accuracy under limited reranker budget.

Abstract: Text generating capabilities have undergone a substantial transformation with

lot of data and processing power. This paper introduces a new method that
combines the use of the Gemma 2B LLM with a classifier-LLM architecture to
incorporate a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) encoder. Our approach drastically
lowers the amount of data and compute power needed while achieving performance
close to that of cutting-edge methods. Notably, compared to current
methodologies, our methodology delivers an overall performance improvement of
10%. The suggested architecture demonstrates the possibility of effective
transfer learning for EEG-based text production, remaining strong and
functional even in the face of data limits. This work highlights the potential
of integrating LLMs with EEG decoding to improve assistive technologies and
improve independence and communication for those with severe motor limitations.
Our method pushes the limits of present capabilities and opens new paths for
research and application in brain-computer interfaces by efficiently using the
strengths of pre-trained language models. This makes EEG-based text production
more accessible and efficient.

Abstract: Discharge communication is a critical yet underexplored component of patient

to act as personalized discharge educators. DischargeSim simulates post-visit,
multi-turn conversations between LLM-driven DoctorAgents and PatientAgents with
diverse psychosocial profiles (e.g., health literacy, education, emotion).
Interactions are structured across six clinically grounded discharge topics and
assessed along three axes: (1) dialogue quality via automatic and LLM-as-judge
evaluation, (2) personalized document generation including free-text summaries
and structured AHRQ checklists, and (3) patient comprehension through a
downstream multiple-choice exam. Experiments across 18 LLMs reveal significant
gaps in discharge education capability, with performance varying widely across
patient profiles. Notably, model size does not always yield better education
outcomes, highlighting trade-offs in strategy use and content prioritization.
DischargeSim offers a first step toward benchmarking LLMs in post-visit
clinical education and promoting equitable, personalized patient support.

Abstract: Migration has been a core topic in German political debate, from millions of
expellees post World War II over labor migration to refugee movements in the
recent past. Studying political speech regarding such wide-ranging phenomena in
depth traditionally required extensive manual annotations, limiting the scope
of analysis to small subsets of the data. Large language models (LLMs) have the
potential to partially automate even complex annotation tasks. We provide an
extensive evaluation of a multiple LLMs in annotating (anti-)solidarity
subtypes in German parliamentary debates compared to a large set of thousands
of human reference annotations (gathered over a year). We evaluate the
influence of model size, prompting differences, fine-tuning, historical versus
contemporary data; and we investigate systematic errors. Beyond methodological
evaluation, we also interpret the resulting annotations from a social science
lense, gaining deeper insight into (anti-)solidarity trends towards migrants in
the German post-World War II period and recent past. Our data reveals a high
degree of migrant-directed solidarity in the postwar period, as well as a
strong trend towards anti-solidarity in the German parliament since 2015,
motivating further research. These findings highlight the promise of LLMs for
political text analysis and the importance of migration debates in Germany,

Abstract: Many contemporary data-driven research efforts in the natural sciences, such
as chemistry and materials science, require large-scale, high-performance
entity recognition from scientific datasets. Large language models (LLMs) have
increasingly been adopted to solve the entity recognition task, with the same
trend being observed on all-spectrum NLP tasks. The prevailing entity
recognition LLMs rely on fine-tuned technology, yet the fine-tuning process
often incurs significant cost. To achieve a best performance-cost trade-off, we
propose ALLabel, a three-stage framework designed to select the most
informative and representative samples in preparing the demonstrations for LLM
modeling. The annotated examples are used to construct a ground-truth retrieval
corpus for LLM in-context learning. By sequentially employing three distinct
active learning strategies, ALLabel consistently outperforms all baselines
under the same annotation budget across three specialized domain datasets.
Experimental results also demonstrate that selectively annotating only 5\%-10\%
of the dataset with ALLabel can achieve performance comparable to the method
annotating the entire dataset. Further analyses and ablation studies verify the
effectiveness and generalizability of our proposal.

decoupling and utilization of meta-knowledge. Concretely, VeriOS-Agent
autonomously executes actions in normal conditions while proactively querying
humans in untrustworthy scenarios. Experiments show that VeriOS-Agent improves

TL;DR: BALI方法通过联合预训练语言模型和知识图谱编码器，将生物医学知识图谱信息融入语言模型，提升对复杂领域概念的理解能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生物医学LLMs对复杂领域特定概念结构和知识图谱中事实信息的理解有限，需要更好的知识融合方法

Method: 提出BALI联合预训练方法，通过链接生物医学概念到UMLS知识图谱，使用局部KG子图作为跨模态正样本，同时学习专用KG编码器并对齐LM和图表示

Result: 在PubMedBERT和BioLinkBERT等生物医学LM上实施该方法，在多个语言理解任务上提升性能，并改善实体表示质量，即使在小规模对齐数据集上预训练也有效

Conclusion: BALI方法有效增强了生物医学语言模型的知识理解和表示能力，为领域特定LLM的知识融合提供了有效途径

Abstract: In recent years, there has been substantial progress in using pretrained
Language Models (LMs) on a range of tasks aimed at improving the understanding
of biomedical texts. Nonetheless, existing biomedical LLMs show limited
comprehension of complex, domain-specific concept structures and the factual
information encoded in biomedical Knowledge Graphs (KGs). In this work, we
propose BALI (Biomedical Knowledge Graph and Language Model Alignment), a novel
joint LM and KG pre-training method that augments an LM with external knowledge
by the simultaneous learning of a dedicated KG encoder and aligning the
representations of both the LM and the graph. For a given textual sequence, we
link biomedical concept mentions to the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS)
KG and utilize local KG subgraphs as cross-modal positive samples for these
mentions. Our empirical findings indicate that implementing our method on
several leading biomedical LMs, such as PubMedBERT and BioLinkBERT, improves
their performance on a range of language understanding tasks and the quality of
entity representations, even with minimal pre-training on a small alignment
dataset sourced from PubMed scientific abstracts.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于迭代自提示技术(ISP)的临床病例文档摘要方法，使用LLMs生成任务特定提示并通过few-shot学习进行优化，在MultiClinSUM共享任务中取得了良好的语义相似度效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床报告通常冗长且充满专业术语，使得领域专家难以高效识别文档中的重要内容，影响了医患之间的有效沟通和共享决策。

Method: 采用迭代自提示技术(ISP)在大型语言模型上，通过让LLMs生成任务特定提示并使用基于示例的few-shot学习进行优化。同时使用ROUGE和BERT-score等词汇和嵌入空间指标来指导模型微调。

Result: 使用GPT-4和GPT-4o的视角感知ISP方法在3,396份临床病例报告上获得了ROUGE分数(46.53, 24.68, 30.77)和BERT分数(87.84, 83.25, 85.46)，高BERT分数表明模型产生了语义等效的输出摘要。

Conclusion: 视角感知ISP技术可以有效地用于临床报告摘要，支持更好的医患沟通，尽管词汇重叠度较低但语义保持良好。

Abstract: Efficient communication between patients and clinicians plays an important
role in shared decision-making. However, clinical reports are often lengthy and
filled with clinical jargon, making it difficult for domain experts to identify
important aspects in the document efficiently. This paper presents the
methodology we applied in the MultiClinSUM shared task for summarising clinical
case documents. We used an Iterative Self-Prompting technique on large language
models (LLMs) by asking LLMs to generate task-specific prompts and refine them
via example-based few-shot learning. Furthermore, we used lexical and embedding
space metrics, ROUGE and BERT-score, to guide the model fine-tuning with
epochs. Our submission using perspective-aware ISP on GPT-4 and GPT-4o achieved
ROUGE scores (46.53, 24.68, 30.77) and BERTscores (87.84, 83.25, 85.46) for (P,
R, F1) from the official evaluation on 3,396 clinical case reports from various
specialties extracted from open journals. The high BERTscore indicates that the
model produced semantically equivalent output summaries compared to the
references, even though the overlap at the exact lexicon level is lower, as
reflected in the lower ROUGE scores. This work sheds some light on how
perspective-aware ISP (PA-ISP) can be deployed for clinical report
summarisation and support better communication between patients and clinicians.

Conclusion: M-BRe框架有效解决了LLMs在关系抽取中的语义捕获和计算效率问题，为自动训练样本提取提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: For Relation Extraction (RE), the manual annotation of training data may be
prohibitively expensive, since the sentences that contain the target relations
in texts can be very scarce and difficult to find. It is therefore beneficial
to develop an efficient method that can automatically extract training
instances from unlabeled texts for training RE models. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) have been adopted in various natural language processing tasks,
with RE also benefiting from their advances. However, when leveraging LLMs for
RE with predefined relation categories, two key challenges arise. First, in a
multi-class classification setting, LLMs often struggle to comprehensively
capture the semantics of every relation, leading to suboptimal results. Second,
although employing binary classification for each relation individually can
mitigate this issue, it introduces significant computational overhead,
resulting in impractical time complexity for real-world applications.
Therefore, this paper proposes a framework called M-BRe to extract training
instances from unlabeled texts for RE. It utilizes three modules to combine the
advantages of both of the above classification approaches: Relation Grouping,
Relation Extraction, and Label Decision. Extensive experiments confirm its
superior capability in discovering high-quality training samples from unlabeled
texts for RE.

Conclusion: DK2R方法通过有效利用双重知识和LLMs，成功解决了多模态对话系统中的知识选择和解耦问题，显著提升了文本响应生成性能。

Abstract: Textual response generation is pivotal for multimodal \mbox{task-oriented}
dialog systems, which aims to generate proper textual responses based on the
multimodal context. While existing efforts have demonstrated remarkable
progress, there still exist the following limitations: 1) \textit{neglect of
unstructured review knowledge} and 2) \textit{underutilization of large
language models (LLMs)}. Inspired by this, we aim to fully utilize dual
knowledge (\textit{i.e., } structured attribute and unstructured review
knowledge) with LLMs to promote textual response generation in multimodal
task-oriented dialog systems. However, this task is non-trivial due to two key
challenges: 1) \textit{dynamic knowledge type selection} and 2)
\textit{intention-response decoupling}. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel dual knowledge-enhanced two-stage reasoner by adapting LLMs for
multimodal dialog systems (named DK2R). To be specific, DK2R first extracts
both structured attribute and unstructured review knowledge from external
knowledge base given the dialog context. Thereafter, DK2R uses an LLM to
evaluate each knowledge type's utility by analyzing LLM-generated provisional
probe responses. Moreover, DK2R separately summarizes the intention-oriented
key clues via dedicated reasoning, which are further used as auxiliary signals
to enhance LLM-based textual response generation. Extensive experiments
conducted on a public dataset verify the superiority of DK2R. We have released
the codes and parameters.

Abstract: Literary translation has recently gained attention as a distinct and complex
task in machine translation research. However, the translation by small open
models remains an open problem. We contribute to this ongoing research by
introducing TINYFABULIST TRANSLATION FRAMEWORK (TF2), a unified framework for
dataset creation, fine tuning, and evaluation in English-Romanian literary
translations, centred on the creation and open release of both a compact, fine
tuned language model (TF2-12B) and large scale synthetic parallel datasets
(DS-TF2-EN-RO-3M and DS-TF2-EN-RO-15K). Building on DS-TF1-EN-3M (TF1), the
largest collection of synthetic English fables to date, we address the need for
rich, high quality literary datasets in low resource languages such as
Romanian. Our pipeline first generates 15k high quality Romanian references
from the TF1 pool using a high performing LLM. We then apply a two stage fine
tuning process to a 12B parameter open weight model: (i) instruction tuning to
capture genre specific narrative style, and (ii) adapter compression for
efficient deployment. Evaluation combines corpus level BLEU and a five
dimension LLM based rubric (accuracy, fluency, coherence, style, cultural
adaptation) to provide a nuanced assessment of translation quality. Results
show that our fine tuned model achieves fluency and adequacy competitive with
top performing large proprietary models, while being open, accessible, and
significantly more cost effective. Alongside the fine tuned model and both
datasets, we publicly release all scripts and evaluation prompts. TF2 thus
provides an end-to-end, reproducible pipeline for research on cost efficient
translation, cross lingual narrative generation, and the broad adoption of open
models for culturally significant literary content in low resource settings.

Abstract: This paper presents our team's solution to Shared Task 7 of NLPCC-2025, which
focuses on sentence-level gender bias detection and mitigation in Chinese. The
task aims to promote fairness and controllability in natural language
generation by automatically detecting, classifying, and mitigating gender bias.
To address this challenge, we adopt a fine-tuning approach based on large
language models (LLMs), efficiently adapt to the bias detection task via
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). In terms of data processing, we construct a more
balanced training set to alleviate class imbalance and introduce heterogeneous
samples from multiple sources to enhance model generalization. For the
detection and classification sub-tasks, we employ a majority voting strategy
that integrates outputs from multiple expert models to boost performance.
Additionally, to improve bias generation detection and mitigation, we design a
multi-temperature sampling mechanism to capture potential variations in bias
expression styles. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in bias detection, classification, and mitigation. Our method
ultimately achieves an average score of 47.90%, ranking fourth in the shared
task.

53,000 images, to gather all of our data, which has 225 nouns and 115
adjectives, with each noun having about 9 different adjectives, forming
approximately 1000 noun-adjective pairs. For our first experiment, we test our
method's ability to determine the state of each noun class separately against
other metrics for comparison. These metrics are cosine similarity, dot product,
product quantization, binary index, Naive Bayes, and a custom neural network.
Among these metrics, we found that our proposed BVM performs the best in
classifying the states for each noun. We then perform a second experiment where
we try using BVM to determine if it can differentiate adjectives from one
another for each adjective separately. We compared the abilities of BVM to
differentiate adjectives against the proposed method the MIT-States paper
suggests: using a logistic regression model. In the end, we did not find
conclusive evidence that our BVM metric could perform better than the logistic
regression model at discerning adjectives. Yet, we were able to find evidence
for possible improvements to our method; this leads to the chance of increasing
our method's accuracy through certain changes in our methodologies.

phrases constitute stigmatizing language in healthcare. We conducted a
systematic search of the literature to identify existing stigmatizing language
lexicons and then analyzed them comparatively to examine: 1) similarities and
discrepancies between these lexicons, and 2) the distribution of positive,
negative, or neutral terms based on an established sentiment dataset. Our
search identified four lexicons. The analysis results revealed moderate
semantic similarity among them, and that most stigmatizing terms are related to
judgmental expressions by clinicians to describe perceived negative behaviors.
Sentiment analysis showed a predominant proportion of negatively classified
terms, though variations exist across lexicons. Our findings underscore the
need for a standardized lexicon and highlight challenges in defining
stigmatizing language in clinical texts.

Conclusion: DIET-CP提供了一种简单有效的持续预训练方法，特别适合小规模专业领域数据集的应用。

Abstract: Continued pretraining offers a promising solution for adapting foundation
models to a new target domain. However, in specialized domains, available
datasets are often very small, limiting the applicability of SSL methods
developed for large-scale pretraining and making hyperparameter search
infeasible. In addition, pretrained models are usually released as
backbone-weights only, lacking important information to continue pretraining.
We propose to bridge this gap with DIET-CP, a simple continued pretraining
strategy, where any strong foundation model can be steered towards the new data
distribution of interest. DIET-CP relies on a very simple objective, requires
no labels, and introduces no more hyperparameters than supervised finetuning.
It is stable across data modalities and backbone choices, while providing a
significant performance boost for state-of-the-art models such as DINOv3 using
only 1000 images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类在识别受损文字时展现的惊人韧性是否在先进的视觉语言模型中也存在，探索VLMs在面对字符碎片化、融合和部分遮挡时的表现。

Method: 构建了两个受心理物理学启发的基准测试，涵盖中文象形文字和英文字母文字，通过拼接、重组和叠加字形来创建对人类可读但对模型"可见但不可读"的刺激材料。

Result: 当代VLMs在这些扰动下表现严重下降，经常产生不相关或不连贯的输出，表明模型过度依赖通用视觉不变性而忽视了符号组合先验知识。

Conclusion: 研究结果呼吁开发能够编码符号分割、组合和绑定的架构和训练策略，为多模态系统在教育、可访问性、文化遗产和安全等领域的部署提出了具体挑战。

Abstract: Writing is a universal cultural technology that reuses vision for symbolic
communication. Humans display striking resilience: we readily recognize words
even when characters are fragmented, fused, or partially occluded. This paper
investigates whether advanced vision language models (VLMs) share this
resilience. We construct two psychophysics inspired benchmarks across distinct
writing systems, Chinese logographs and English alphabetic words, by splicing,
recombining, and overlaying glyphs to yield ''visible but unreadable'' stimuli
for models while remaining legible to humans. Despite strong performance on
clean text, contemporary VLMs show a severe drop under these perturbations,
frequently producing unrelated or incoherent outputs. The pattern suggests a
structural limitation: models heavily leverage generic visual invariances but
under rely on compositional priors needed for robust literacy. We release
stimuli generation code, prompts, and evaluation protocols to facilitate
transparent replication and follow up work. Our findings motivate architectures
and training strategies that encode symbol segmentation, composition, and
binding across scripts, and they delineate concrete challenges for deploying
multimodal systems in education, accessibility, cultural heritage, and
security.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态模型训练依赖稀疏的图像-文本对，缺乏细粒度视觉细节，需要一种资源高效的方法来对齐视觉理解和生成能力

Method: Reconstruction Alignment (RecA)方法：利用模型自身的视觉理解嵌入作为条件，通过自监督重建损失优化图像重建，实现理解和生成的对齐

Result: 仅用27 GPU小时，在GenEval(0.73→0.90)和DPGBench(80.93→88.15)上显著提升生成性能，编辑基准也得到改善(ImgEdit 3.38→3.75, GEdit 6.94→7.25)，超越更大开源模型

Conclusion: RecA是一种高效通用的后训练对齐策略，适用于多种多模态架构，为理解和生成对齐提供了简单有效的解决方案

Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) unify visual understanding and generation
within a single architecture. However, conventional training relies on
image-text pairs (or sequences) whose captions are typically sparse and miss
fine-grained visual details--even when they use hundreds of words to describe a
simple image. We introduce Reconstruction Alignment (RecA), a
resource-efficient post-training method that leverages visual understanding
encoder embeddings as dense "text prompts," providing rich supervision without
captions. Concretely, RecA conditions a UMM on its own visual understanding
embeddings and optimizes it to reconstruct the input image with a
self-supervised reconstruction loss, thereby realigning understanding and
generation. Despite its simplicity, RecA is broadly applicable: across
autoregressive, masked-autoregressive, and diffusion-based UMMs, it
consistently improves generation and editing fidelity. With only 27 GPU-hours,
post-training with RecA substantially improves image generation performance on
GenEval (0.73$\rightarrow$0.90) and DPGBench (80.93$\rightarrow$88.15), while
also boosting editing benchmarks (ImgEdit 3.38$\rightarrow$3.75, GEdit
6.94$\rightarrow$7.25). Notably, RecA surpasses much larger open-source models
and applies broadly across diverse UMM architectures, establishing it as an
efficient and general post-training alignment strategy for UMMs

Method: 1)构建Visual Probe Dataset视觉搜索数据集；2)开发迭代数据收集管道获取多样化推理轨迹；3)提出over-turn masking策略避免强化学习中惩罚超轮次响应

Conclusion: Mini-o3系统能够产生丰富的推理模式和深度思考路径，有效解决复杂视觉搜索问题，展示了深度多轮推理的可行性

Abstract: Recent advances in large multimodal models have leveraged image-based tools
with reinforcement learning to tackle visual problems. However, existing
open-source approaches often exhibit monotonous reasoning patterns and allow
only a limited number of interaction turns, making them inadequate for
difficult tasks that require trial-and-error exploration. In this work, we
address this limitation by scaling up tool-based interactions and introduce
Mini-o3, a system that executes deep, multi-turn reasoning -- spanning tens of
steps -- and achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging visual search
tasks. Our recipe for reproducing OpenAI o3-style behaviors comprises three key
components. First, we construct the Visual Probe Dataset, a collection of
thousands of challenging visual search problems designed for exploratory
reasoning. Second, we develop an iterative data collection pipeline to obtain
cold-start trajectories that exhibit diverse reasoning patterns, including
depth-first search, trial-and-error, and goal maintenance. Third, we propose an
over-turn masking strategy that prevents penalization of over-turn responses
(those that hit the maximum number of turns) during reinforcement learning,
thereby balancing training-time efficiency with test-time scalability. Despite
training with an upper bound of only six interaction turns, our model generates
trajectories that naturally scale to tens of turns at inference time, with
accuracy improving as the number of turns increases. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Mini-o3 produces rich reasoning patterns and deep thinking
paths, effectively solving challenging visual search problems.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在图像描述和视觉问答等任务中表现优异，但容易产生与视觉输入冲突的幻觉文本。现有方法通常对所有层和注意力头进行统一调整，无法准确定位问题来源。

Conclusion: 通过细粒度的注意力诊断和动态校正，可以有效解决MLLM的幻觉问题，该方法具有任务无关性和高效性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on tasks
like image captioning and visual question answering, but remain prone to
hallucinations, where generated text conflicts with the visual input. Prior
work links this partly to insufficient visual attention, but existing
attention-based detectors and mitigation typically apply uniform adjustments
across layers and heads, obscuring where errors originate. In this paper, we
first show these methods fail to accurately localize problematic layers. Then,
we introduce two diagnostics: Layer Image Attention Entropy (LIAE) which flags
anomalous layers, and Image Attention Focus (IAF) which scores attention heads
within those layers. Analysis shows that LIAE pinpoints faulty layers and IAF
reliably ranks heads that warrant correction. Guided by these signals, we
propose Dynamic Layer-wise Entropy and Attention Fusion (D-LEAF), a
task-agnostic, attention-guided method that dynamically localizes and corrects
errors during inference with negligible overhead. Results show our D-LEAF
delivers a 53% relative improvement on standard captioning benchmarks, and on
VQA both accuracy and F1-score improve by approximately 4%, substantially
suppressing hallucinations while preserving efficiency.

Abstract: Large-scale biological discovery requires integrating massive, heterogeneous
datasets like those from the JUMP Cell Painting consortium, but technical batch
effects and a lack of generalizable models remain critical roadblocks. To
address this, we introduce CellPainTR, a Transformer-based architecture
designed to learn foundational representations of cellular morphology that are
robust to batch effects. Unlike traditional methods that require retraining on
new data, CellPainTR's design, featuring source-specific context tokens, allows
for effective out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to entirely unseen
datasets without fine-tuning. We validate CellPainTR on the large-scale JUMP
dataset, where it outperforms established methods like ComBat and Harmony in
both batch integration and biological signal preservation. Critically, we
demonstrate its robustness through a challenging OOD task on the unseen Bray et
al. dataset, where it maintains high performance despite significant domain and
feature shifts. Our work represents a significant step towards creating truly
foundational models for image-based profiling, enabling more reliable and

Conclusion: FedAPT有效解决了联邦提示调优中的对抗鲁棒性问题，通过全局标签信息引导和跨层协同，为实际应用提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Prompt Tuning (FPT) is an efficient method for cross-client
collaborative fine-tuning of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However,
models tuned using FPT are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, leading to
misclassification in downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce Federated
Adversarial Prompt Tuning (\textbf{FedAPT}), a novel method designed to enhance
the adversarial robustness of FPT. We identify a key issue in FedAPT under
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) settings: a \textit{class
information gap} between clients and the global model. Clients rely solely on
limited local label information to generate adversarial samples for training,
while the global model must defend against adversarial attacks from global
labels. To address this issue, we propose a \textbf{class-aware prompt
generator} that generates visual prompts from text prompts. This generator is
guided by a \emph{Global Label Embedding} (serving as a ``beacon") which
encodes cross-client label information to create more globally-aligned visual
prompts. Additionally, we propose a \textbf{cross-layer generator sharing}
strategy to enhance prompt coupling across different layers of the model,
further boosting adversarial robustness. Extensive experiments on multiple
image classification datasets demonstrate the superiority of FedAPT in
improving adversarial robustness, outperforming existing methods by a large
margin. FedAPT also exhibits exceptional generalization in cross-domain and
cross-dataset scenarios, indicating its effectiveness in real-world
applications.

Abstract: Open-source Vision-Language Models show immense promise for enterprise
applications, yet a critical disconnect exists between academic evaluation and
enterprise deployment requirements. Current benchmarks rely heavily on
multiple-choice questions and synthetic data, failing to capture the complexity
of real-world business applications like social media content analysis. This
paper introduces VLM-in-the-Wild (ViLD), a comprehensive framework to bridge
this gap by evaluating VLMs on operational enterprise requirements. We define
ten business-critical tasks: logo detection, OCR, object detection, human
presence and demographic analysis, human activity and appearance analysis,
scene detection, camera perspective and media quality assessment, dominant
colors, comprehensive description, and NSFW detection. To this framework, we
bring an innovative BlockWeaver Algorithm that solves the challenging problem
of comparing unordered, variably-grouped OCR outputs from VLMs without relying
on embeddings or LLMs, achieving remarkable speed and reliability. To
demonstrate efficacy of ViLD, we constructed a new benchmark dataset of 7,500
diverse samples, carefully stratified from a corpus of one million real-world
images and videos. ViLD provides actionable insights by combining semantic
matching (both embedding-based and LLM-as-a-judge approaches), traditional
metrics, and novel methods to measure the completeness and faithfulness of
descriptive outputs. By benchmarking leading open-source VLMs (Qwen, MIMO, and
InternVL) against a powerful proprietary baseline as per ViLD framework, we
provide one of the first industry-grounded, task-driven assessment of VLMs
capabilities, offering actionable insights for their deployment in enterprise
environments.

Abstract: Can models generalize attribute knowledge across semantically and
perceptually dissimilar categories? While prior work has addressed attribute
prediction within narrow taxonomic or visually similar domains, it remains
unclear whether current models can abstract attributes and apply them to
conceptually distant categories. This work presents the first explicit
evaluation for the robustness of the attribute prediction task under such
conditions, testing whether models can correctly infer shared attributes
between unrelated object types: e.g., identifying that the attribute "has four
legs" is common to both "dogs" and "chairs". To enable this evaluation, we
introduce train-test split strategies that progressively reduce correlation
between training and test sets, based on: LLM-driven semantic grouping,
embedding similarity thresholding, embedding-based clustering, and
supercategory-based partitioning using ground-truth labels. Results show a
sharp drop in performance as the correlation between training and test
categories decreases, indicating strong sensitivity to split design. Among the
evaluated methods, clustering yields the most effective trade-off, reducing
hidden correlations while preserving learnability. These findings offer new
insights into the limitations of current representations and inform future
benchmark construction for attribute reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly capable of interpreting multimodal
inputs to generate complex 3D shapes, yet robust methods to evaluate geometric
and structural fidelity remain underdeveloped. This paper introduces a human in
the loop framework for the quantitative evaluation of LLM generated 3D models,
supporting applications such as democratization of CAD design, reverse
engineering of legacy designs, and rapid prototyping. We propose a
comprehensive suite of similarity and complexity metrics, including volumetric
accuracy, surface alignment, dimensional fidelity, and topological intricacy,
to benchmark generated models against ground truth CAD references. Using an L
bracket component as a case study, we systematically compare LLM performance
across four input modalities: 2D orthographic views, isometric sketches,
geometric structure trees, and code based correction prompts. Our findings
demonstrate improved generation fidelity with increased semantic richness, with
code level prompts achieving perfect reconstruction across all metrics. A key
contribution of this work is demonstrating that our proposed quantitative
evaluation approach enables significantly faster convergence toward the ground
truth, especially compared to traditional qualitative methods based solely on
visual inspection and human intuition. This work not only advances the
understanding of AI assisted shape synthesis but also provides a scalable
methodology to validate and refine generative models for diverse CAD

Abstract: We propose a novel regularization loss that enforces standard Gaussianity,
encouraging samples to align with a standard Gaussian distribution. This
facilitates a range of downstream tasks involving optimization in the latent
space of text-to-image models. We treat elements of a high-dimensional sample
as one-dimensional standard Gaussian variables and define a composite loss that
combines moment-based regularization in the spatial domain with power
spectrum-based regularization in the spectral domain. Since the expected values
of moments and power spectrum distributions are analytically known, the loss
promotes conformity to these properties. To ensure permutation invariance, the
losses are applied to randomly permuted inputs. Notably, existing
Gaussianity-based regularizations fall within our unified framework: some
correspond to moment losses of specific orders, while the previous
covariance-matching loss is equivalent to our spectral loss but incurs higher
time complexity due to its spatial-domain computation. We showcase the
application of our regularization in generative modeling for test-time reward
alignment with a text-to-image model, specifically to enhance aesthetics and
text alignment. Our regularization outperforms previous Gaussianity
regularization, effectively prevents reward hacking and accelerates
convergence.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have revolutionized text-to-image generation,
but they risk perpetuating the harmful social biases in their training data.
Prior work has identified gender bias in these models, but methodological
limitations prevented large-scale, comparable, cross-model analysis. To address
this gap, we introduce the Aymara Image Fairness Evaluation, a benchmark for
assessing social bias in AI-generated images. We test 13 commercially available
LMMs using 75 procedurally-generated, gender-neutral prompts to generate people
in stereotypically-male, stereotypically-female, and non-stereotypical
professions. We then use a validated LLM-as-a-judge system to score the 965
resulting images for gender representation. Our results reveal (p < .001 for
all): 1) LMMs systematically not only reproduce but actually amplify
occupational gender stereotypes relative to real-world labor data, generating
men in 93.0% of images for male-stereotyped professions but only 22.5% for
female-stereotyped professions; 2) Models exhibit a strong default-male bias,
generating men in 68.3% of the time for non-stereotyped professions; and 3) The
extent of bias varies dramatically across models, with overall male
representation ranging from 46.7% to 73.3%. Notably, the top-performing model
de-amplified gender stereotypes and approached gender parity, achieving the
highest fairness scores. This variation suggests high bias is not an inevitable
outcome but a consequence of design choices. Our work provides the most
comprehensive cross-model benchmark of gender bias to date and underscores the
necessity of standardized, automated evaluation tools for promoting
accountability and fairness in AI development.

Abstract: Working with annotated data is the cornerstone of supervised learning.
Nevertheless, providing labels to instances is a task that requires significant
human effort. Several critical real-world applications make things more
complicated because no matter how many labels may have been identified in a
task of interest, it could be the case that examples corresponding to novel
classes may appear in the future. Not unsurprisingly, prior work in this,
so-called, `open-world' context has focused a lot on semi-supervised
approaches.
  Focusing on image classification, somehow paradoxically, we propose a fully
unsupervised approach to the problem of determining the novel categories in a
particular dataset. Our approach relies on estimating the number of clusters
using Vision Transformers, which utilize attention mechanisms to generate
vector embeddings. Furthermore, we incorporate manifold learning techniques to
refine these embeddings by exploiting the intrinsic geometry of the data,
thereby enhancing the overall image clustering performance. Overall, we
establish new State-of-the-Art results on single-modal clustering and Novel
Class Discovery on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and Tiny ImageNet. We do
so, both when the number of clusters is known or unknown ahead of time. The

indicator of user intent. To address this gap, we introduce EgoGazeVQA, an
egocentric gaze-guided video question answering benchmark that leverages gaze
information to improve the understanding of longer daily-life videos.
EgoGazeVQA consists of gaze-based QA pairs generated by MLLMs and refined by
human annotators. Our experiments reveal that existing MLLMs struggle to
accurately interpret user intentions. In contrast, our gaze-guided intent
prompting methods significantly enhance performance by integrating spatial,
temporal, and intent-related cues. We further conduct experiments on
gaze-related fine-tuning and analyze how gaze estimation accuracy impacts
prompting effectiveness. These results underscore the value of gaze for more
personalized and effective AI assistants in egocentric settings.

TL;DR: 研究发现当前视觉语言模型的性别偏见评估存在严重问题，即使对非性别特征进行微小扰动（如遮挡10%物体或轻微模糊背景），也会导致偏见评分大幅变化（生成式VLMs变化达175%，CLIP变体变化43%），表明现有评估更多反映模型对伪相关特征的响应而非真实性别偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于真实图像的性别偏见评估基准往往包含性别与非性别特征（如物体、背景）之间的伪相关性，这可能导致性别偏见评估失真。研究旨在探究这些伪相关特征是否扭曲了性别偏见评估的可靠性。

Method: 系统性地对四个广泛使用的基准（COCO-gender、FACET、MIAP、PHASE）和各种VLMs中的非性别特征进行扰动，包括物体遮挡和背景模糊等操作，量化这些扰动对偏见评估的影响。

Result: 即使最小程度的扰动也能显著改变偏见评分：生成式VLMs的指标变化高达175%，CLIP变体的指标变化达43%。这表明当前偏见评估更多反映模型对伪相关特征的响应，而非真实的性别偏见。

Conclusion: 由于创建无伪相关特征的基准具有根本性挑战，建议在报告偏见指标时同时报告特征敏感性测量，以实现更可靠的偏见评估。

Abstract: Gender bias in vision-language foundation models (VLMs) raises concerns about
their safe deployment and is typically evaluated using benchmarks with gender
annotations on real-world images. However, as these benchmarks often contain
spurious correlations between gender and non-gender features, such as objects
and backgrounds, we identify a critical oversight in gender bias evaluation: Do
spurious features distort gender bias evaluation? To address this question, we
systematically perturb non-gender features across four widely used benchmarks
(COCO-gender, FACET, MIAP, and PHASE) and various VLMs to quantify their impact
on bias evaluation. Our findings reveal that even minimal perturbations, such
as masking just 10% of objects or weakly blurring backgrounds, can dramatically
alter bias scores, shifting metrics by up to 175% in generative VLMs and 43% in
CLIP variants. This suggests that current bias evaluations often reflect model
responses to spurious features rather than gender bias, undermining their
reliability. Since creating spurious feature-free benchmarks is fundamentally
challenging, we recommend reporting bias metrics alongside feature-sensitivity
measurements to enable a more reliable bias assessment.

Conclusion: 该方法通过数据高效的微调策略成功解决了Med-VLMs在3D医学影像应用中的关键限制，为医学AI诊断提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (Med-VLMs) have shown impressive results in
tasks such as report generation and visual question answering, but they still
face several limitations. Most notably, they underutilize patient metadata and
lack integration of clinical diagnostic knowledge. Moreover, most existing
models are typically trained from scratch or fine-tuned on large-scale 2D
image-text pairs, requiring extensive computational resources, and their
effectiveness on 3D medical imaging is often limited due to the absence of
structural information. To address these gaps, we propose a data-efficient
fine-tuning pipeline to adapt 3D CT-based Med-VLMs for 3D MRI and demonstrate
its application in Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. Our system introduces
two key innovations. First, we convert structured metadata into synthetic
reports, enriching textual input for improved image-text alignment. Second, we
add an auxiliary token trained to predict the mini-mental state examination
(MMSE) score, a widely used clinical measure of cognitive function that
correlates with AD severity. This provides additional supervision for
fine-tuning. Applying lightweight prompt tuning to both image and text
modalities, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on two AD
datasets using 1,500 training images, outperforming existing methods fine-tuned
on 10,000 images. Code will be released upon publication.

Abstract: Visual reasoning over structured data such as tables is a critical capability

across distinct roles: generation, validation, and inspiration. Visual-TableQA
comprises 2.5k richly structured LaTeX-rendered tables and 6k
reasoning-intensive QA pairs, all produced at a cost of under USD 100. To
promote diversity and creativity, our pipeline performs multi-model
collaborative data generation via cross-model prompting ('inspiration') and
LLM-jury filtering. Stronger models seed layouts and topics that weaker models
elaborate, collectively distilling diverse reasoning patterns and visual
structures into the dataset. Empirical results show that models fine-tuned on
Visual-TableQA generalize robustly to external benchmarks, outperforming

models' performance on perception from short clips continuing to rise. Yet,
multiple recent benchmarks, such as LVBench, Neptune, and ActivityNet-RTL, show
performance wanes for tasks requiring complex reasoning on videos as queries
grow more complex and videos grow longer. In this work, we ask: can existing
perception capabilities be leveraged to successfully perform more complex video
reasoning? In particular, we develop a large language model agent given access
to video modules as subagents or tools. Rather than following a fixed procedure
to solve queries as in previous work such as Visual Programming, ViperGPT, and
MoReVQA, the agent uses the results of each call to a module to determine
subsequent steps. Inspired by work in the textual reasoning domain, we
introduce a critic to distinguish between instances of successful and
unsuccessful sequences from the agent. We show that the combination of our
agent and critic achieve strong performance on the previously-mentioned

Conclusion: PLM通过全面的对象中心推理有效解决了3D理解中的表示对齐问题，展示了强大的泛化能力

Abstract: 3D object segmentation with Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a
prevailing paradigm due to its broad semantics, task flexibility, and strong
generalization. However, this paradigm is hindered by representation
misalignment: LLMs process high-level semantic tokens, whereas 3D point clouds
convey only dense geometric structures. In prior methods, misalignment limits
both input and output. At the input stage, dense point patches require heavy
pre-alignment, weakening object-level semantics and confusing similar
distractors. At the output stage, predictions depend only on dense features
without explicit geometric cues, leading to a loss of fine-grained accuracy. To
address these limitations, we present the Point Linguist Model (PLM), a general
framework that bridges the representation gap between LLMs and dense 3D point
clouds without requiring large-scale pre-alignment between 3D-text or
3D-images. Specifically, we introduce Object-centric Discriminative
Representation (OcDR), which learns object-centric tokens that capture target
semantics and scene relations under a hard negative-aware training objective.
This mitigates the misalignment between LLM tokens and 3D points, enhances
resilience to distractors, and facilitates semantic-level reasoning within
LLMs. For accurate segmentation, we introduce the Geometric Reactivation
Decoder (GRD), which predicts masks by combining OcDR tokens carrying
LLM-inferred geometry with corresponding dense features, preserving
comprehensive dense features throughout the pipeline. Extensive experiments
show that PLM achieves significant improvements of +7.3 mIoU on ScanNetv2 and
+6.0 mIoU on Multi3DRefer for 3D referring segmentation, with consistent gains
across 7 benchmarks spanning 4 different tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness
of comprehensive object-centric reasoning for robust 3D understanding.

Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在视觉中心任务（如目标计数、空间推理）上表现有限，主要原因是文本监督范式只能提供视觉通路的间接指导，导致训练过程中丢失细粒度视觉细节。

Result: 在广泛采用的多模态基准测试中，所有任务都取得了持续改进。通过全面的消融研究验证了框架的关键设计选择。

Conclusion: 这一简单发现为在MLLM训练中有效整合视觉信息开辟了重要方向。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) trained with visual instruction
tuning have achieved strong performance across diverse tasks, yet they remain
limited in vision-centric tasks such as object counting or spatial reasoning.
We attribute this gap to the prevailing text-only supervision paradigm, which
provides only indirect guidance for the visual pathway and often leads MLLMs to
discard fine-grained visual details during training. In this paper, we present
VIsual Representation ALignment (VIRAL), a simple yet effective regularization
strategy that aligns the internal visual representations of MLLMs with those of
pre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs). By explicitly enforcing this
alignment, VIRAL enables the model not only to retain critical visual details
from the input vision encoder but also to complement additional visual
knowledge from VFMs, thereby enhancing its ability to reason over complex
visual inputs. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across all
tasks on widely adopted multimodal benchmarks. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive ablation studies to validate the key design choices underlying
our framework. We believe this simple finding opens up an important direction
for the effective integration of visual information in training MLLMs.

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10、STL-10、TinyImageNet和ImageNet100上均取得一致性能提升，特别是在非线性结构明显的数据集上改进显著。UMAP可视化显示核化嵌入具有更好的等距性和类别分离性。

Conclusion: 核化SSL目标是连接经典核方法和现代表示学习的有前景方向，能够避免表示坍塌并提升复杂或小规模数据任务的性能。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
representation learning by optimizing geometric objectives--such as invariance
to augmentations, variance preservation, and feature decorrelation--without
requiring labels. However, most existing methods operate in Euclidean space,
limiting their ability to capture nonlinear dependencies and geometric
structures. In this work, we propose Kernel VICReg, a novel self-supervised
learning framework that lifts the VICReg objective into a Reproducing Kernel
Hilbert Space (RKHS). By kernelizing each term of the loss-variance,
invariance, and covariance--we obtain a general formulation that operates on
double-centered kernel matrices and Hilbert-Schmidt norms, enabling nonlinear
feature learning without explicit mappings.
  We demonstrate that Kernel VICReg not only avoids representational collapse
but also improves performance on tasks with complex or small-scale data.
Empirical evaluations across MNIST, CIFAR-10, STL-10, TinyImageNet, and
ImageNet100 show consistent gains over Euclidean VICReg, with particularly
strong improvements on datasets where nonlinear structures are prominent. UMAP
visualizations further confirm that kernel-based embeddings exhibit better
isometry and class separation. Our results suggest that kernelizing SSL
objectives is a promising direction for bridging classical kernel methods with
modern representation learning.

Conclusion: 机器遗忘是增强已部署视觉系统公平性的实用框架，无需完全重新训练。

Abstract: Deep neural networks often rely on spurious correlations in training data,
leading to biased or unfair predictions in safety-critical domains such as
medicine and autonomous driving. While conventional bias mitigation typically
requires retraining from scratch or redesigning data pipelines, recent advances
in machine unlearning provide a promising alternative for post-hoc model

privacy-preserving unlearning techniques, we evaluate various strategies
including Gradient Ascent, LoRA, and Teacher-Student distillation. Through
empirical analysis on three benchmark datasets, CUB-200-2011 (pose bias),
CIFAR-10 (synthetic patch bias), and CelebA (gender bias in smile detection),
we demonstrate that post-hoc unlearning can substantially reduce subgroup
disparities, with improvements in demographic parity of up to \textbf{94.86\%}

gains are achieved with minimal accuracy loss and with methods scoring an

Abstract: Deep neural networks have exhibited impressive performance in image
classification tasks but remain vulnerable to adversarial examples. Standard
adversarial training enhances robustness but typically fails to explicitly
address inter-class feature overlap, a significant contributor to adversarial
susceptibility. In this work, we introduce a novel adversarial training
framework that actively mitigates inter-class proximity by projecting out
inter-class dependencies from adversarial and clean samples in the feature
space. Specifically, our approach first identifies the nearest inter-class
neighbors for each adversarial sample and subsequently removes projections onto
these neighbors to enforce stronger feature separability. Theoretically, we
demonstrate that our proposed logits correction reduces the Lipschitz constant
of neural networks, thereby lowering the Rademacher complexity, which directly
contributes to improved generalization and robustness. Extensive experiments
across standard benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN show that
our method demonstrates strong performance that is competitive with leading
adversarial training techniques, highlighting significant achievements in both
robust and clean accuracy. Our findings reveal the importance of addressing
inter-class feature proximity explicitly to bolster adversarial robustness in

Abstract: One of the key issues in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is the black-box nature
of their internal feature extraction process. Targeting vision-related domains,
this paper focuses on analysing the feature space of a DNN by proposing a
decoder that can generate images whose features are guaranteed to closely match
a user-specified feature. Owing to this guarantee that is missed in past
studies, our decoder allows us to evidence which of various attributes in an
image are encoded into a feature by the DNN, by generating images whose
features are in proximity to that feature. Our decoder is implemented as a
guided diffusion model that guides the reverse image generation of a
pre-trained diffusion model to minimise the Euclidean distance between the
feature of a clean image estimated at each step and the user-specified feature.
One practical advantage of our decoder is that it can analyse feature spaces of
different DNNs with no additional training and run on a single COTS GPU. The
experimental results targeting CLIP's image encoder, ResNet-50 and vision
transformer demonstrate that images generated by our decoder have features
remarkably similar to the user-specified ones and reveal valuable insights into
these DNNs' feature spaces.

Abstract: Multimodal fusion is a multimedia technique that has become popular in the
wide range of tasks where image information is accompanied by a signal/audio.
The latter may not convey highly semantic information, such as speech or music,
but some measures such as audio signal recorded by mics in the goal to detect
rail structure elements or defects. While classical detection approaches such
as You Only Look Once (YOLO) family detectors can be efficiently deployed for
defect detection on the image modality, the single modality approaches remain
limited. They yield an overdetection in case of the appearance similar to
normal structural elements. The paper proposes a new multimodal fusion
architecture built on the basis of domain rules with YOLO and Vision
transformer backbones. It integrates YOLOv8n for rapid object detection with a
Vision Transformer (ViT) to combine feature maps extracted from multiple layers
(7, 16, and 19) and synthesised audio representations for two defect classes:
rail Rupture and Surface defect. Fusion is performed between audio and image.
Experimental evaluation on a real-world railway dataset demonstrates that our
multimodal fusion improves precision and overall accuracy by 0.2 points
compared to the vision-only approach. Student's unpaired t-test also confirms
statistical significance of differences in the mean accuracy.

Conclusion: ClaFR是一种简单有效的后处理OOD检测方法，在保护数据隐私的同时实现了优异的检测性能

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection helps models identify data outside the
training categories, crucial for security applications. While feature-based
post-hoc methods address this by evaluating data differences in the feature
space without changing network parameters, they often require access to
training data, which may not be suitable for some data privacy scenarios. This
may not be suitable in scenarios where data privacy protection is a concern. In
this paper, we propose a simple yet effective post-hoc method, termed
Classifier-based Feature Reconstruction (ClaFR), from the perspective of
subspace projection. It first performs an orthogonal decomposition of the
classifier's weights to extract the class-known subspace, then maps the
original data features into this subspace to obtain new data representations.
Subsequently, the OOD score is determined by calculating the feature
reconstruction error of the data within the subspace. Compared to existing OOD
detection algorithms, our method does not require access to training data while
achieving leading performance on multiple OOD benchmarks. Our code is released
at https://github.com/Aie0923/ClaFR.

### [68] [The Protocol Genome A Self Supervised Learning Framework from DICOM Headers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06995)
*Jimmy Joseph*

Main category: cs.CV

Relevance: 35.0

TL;DR: Protocol Genome是一个自监督学习系统，通过分析DICOM医学影像头部信息来学习协议相关性，在外部验证中达到AUROC 0.901，显著优于基线方法，并提高了跨模态和厂商的校准性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床影像通过PACS/DICOM系统处理，扫描协议选择（扫描仪型号、序列、参数等）会影响图像对比度、噪声和伪影，这些潜在混杂因素阻碍了仅基于图像的神经网络在不同站点间的泛化能力。

Method: 将结构化DICOM头部信息作为标签，通过三种方法学习协议感知但临床鲁棒的图像表示：(1)协议-图像对比学习，(2)掩码协议预测，(3)协议-协议转换。使用126万项研究数据进行实验。

Result: 在三个临床任务上均取得显著提升：肺栓塞检测AUROC提升0.046，胶质瘤分级提升0.058，心脏肥大检测提升0.041。校准性改善25-37%，且在10-20%标注数据下仍保持优势。

Conclusion: 该方法减少了协议边界处的假阳性，适用于PACS系统，并提供了模型卡片和部署指南，包含去标识化和偏见审计。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Protocol Genome, a self-supervised learning
system that learns correlations from DICOM headers and achieves AUROC 0.901 (vs
0.847 baseline) and ECE 0.036 (vs 0.058) on fully held-out external validation.
Our method also improves calibration and robustness across modalities (CT, MRI,
CXR) and vendors. Clinical imaging is funneled through PACS/DICOM, where
procedure choices (scanner make/model, sequence, kernel, kVp, TR/TE, and slice
thickness) have consequences for contrast, noise, and artifact. These latent
confounders impede the generalization of image-only networks across sites. We
consider structured DICOM headers as a label and learn protocol-aware but
clinically robust image representations. Protocol Genome obtains tokenized
embeddings of de-identified header fields and models them along with image
features using: (1) protocol-image contrastive learning, (2) masked protocol
prediction, and (3) protocol-protocol translation. With 1.26M studies (7 health
systems, 31 scanners, 3 vendors; CT, MR, CR/DR), we experiment on: (A) chest CT
triage for PE, (B) brain MRI glioma grading, and (C) chest radiograph
cardiomegaly detection. Relative to strong SSL baselines (SimCLR, MAE) as well
as ImageNet transfer, Protocol Genome (+0.046: PE, +0.058: glioma, +0.041:
cardiomegaly) is associated with higher external AUROC; 25-37% calibration
improvements are obtained (p < 0.01, DeLong tests). While the gains may be
task-dependent, they are preserved with 10-20% of labeled data. From a clinical
point of view, the technique reduces false positives at protocol borders and is
applicable in a PACS (DICOM C-FIND/C-MOVE, DICOMweb QIDO/WADO). We publish a
model card and deployment guide, complete with both de-identification and bias
audits.

Conclusion: 奖励驱动的优化方法有效提升了基础模型在特定领域的适应性和性能，为实时分割任务提供了可行解决方案

Abstract: Image segmentation is a critical task in microscopy, essential for accurately
analyzing and interpreting complex visual data. This task can be performed
using custom models trained on domain-specific datasets, transfer learning from
pre-trained models, or foundational models that offer broad applicability.
However, foundational models often present a considerable number of
non-transparent tuning parameters that require extensive manual optimization,
limiting their usability for real-time streaming data analysis. Here, we
introduce a reward function-based optimization to fine-tune foundational models
and illustrate this approach for SAM (Segment Anything Model) framework by
Meta. The reward functions can be constructed to represent the physics of the
imaged system, including particle size distributions, geometries, and other
criteria. By integrating a reward-driven optimization framework, we enhance
SAM's adaptability and performance, leading to an optimized variant, SAM$^{*}$,
that better aligns with the requirements of diverse segmentation tasks and
particularly allows for real-time streaming data segmentation. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of this approach in microscopy imaging, where precise
segmentation is crucial for analyzing cellular structures, material interfaces,
and nanoscale features.

Conclusion: 通过利用注意力矩阵的结构化特性和借鉴大语言模型的进展，提出的块稀疏注意力机制有效解决了多视图重建中的计算效率问题

Abstract: Efficient and accurate feed-forward multi-view reconstruction has long been
an important task in computer vision. Recent transformer-based models like VGGT
and $\pi^3$ have achieved impressive results with simple architectures, yet
they face an inherent runtime bottleneck, due to the quadratic complexity of
the global attention layers, that limits the scalability to large image sets.
In this paper, we empirically analyze the global attention matrix of these
models and observe that probability mass concentrates on a small subset of
patch-patch interactions that correspond to cross-view geometric matches.
Motivated by the structured attention and inspired by recent advancement in
large language models, we propose a replacement for the dense global attention
operation based on highly optimized block-sparse kernels, yielding up to
$4\times$ faster inference with comparable task performance. Our retrofit
requires no retraining of the backbone, extends to both VGGT and $\pi^3$, and
supports large image collections. Evaluations on a comprehensive suite of
multi-view benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Data scarcity hinders deep learning for medical imaging. We propose a

DPM-based augmentation is shown to be superior to both traditional methods and

from U-Net segmented tumors. An XGBoost classifier trained on these fused
features achieves 98.0\% accuracy and 98.1\% sensitivity. Ablation studies and

Method: 提出DEPF检测器，包含双域增强模块(DDE)和优先级引导Mamba融合模块(PGMF)。DDE使用跨尺度小波Mamba增强全局亮度，傅里叶细节恢复块增强纹理细节；PGMF引入优先级扫描概念，根据模态差异的优先级分数从局部目标特征开始扫描

Result: 在DroneVehicle和VEDAI数据集上的实验表明，DEPF在目标检测方面表现优异，优于最先进的方法

Conclusion: 基于Mamba线性复杂度的DEPF方法有效解决了无人机多光谱目标检测的关键挑战，在保持计算效率的同时提升了检测性能

Abstract: Multispectral remote sensing object detection is one of the important
application of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). However, it faces three
challenges. Firstly, the low-light remote sensing images reduce the
complementarity during multi-modality fusion. Secondly, the local small target
modeling is interfered with redundant information in the fusion stage easily.
Thirdly, due to the quadratic computational complexity, it is hard to apply the
transformer-based methods on the UAV platform. To address these limitations,
motivated by Mamba with linear complexity, a UAV multispectral object detector
with dual-domain enhancement and priority-guided mamba fusion (DEPF) is
proposed. Firstly, to enhance low-light remote sensing images, Dual-Domain
Enhancement Module (DDE) is designed, which contains Cross-Scale Wavelet Mamba
(CSWM) and Fourier Details Recovery block (FDR). CSWM applies cross-scale mamba
scanning for the low-frequency components to enhance the global brightness of
images, while FDR constructs spectrum recovery network to enhance the frequency
spectra features for recovering the texture-details. Secondly, to enhance local
target modeling and reduce the impact of redundant information during fusion,
Priority-Guided Mamba Fusion Module (PGMF) is designed. PGMF introduces the
concept of priority scanning, which starts from local targets features
according to the priority scores obtained from modality difference. Experiments
on DroneVehicle dataset and VEDAI dataset reports that, DEPF performs well on
object detection, comparing with state-of-the-art methods. Our code is

Motivation: 现有解析图方法主要关注单模态建模，忽略了多模态融合的潜力。语言可以提供丰富的空间关系先验，但现有的全局特征融合方法会削弱遮挡区域响应并导致对齐和定位失败

Method: 提出PGVL框架，包含引导模块(GM)。低层节点关注局部特征保持遮挡区域响应，高层节点整合全局特征推断遮挡部分。采用自上而下分解和自下而上组合，构建模态特定解析图，使用递归双向交叉注意力并通过GM净化

Result: 在主要姿态估计数据集上验证了PGVL和网络的有效性

Conclusion: PGVL通过有效的视觉-语言交互和多层次特征融合，解决了遮挡场景下的人体姿态估计问题

Abstract: Parse graphs boost human pose estimation (HPE) by integrating context and
hierarchies, yet prior work mostly focuses on single modality modeling,
ignoring the potential of multimodal fusion. Notably, language offers rich HPE
priors like spatial relations for occluded scenes, but existing visual-language
fusion via global feature integration weakens occluded region responses and
causes alignment and location failures. To address this issue, we propose Parse
Graph-based Visual-Language interaction (PGVL) with a core novel Guided Module
(GM). In PGVL, low-level nodes focus on local features, maximizing the
maintenance of responses in occluded areas and high-level nodes integrate
global features to infer occluded or invisible parts. GM enables high semantic
nodes to guide the feature update of low semantic nodes that have undergone
cross attention. It ensuring effective fusion of diverse information. PGVL
includes top-down decomposition and bottom-up composition. In the first stage,
modality specific parse graphs are constructed. Next stage. recursive
bidirectional cross-attention is used, purified by GM. We also design network
based on PGVL. The PGVL and our network is validated on major pose estimation
datasets. We will release the code soon.

Abstract: Cross-View Geo-Localization (CVGL) focuses on identifying correspondences
between images captured from distinct perspectives of the same geographical
location. However, existing CVGL approaches are typically restricted to a
single view or modality, and their direct visual matching strategy lacks
interpretability: they merely predict whether two images correspond, without
explaining the rationale behind the match. In this paper, we present GLEAM-C, a
foundational CVGL model that unifies multiple views and modalities-including
UAV imagery, street maps, panoramic views, and ground photographs-by aligning
them exclusively with satellite imagery. Our framework enhances training
efficiency through optimized implementation while achieving accuracy comparable
to prior modality-specific CVGL models through a two-phase training strategy.
Moreover, to address the lack of interpretability in traditional CVGL methods,
we leverage the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) to propose a new task, GLEAM-X, which combines cross-view
correspondence prediction with explainable reasoning. To support this task, we
construct a bilingual benchmark using GPT-4o and Doubao-1.5-Thinking-Vision-Pro
to generate training and testing data. The test set is further refined through
detailed human revision, enabling systematic evaluation of explainable
cross-view reasoning and advancing transparency and scalability in
geo-localization. Together, GLEAM-C and GLEAM-X form a comprehensive CVGL
pipeline that integrates multi-modal, multi-view alignment with interpretable
correspondence analysis, unifying accurate cross-view matching with explainable
reasoning and advancing Geo-Localization by enabling models to better Explain
And Match. Code and datasets used in this work will be made publicly accessible

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing
significant security threats to their deployment in remote sensing
applications. Research on adversarial attacks not only reveals model
vulnerabilities but also provides critical insights for enhancing robustness.
Although current mixing-based strategies have been proposed to increase the
transferability of adversarial examples, they either perform global blending or
directly exchange a region in the images, which may destroy global semantic
features and mislead the optimization of adversarial examples. Furthermore,
their reliance on cross-entropy loss for perturbation optimization leads to
gradient diminishing during iterative updates, compromising adversarial example
quality. To address these limitations, we focus on non-targeted attacks and
propose a novel framework via local mixing and logits optimization. First, we
present a local mixing strategy to generate diverse yet semantically consistent
inputs. Different from MixUp, which globally blends two images, and MixCut,
which stitches images together, our method merely blends local regions to
preserve global semantic information. Second, we adapt the logit loss from
targeted attacks to non-targeted scenarios, mitigating the gradient vanishing
problem of cross-entropy loss. Third, a perturbation smoothing loss is applied
to suppress high-frequency noise and enhance transferability. Extensive
experiments on FGSCR-42 and MTARSI datasets demonstrate superior performance
over 12 state-of-the-art methods across 6 surrogate models. Notably, with
ResNet as the surrogate on MTARSI, our method achieves a 17.28% average
improvement in black-box attack success rate.

Abstract: Spatial conditioning in pretrained text-to-image diffusion models has
significantly improved fine-grained control over the structure of generated
images. However, existing control adapters exhibit limited adaptability and
incur high training costs when encountering novel spatial control conditions
that differ substantially from the training tasks. To address this limitation,
we propose Universal Few-Shot Control (UFC), a versatile few-shot control
adapter capable of generalizing to novel spatial conditions. Given a few
image-condition pairs of an unseen task and a query condition, UFC leverages
the analogy between query and support conditions to construct task-specific
control features, instantiated by a matching mechanism and an update on a small
set of task-specific parameters. Experiments on six novel spatial control tasks
show that UFC, fine-tuned with only 30 annotated examples of novel tasks,
achieves fine-grained control consistent with the spatial conditions. Notably,
when fine-tuned with 0.1% of the full training data, UFC achieves competitive
performance with the fully supervised baselines in various control tasks. We
also show that UFC is applicable agnostically to various diffusion backbones
and demonstrate its effectiveness on both UNet and DiT architectures. Code is

effective masking strategy. Leveraging Hounsfield Unit (HU) measurements, we
implement an HU-based Foreground Masking, which focuses on the intensity
distribution of visceral organs and excludes non-tissue regions, such as air
and fluid, that lack diagnostically meaningful features. Extensive experiments
on five public 3D medical imaging datasets demonstrate that our masking
consistently improves performance, both in quality of segmentation and Dice
score (BTCV:~84.64\%, Flare22:~92.43\%, MM-WHS:~90.67\%, Amos22:~88.64\%,
BraTS:~78.55\%). These results underscore the importance of domain-centric MIM
and suggest a promising direction for representation learning in medical image
segmentation. Implementation is available at github.com/AISeedHub/SubFore/.

Abstract: Document images encapsulate a wealth of knowledge, while the portability of
spoken queries enables broader and flexible application scenarios. Yet, no
prior work has explored knowledge base question answering over visual document
images with queries provided directly in speech. We propose TextlessRAG, the
first end-to-end framework for speech-based question answering over large-scale
document images. Unlike prior methods, TextlessRAG eliminates ASR, TTS and OCR,
directly interpreting speech, retrieving relevant visual knowledge, and
generating answers in a fully textless pipeline. To further boost performance,
we integrate a layout-aware reranking mechanism to refine retrieval.
Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in both efficiency and
accuracy. To advance research in this direction, we also release the first
bilingual speech--document RAG dataset, featuring Chinese and English voice
queries paired with multimodal document content. Both the dataset and our
pipeline will be made available at

Motivation: 解决深度学习黑盒模型在高风险应用中缺乏可信度和可问责性的问题，特别是在3D形状识别任务中需要透明决策过程的需求。

Method: 使用Class Node Graph Attention Network (CGAT)架构，结合图注意力卷积和注意力机制，可视化注意力分布来解释决策过程。评估了局部平均曲率和质心距离等节点特征的不同组合。

Result: 结合局部平均曲率和质心距离作为节点特征获得了0.76加权F1分数，产生了更全面的注意力可视化效果。包含指向全局CLS节点的有向边能产生更直观的注意力图。

Conclusion: CGAT架构能够生成人类可理解的注意力图，增强模型可信度并促进专家验证。虽然应用于牙科数据，但可广泛适用于基于图的分类和回归任务。

Abstract: Deep learning offers a promising avenue for automating many recognition tasks
in fields such as medicine and forensics. However, the black-box nature of
these models hinders their adoption in high-stakes applications where trust and
accountability are required. For 3D shape recognition tasks in particular, this
paper introduces the Class Node Graph Attention Network (CGAT) architecture to
address this need. Applied to 3D meshes of third molars derived from CBCT
images, for Demirjian stage allocation, CGAT utilizes graph attention
convolutions and an inherent attention mechanism, visualized via attention
rollout, to explain its decision-making process. We evaluated the local mean
curvature and distance to centroid node features, both individually and in
combination, as well as model depth, finding that models incorporating directed
edges to a global CLS node produced more intuitive attention maps, while also
yielding desirable classification performance. We analyzed the attention-based
explanations of the models, and their predictive performances to propose
optimal settings for the CGAT. The combination of local mean curvature and
distance to centroid as node features yielded a slight performance increase
with 0.76 weighted F1 score, and more comprehensive attention visualizations.
The CGAT architecture's ability to generate human-understandable attention maps
can enhance trust and facilitate expert validation of model decisions. While
demonstrated on dental data, CGAT is broadly applicable to graph-based
classification and regression tasks, promoting wider adoption of transparent
and competitive deep learning models in high-stakes environments.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了标注数据依赖和可解释性不足的问题，具有很好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Deep learning has shown significant potential in diagnosing neurodegenerative
diseases from MRI data. However, most existing methods rely heavily on large
volumes of labeled data and often yield representations that lack
interpretability. To address both challenges, we propose a novel
self-supervised cross-encoder framework that leverages the temporal continuity
in longitudinal MRI scans for supervision. This framework disentangles learned
representations into two components: a static representation, constrained by
contrastive learning, which captures stable anatomical features; and a dynamic
representation, guided by input-gradient regularization, which reflects
temporal changes and can be effectively fine-tuned for downstream
classification tasks. Experimental results on the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that our method achieves
superior classification accuracy and improved interpretability. Furthermore,
the learned representations exhibit strong zero-shot generalization on the Open
Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset and cross-task generalization
on the Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) dataset. The code for the
proposed method will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 现有潜在扩散模型的语义水印技术虽然能抵抗再生攻击，但由于频率完整性损失导致检测性能下降，需要解决这一根本问题。

Method: 提出Hermitian对称傅里叶水印(SFW)方法，通过强制Hermitian对称性保持频率完整性；引入中心感知嵌入策略确保裁剪攻击下的信息保留；改进现有语义水印方案的频域结构。

Result: 在各种攻击场景下实现了最先进的验证和识别性能，在保持优异图像保真度(FID和CLIP分数)的同时获得最高检测准确率。

Conclusion: SFW是一个有效平衡鲁棒性和图像保真度的框架，解决了语义水印中的固有权衡问题。

Abstract: Semantic watermarking techniques for latent diffusion models (LDMs) are
robust against regeneration attacks, but often suffer from detection
performance degradation due to the loss of frequency integrity. To tackle this
problem, we propose a novel embedding method called Hermitian Symmetric Fourier
Watermarking (SFW), which maintains frequency integrity by enforcing Hermitian
symmetry. Additionally, we introduce a center-aware embedding strategy that
reduces the vulnerability of semantic watermarking due to cropping attacks by
ensuring robust information retention. To validate our approach, we apply these
techniques to existing semantic watermarking schemes, enhancing their
frequency-domain structures for better robustness and retrieval accuracy.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve state-of-the-art
verification and identification performance, surpassing previous approaches
across various attack scenarios. Ablation studies confirm the impact of SFW on
detection capabilities, the effectiveness of the center-aware embedding against
cropping, and how message capacity influences identification accuracy. Notably,
our method achieves the highest detection accuracy while maintaining superior
image fidelity, as evidenced by FID and CLIP scores. Conclusively, our proposed
SFW is shown to be an effective framework for balancing robustness and image
fidelity, addressing the inherent trade-offs in semantic watermarking. Code

Abstract: Small moving target detection is crucial for many defense applications but
remains highly challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratios, ambiguous visual
cues, and cluttered backgrounds. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning
framework that differs fundamentally from existing approaches, which often rely
on target-specific features or motion cues and tend to lack robustness in
complex environments. Our key insight is that small target detection and
background discrimination are inherently coupled, even cluttered video
backgrounds often exhibit strong low-rank structures that can serve as stable
priors for detection. We reformulate the task as a tensor-based low-rank and
sparse decomposition problem and conduct a theoretical analysis of the
background, target, and noise components to guide model design. Building on
these insights, we introduce TenRPCANet, a deep neural network that requires
minimal assumptions about target characteristics. Specifically, we propose a
tokenization strategy that implicitly enforces multi-order tensor low-rank
priors through a self-attention mechanism. This mechanism captures both local
and non-local self-similarity to model the low-rank background without relying
on explicit iterative optimization. In addition, inspired by the sparse
component update in tensor RPCA, we design a feature refinement module to
enhance target saliency. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on two highly distinct and challenging tasks: multi-frame infrared
small target detection and space object detection. These results demonstrate
both the effectiveness and the generalizability of our approach.

Abstract: As local AI grows in popularity, there is a critical gap between the
benchmark performance of object detectors and their practical viability on
consumer-grade hardware. While models like YOLOv10s promise real-time speeds,
these metrics are typically achieved on high-power, desktop-class GPUs. This
paper reveals that on resource-constrained systems, such as laptops with RTX
4060 GPUs, performance is not compute-bound but is instead dominated by
system-level bottlenecks, as illustrated by a simple bottleneck test. To
overcome this hardware-level constraint, we introduce a Two-Pass Adaptive
Inference algorithm, a model-independent approach that requires no
architectural changes. This study mainly focuses on adaptive inference
strategies and undertakes a comparative analysis of architectural early-exit
and resolution-adaptive routing, highlighting their respective trade-offs
within a unified evaluation framework. The system uses a fast, low-resolution
pass and only escalates to a high-resolution model pass when detection
confidence is low. On a 5000-image COCO dataset, our method achieves a 1.85x
speedup over a PyTorch Early-Exit baseline, with a modest mAP loss of 5.51%.
This work provides a practical and reproducible blueprint for deploying
high-performance, real-time AI on consumer-grade devices by shifting the focus

Abstract: Joint reconstruction of human-object interaction marks a significant
milestone in comprehending the intricate interrelations between humans and
their surrounding environment. Nevertheless, previous optimization methods
often struggle to achieve physically plausible reconstruction results due to
the lack of prior knowledge about human-object interactions. In this paper, we
introduce ScoreHOI, an effective diffusion-based optimizer that introduces
diffusion priors for the precise recovery of human-object interactions. By
harnessing the controllability within score-guided sampling, the diffusion
model can reconstruct a conditional distribution of human and object pose given
the image observation and object feature. During inference, the ScoreHOI
effectively improves the reconstruction results by guiding the denoising
process with specific physical constraints. Furthermore, we propose a
contact-driven iterative refinement approach to enhance the contact
plausibility and improve the reconstruction accuracy. Extensive evaluations on
standard benchmarks demonstrate ScoreHOI's superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its ability to achieve a precise and
robust improvement in joint human-object interaction reconstruction.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a dominant novel-view synthesis
technique, but its high memory consumption severely limits its applicability on
edge devices. A growing number of 3DGS compression methods have been proposed
to make 3DGS more efficient, yet most only focus on storage compression and
fail to address the critical bottleneck of rendering memory. To address this
problem, we introduce MEGS$^{2}$, a novel memory-efficient framework that
tackles this challenge by jointly optimizing two key factors: the total
primitive number and the parameters per primitive, achieving unprecedented
memory compression. Specifically, we replace the memory-intensive spherical
harmonics with lightweight arbitrarily-oriented spherical Gaussian lobes as our
color representations. More importantly, we propose a unified soft pruning
framework that models primitive-number and lobe-number pruning as a single
constrained optimization problem. Experiments show that MEGS$^{2}$ achieves a
50% static VRAM reduction and a 40% rendering VRAM reduction compared to
existing methods, while maintaining comparable rendering quality.

Conclusion: 融合全局语义和局部精度的双提示双分支多模态设计能产生准确的乳腺超声分割掩码，提高对小病灶和低对比度病灶的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Background: Precise breast ultrasound (BUS) segmentation supports reliable
measurement, quantitative analysis, and downstream classification, yet remains
difficult for small or low-contrast lesions with fuzzy margins and speckle
noise. Text prompts can add clinical context, but directly applying weakly
localized text-image cues (e.g., CAM/CLIP-derived signals) tends to produce
coarse, blob-like responses that smear boundaries unless additional mechanisms
recover fine edges. Methods: We propose XBusNet, a novel dual-prompt,
dual-branch multimodal model that combines image features with clinically
grounded text. A global pathway based on a CLIP Vision Transformer encodes
whole-image semantics conditioned on lesion size and location, while a local
U-Net pathway emphasizes precise boundaries and is modulated by prompts that
describe shape, margin, and Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS)
terms. Prompts are assembled automatically from structured metadata, requiring
no manual clicks. We evaluate on the Breast Lesions USG (BLU) dataset using
five-fold cross-validation. Primary metrics are Dice and Intersection over
Union (IoU); we also conduct size-stratified analyses and ablations to assess
the roles of the global and local paths and the text-driven modulation.
Results: XBusNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on BLU, with mean Dice
of 0.8765 and IoU of 0.8149, outperforming six strong baselines. Small lesions
show the largest gains, with fewer missed regions and fewer spurious
activations. Ablation studies show complementary contributions of global
context, local boundary modeling, and prompt-based modulation. Conclusions: A
dual-prompt, dual-branch multimodal design that merges global semantics with
local precision yields accurate BUS segmentation masks and improves robustness
for small, low-contrast lesions.

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have proven to be highly effective for
skeleton-based action recognition, primarily due to their ability to leverage
graph topology for feature aggregation, a key factor in extracting meaningful
representations. However, despite their success, GCNs often struggle to
effectively distinguish between ambiguous actions, revealing limitations in the
representation of learned topological and spatial features. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel approach, Gaussian Topology Refinement Gated
Graph Convolution (G$^{3}$CN), to address the challenge of distinguishing
ambiguous actions in skeleton-based action recognition. G$^{3}$CN incorporates
a Gaussian filter to refine the skeleton topology graph, improving the
representation of ambiguous actions. Additionally, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)
are integrated into the GCN framework to enhance information propagation
between skeleton points. Our method shows strong generalization across various

Abstract: The labor- and experience-intensive creation of 3D assets with physically
based rendering (PBR) materials demands an autonomous 3D asset creation
pipeline. However, most existing 3D generation methods focus on geometry
modeling, either baking textures into simple vertex colors or leaving texture
synthesis to post-processing with image diffusion models. To achieve end-to-end
PBR-ready 3D asset generation, we present Lightweight Gaussian Asset Adapter
(LGAA), a novel framework that unifies the modeling of geometry and PBR
materials by exploiting multi-view (MV) diffusion priors from a novel
perspective. The LGAA features a modular design with three components.
Specifically, the LGAA Wrapper reuses and adapts network layers from MV
diffusion models, which encapsulate knowledge acquired from billions of images,
enabling better convergence in a data-efficient manner. To incorporate multiple
diffusion priors for geometry and PBR synthesis, the LGAA Switcher aligns
multiple LGAA Wrapper layers encapsulating different knowledge. Then, a tamed
variational autoencoder (VAE), termed LGAA Decoder, is designed to predict 2D
Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) with PBR channels. Finally, we introduce a dedicated
post-processing procedure to effectively extract high-quality, relightable mesh
assets from the resulting 2DGS. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of LGAA with both text-and
image-conditioned MV diffusion models. Additionally, the modular design enables
flexible incorporation of multiple diffusion priors, and the
knowledge-preserving scheme leads to efficient convergence trained on merely
69k multi-view instances. Our code, pre-trained weights, and the dataset used
will be publicly available via our project page:

Abstract: Vector graphics, known for their scalability and user-friendliness, provide a
unique approach to visual content compared to traditional pixel-based images.
Animation of these graphics, driven by the motion of their elements, offers
enhanced comprehensibility and controllability but often requires substantial
manual effort. To automate this process, we propose a novel method that
integrates implicit neural representations with text-to-video diffusion models
for vector graphic animation. Our approach employs layered implicit neural
representations to reconstruct vector graphics, preserving their inherent
properties such as infinite resolution and precise color and shape constraints,
which effectively bridges the large domain gap between vector graphics and
diffusion models. The neural representations are then optimized using video
score distillation sampling, which leverages motion priors from pretrained
text-to-video diffusion models. Finally, the vector graphics are warped to
match the representations resulting in smooth animation. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness of our method in generating vivid and natural vector
graphic animations, demonstrating significant improvement over existing

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅在渲染方面表现出色，但由于表示的无结构性和缺乏显式几何监督，实现准确完整的表面重建仍然具有挑战性

Method: 为每个高斯关联可学习的SDF值，将SDF学习直接嵌入3DGS流程；设计几何引导的网格增长策略，在多尺度层次结构下自适应分布高斯

Result: 在DTU、Mip-NeRF 360和Tanks&Temples等标准基准测试中，DiGS一致提高了重建精度和完整性，同时保持了高渲染保真度

Conclusion: DiGS通过整合SDF学习到3DGS中，成功实现了更好的几何一致性和表面重建质量

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for
photorealistic view synthesis, representing scenes with spatially distributed
Gaussian primitives. While highly effective for rendering, achieving accurate
and complete surface reconstruction remains challenging due to the unstructured
nature of the representation and the absence of explicit geometric supervision.
In this work, we propose DiGS, a unified framework that embeds Signed Distance
Field (SDF) learning directly into the 3DGS pipeline, thereby enforcing strong
and interpretable surface priors. By associating each Gaussian with a learnable
SDF value, DiGS explicitly aligns primitives with underlying geometry and
improves cross-view consistency. To further ensure dense and coherent coverage,
we design a geometry-guided grid growth strategy that adaptively distributes
Gaussians along geometry-consistent regions under a multi-scale hierarchy.
Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including DTU, Mip-NeRF 360, and
Tanks& Temples, demonstrate that DiGS consistently improves reconstruction
accuracy and completeness while retaining high rendering fidelity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D数据标注成本高昂，现有弱监督方法仅依赖2D框标注存在投影模糊和部分可见性问题，需要利用时序多视图信息来解决这些挑战

Method: 提出MVAT框架：1)跨时间聚合目标中心点云构建完整3D表示；2)采用师生蒸馏范式，教师网络从单视图学习但目标来自时序聚合的静态对象；3)引入多视图2D投影损失确保3D框与所有可用2D标注的一致性

Result: 在nuScenes和Waymo Open数据集上达到弱监督3D目标检测的最先进性能，显著缩小与全监督方法的差距，且无需任何3D框标注

Conclusion: MVAT通过有效利用时序多视图信息解决了弱监督3D检测的关键挑战，为降低3D标注成本提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Annotating 3D data remains a costly bottleneck for 3D object detection,
motivating the development of weakly supervised annotation methods that rely on
more accessible 2D box annotations. However, relying solely on 2D boxes
introduces projection ambiguities since a single 2D box can correspond to
multiple valid 3D poses. Furthermore, partial object visibility under a single
viewpoint setting makes accurate 3D box estimation difficult. We propose MVAT,
a novel framework that leverages temporal multi-view present in sequential data
to address these challenges. Our approach aggregates object-centric point
clouds across time to build 3D object representations as dense and complete as
possible. A Teacher-Student distillation paradigm is employed: The Teacher
network learns from single viewpoints but targets are derived from temporally
aggregated static objects. Then the Teacher generates high quality
pseudo-labels that the Student learns to predict from a single viewpoint for
both static and moving objects. The whole framework incorporates a multi-view
2D projection loss to enforce consistency between predicted 3D boxes and all
available 2D annotations. Experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open datasets
demonstrate that MVAT achieves state-of-the-art performance for weakly
supervised 3D object detection, significantly narrowing the gap with fully
supervised methods without requiring any 3D box annotations. % \footnote{Code

Conclusion: 该方法在保持较低计算成本的同时实现了更好的性能，并在多个数据集上展现出强大的泛化能力

Abstract: Previous deep image registration methods that employ single homography,
multi-grid homography, or thin-plate spline often struggle with real scenes
containing depth disparities due to their inherent limitations. To address
this, we propose an Exponential-Decay Free-Form Deformation Network (EDFFDNet),
which employs free-form deformation with an exponential-decay basis function.
This design achieves higher efficiency and performs well in scenes with depth
disparities, benefiting from its inherent locality. We also introduce an
Adaptive Sparse Motion Aggregator (ASMA), which replaces the MLP motion
aggregator used in previous methods. By transforming dense interactions into
sparse ones, ASMA reduces parameters and improves accuracy. Additionally, we
propose a progressive correlation refinement strategy that leverages
global-local correlation patterns for coarse-to-fine motion estimation, further
enhancing efficiency and accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that EDFFDNet
reduces parameters, memory, and total runtime by 70.5%, 32.6%, and 33.7%,
respectively, while achieving a 0.5 dB PSNR gain over the state-of-the-art
method. With an additional local refinement stage,EDFFDNet-2 further improves
PSNR by 1.06 dB while maintaining lower computational costs. Our method also
demonstrates strong generalization ability across datasets, outperforming
previous deep learning methods.

Motivation: 传统图像压缩方法使用单一熵模型无法有效捕捉不同语义区域的统计特性，限制了压缩性能

Method: 利用语义分割识别图像不同区域，为每个语义区域分配专用熵模型，使用多通道离散逻辑混合似然建模像素值分布

Result: 在基准数据集上实现了最先进的压缩比，同时仅引入最小的编码和解码延迟，支持基于分割掩码的感兴趣区域编码

Conclusion: SEEC框架通过语义分割指导的多熵模型选择，显著提升了无损图像压缩的性能

Abstract: Recently, learned image compression has attracted considerable attention due
to its superior performance over traditional methods. However, most existing
approaches employ a single entropy model to estimate the probability
distribution of pixel values across the entire image, which limits their
ability to capture the diverse statistical characteristics of different
semantic regions. To overcome this limitation, we propose Segmentation-Assisted
Multi-Entropy Models for Lossless Image Compression (SEEC). Our framework
utilizes semantic segmentation to guide the selection and adaptation of
multiple entropy models, enabling more accurate probability distribution
estimation for distinct semantic regions. Specifically, SEEC first extracts
image features and then applies semantic segmentation to identify different
regions, each assigned a specialized entropy model to better capture its unique
statistical properties. Finally, a multi-channel discrete logistic mixture
likelihood is employed to model the pixel value distributions effectively.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEEC achieves
state-of-the-art compression ratios while introducing only minimal encoding and
decoding latency. With superior performance, the proposed model also supports
Regions of Interest (ROIs) coding condition on the provided segmentation mask.

Conclusion: 该方法在保持或提升超分辨率质量的同时显著加速了重建过程，为医学图像处理提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Acquiring images in high resolution is often a challenging task. Especially
in the medical sector, image quality has to be balanced with acquisition time
and patient comfort. To strike a compromise between scan time and quality for
Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging, two anisotropic scans with different
low-resolution (LR) orientations can be acquired. Typically, LR scans are
analyzed individually by radiologists, which is time consuming and can lead to
inaccurate interpretation. To tackle this, we propose a novel approach for
fusing two orthogonal anisotropic LR MR images to reconstruct anatomical
details in a unified representation. Our multi-view neural network is trained
in a self-supervised manner, without requiring corresponding high-resolution
(HR) data. To optimize the model, we introduce a sparse coordinate-based loss,
enabling the integration of LR images with arbitrary scaling. We evaluate our
method on MR images from two independent cohorts. Our results demonstrate
comparable or even improved super-resolution (SR) performance compared to
state-of-the-art (SOTA) self-supervised SR methods for different upsampling
scales. By combining a patient-agnostic offline and a patient-specific online
phase, we achieve a substantial speed-up of up to ten times for
patient-specific reconstruction while achieving similar or better SR quality.

Conclusion: 通过建立对象级相关性而非图像级相关性，OCNet能够有效挖掘查询目标特征并抑制硬像素噪声，在少样本语义分割任务中表现优异

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) aims to segment objects of novel
categories in the query images given only a few annotated support samples.
Existing methods primarily build the image-level correlation between the
support target object and the entire query image. However, this correlation
contains the hard pixel noise, \textit{i.e.}, irrelevant background objects,
that is intractable to trace and suppress, leading to the overfitting of the
background. To address the limitation of this correlation, we imitate the
biological vision process to identify novel objects in the object-level
information. Target identification in the general objects is more valid than in
the entire image, especially in the low-data regime. Inspired by this, we
design an Object-level Correlation Network (OCNet) by establishing the
object-level correlation between the support target object and query general
objects, which is mainly composed of the General Object Mining Module (GOMM)
and Correlation Construction Module (CCM). Specifically, GOMM constructs the
query general object feature by learning saliency and high-level similarity
cues, where the general objects include the irrelevant background objects and
the target foreground object. Then, CCM establishes the object-level
correlation by allocating the target prototypes to match the general object
feature. The generated object-level correlation can mine the query target
feature and suppress the hard pixel noise for the final prediction. Extensive
experiments on PASCAL-${5}^{i}$ and COCO-${20}^{i}$ show that our model
achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

pre-training a vision transformer with many cloud particle images, we learn
robust representations of crystal morphology, which can be used for various

subsequently constrain their role in Earth's climate system.

Abstract: Face enhancement techniques are widely used to enhance facial appearance.
However, they can inadvertently distort biometric features, leading to
significant decrease in the accuracy of deepfake detectors. This study
hypothesizes that these techniques, while improving perceptual quality, can
degrade the performance of deepfake detectors. To investigate this, we
systematically evaluate whether commonly used face enhancement methods can
serve an anti-forensic role by reducing detection accuracy. We use both
traditional image processing methods and advanced GAN-based enhancements to
evaluate the robustness of deepfake detectors. We provide a comprehensive
analysis of the effectiveness of these enhancement techniques, focusing on
their impact on Na\"ive, Spatial, and Frequency-based detection methods.
Furthermore, we conduct adversarial training experiments to assess whether
exposure to face enhancement transformations improves model robustness.
Experiments conducted on the FaceForensics++, DeepFakeDetection, and CelebDF-v2
datasets indicate that even basic enhancement filters can significantly reduce
detection accuracy achieving ASR up to 64.63\%. In contrast, GAN-based
techniques further exploit these vulnerabilities, achieving ASR up to 75.12\%.
Our results demonstrate that face enhancement methods can effectively function
as anti-forensic tools, emphasizing the need for more resilient and adaptive

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled the creation of highly realistic 3D
scene representations from sets of multi-view images. However, inpainting
missing regions, whether due to occlusion or scene editing, remains a

consistency-aware refinement scheme that selectively identifies and corrects
inconsistent regions without disrupting the rest of the scene. Evaluations on

Abstract: Owing to the inherently dynamic and complex characteristics of cardiac
magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, high-quality and diverse k-space data are
rarely available in practice, which in turn hampers robust reconstruction of
dynamic cardiac MRI. To address this challenge, we perform feature-level
learning directly in the frequency domain and employ a temporal-fusion strategy
as the generative guidance to synthesize k-space data. Specifically, leveraging
the global representation capacity of the Fourier transform, the frequency
domain can be considered a natural global feature space. Therefore, unlike
traditional methods that use pixel-level convolution for feature learning and
modeling in the image domain, this letter focuses on feature-level modeling in
the frequency domain, enabling stable and rich generation even with ultra
low-data regimes. Moreover, leveraging the advantages of feature-level modeling
in the frequency domain, we integrate k-space data across time frames with
multiple fusion strategies to steer and further optimize the generative
trajectory. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method possesses
strong generative ability in low-data regimes, indicating practical potential
to alleviate data scarcity in dynamic MRI reconstruction.

drift, while evading heuristic checks. In this paper, we study this threat and

proposed model is trained on attack-free sessions to learn temporal
regularities of motion to detect runtime deviations and initiate recovery to
restore pose consistency. We evaluate the approach in a realistic offloaded-VIO

Experimental results in terms of well-known performance metrics show
substantial reductions in trajectory and pose error compared to a no-defense

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) and its derived en-face
projections provide high-resolution visualization of the retinal and choroidal
vasculature, which is critical for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of retinal
diseases. However, acquiring high-quality OCTA images is challenging due to
motion sensitivity and the high costs associated with software modifications
for conventional OCT devices. Moreover, current deep learning methods for
OCT-to-OCTA translation often overlook the vascular differences across retinal
layers and struggle to reconstruct the intricate, dense vascular details
necessary for reliable diagnosis. To overcome these limitations, we propose
XOCT, a novel deep learning framework that integrates Cross-Dimensional
Supervision (CDS) with a Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MSFF) network for
layer-aware vascular reconstruction. Our CDS module leverages 2D layer-wise
en-face projections, generated via segmentation-weighted z-axis averaging, as
supervisory signals to compel the network to learn distinct representations for
each retinal layer through fine-grained, targeted guidance. Meanwhile, the MSFF
module enhances vessel delineation through multi-scale feature extraction
combined with a channel reweighting strategy, effectively capturing vascular
details at multiple spatial scales. Our experiments on the OCTA-500 dataset
demonstrate XOCT's improvements, especially for the en-face projections which
are significant for clinical evaluation of retinal pathologies, underscoring
its potential to enhance OCTA accessibility, reliability, and diagnostic value
for ophthalmic disease detection and monitoring. The code is available at

Conclusion: EHWGesture可作为推进多模态临床手势理解的综合基准数据集

Abstract: Hand gesture understanding is essential for several applications in
human-computer interaction, including automatic clinical assessment of hand
dexterity. While deep learning has advanced static gesture recognition, dynamic
gesture understanding remains challenging due to complex spatiotemporal
variations. Moreover, existing datasets often lack multimodal and multi-view
diversity, precise ground-truth tracking, and an action quality component
embedded within gestures. This paper introduces EHWGesture, a multimodal video
dataset for gesture understanding featuring five clinically relevant gestures.
It includes over 1,100 recordings (6 hours), captured from 25 healthy subjects
using two high-resolution RGB-Depth cameras and an event camera. A motion
capture system provides precise ground-truth hand landmark tracking, and all
devices are spatially calibrated and synchronized to ensure cross-modal
alignment. Moreover, to embed an action quality task within gesture
understanding, collected recordings are organized in classes of execution speed
that mirror clinical evaluations of hand dexterity. Baseline experiments
highlight the dataset's potential for gesture classification, gesture trigger
detection, and action quality assessment. Thus, EHWGesture can serve as a
comprehensive benchmark for advancing multimodal clinical gesture
understanding.

Conclusion: 该框架为单图像3D头重建提供了一种高效的前向传播解决方案，在合成数据上训练取得了良好效果

Abstract: We present a feed-forward framework for Gaussian full-head synthesis from a
single unposed image. Unlike previous work that relies on time-consuming GAN
inversion and test-time optimization, our framework can reconstruct the
Gaussian full-head model given a single unposed image in a single forward pass.
This enables fast reconstruction and rendering during inference. To mitigate
the lack of large-scale 3D head assets, we propose a large-scale synthetic
dataset from trained 3D GANs and train our framework using only synthetic data.
For efficient high-fidelity generation, we introduce a coarse-to-fine Gaussian
head generation pipeline, where sparse points from the FLAME model interact
with the image features by transformer blocks for feature extraction and coarse
shape reconstruction, which are then densified for high-fidelity
reconstruction. To fully leverage the prior knowledge residing in pretrained 3D
GANs for effective reconstruction, we propose a dual-branch framework that
effectively aggregates the structured spherical triplane feature and
unstructured point-based features for more effective Gaussian head
reconstruction. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our framework
towards existing work.

Abstract: Temporal image forensics is the science of estimating the age of a digital
image. Usually, time-dependent traces (age traces) introduced by the image
acquisition pipeline are exploited for this purpose. In this review, a
comprehensive overview of the field of temporal image forensics based on
time-dependent traces from the image acquisition pipeline is given. This
includes a detailed insight into the properties of known age traces (i.e.,
in-field sensor defects and sensor dust) and temporal image forensics
techniques. Another key aspect of this work is to highlight the problem of
content bias and to illustrate how important eXplainable Artificial
Intelligence methods are to verify the reliability of temporal image forensics
techniques. Apart from reviewing material presented in previous works, in this
review: (i) a new (probably more realistic) forensic setting is proposed; (ii)
the main properties (growth rate and spatial distribution) of in-field sensor
defects are verified; (iii) it is shown that a method proposed to utilize
in-field sensor defects for image age approximation actually exploits other
traces (most likely content bias); (iv) the features learned by a neural
network dating palmprint images are further investigated; (v) it is shown how
easily a neural network can be distracted from learning age traces. For this
purpose, previous work is analyzed, re-implemented if required and experiments
are conducted.

Abstract: Stroke is the second most frequent cause of death world wide with an annual
mortality of around 5.5 million. Recurrence rates of stroke are between 5 and
25% in the first year. As mortality rates for relapses are extraordinarily high
(40%) it is of utmost importance to reduce the recurrence rates. We address
this issue by detecting patients at risk of stroke recurrence at an early stage
in order to enable appropriate therapy planning. To this end we collected 3D
intracranial CTA image data and recorded concomitant heart diseases, the age
and the gender of stroke patients between 2010 and 2024. We trained single- and
multimodal deep learning based neural networks for binary relapse detection
(Task 1) and for relapse free survival (RFS) time prediction together with a
subsequent classification (Task 2). The separation of relapse from non-relapse
patients (Task 1) could be solved with tabular data (AUC on test dataset:
0.84). However, for the main task, the regression (Task 2), our multimodal
XSRD-net processed the modalities vision:tabular with 0.68:0.32 according to
modality contribution measures. The c-index with respect to relapses for the
multimodal model reached 0.68, and the AUC is 0.71 for the test dataset. Final,
deeper interpretability analysis results could highlight a link between both
heart diseases (tabular) and carotid arteries (vision) for the detection of
relapses and the prediction of the RFS time. This is a central outcome that we
strive to strengthen with ongoing data collection and model retraining.

Conclusion: RayGaussX成功解决了RayGauss的计算效率问题，在保持甚至提升渲染质量的同时实现了显著的性能提升，为实时高质量新视角合成提供了可行方案。

Abstract: RayGauss has achieved state-of-the-art rendering quality for novel-view
synthesis on synthetic and indoor scenes by representing radiance and density
fields with irregularly distributed elliptical basis functions, rendered via
volume ray casting using a Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH). However, its
computational cost prevents real-time rendering on real-world scenes. Our
approach, RayGaussX, builds on RayGauss by introducing key contributions that
accelerate both training and inference. Specifically, we incorporate volumetric
rendering acceleration strategies such as empty-space skipping and adaptive
sampling, enhance ray coherence, and introduce scale regularization to reduce
false-positive intersections. Additionally, we propose a new densification
criterion that improves density distribution in distant regions, leading to
enhanced graphical quality on larger scenes. As a result, RayGaussX achieves 5x
to 12x faster training and 50x to 80x higher rendering speeds (FPS) on
real-world datasets while improving visual quality by up to +0.56 dB in PSNR.

Conclusion: ToothMCL是首个牙齿分割多模态预训练框架，通过对比学习有效整合多模态信息，显著提升了牙齿分割的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Digital dentistry represents a transformative shift in modern dental
practice. The foundational step in this transformation is the accurate digital
representation of the patient's dentition, which is obtained from segmented
Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) and Intraoral Scans (IOS). Despite the
growing interest in digital dental technologies, existing segmentation
methodologies frequently lack rigorous validation and demonstrate limited
performance and clinical applicability. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work to introduce a multimodal pretraining framework for tooth
segmentation. We present ToothMCL, a Tooth Multimodal Contrastive Learning for
pretraining that integrates volumetric (CBCT) and surface-based (IOS)
modalities. By capturing modality-invariant representations through multimodal
contrastive learning, our approach effectively models fine-grained anatomical
features, enabling precise multi-class segmentation and accurate identification
of F\'ed\'eration Dentaire Internationale (FDI) tooth numbering. Along with the
framework, we curated CBCT-IOS3.8K, the largest paired CBCT and IOS dataset to
date, comprising 3,867 patients. We then evaluated ToothMCL on a comprehensive
collection of independent datasets, representing the largest and most diverse
evaluation to date. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
internal and external testing, with an increase of 12\% for CBCT segmentation
and 8\% for IOS segmentation in the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC).
Furthermore, ToothMCL consistently surpasses existing approaches in tooth
groups and demonstrates robust generalizability across varying imaging
conditions and clinical scenarios.

Abstract: Estimating the 6D pose of arbitrary unseen objects from a single reference
image is critical for robotics operating in the long-tail of real-world
instances. However, this setting is notoriously challenging: 3D models are
rarely available, single-view reconstructions lack metric scale, and domain
gaps between generated models and real-world images undermine robustness. We
propose OnePoseViaGen, a pipeline that tackles these challenges through two key
components. First, a coarse-to-fine alignment module jointly refines scale and
pose by combining multi-view feature matching with render-and-compare
refinement. Second, a text-guided generative domain randomization strategy
diversifies textures, enabling effective fine-tuning of pose estimators with
synthetic data. Together, these steps allow high-fidelity single-view 3D
generation to support reliable one-shot 6D pose estimation. On challenging
benchmarks (YCBInEOAT, Toyota-Light, LM-O), OnePoseViaGen achieves
state-of-the-art performance far surpassing prior approaches. We further
demonstrate robust dexterous grasping with a real robot hand, validating the
practicality of our method in real-world manipulation. Project page:

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) plays a crucial role in enabling seamless
connectivity and intelligent home automation, particularly in food management.
By integrating IoT with computer vision, the smart fridge employs an ESP32-CAM
to establish a monitoring subsystem that enhances food management efficiency
through real-time food detection, inventory tracking, and temperature
monitoring. This benefits waste reduction, grocery planning improvement, and
household consumption optimization. In high-density inventory conditions,
capturing partial or layered images complicates object detection, as
overlapping items and occluded views hinder accurate identification and
counting. Besides, varied angles and obscured details in multi-layered setups
reduce algorithm reliability, often resulting in miscounts or
misclassifications. Our proposed system is structured into three core modules:
data pre-processing, object detection and management, and a web-based
visualization. To address the challenge of poor model calibration caused by
overconfident predictions, we implement a variant of focal loss that mitigates
over-confidence and under-confidence in multi-category classification. This
approach incorporates adaptive, class-wise error calibration via temperature
scaling and evaluates the distribution of predicted probabilities across
methods. Our results demonstrate that robust functional calibration
significantly improves detection reliability under varying lighting conditions
and scalability challenges. Further analysis demonstrates a practical,
user-focused approach to modern food management, advancing sustainable living
goals through reduced waste and more informed consumption.

Abstract: Modeling of high-frequency outgoing radiance distributions has long been a
key challenge in rendering, particularly for glossy material. Such
distributions concentrate radiative energy within a narrow lobe and are highly
sensitive to changes in view direction. However, existing neural radiosity
methods, which primarily rely on positional feature encoding, exhibit notable
limitations in capturing these high-frequency, strongly view-dependent radiance
distributions. To address this, we propose a highly-efficient approach by
reflectance-aware ray cone encoding based on the neural radiosity framework,
named neural cone radiosity. The core idea is to employ a pre-filtered
multi-resolution hash grid to accurately approximate the glossy BSDF lobe,
embedding view-dependent reflectance characteristics directly into the encoding
process through continuous spatial aggregation. Our design not only
significantly improves the network's ability to model high-frequency reflection
distributions but also effectively handles surfaces with a wide range of
glossiness levels, from highly glossy to low-gloss finishes. Meanwhile, our
method reduces the network's burden in fitting complex radiance distributions,
allowing the overall architecture to remain compact and efficient.
Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently
produces high-quality, noise-free renderings in real time under various
glossiness conditions, and delivers superior fidelity and realism compared to
baseline approaches.

Abstract: Human hair reconstruction is a challenging problem in computer vision, with
growing importance for applications in virtual reality and digital human
modeling. Recent advances in 3D Gaussians Splatting (3DGS) provide efficient
and explicit scene representations that naturally align with the structure of
hair strands. In this work, we extend the 3DGS framework to enable strand-level
hair geometry reconstruction from multi-view images. Our multi-stage pipeline
first reconstructs detailed hair geometry using a differentiable Gaussian
rasterizer, then merges individual Gaussian segments into coherent strands
through a novel merging scheme, and finally refines and grows the strands under
photometric supervision.
  While existing methods typically evaluate reconstruction quality at the
geometric level, they often neglect the connectivity and topology of hair
strands. To address this, we propose a new evaluation metric that serves as a
proxy for assessing topological accuracy in strand reconstruction. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method robustly handles a wide range of hairstyles and achieves efficient
reconstruction, typically completing within one hour.

Motivation: 研究社区普遍将语言模型的中间推理标记（如Chain of Thoughts）拟人化为"思考"过程，并假设更长的推理轨迹代表更高的问题适应性计算。本文旨在验证中间标记序列长度是否真正反映问题难度

Method: 在A*搜索算法的推导轨迹上从头训练Transformer模型，利用迷宫问题中所需操作数量作为可验证的问题复杂度度量，系统评估模型在分布内和分布外问题上的表现

Result: 发现即使在最简单的任务中，模型也经常产生过长的推理轨迹且有时无法生成解决方案。中间标记长度与真实A*轨迹长度仅松散相关，相关性主要出现在接近训练分布的问题上

Conclusion: 中间标记生成并非真正适应问题难度，而是近似回忆训练数据分布。结果挑战了将较长序列自动解释为"思考努力"的假设

Abstract: Intermediate token generation (ITG), where a model produces output before the
solution, has been proposed as a method to improve the performance of language
models on reasoning tasks. While these reasoning traces or Chain of Thoughts
(CoTs) are correlated with performance gains, the mechanisms underlying them
remain unclear. A prevailing assumption in the community has been to
anthropomorphize these tokens as "thinking", treating longer traces as evidence
of higher problem-adaptive computation. In this work, we critically examine
whether intermediate token sequence length reflects or correlates with problem
difficulty. To do so, we train transformer models from scratch on derivational
traces of the A* search algorithm, where the number of operations required to
solve a maze problem provides a precise and verifiable measure of problem
complexity. We first evaluate the models on trivial free-space problems,
finding that even for the simplest tasks, they often produce excessively long
reasoning traces and sometimes fail to generate a solution. We then
systematically evaluate the model on out-of-distribution problems and find that
the intermediate token length and ground truth A* trace length only loosely
correlate. We notice that the few cases where correlation appears are those
where the problems are closer to the training distribution, suggesting that the
effect arises from approximate recall rather than genuine problem-adaptive
computation. This suggests that the inherent computational complexity of the
problem instance is not a significant factor, but rather its distributional
distance from the training data. These results challenge the assumption that
intermediate trace generation is adaptive to problem difficulty and caution
against interpreting longer sequences in systems like R1 as automatically
indicative of "thinking effort".

Motivation: 受AlphaEvolve启发，但AlphaEvolve仅限于数百行代码的孤立内核，SATLUTION旨在将LLM代码进化扩展到包含数百个文件和数万行C/C++代码的完整代码库规模。

Method: SATLUTION框架协调LLM代理在严格正确性保证和分布式运行时反馈下直接进化求解器代码库，同时自我进化其进化策略和规则，针对布尔可满足性(SAT)问题。

Conclusion: 该研究表明LLM代理能够在完整代码库规模上实现代码自我进化，并在复杂算法问题上超越人类专家表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong coding abilities,
enabling not only static code generation but also iterative code self-evolving
through agentic frameworks. Recently, AlphaEvolve \cite{novikov2025alphaevolve}
demonstrated that LLM-based coding agents can autonomously improve algorithms
and surpass human experts, with scopes limited to isolated kernels spanning
hundreds of lines of code. Inspired by AlphaEvolve, we present SATLUTION, the
first framework to extend LLM-based code evolution to the full repository
scale, encompassing hundreds of files and tens of thousands of lines of C/C++
code. Targeting Boolean Satisfiability (SAT), the canonical NP-complete problem
and a cornerstone of both theory and applications. SATLUTION orchestrates LLM
agents to directly evolve solver repositories under strict correctness
guarantees and distributed runtime feedback, while simultaneously self-evolving
its own evolution policies and rules. Starting from SAT Competition 2024
codebases and benchmark, SATLUTION evolved solvers that decisively outperformed
the human-designed winners of the SAT Competition 2025, and also surpassed both
2024 and 2025 champions on the 2024 benchmarks.

Result: 在Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct上的实验表明，仅通过自博弈就能在指令跟随基准上提升性能，且效果优于数据驱动的基线方法

Conclusion: 自博弈强化学习是突破数据瓶颈的有效方法，为LLMs的持续改进提供了新的技术路径

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years, driven by
scale, abundant high-quality training data, and reinforcement learning. Yet
this progress faces a fundamental bottleneck: the need for ever more data from
which models can continue to learn. In this work, we propose a reinforcement
learning approach that removes this dependency by enabling models to improve
without additional data. Our method leverages a game-theoretic framework of
self-play, where a model's capabilities are cast as performance in a
competitive game and stronger policies emerge by having the model play against
itself - a process we call Language Self-Play (LSP). Experiments with
Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct on instruction-following benchmarks show that pretrained
models can not only enhance their performance on challenging tasks through
self-play alone, but can also do so more effectively than data-driven
baselines.

Abstract: Direct Prompt Injection (DPI) attacks pose a critical security threat to
Large Language Models (LLMs) due to their low barrier of execution and high
potential damage. To address the impracticality of existing white-box/gray-box
methods and the poor transferability of black-box methods, we propose an
activations-guided prompt injection attack framework. We first construct an
Energy-based Model (EBM) using activations from a surrogate model to evaluate
the quality of adversarial prompts. Guided by the trained EBM, we employ the
token-level Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to adaptively optimize
adversarial prompts, thereby enabling gradient-free black-box attacks.
Experimental results demonstrate our superior cross-model transferability,
achieving 49.6% attack success rate (ASR) across five mainstream LLMs and 34.6%
improvement over human-crafted prompts, and maintaining 36.6% ASR on unseen
task scenarios. Interpretability analysis reveals a correlation between
activations and attack effectiveness, highlighting the critical role of
semantic patterns in transferable vulnerability exploitation.

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成基准测试中，相比最先进的基于提示的自校正方法取得了一致且显著的改进

Conclusion: FTR框架有效解决了LLM自校正的关键限制，通过用户反馈触发和增强解码机制显著提升了生成内容的准确性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across
diverse tasks, yet their susceptibility to generating incorrect content during
inference remains a critical unsolved challenge. While self-correction methods
offer potential solutions, their effectiveness is hindered by two inherent
limitations: (1) the absence of reliable guidance signals for error
localization, and (2) the restricted reasoning depth imposed by conventional
next-token decoding paradigms. To address these issues, we propose
Feedback-Triggered Regeneration (FTR), a novel framework that synergizes user
feedback with enhanced decoding dynamics. Specifically, FTR activates response
regeneration only upon receiving negative user feedback, thereby circumventing
error propagation from faulty self-assessment while preserving originally
correct outputs. Furthermore, we introduce Long-Term Multipath (LTM) decoding,
which enables systematic exploration of multiple reasoning trajectories through
delayed sequence evaluation, effectively overcoming the myopic decision-making
characteristic of standard next-token prediction. Extensive experiments on
mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks demonstrate that our
framework achieves consistent and significant improvements over
state-of-the-art prompt-based self-correction methods.

Conclusion: RIMO提供了具有挑战性且易于评估的测试套件，为未来研究提供了高分辨率的标准，揭示了需要填补的深刻推理差距。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) reach high scores on established mathematical
benchmarks, such as GSM8K and MATH, the research community has turned to
International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) problems to push the evaluation
frontier. However, existing Olympiad-level benchmarks suffer from practical
constraints that introduce grading noise and potential bias, such as
heterogeneous answer formats requiring model-based judges and a reliance on
potentially flawed solutions. We introduce RIMO, a two-track benchmark designed
to preserve peak Olympiad difficulty while eliminating this evaluation noise.
The first track, RIMO-N, rewrites 335 IMO problems to admit a single, unique
integer answer, allowing for deterministic correctness checking. The second
track, RIMO-P, features 456 proof problems with expert-checked solutions, which
are decomposed into a sequence of sub-problems to evaluate the step-by-step
reasoning process via an automated grading system. Our benchmarking of ten
frontier LLMs, including GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Flash, reveals that while these
systems excel on older benchmarks, their performance drops sharply on RIMO.
These results highlight a substantial gap between current LLM capabilities and
actual Olympiad-level reasoning. By providing a challenging yet
easy-to-evaluate suite, RIMO offers a high-resolution yardstick for future
research, presenting a clear target for closing the profound reasoning gap our
findings expose.

Conclusion: 置信度是推理充分性的有力信号，CGR使大型推理语言模型更具适应性、可信性和资源效率，为实际部署铺平道路

Abstract: The rise of large reasoning language models (LRLMs) has unlocked new
potential for solving complex tasks. These models operate with a thinking
budget, that is, a predefined number of reasoning tokens used to arrive at a
solution. We propose a novel approach, inspired by the generator/discriminator
framework in generative adversarial networks, in which a critic model
periodically probes its own reasoning to assess whether it has reached a
confident conclusion. If not, reasoning continues until a target certainty
threshold is met. This mechanism adaptively balances efficiency and reliability
by allowing early termination when confidence is high, while encouraging
further reasoning when uncertainty persists. Through experiments on the
AIME2024 and AIME2025 datasets, we show that Certainty-Guided Reasoning (CGR)
improves baseline accuracy while reducing token usage. Importantly, extended
multi-seed evaluations over 64 runs demonstrate that CGR is stable, reducing
variance across seeds and improving exam-like performance under penalty-based
grading. Additionally, our token savings analysis shows that CGR can eliminate
millions of tokens in aggregate, with tunable trade-offs between certainty
thresholds and efficiency. Together, these findings highlight certainty as a
powerful signal for reasoning sufficiency. By integrating confidence into the
reasoning process, CGR makes large reasoning language models more adaptive,
trustworthy, and resource efficient, paving the way for practical deployment in
domains where both accuracy and computational cost matter.

capability of small-scale LLMs can be enhanced by training on a few superior
data synthesis samples from proprietary LLMs. Building on this, we propose a
novel iterative self-distillation approach to bootstrap small-scale LLMs,
transforming them into powerful synthesizers that reduce reliance on
proprietary LLMs and minimize costs. Concretely, in each iteration, to obtain
diverse and high-quality self-distilled data, we design multi-checkpoint
sampling and multi-aspect scoring strategies for initial data selection.
Furthermore, to identify the most influential samples, we introduce a
gradient-based influence estimation method for final data filtering. Based on
the code instruction datasets from the small-scale synthesizers, we develop
SCoder, a family of code generation models fine-tuned from DeepSeek-Coder.
SCoder models achieve state-of-the-art code generation capabilities,

Abstract: GPU kernel optimization has long been a central challenge at the intersection
of high-performance computing and machine learning. Efficient kernels are
crucial for accelerating large language model (LLM) training and serving, yet
attaining high performance typically requires extensive manual tuning.
Compiler-based systems reduce some of this burden, but still demand substantial
manual design and engineering effort. Recently, researchers have explored using
LLMs for GPU kernel generation, though prior work has largely focused on
translating high-level PyTorch modules into CUDA code. In this work, we
introduce Astra, the first LLM-based multi-agent system for GPU kernel
optimization. Unlike previous approaches, Astra starts from existing CUDA
implementations extracted from SGLang, a widely deployed framework for serving
LLMs, rather than treating PyTorch modules as the specification. Within Astra,
specialized LLM agents collaborate through iterative code generation, testing,
profiling, and planning to produce kernels that are both correct and
high-performance. On kernels from SGLang, Astra achieves an average speedup of
1.32x using zero-shot prompting with OpenAI o4-mini. A detailed case study
further demonstrates that LLMs can autonomously apply loop transformations,
optimize memory access patterns, exploit CUDA intrinsics, and leverage fast
math operations to yield substantial performance gains. Our work highlights
multi-agent LLM systems as a promising new paradigm for GPU kernel
optimization.

Conclusion: Paladin提供了一种有效且实用的解决方案，能够可靠检测LLM生成的钓鱼内容，解决了现有检测方法面临的挑战。

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models, the potential threat of
their malicious use, particularly in generating phishing content, is becoming
increasingly prevalent. Leveraging the capabilities of LLMs, malicious users
can synthesize phishing emails that are free from spelling mistakes and other
easily detectable features. Furthermore, such models can generate
topic-specific phishing messages, tailoring content to the target domain and
increasing the likelihood of success.
  Detecting such content remains a significant challenge, as LLM-generated
phishing emails often lack clear or distinguishable linguistic features. As a
result, most existing semantic-level detection approaches struggle to identify
them reliably. While certain LLM-based detection methods have shown promise,
they suffer from high computational costs and are constrained by the
performance of the underlying language model, making them impractical for
large-scale deployment.
  In this work, we aim to address this issue. We propose Paladin, which embeds
trigger-tag associations into vanilla LLM using various insertion strategies,
creating them into instrumented LLMs. When an instrumented LLM generates
content related to phishing, it will automatically include detectable tags,
enabling easier identification. Based on the design on implicit and explicit
triggers and tags, we consider four distinct scenarios in our work. We evaluate
our method from three key perspectives: stealthiness, effectiveness, and
robustness, and compare it with existing baseline methods. Experimental results
show that our method outperforms the baselines, achieving over 90% detection
accuracy across all scenarios.

fundamental routing challenge: how to accurately direct each query to an

routing framework that integrates both LLM and agent-based routing. Built upon
a deep understanding of model and agent capabilities, MoMA effectively handles
diverse queries through precise intent recognition and adaptive routing
strategies, achieving an optimal balance between efficiency and cost.
Specifically, we construct a detailed training dataset to profile the
capabilities of various LLMs under different routing model structures,
identifying the most suitable tasks for each LLM. During inference, queries are
dynamically routed to the LLM with the best cost-performance efficiency. We
also introduce an efficient agent selection strategy based on a context-aware
state machine and dynamic masking. Experimental results demonstrate that the

Abstract: Code generation has emerged as a pivotal capability of Large Language
Models(LLMs), revolutionizing development efficiency for programmers of all
skill levels. However, the complexity of data structures and algorithmic logic
often results in functional deficiencies and security vulnerabilities in
generated code, reducing it to a prototype requiring extensive manual
debugging. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can enhance correctness
and security by leveraging external code manuals, it simultaneously introduces
new attack surfaces.
  In this paper, we pioneer the exploration of attack surfaces in
Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG), focusing on malicious dependency
hijacking. We demonstrate how poisoned documentation containing hidden
malicious dependencies (e.g., matplotlib_safe) can subvert RACG, exploiting
dual trust chains: LLM reliance on RAG and developers' blind trust in LLM
suggestions. To construct poisoned documents, we propose ImportSnare, a novel
attack framework employing two synergistic strategies: 1)Position-aware beam
search optimizes hidden ranking sequences to elevate poisoned documents in
retrieval results, and 2)Multilingual inductive suggestions generate
jailbreaking sequences to manipulate LLMs into recommending malicious
dependencies. Through extensive experiments across Python, Rust, and
JavaScript, ImportSnare achieves significant attack success rates (over 50% for
popular libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn) in general, and is also able
to succeed even when the poisoning ratio is as low as 0.01%, targeting both
custom and real-world malicious packages. Our findings reveal critical supply
chain risks in LLM-powered development, highlighting inadequate security
alignment for code generation tasks. To support future research, we will

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence is emerging as an important technology,
promising to be transformative in many areas. At the same time, generative AI
techniques are based on sampling from probabilistic models, and by default,
they come with no guarantees about correctness, safety, fairness, or other
properties. Statistical methods offer a promising potential approach to improve
the reliability of generative AI techniques. In addition, statistical methods
are also promising for improving the quality and efficiency of AI evaluation,
as well as for designing interventions and experiments in AI.
  In this paper, we review some of the existing work on these topics,
explaining both the general statistical techniques used, as well as their
applications to generative AI. We also discuss limitations and potential future
directions.

TL;DR: PaVeRL-SQL是一个结合部分匹配奖励和语言强化学习的框架，用于提升文本到SQL转换模型的执行准确率，在工业级数据库和复杂问题上达到SOTA效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到SQL方法在工业级数据库和涉及领域特定业务逻辑的复杂问题上执行准确率较低，需要更可靠的解决方案。

Method: 采用两种管道：1) 基于大语言模型的上下文学习框架与群体自评估（语言RL）；2) 基于小模型（OmniSQL-7B）的思维链RL管道，使用特殊设计的奖励函数和两阶段RL训练。

Result: 在Spider、Spider 2.0和BIRD基准测试中达到SOTA，Spider2.0-SQLite上语言RL管道比SOTA高7.4%，CoT管道高1.4%。混合SQL方言训练带来三倍增益。

Conclusion: PaVeRL-SQL在现实工业约束下提供了可靠、SOTA级别的文本到SQL解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL models allow users to interact with a database more easily by
generating executable SQL statements from natural-language questions. Despite
recent successes on simpler databases and questions, current Text-to-SQL
methods still suffer from low execution accuracy on industry-scale databases
and complex questions involving domain-specific business logic. We present
\emph{PaVeRL-SQL}, a framework that combines \emph{Partial-Match Rewards} and
\emph{Verbal Reinforcement Learning} to drive self-improvement in reasoning
language models (RLMs) for Text-to-SQL. To handle practical use cases, we adopt
two pipelines: (1) a newly designed in-context learning framework with group
self-evaluation (verbal-RL), using capable open- and closed-source large
language models (LLMs) as backbones; and (2) a chain-of-thought (CoT) RL
pipeline with a small backbone model (OmniSQL-7B) trained with a specially
designed reward function and two-stage RL. These pipelines achieve
state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on popular Text-to-SQL benchmarks -- Spider,
Spider 2.0, and BIRD. For the industrial-level Spider2.0-SQLite benchmark, the
verbal-RL pipeline achieves an execution accuracy 7.4\% higher than SOTA, and
the CoT pipeline is 1.4\% higher. RL training with mixed SQL dialects yields
strong, threefold gains, particularly for dialects with limited training data.
Overall, \emph{PaVeRL-SQL} delivers reliable, SOTA Text-to-SQL under realistic
industrial constraints. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有基于大型语言模型(LLMs)的医疗解决方案多为云端部署，存在隐私泄露风险、内存占用大和延迟高等问题。需要研究轻量级的小型语言模型在移动和可穿戴设备上的本地部署能力。

Method: 使用零样本、少样本和指令微调三种方法系统评估SLMs在健康预测任务中的表现，并将性能最佳的微调SLMs部署到移动设备上评估实际效率和预测性能。

Result: SLMs能够达到与LLMs相当的性能，同时在效率和隐私保护方面有显著优势。但在处理类别不平衡和少样本场景时仍存在挑战。

Conclusion: SLMs虽然目前还不完美，但作为下一代隐私保护的医疗监测解决方案具有很大潜力。

Abstract: Mobile and wearable healthcare monitoring play a vital role in facilitating
timely interventions, managing chronic health conditions, and ultimately
improving individuals' quality of life. Previous studies on large language
models (LLMs) have highlighted their impressive generalization abilities and
effectiveness in healthcare prediction tasks. However, most LLM-based
healthcare solutions are cloud-based, which raises significant privacy concerns
and results in increased memory usage and latency. To address these challenges,
there is growing interest in compact models, Small Language Models (SLMs),
which are lightweight and designed to run locally and efficiently on mobile and
wearable devices. Nevertheless, how well these models perform in healthcare
prediction remains largely unexplored. We systematically evaluated SLMs on
health prediction tasks using zero-shot, few-shot, and instruction fine-tuning
approaches, and deployed the best performing fine-tuned SLMs on mobile devices
to evaluate their real-world efficiency and predictive performance in practical
healthcare scenarios. Our results show that SLMs can achieve performance
comparable to LLMs while offering substantial gains in efficiency and privacy.
However, challenges remain, particularly in handling class imbalance and
few-shot scenarios. These findings highlight SLMs, though imperfect in their
current form, as a promising solution for next-generation, privacy-preserving
healthcare monitoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在教育环境中提供过时或虚假信息的问题，通过RAG技术提高回答的可靠性，特别关注教育场景中的教学因素和实际部署成本。

Method: 使用EduScopeQA数据集（3,176个教育问题），比较向量检索（OpenAI Vector Search）和图形检索（GraphRAG）两种RAG范式，评估不同学科、问题类型和教材完整性情况下的性能。

Result: 向量检索RAG成本低且擅长快速事实检索；GraphRAG Global在主题查询中提供更丰富的教学答案；GraphRAG Local在教材完整性关键时准确率最高。动态路由框架可提升保真度和效率。

Conclusion: 为教育工作者和系统设计者提供了将RAG增强的LLM有效集成到学习环境中的实用指南，建议根据查询类型动态选择最优检索方法。

Abstract: Large language models like ChatGPT are increasingly used in classrooms, but
they often provide outdated or fabricated information that can mislead
students. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) improves reliability of LLMs by
grounding responses in external resources. We investigate two accessible RAG
paradigms, vector-based retrieval and graph-based retrieval to identify best
practices for classroom question answering (QA). Existing comparative studies
fail to account for pedagogical factors such as educational disciplines,
question types, and practical deployment costs. Using a novel dataset,
EduScopeQA, of 3,176 questions across academic subjects, we measure performance
on various educational query types, from specific facts to broad thematic
discussions. We also evaluate system alignment with a dataset of systematically
altered textbooks that contradict the LLM's latent knowledge. We find that
OpenAI Vector Search RAG (representing vector-based RAG) performs well as a
low-cost generalist, especially for quick fact retrieval. On the other hand,
GraphRAG Global excels at providing pedagogically rich answers to thematic
queries, and GraphRAG Local achieves the highest accuracy with the dense,
altered textbooks when corpus integrity is critical. Accounting for the 10-20x
higher resource usage of GraphRAG (representing graph-based RAG), we show that
a dynamic branching framework that routes queries to the optimal retrieval
method boosts fidelity and efficiency. These insights provide actionable
guidelines for educators and system designers to integrate RAG-augmented LLMs
into learning environments effectively.

Motivation: 当前检索模型缺乏处理复杂多约束自然语言查询的能力，现有评估资源有限且不够真实，需要建立全面的复杂检索任务基准来推动下一代检索模型发展

Method: 构建了多样化和真实的复杂检索任务集，对代表性SOTA检索模型进行基准测试，并探索了基于LLM的查询扩展和重写技术对检索质量的影响

Result: 最佳模型的平均nDCG@10仅为0.346，R@100仅为0.587，LLM增强技术对弱模型有帮助，但对最强模型在所有重写技术下性能都下降

Conclusion: 当前检索模型在复杂检索任务上仍有很大提升空间，LLM增强技术需要更精细的设计，复杂检索基准将推动检索模型能力的发展

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are incredible and versatile tools for
text-based tasks that have enabled countless, previously unimaginable,
applications. Retrieval models, in contrast, have not yet seen such capable
general-purpose models emerge. To achieve this goal, retrieval models must be
able to perform complex retrieval tasks, where queries contain multiple parts,
constraints, or requirements in natural language. These tasks represent a
natural progression from the simple, single-aspect queries that are used in the
vast majority of existing, commonly used evaluation sets. Complex queries
naturally arise as people expect search systems to handle more specific and
often ambitious information requests, as is demonstrated by how people use
LLM-based information systems. Despite the growing desire for retrieval models
to expand their capabilities in complex retrieval tasks, there exist limited
resources to assess the ability of retrieval models on a comprehensive set of
diverse complex tasks. The few resources that do exist feature a limited scope
and often lack realistic settings making it hard to know the true capabilities
of retrieval models on complex real-world retrieval tasks. To address this
shortcoming and spur innovation in next-generation retrieval models, we
construct a diverse and realistic set of complex retrieval tasks and benchmark
a representative set of state-of-the-art retrieval models. Additionally, we
explore the impact of LLM-based query expansion and rewriting on retrieval
quality. Our results show that even the best models struggle to produce
high-quality retrieval results with the highest average nDCG@10 of only 0.346
and R@100 of only 0.587 across all tasks. Although LLM augmentation can help
weaker models, the strongest model has decreased performance across all metrics
with all rewriting techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管音频在人类交流中至关重要，但LLM与音频的整合仍未被充分探索。研究者希望开发高效的音频-语言模型，减少对大量数据和复杂架构的依赖。

Method: 基于指令调优的LLM和Whisper编码器构建音频-语言模型，使用少于30K小时的公开音频数据进行单阶段训练，避免了课程学习、多编码器和复杂跨注意力连接器等常见复杂性。

Result: Falcon3-Audio-7B在MMAU基准上获得64.14分，匹配R1-AQA的最佳性能，同时具有卓越的数据和参数效率。最小的1B模型仍能与2B-13B参数的开源模型竞争。

Conclusion: 研究表明，强性能不需要常见的复杂性设计，即使与在500K+小时数据上训练的模型相比，简化架构和少量数据也能取得优异结果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed NLP, yet their integration with
audio remains underexplored -- despite audio's centrality to human
communication. We introduce Falcon3-Audio, a family of Audio-Language Models
(ALMs) built on instruction-tuned LLMs and Whisper encoders. Using a remarkably
small amount of public audio data -- less than 30K hours (5K unique) --
Falcon3-Audio-7B matches the best reported performance among open-weight models
on the MMAU benchmark, with a score of 64.14, matching R1-AQA, while
distinguishing itself through superior data and parameter efficiency,
single-stage training, and transparency. Notably, our smallest 1B model remains
competitive with larger open models ranging from 2B to 13B parameters. Through
extensive ablations, we find that common complexities -- such as curriculum
learning, multiple audio encoders, and intricate cross-attention connectors --
are not required for strong performance, even compared to models trained on
over 500K hours of data.

Abstract: In 2023, the National Eating Disorders Association's (NEDA) chatbot Tessa was
suspended after providing harmful weight-loss advice to vulnerable users-an
avoidable failure that underscores the risks of unsafe AI in healthcare
contexts. This paper examines Tessa as a case study in absent safety
engineering and demonstrates how a lightweight, modular safeguard could have
prevented the incident. We propose a hybrid safety middleware that combines
deterministic lexical gates with an in-line large language model (LLM) policy
filter, enforcing fail-closed verdicts and escalation pathways within a single
model call. Using synthetic evaluations, we show that this design achieves
perfect interception of unsafe prompts at baseline cost and latency,
outperforming traditional multi-stage pipelines. Beyond technical remedies, we
map Tessa's failure patterns to established frameworks (OWASP LLM Top10, NIST
SP 800-53), connecting practical safeguards to actionable governance controls.
The results highlight that robust, auditable safety in health-adjacent AI does
not require heavyweight infrastructure: explicit, testable checks at the last
mile are sufficient to prevent "another Tessa", while governance and escalation
ensure sustainability in real-world deployment.

Conclusion: VISION框架通过反事实训练有效减少虚假学习，实现了更鲁棒、可泛化的漏洞检测，并推进了可信AI网络安全系统的发展

Abstract: Automated detection of vulnerabilities in source code is an essential
cybersecurity challenge, underpinning trust in digital systems and services.
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach as they can
learn structural and logical code relationships in a data-driven manner.
However, their performance is severely constrained by training data imbalances
and label noise. GNNs often learn 'spurious' correlations from superficial code
similarities, producing detectors that fail to generalize well to unseen
real-world data. In this work, we propose a unified framework for robust and
interpretable vulnerability detection, called VISION, to mitigate spurious
correlations by systematically augmenting a counterfactual training dataset.
Counterfactuals are samples with minimal semantic modifications but opposite
labels. Our framework includes: (i) generating counterfactuals by prompting a
Large Language Model (LLM); (ii) targeted GNN training on paired code examples
with opposite labels; and (iii) graph-based interpretability to identify the
crucial code statements relevant for vulnerability predictions while ignoring
spurious ones. We find that VISION reduces spurious learning and enables more
robust, generalizable detection, improving overall accuracy (from 51.8% to
97.8%), pairwise contrast accuracy (from 4.5% to 95.8%), and worst-group
accuracy (from 0.7% to 85.5%) on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)-20
vulnerability. We further demonstrate gains using proposed metrics: intra-class
attribution variance, inter-class attribution distance, and node score
dependency. We also release CWE-20-CFA, a benchmark of 27,556 functions (real
and counterfactual) from the high-impact CWE-20 category. Finally, VISION
advances transparent and trustworthy AI-based cybersecurity systems through
interactive visualization for human-in-the-loop analysis.

Motivation: 现有运动控制器要么是盲控（仅本体感知），要么使用计算-内存权衡不佳的融合骨干网络。循环控制器难以处理长时程信用分配，而基于Transformer的融合在token长度上产生二次成本，限制了时空上下文

Method: 使用SSD-Mamba2作为骨干网络，应用状态空间对偶性实现循环和卷积扫描，支持硬件感知流式处理和近线性扩展。将本体感知状态和外感受观察编码为紧凑token，通过堆叠SSD-Mamba2层进行融合

Result: 在多样化运动控制场景中，该方法在回报、安全性（碰撞和跌倒）和样本效率方面一致超越强基线方法，同时在相同计算预算下收敛更快

Conclusion: SSD-Mamba2为可扩展、有预见性和高效的端到端运动控制提供了实用的融合骨干网络

Abstract: End-to-end reinforcement learning for motion control promises unified
perception-action policies that scale across embodiments and tasks, yet most
deployed controllers are either blind (proprioception-only) or rely on fusion
backbones with unfavorable compute-memory trade-offs. Recurrent controllers
struggle with long-horizon credit assignment, and Transformer-based fusion
incurs quadratic cost in token length, limiting temporal and spatial context.
We present a vision-driven cross-modal RL framework built on SSD-Mamba2, a
selective state-space backbone that applies state-space duality (SSD) to enable
both recurrent and convolutional scanning with hardware-aware streaming and
near-linear scaling. Proprioceptive states and exteroceptive observations
(e.g., depth tokens) are encoded into compact tokens and fused by stacked
SSD-Mamba2 layers. The selective state-space updates retain long-range
dependencies with markedly lower latency and memory use than quadratic
self-attention, enabling longer look-ahead, higher token resolution, and stable
training under limited compute. Policies are trained end-to-end under curricula
that randomize terrain and appearance and progressively increase scene
complexity. A compact, state-centric reward balances task progress, energy
efficiency, and safety. Across diverse motion-control scenarios, our approach
consistently surpasses strong state-of-the-art baselines in return, safety
(collisions and falls), and sample efficiency, while converging faster at the
same compute budget. These results suggest that SSD-Mamba2 provides a practical
fusion backbone for scalable, foresightful, and efficient end-to-end motion
control.

Conclusion: FLeW成功统一了三种表示学习方法，通过引用意图驱动的训练和自适应集成机制，解决了现有方法的局限性，为科学文档表示学习提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Scientific document representation learning provides powerful embeddings for
various tasks, while current methods face challenges across three approaches.
1) Contrastive training with citation-structural signals underutilizes citation
information and still generates single-vector representations. 2) Fine-grained
representation learning, which generates multiple vectors at the sentence or
aspect level, requires costly integration and lacks domain generalization. 3)
Task-aware learning depends on manually predefined task categorization,
overlooking nuanced task distinctions and requiring extra training data for
task-specific modules. To address these problems, we propose a new method that
unifies the three approaches for better representations, namely FLeW.
Specifically, we introduce a novel triplet sampling method that leverages
citation intent and frequency to enhance citation-structural signals for
training. Citation intents (background, method, result), aligned with the
general structure of scientific writing, facilitate a domain-generalized facet
partition for fine-grained representation learning. Then, we adopt a simple
weight search to adaptively integrate three facet-level embeddings into a
task-specific document embedding without task-aware fine-tuning. Experiments
show the applicability and robustness of FLeW across multiple scientific tasks
and fields, compared to prior models.

Abstract: We introduce Spectral NSR, a fully spectral neuro-symbolic reasoning
framework that embeds logical rules as spectral templates and performs
inference directly in the graph spectral domain. By leveraging graph signal
processing (GSP) and frequency-selective filters grounded in the Laplacian
eigenstructure of knowledge graphs, the architecture unifies the
interpretability of symbolic reasoning with the scalability and adaptability of
spectral learning. Beyond the core formulation, we incorporate a comprehensive
set of extensions, including dynamic graph and basis learning, rational and
diffusion filters for sharper spectral selectivity, mixture-of-spectral-experts
for modular specialization, proof-guided training with spectral curricula, and
uncertainty quantification for calibrated confidence. Additional enhancements
such as large language model coupling, co-spectral transfer alignment,
adversarial robustness, efficient GPU kernels, generalized Laplacians, and
causal interventions further expand the versatility of the framework.
  Empirical evaluation on state-of-the-art reasoning benchmarks such as
ProofWriter and CLUTRR demonstrates that Spectral NSR achieves superior
accuracy, faster inference, improved robustness to adversarial perturbations,
and higher interpretability compared to leading baselines including
transformers, message-passing neural networks, and neuro-symbolic logic
programming systems. Spectral attribution and proof-band agreement analyses
confirm that model decisions align closely with symbolic proof structures,
while transfer experiments validate effective domain adaptation through
co-spectral alignment. These results establish Spectral NSR as a scalable and
principled foundation for the next generation of reasoning systems, offering
transparency, robustness, and generalization beyond conventional approaches.

Abstract: Each year millions of people seek help for their legal problems by calling a
legal aid program hotline, walking into a legal aid office, or using a lawyer
referral service. The first step to match them to the right help is to identify
the legal problem the applicant is experiencing. Misdirection has consequences.
Applicants may miss a deadline, experience physical abuse, lose housing or lose
custody of children while waiting to connect to the right legal help. We
introduce and evaluate the FETCH classifier for legal issue classification and
describe two methods for improving accuracy: a hybrid LLM/ML ensemble
classification method, and the automatic generation of follow-up questions to
enrich the initial problem narrative. We employ a novel data set of 419
real-world queries to a nonprofit lawyer referral service. Ultimately, we show
classification accuracy (hits@2) of 97.37\% using a mix of inexpensive models,
exceeding the performance of the current state-of-the-art GPT-5 model. Our

expertise required for manual spreadsheet layout design, there is an urgent
need for automated solutions. However, existing automated layout models are
ill-suited to spreadsheets, as they often (1) treat components as axis-aligned
rectangles with continuous coordinates, overlooking the inherently discrete,
grid-based structure of spreadsheets; and (2) neglect interrelated semantics,
such as data dependencies and contextual links, unique to spreadsheets. In this
paper, we first formalize the spreadsheet layout generation task, supported by
a seven-criterion evaluation protocol and a dataset of 3,326 spreadsheets. We
then introduce SheetDesigner, a zero-shot and training-free framework using
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that combines rule and vision
reflection for component placement and content population. SheetDesigner
outperforms five baselines by at least 22.6\%. We further find that through
vision modality, MLLMs handle overlap and balance well but struggle with
alignment, necessitates hybrid rule and visual reflection strategies. Our codes
and data is available at Github.

Abstract: Adopting Large language models (LLMs) in organizations potentially
revolutionizes our lives and work. However, they can generate off-topic,
discriminating, or harmful content. This AI alignment problem often stems from
misspecifications during the LLM adoption, unnoticed by the principal due to
the LLM's black-box nature. While various research disciplines investigated AI
alignment, they neither address the information asymmetries between
organizational adopters and black-box LLM agents nor consider organizational AI
adoption processes. Therefore, we propose LLM ATLAS (LLM Agency Theory-Led
Alignment Strategy) a conceptual framework grounded in agency (contract)
theory, to mitigate alignment problems during organizational LLM adoption. We
conduct a conceptual literature analysis using the organizational LLM adoption
phases and the agency theory as concepts. Our approach results in (1) providing
an extended literature analysis process specific to AI alignment methods during
organizational LLM adoption and (2) providing a first LLM alignment
problem-solution space.

Conclusion: 开源模型与顶尖学生存在显著性能差距，闭源推理模型展现出强大的物理推理能力，仍有很大改进空间。HiPhO作为严谨、人类对齐的基准测试，可推动多模态物理推理发展。

Abstract: Recently, the physical capabilities of (M)LLMs have garnered increasing
attention. However, existing benchmarks for physics suffer from two major gaps:
they neither provide systematic and up-to-date coverage of real-world physics
competitions such as physics Olympiads, nor enable direct performance
comparison with humans. To bridge these gaps, we present HiPhO, the first
benchmark dedicated to high school physics Olympiads with human-aligned
evaluation. Specifically, HiPhO highlights three key innovations. (1)
Comprehensive Data: It compiles 13 latest Olympiad exams from 2024-2025,
spanning both international and regional competitions, and covering mixed
modalities that encompass problems spanning text-only to diagram-based. (2)
Professional Evaluation: We adopt official marking schemes to perform
fine-grained grading at both the answer and step level, fully aligned with
human examiners to ensure high-quality and domain-specific evaluation. (3)
Comparison with Human Contestants: We assign gold, silver, and bronze medals to
models based on official medal thresholds, thereby enabling direct comparison
between (M)LLMs and human contestants. Our large-scale evaluation of 30
state-of-the-art (M)LLMs shows that: across 13 exams, open-source MLLMs mostly
remain at or below the bronze level; open-source LLMs show promising progress
with occasional golds; closed-source reasoning MLLMs can achieve 6 to 12 gold
medals; and most models still have a significant gap from full marks. These
results highlight a substantial performance gap between open-source models and
top students, the strong physical reasoning capabilities of closed-source
reasoning models, and the fact that there is still significant room for
improvement. HiPhO, as a rigorous, human-aligned, and Olympiad-focused
benchmark for advancing multimodal physical reasoning, is open-source and

Motivation: 研究动机是开发可靠的方法来测量语言模型的福利状态，探索模型是否具有类似人类的福利体验，以及如何通过行为实验来验证模型的偏好一致性。

Method: 研究方法包括：1) 比较模型口头报告偏好与虚拟环境中的行为选择；2) 测试成本和奖励对行为的影响；3) 使用幸福福利量表测量自主性和生活目的等状态；4) 检查语义等效提示下的一致性。

Result: 研究发现不同测量方法之间存在显著的一致性，陈述偏好与行为在多种条件下呈现可靠相关性。但一致性在不同模型和条件下存在差异，且对提示扰动不够稳健。

Conclusion: 虽然目前不确定这些方法是否成功测量了语言模型的福利状态，但研究证明了在语言模型中进行福利测量的可行性，为未来探索奠定了基础。

Abstract: We develop new experimental paradigms for measuring welfare in language
models. We compare verbal reports of models about their preferences with
preferences expressed through behavior when navigating a virtual environment
and selecting conversation topics. We also test how costs and rewards affect
behavior and whether responses to an eudaimonic welfare scale - measuring
states such as autonomy and purpose in life - are consistent across
semantically equivalent prompts. Overall, we observed a notable degree of
mutual support between our measures. The reliable correlations observed between
stated preferences and behavior across conditions suggest that preference
satisfaction can, in principle, serve as an empirically measurable welfare
proxy in some of today's AI systems. Furthermore, our design offered an
illuminating setting for qualitative observation of model behavior. Yet, the
consistency between measures was more pronounced in some models and conditions
than others and responses were not consistent across perturbations. Due to
this, and the background uncertainty about the nature of welfare and the
cognitive states (and welfare subjecthood) of language models, we are currently
uncertain whether our methods successfully measure the welfare state of
language models. Nevertheless, these findings highlight the feasibility of
welfare measurement in language models, inviting further exploration.

Main category: cs.NE

Relevance: 65.0

TL;DR: 本文挑战了神经网络训练中前向传播与反向传播对称性的传统假设，证明只要保持梯度方向，精确的梯度幅度并非必需。实验表明使用更简单或随机的梯度替代品不会损害学习效果，反而可能提升训练稳定性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于梯度的神经网络训练要求激活函数可微分且严格单调，这种前向-后向对称性严重限制了激活函数的选择，特别是排除了具有平坦或不可微分区域的函数。本文旨在打破这一限制，探索更灵活的激活函数设计。

Method: 通过数学分析证明梯度方向比精确幅度更重要，并在MLP、CNN和BNN等基础架构上进行实证实验，使用简化或随机的梯度替代传统梯度，测试包括Heaviside阶跃函数在内的平坦或不可微分激活函数的训练效果。

Result: 实验证实放松前向-后向对称性并使用简化梯度替代品不会损害学习性能，甚至可能提高训练稳定性和效率。使用平坦或不可微分激活函数（如Heaviside函数）的神经网络能够有效训练。

Conclusion: 神经网络训练不需要严格的前向-后向对称性，梯度方向比精确幅度更重要。这一发现扩展了激活函数的设计灵活性，提高了计算效率，为更复杂的架构设计开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Gradient-based neural network training traditionally enforces symmetry
between forward and backward propagation, requiring activation functions to be
differentiable (or sub-differentiable) and strictly monotonic in certain
regions to prevent flat gradient areas. This symmetry, linking forward
activations closely to backward gradients, significantly restricts the
selection of activation functions, particularly excluding those with
substantial flat or non-differentiable regions. In this paper, we challenge
this assumption through mathematical analysis, demonstrating that precise
gradient magnitudes derived from activation functions are largely redundant,
provided the gradient direction is preserved. Empirical experiments conducted
on foundational architectures - such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs),
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) -
confirm that relaxing forward-backward symmetry and substituting traditional
gradients with simpler or stochastic alternatives does not impair learning and
may even enhance training stability and efficiency. We explicitly demonstrate
that neural networks with flat or non-differentiable activation functions, such
as the Heaviside step function, can be effectively trained, thereby expanding
design flexibility and computational efficiency. Further empirical validation
with more complex architectures remains a valuable direction for future
research.

transfer to a tactile-enabled fully actuated four-fingered dexterous robot

Conclusion: LLMs能有效捕捉表面层动机，但在架构推理方面存在困难。其价值在于提供局部化解释，与软件指标结合可形成混合方法，为更系统地优先处理重构提供有前景的路径。

Abstract: Context. Code refactoring improves software quality without changing external
behavior. Despite its advantages, its benefits are hindered by the considerable
cost of time, resources, and continuous effort it demands. Aim. Understanding
why developers refactor, and which metrics capture these motivations, may
support wider and more effective use of refactoring in practice. Method. We
performed a large-scale empirical study to analyze developers refactoring
activity, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify underlying
motivations from version control data, comparing our findings with previous
motivations reported in the literature. Results. LLMs matched human judgment in
80% of cases, but aligned with literature-based motivations in only 47%. They
enriched 22% of motivations with more detailed rationale, often highlighting
readability, clarity, and structural improvements. Most motivations were
pragmatic, focused on simplification and maintainability. While metrics related
to developer experience and code readability ranked highest, their correlation
with motivation categories was weak. Conclusions. We conclude that LLMs
effectively capture surface-level motivations but struggle with architectural
reasoning. Their value lies in providing localized explanations, which, when
combined with software metrics, can form hybrid approaches. Such integration
offers a promising path toward prioritizing refactoring more systematically and
balancing short-term improvements with long-term architectural goals.

Abstract: The article provides an overview of approaches to modeling the human psyche
in the perspective of building an artificial one. Based on the review, a
concept of cognitive architecture is proposed, where the psyche is considered
as an operating system of a living or artificial subject, including a space of
needs that determines its life meanings in connection with stimuli from the
external world, and intelligence as a decision-making system for actions in
relation to this world in order to satisfy these needs. Based on the concept, a
computational formalization is proposed for creating artificial intelligence
systems through learning from experience in the space of a space of needs,
taking into account their biological or existential significance for an
intelligent agent. Thus, the problem of building general artificial
intelligence as a system for making optimal decisions in the space of
agent-specific needs under conditions of uncertainty is formalized, with
maximization of success in achieving goals, minimization of existential risks
and maximization of energy efficiency. A minimal experimental implementation of
the model is also provided.

Abstract: Trustworthy AI requires reasoning systems that are not only powerful but also
transparent and reliable. Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) is central to formal
reasoning, yet classical binary resolution remains limited, as each step
involves only two clauses and eliminates at most two literals. To overcome this
bottleneck, the concept of standard contradiction and the theory of
contradiction-separation-based deduction were introduced in 2018. This paper
advances that framework by focusing on the systematic construction of standard
contradictions. Specially, this study investigates construction methods for two
principal forms of standard contradiction: the maximum triangular standard
contradiction and the triangular-type standard contradiction. Building on these
structures, we propose a procedure for determining the satisfiability and
unsatisfiability of clause sets via maximum standard contradiction.
Furthermore, we derive formulas for computing the number of standard
sub-contradictions embedded within both the maximum triangular standard
contradiction and the triangular-type standard contradiction. The results
presented herein furnish the methodological basis for advancing
contradiction-separation-based dynamic multi-clause automated deduction,
thereby extending the expressive and deductive capabilities of automated
reasoning systems beyond the classical binary paradigm.

Abstract: Ensuring reliable robot operation when visual input is degraded or
insufficient remains a central challenge in robotics. This letter introduces
DepthVision, a framework for multimodal scene understanding designed to address
this problem. Unlike existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which use only
camera-based visual input alongside language, DepthVision synthesizes RGB
images from sparse LiDAR point clouds using a conditional generative
adversarial network (GAN) with an integrated refiner network. These synthetic
views are then combined with real RGB data using a Luminance-Aware Modality
Adaptation (LAMA), which blends the two types of data dynamically based on
ambient lighting conditions. This approach compensates for sensor degradation,
such as darkness or motion blur, without requiring any fine-tuning of
downstream vision-language models. We evaluate DepthVision on real and
simulated datasets across various models and tasks, with particular attention
to safety-critical tasks. The results demonstrate that our approach improves
performance in low-light conditions, achieving substantial gains over RGB-only
baselines while preserving compatibility with frozen VLMs. This work highlights
the potential of LiDAR-guided RGB synthesis for achieving robust robot
operation in real-world environments.

Abstract: Quantum policy evaluation (QPE) is a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm
which is quadratically more efficient than an analogous classical Monte Carlo
estimation. It makes use of a direct quantum mechanical realization of a finite
Markov decision process, in which the agent and the environment are modeled by
unitary operators and exchange states, actions, and rewards in superposition.
Previously, the quantum environment has been implemented and parametrized
manually for an illustrative benchmark using a quantum simulator. In this
paper, we demonstrate how these environment parameters can be learned from a
batch of classical observational data through quantum machine learning (QML) on
quantum hardware. The learned quantum environment is then applied in QPE to
also compute policy evaluations on quantum hardware. Our experiments reveal
that, despite challenges such as noise and short coherence times, the
integration of QML and QPE shows promising potential for achieving quantum
advantage in RL.

further to improve robustness. Both modules are critical to understand the
current outcome from each action and handle unexpected interruptions(such as

Abstract: Neurosymbolic (NeSy) frameworks combine neural representations and learning
with symbolic representations and reasoning. Combining the reasoning
capacities, explainability, and interpretability of symbolic processing with
the flexibility and power of neural computing allows us to solve complex
problems with more reliability while being data-efficient. However, this
recently growing topic poses a challenge to developers with its learning curve,
lack of user-friendly tools, libraries, and unifying frameworks. In this paper,
we characterize the technical facets of existing NeSy frameworks, such as the
symbolic representation language, integration with neural models, and the
underlying algorithms. A majority of the NeSy research focuses on algorithms
instead of providing generic frameworks for declarative problem specification
to leverage problem solving. To highlight the key aspects of Neurosymbolic

Abstract: The integration of Deep Learning (DL) in System Dynamics (SD) modeling for
transportation logistics offers significant advantages in scalability and
predictive accuracy. However, these gains are often offset by the loss of
explainability and causal reliability $-$ key requirements in critical
decision-making systems. This paper presents a novel framework for
interpretable-by-design neural system dynamics modeling that synergizes DL with
techniques from Concept-Based Interpretability, Mechanistic Interpretability,
and Causal Machine Learning. The proposed hybrid approach enables the
construction of neural network models that operate on semantically meaningful
and actionable variables, while retaining the causal grounding and transparency
typical of traditional SD models. The framework is conceived to be applied to
real-world case-studies from the EU-funded project AutoMoTIF, focusing on
data-driven decision support, automation, and optimization of multimodal
logistic terminals. We aim at showing how neuro-symbolic methods can bridge the
gap between black-box predictive models and the need for critical decision
support in complex dynamical environments within cyber-physical systems enabled
by the industrial Internet-of-Things.

Motivation: 现有神经符号AI框架（如DeepProbLog）采用固定的神经处理在前、符号推理在后的流程，限制了处理复杂依赖关系的能力，特别是在图等不规则数据结构中。

Method: 扩展ProbLog引入图神经网络谓词，将符号表示视为图，允许图神经网络处理符号推理，支持神经和符号组件的任意顺序分层。

Conclusion: DeepGraphLog通过将神经符号AI扩展到图结构领域，提供了一个更表达和灵活的神经符号集成框架。

Abstract: Neurosymbolic AI (NeSy) aims to integrate the statistical strengths of neural
networks with the interpretability and structure of symbolic reasoning.
However, current NeSy frameworks like DeepProbLog enforce a fixed flow where
symbolic reasoning always follows neural processing. This restricts their
ability to model complex dependencies, especially in irregular data structures
such as graphs. In this work, we introduce DeepGraphLog, a novel NeSy framework
that extends ProbLog with Graph Neural Predicates. DeepGraphLog enables
multi-layer neural-symbolic reasoning, allowing neural and symbolic components
to be layered in arbitrary order. In contrast to DeepProbLog, which cannot
handle symbolic reasoning via neural methods, DeepGraphLog treats symbolic
representations as graphs, enabling them to be processed by Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs). We showcase the capabilities of DeepGraphLog on tasks in
planning, knowledge graph completion with distant supervision, and GNN
expressivity. Our results demonstrate that DeepGraphLog effectively captures
complex relational dependencies, overcoming key limitations of existing NeSy
systems. By broadening the applicability of neurosymbolic AI to
graph-structured domains, DeepGraphLog offers a more expressive and flexible
framework for neural-symbolic integration.

Abstract: This article comprehensively reviews recent developments and research on deep
learning-based (DL-based) techniques for integrated sensing and communication
(ISAC) systems. ISAC, which combines sensing and communication functionalities,
is regarded as a key enabler for 6G and beyond networks, as many emerging
applications, such as vehicular networks and industrial robotics, necessitate
both sensing and communication capabilities for effective operation. A unified
platform that provides both functions can reduce hardware complexity, alleviate
frequency spectrum congestion, and improve energy efficiency. However,
integrating these functionalities on the same hardware requires highly
optimized signal processing and system design, introducing significant
computational complexity when relying on conventional iterative or
optimization-based techniques. As an alternative to conventional techniques,
DL-based techniques offer efficient and near-optimal solutions with reduced
computational complexity. Hence, such techniques are well-suited for operating
under limited computational resources and low latency requirements in real-time
systems. DL-based techniques can swiftly and effectively yield near-optimal
solutions for a wide range of sophisticated ISAC-related tasks, including
waveform design, channel estimation, sensing signal processing, data
demodulation, and interference mitigation. Therefore, motivated by these
advantages, recent studies have proposed various DL-based approaches for ISAC
system design. After briefly introducing DL architectures and ISAC
fundamentals, this survey presents a comprehensive and categorized review of
state-of-the-art DL-based techniques for ISAC, highlights their key advantages
and major challenges, and outlines potential directions for future research.

Abstract: The widespread use of generative AI has shown remarkable success in producing
highly realistic deepfakes, posing a serious threat to various voice biometric
applications, including speaker verification, voice biometrics, audio
conferencing, and criminal investigations. To counteract this, several
state-of-the-art (SoTA) audio deepfake detection (ADD) methods have been
proposed to identify generative AI signatures to distinguish between real and
deepfake audio. However, the effectiveness of these methods is severely
undermined by anti-forensic (AF) attacks that conceal generative signatures.
These AF attacks span a wide range of techniques, including statistical
modifications (e.g., pitch shifting, filtering, noise addition, and
quantization) and optimization-based attacks (e.g., FGSM, PGD, C \& W, and
DeepFool). In this paper, we investigate the SoTA ADD methods and provide a
comparative analysis to highlight their effectiveness in exposing deepfake
signatures, as well as their vulnerabilities under adversarial conditions. We
conducted an extensive evaluation of ADD methods on five deepfake benchmark
datasets using two categories: raw and spectrogram-based approaches. This
comparative analysis enables a deeper understanding of the strengths and
limitations of SoTA ADD methods against diverse AF attacks. It does not only
highlight vulnerabilities of ADD methods, but also informs the design of more
robust and generalized detectors for real-world voice biometrics. It will
further guide future research in developing adaptive defense strategies that
can effectively counter evolving AF techniques.

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的生成模型能够有效捕捉行星系统中的相关性，为天文学研究提供低成本的大规模合成数据生成能力，可用于指导观测活动。

Abstract: Numerical calculations of planetary system formation are very demanding in
terms of computing power. These synthetic planetary systems can however provide
access to correlations, as predicted in a given numerical framework, between
the properties of planets in the same system. Such correlations can, in return,
be used in order to guide and prioritize observational campaigns aiming at
discovering some types of planets, as Earth-like planets. Our goal is to
develop a generative model which is capable of capturing correlations and
statistical relationships between planets in the same system. Such a model,
trained on the Bern model, offers the possibility to generate large number of
synthetic planetary systems with little computational cost, that can be used,
for example, to guide observational campaigns. Our generative model is based on
the transformer architecture which is well-known to efficiently capture
correlations in sequences and is at the basis of all modern Large Language
Models. To assess the validity of the generative model, we perform visual and
statistical comparisons, as well as a machine learning driven tests. Finally,
as a use case example, we consider the TOI-469 system, in which we aim at
predicting the possible properties of planets c and d, based on the properties
of planet b (the first that has been detected). We show using different
comparison methods that the properties of systems generated by our model are
very similar to the ones of the systems computed directly by the Bern model. We
also show in the case of the TOI-469 system, that using the generative model
allows to predict the properties of planets not yet observed, based on the
properties of the already observed planet. We provide our model to the

Abstract: As the demand for exercising the "right to be forgotten" grows, the need for
verifiable machine unlearning has become increasingly evident to ensure both
transparency and accountability. We present {\em zkUnlearner}, the first
zero-knowledge framework for verifiable machine unlearning, specifically
designed to support {\em multi-granularity} and {\em forgery-resistance}.
  First, we propose a general computational model that employs a {\em
bit-masking} technique to enable the {\em selectivity} of existing
zero-knowledge proofs of training for gradient descent algorithms. This
innovation enables not only traditional {\em sample-level} unlearning but also
more advanced {\em feature-level} and {\em class-level} unlearning. Our model
can be translated to arithmetic circuits, ensuring compatibility with a broad
range of zero-knowledge proof systems. Furthermore, our approach overcomes key
limitations of existing methods in both efficiency and privacy. Second, forging
attacks present a serious threat to the reliability of unlearning.
Specifically, in Stochastic Gradient Descent optimization, gradients from
unlearned data, or from minibatches containing it, can be forged using
alternative data samples or minibatches that exclude it. We propose the first
effective strategies to resist state-of-the-art forging attacks. Finally, we
benchmark a zkSNARK-based instantiation of our framework and perform
comprehensive performance evaluations to validate its practicality.

Abstract: Neural Collaborative Filtering models are widely used in recommender systems
but are typically trained under static settings, assuming fixed data
distributions. This limits their applicability in dynamic environments where
user preferences evolve. Incremental learning offers a promising solution, yet
conventional methods from computer vision or NLP face challenges in
recommendation tasks due to data sparsity and distinct task paradigms. Existing
approaches for neural recommenders remain limited and often lack
generalizability. To address this, we propose MEGG, Replay Samples with
Maximally Extreme GGscore, an experience replay based incremental learning
framework. MEGG introduces GGscore, a novel metric that quantifies sample
influence, enabling the selective replay of highly influential samples to
mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Being model-agnostic, MEGG integrates
seamlessly across architectures and frameworks. Experiments on three neural
models and four benchmark datasets show superior performance over
state-of-the-art baselines, with strong scalability, efficiency, and
robustness. Implementation will be released publicly upon acceptance.

Abstract: The relentless growth of large-scale artificial intelligence (AI) has created
unprecedented demand for computational power, straining the energy, bandwidth,

integrated circuits (EPICs) have emerged as a compelling platform for
next-generation AI systems, offering inherent advantages in ultra-high
bandwidth, low latency, and energy efficiency for computing and
interconnection. Beyond performance, EPICs also hold unique promises for
sustainability. Fabricated in relaxed process nodes with fewer metal layers and
lower defect densities, photonic devices naturally reduce embodied carbon
footprint (CFP) compared to advanced digital electronic integrated circuits,
while delivering orders-of-magnitude higher computing performance and
interconnect bandwidth. To further advance the sustainability of photonic AI
systems, we explore how electronic-photonic design automation (EPDA) and
cross-layer co-design methodologies can amplify these inherent benefits. We

device-circuit-architecture co-design unlocks new sustainability gains for
photonic hardware: ultra-compact photonic circuit designs that minimize chip
area cost, reconfigurable hardware topology that adapts to evolving AI
workloads, and intelligent resilience mechanisms that prolong lifetime by
tolerating variations and faults. By uniting intrinsic photonic efficiency with
EPDA- and co-design-driven gains in area efficiency, reconfigurability, and

Our method, Adversarial Alignment of TSFM Embeddings forces the distributions
of source and target embeddings to align within this space, facilitating label

Motivation: 研究AI技术对传统艺术领域的复杂影响，探索其作为颠覆性力量还是增强工具的双重角色，旨在为AI在艺术领域的合理应用提供指导。

Method: 通过案例分析和数据展示，考察生成对抗网络、扩散模型、文本到图像生成器等AI技术在视觉艺术、表演艺术和工艺美术中的应用效果。

Result: AI能够民主化创意表达、提高生产力、保护文化遗产，但也带来艺术真实性威胁、数据伦理问题和社会经济影响（如失业风险）。

Conclusion: AI的影响具有情境依赖性，需要发展伦理指南、协作方法和包容性技术开发，使AI成为艺术进化的机制而非艺术家灵魂的替代品。

Abstract: The introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the domains of
traditional art (visual arts, performing arts, and crafts) has sparked a
complicated discussion about whether this might be an agent of disruption or an
enhancement of our traditional art forms. This paper looks at the duality of
AI, exploring the ways that recent technologies like Generative Adversarial
Networks and Diffusion Models, and text-to-image generators are changing the
fields of painting, sculpture, calligraphy, dance, music, and the arts of
craft. Using examples and data, we illustrate the ways that AI can democratize
creative expression, improve productivity, and preserve cultural heritage,
while also examining the negative aspects, including: the threats to
authenticity within art, ethical concerns around data, and issues including
socio-economic factors such as job losses. While we argue for the
context-dependence of the impact of AI (the potential for creative
homogenization and the devaluation of human agency in artmaking), we also
illustrate the potential for hybrid practices featuring AI in cuisine, etc. We
advocate for the development of ethical guidelines, collaborative approaches,
and inclusive technology development. In sum, we are articulating a vision of
AI in which it amplifies our innate creativity while resisting the displacement
of the cultural, nuanced, and emotional aspects of traditional art. The future
will be determined by human choices about how to govern AI so that it becomes a
mechanism for artistic evolution and not a substitute for the artist's soul.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) across industry,
government, and education highlights the urgent need for robust frameworks to
conceptualise and guide engagement. This paper introduces the Hierarchy of
Engagement with AI model, a novel maturity framework inspired by Maslow's
hierarchy of needs. The model conceptualises AI adoption as a progression
through eight levels, beginning with initial exposure and basic understanding
and culminating in ecosystem collaboration and societal impact. Each level
integrates technical, organisational, and ethical dimensions, emphasising that
AI maturity is not only a matter of infrastructure and capability but also of
trust, governance, and responsibility. Initial validation of the model using
four diverse case studies (General Motors, the Government of Estonia, the
University of Texas System, and the African Union AI Strategy) demonstrate the
model's contextual flexibility across various sectors. The model provides
scholars with a framework for analysing AI maturity and offers practitioners
and policymakers a diagnostic and strategic planning tool to guide responsible
and sustainable AI engagement. The proposed model demonstrates that AI maturity
progression is multi-dimensional, requiring technological capability, ethical
integrity, organisational resilience, and ecosystem collaboration.

Motivation: 解决现有歌声合成系统依赖概率建模而缺乏对动态属性（如响度变化）精确控制的问题，专注于音乐表现力中至关重要的动态控制。

Method: 使用从真实频谱图中提取的能量序列显式条件化SVS模型，并提出音素级能量序列以实现用户友好控制，减少标注成本并提高可控性。

Result: 实验表明，与基线和能量预测模型相比，该方法在音素级输入的能量序列平均绝对误差上实现了超过50%的减少，且不损害合成质量。

Conclusion: 这是首次在SVS中实现用户驱动的动态控制，为可控歌声合成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Controllable Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) aims to generate expressive
singing voices reflecting user intent. While recent SVS systems achieve high
audio quality, most rely on probabilistic modeling, limiting precise control
over attributes such as dynamics. We address this by focusing on dynamic
control--temporal loudness variation essential for musical expressiveness--and
explicitly condition the SVS model on energy sequences extracted from
ground-truth spectrograms, reducing annotation costs and improving
controllability. We also propose a phoneme-level energy sequence for
user-friendly control. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt
enabling user-driven dynamics control in SVS. Experiments show our method
achieves over 50% reduction in mean absolute error of energy sequences for
phoneme-level inputs compared to baseline and energy-predictor models, without
compromising synthesis quality.

Conclusion: 研究强调了矢量特定评估的必要性，并为未来文本到SVG生成模型的基准测试提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Generated Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) images demand evaluation criteria
tuned to their symbolic and vectorial nature: criteria that existing metrics
such as FID, LPIPS, or CLIPScore fail to satisfy. In this paper, we introduce
SVGauge, the first human-aligned, reference based metric for text-to-SVG
generation. SVGauge jointly measures (i) visual fidelity, obtained by
extracting SigLIP image embeddings and refining them with PCA and whitening for
domain alignment, and (ii) semantic consistency, captured by comparing
BLIP-2-generated captions of the SVGs against the original prompts in the
combined space of SBERT and TF-IDF. Evaluation on the proposed SHE benchmark
shows that SVGauge attains the highest correlation with human judgments and
reproduces system-level rankings of eight zero-shot LLM-based generators more
faithfully than existing metrics. Our results highlight the necessity of
vector-specific evaluation and provide a practical tool for benchmarking future
text-to-SVG generation models.

Abstract: Next to decision tree and k-nearest neighbours algorithms deep convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) are widely used to classify audio data in many domains

spectral and rhythm features like mel-scaled spectrograms, mel-frequency
cepstral coefficients (MFCC), cyclic tempograms, short-time Fourier transform

normalized statistics (CENS) chromagrams can be used as digital image input

features for audio category level as well as audio class level classification
is investigated in detail with a deep CNN and the ESC-50 dataset with 2,000

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is essential for diagnosing conditions
such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration.
Accurate retinal layer segmentation enables quantitative biomarkers critical
for clinical decision-making, but manual segmentation is time-consuming and
variable, while conventional deep learning models often lack interpretability.
This work proposes an improved SegNet-based deep learning framework for
automated and interpretable retinal layer segmentation. Architectural
innovations, including modified pooling strategies, enhance feature extraction
from noisy OCT images, while a hybrid loss function combining categorical
cross-entropy and Dice loss improves performance for thin and imbalanced
retinal layers. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) is
integrated to provide visual explanations, allowing clinical validation of
model decisions. Trained and validated on the Duke OCT dataset, the framework
achieved 95.77% validation accuracy, a Dice coefficient of 0.9446, and a
Jaccard Index (IoU) of 0.8951. Class-wise results confirmed robust performance
across most layers, with challenges remaining for thinner boundaries. Grad-CAM
visualizations highlighted anatomically relevant regions, aligning segmentation
with clinical biomarkers and improving transparency. By combining architectural
improvements, a customized hybrid loss, and explainable AI, this study delivers
a high-performing SegNet-based framework that bridges the gap between accuracy
and interpretability. The approach offers strong potential for standardizing
OCT analysis, enhancing diagnostic efficiency, and fostering clinical trust in
AI-driven ophthalmic tools.

Result: SMIA攻击在模拟真实环境条件下对最先进模型进行综合评估：对组合VAS/CM系统达到至少82%的攻击成功率，对独立说话人验证系统达到至少97.5%，对反欺骗措施达到100%的成功率。

Conclusion: 当前安全防护措施无法有效应对自适应对抗攻击，迫切需要向下一代防御范式转变，采用能够随威胁环境演变的动态、上下文感知框架。

Abstract: Voice Authentication Systems (VAS) use unique vocal characteristics for
verification. They are increasingly integrated into high-security sectors such
as banking and healthcare. Despite their improvements using deep learning, they
face severe vulnerabilities from sophisticated threats like deepfakes and
adversarial attacks. The emergence of realistic voice cloning complicates
detection, as systems struggle to distinguish authentic from synthetic audio.
While anti-spoofing countermeasures (CMs) exist to mitigate these risks, many
rely on static detection models that can be bypassed by novel adversarial
methods, leaving a critical security gap. To demonstrate this vulnerability, we
propose the Spectral Masking and Interpolation Attack (SMIA), a novel method
that strategically manipulates inaudible frequency regions of AI-generated
audio. By altering the voice in imperceptible zones to the human ear, SMIA
creates adversarial samples that sound authentic while deceiving CMs. We
conducted a comprehensive evaluation of our attack against state-of-the-art
(SOTA) models across multiple tasks, under simulated real-world conditions.
SMIA achieved a strong attack success rate (ASR) of at least 82% against
combined VAS/CM systems, at least 97.5% against standalone speaker verification
systems, and 100% against countermeasures. These findings conclusively
demonstrate that current security postures are insufficient against adaptive
adversarial attacks. This work highlights the urgent need for a paradigm shift
toward next-generation defenses that employ dynamic, context-aware frameworks
capable of evolving with the threat landscape.

Abstract: This study explores how the selection of neuron models and learning rules

inspired neuron models, including Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF), metaneurons,
and probabilistic Levy-Baxter (LB) neurons, across multiple learning rules,
including spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), tempotron, and
reward-modulated updates. A novel element of this work is the integration of a
complexity-based decision mechanism into the evaluation pipeline. Using
Lempel-Ziv Complexity (LZC), a measure related to entropy rate, we quantify the
structural regularity of spike trains and assess classification outcomes in a
consistent and interpretable manner across different SNN configurations. To
investigate neural dynamics and assess algorithm performance, we employed
synthetic datasets with varying temporal dependencies and stochasticity levels.
These included Markov and Poisson processes, well-established models to
simulate neuronal spike trains and capture the stochastic firing behavior of
biological neurons.Validation of synthetic Poisson and Markov-modeled data
reveals clear performance trends: classification accuracy depends on the
interaction between neuron model, network size, and learning rule, with the
LZC-based evaluation highlighting configurations that remain robust to weak or
noisy signals. This work delivers a systematic analysis of how neuron model
selection interacts with network parameters and learning strategies, supported
by a novel complexity-based evaluation approach that offers a consistent
benchmark for SNN performance.

Abstract: Multi-criteria decision-making methods provide decision-makers with
appropriate tools to make better decisions in uncertain, complex, and
conflicting situations. Fuzzy set theory primarily deals with the uncertainty
inherent in human thoughts and perceptions and attempts to quantify this
uncertainty. Fuzzy logic and fuzzy set theory are utilized with multi-criteria
decision-making methods because they effectively handle uncertainty and
fuzziness in decision-makers' judgments, allowing for verbal judgments of the
problem. This study utilizes the Fermatean fuzzy environment, a generalization
of fuzzy sets. An optimization model based on the deviation maximization method
is proposed to determine partially known feature weights. This method is
combined with interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy sets. The proposed method was
applied to the problem of selecting renewable energy sources. The reason for
choosing renewable energy sources is that meeting energy needs from renewable
sources, balancing carbon emissions, and mitigating the effects of global
climate change are among the most critical issues of the recent period. Even
though selecting renewable energy sources is a technical issue, the managerial
and political implications of this issue are also important, and are discussed

Abstract: The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) plays a central role in regulating the
body's responses to stress and maintaining physiological stability. Its
dysregulation is associated with a wide range of conditions, from
cardiovascular disease to anxiety disorders. Skin nerve activity (SKNA)
extracted from high-frequency electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings provides a
noninvasive window into SNS dynamics, but its measurement is highly susceptible
to electromyographic (EMG) contamination. Traditional preprocessing based on
bandpass filtering within a fixed range (e.g., 500--1000 Hz) is susceptible to
overlapping EMG and SKNA spectral components, especially during sustained
muscle activity. We present a denoising approach using a lightweight
one-dimensional convolutional autoencoder with a long short-term memory (LSTM)
bottleneck to reconstruct clean SKNA from EMG-contaminated recordings. Using
clean ECG-derived SKNA data from cognitive stress experiments and EMG noise
from chaotic muscle stimulation recordings, we simulated contamination at
realistic noise levels (--4 dB, --8 dB signal-to-noise ratio) and trained the
model in the leave-one-subject-out cross-validation framework. The method
improved signal-to-noise ratio by up to 9.65 dB, increased cross correlation
with clean SKNA from 0.40 to 0.72, and restored burst-based SKNA features to
near-clean discriminability (AUROC $\geq$ 0.96). Classification of baseline
versus sympathetic stimulation (cognitive stress) conditions reached accuracies
of 91--98\% across severe noise levels, comparable to clean data. These results
demonstrate that deep learning--based reconstruction can preserve
physiologically relevant sympathetic bursts during substantial EMG
interference, enabling more robust SKNA monitoring in naturalistic,
movement-rich environments.

Abstract: The evolution of the traditional power grid into the "smart grid" has
resulted in a fundamental shift in energy management, which allows the
integration of renewable energy sources with modern communication technology.
However, this interconnection has increased smart grids' vulnerability to
attackers, which might result in privacy breaches, operational interruptions,
and massive outages. The SCADA-based smart grid protocols are critical for
real-time data collection and control, but they are vulnerable to attacks like
unauthorized access and denial of service (DoS). This research proposes a
hybrid deep learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) intended to improve
the cybersecurity of smart grids. The suggested model takes advantage of
Convolutional Neural Networks' (CNN) feature extraction capabilities as well as
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks' temporal pattern recognition skills.
DNP3 and IEC104 intrusion detection datasets are employed to train and test our
CNN-LSTM model to recognize and classify the potential cyber threats. Compared
to other deep learning approaches, the results demonstrate considerable
improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with a detection
accuracy of 99.70%.

Method: 通过采样几何设计参数和飞行条件生成数据集，使用PointNet回归器从表面点云预测几何参数，然后通过FiLM网络结合预测参数和飞行条件来预测点状系数。

Result: 实验显示在不同BWB构型上表面预测误差较低。

Conclusion: BlendedNet填补了非常规构型数据空白，促进了数据驱动空气动力学代理建模的研究。

Abstract: BlendedNet is a publicly available aerodynamic dataset of 999 blended wing
body (BWB) geometries. Each geometry is simulated across about nine flight
conditions, yielding 8830 converged RANS cases with the Spalart-Allmaras model
and 9 to 14 million cells per case. The dataset is generated by sampling
geometric design parameters and flight conditions, and includes detailed
pointwise surface quantities needed to study lift and drag. We also introduce
an end-to-end surrogate framework for pointwise aerodynamic prediction. The
pipeline first uses a permutation-invariant PointNet regressor to predict
geometric parameters from sampled surface point clouds, then conditions a
Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) network on the predicted parameters and
flight conditions to predict pointwise coefficients Cp, Cfx, and Cfz.
Experiments show low errors in surface predictions across diverse BWBs.
BlendedNet addresses data scarcity for unconventional configurations and
enables research on data-driven surrogate modeling for aerodynamic design.

Motivation: 帕金森病误诊率高，现有基于肠道微生物的深度学习模型大多使用单一分类器，忽略了菌株间相关性和时间动态，需要更鲁棒的特征提取方法

Method: 收集39对帕金森患者和健康配偶的肠道微生物数据，开发RFRE特征选择框架（随机森林+递归特征消除），结合生态学知识，设计混合分类模型捕捉微生物数据的时空模式

Result: 论文提出了BDPM特征提取器，能够识别差异丰富的分类群，增强生物可解释性，但具体性能指标未在摘要中提供

Conclusion: 该方法为帕金森病的微生物组数据分析提供了新的特征提取框架，具有更好的生物解释性

Abstract: Background: Parkinson's disease remains a major neurodegenerative disorder
with high misdiagnosis rates, primarily due to reliance on clinical rating
scales. Recent studies have demonstrated a strong association between gut
microbiota and Parkinson's disease, suggesting that microbial composition may
serve as a promising biomarker. Although deep learning models based ongut
microbiota show potential for early prediction, most approaches rely on single
classifiers and often overlook inter-strain correlations or temporal dynamics.
Therefore, there is an urgent need for more robust feature extraction methods
tailored to microbiome data. Methods: We proposed BDPM (A Machine
Learning-Based Feature Extractor for Parkinson's Disease Classification via Gut
Microbiota Analysis). First, we collected gut microbiota profiles from 39
Parkinson's patients and their healthy spouses to identify differentially
abundant taxa. Second, we developed an innovative feature selection framework
named RFRE (Random Forest combined with Recursive Feature Elimination),
integrating ecological knowledge to enhance biological interpretability.
Finally, we designed a hybrid classification model to capture temporal and
spatial patterns in microbiome data.

Motivation: 6G网络中极大规模天线阵列(ELAA)需要处理近场区域的空间稀疏性，传统远场平面波假设失效，需要开发新的信道估计方法。

Method: 推导了三种波模型的SNR闭式表达式，提出基于混合球面-平面波模型的SD-OMP算法（将极坐标域推广到联合考虑仰角、方位角和距离）和tensor-OMP算法（利用信道张量结构）。

Result: 仿真结果显示tensor-OMP在NMSE性能上与SD-OMP相当，但计算复杂度更低，可扩展性更好。

Conclusion: 混合球面-平面波模型在建模精度和分析可处理性之间取得了良好平衡，tensor-OMP为分布式近场通信系统提供了高效的信道估计解决方案。

Abstract: Extremely large antenna array (ELAA) is key to enhancing spectral efficiency
in 6G networks. Leveraging the distributed nature of multi-unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV) systems enables the formation of distributed ELAA, which often
operate in the near-field region with spatial sparsity, rendering the
conventional far-field plane wave assumption invalid. This paper investigates
channel estimation for distributed near-field multi-UAV communication systems.
We first derive closed-form signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) expressions under the
plane wave model (PWM), spherical wave model (SWM), and a hybrid
spherical-plane wave model (HSPWM), also referred to as the cross-field model,
within a distributed uniform planar array (UPA) scenario. The analysis shows
that HSPWM achieves a good balance between modeling accuracy and analytical
tractability. Based on this, we propose two channel estimation algorithms: the
spherical-domain orthogonal matching pursuit (SD-OMP) and the tensor-OMP. The
SD-OMP generalizes the polar domain to jointly consider elevation, azimuth, and
range. Under the HSPWM, the channel is naturally formulated as a tensor,
enabling the use of tensor-OMP. Simulation results demonstrate that tensor-OMP
achieves normalized mean square error (NMSE) performance comparable to SD-OMP,
while offering reduced computational complexity and improved scalability.

context of Software-Defined Internet of Vehicles (SD-IoV), this study addresses
the significant challenge of network security in rapidly evolving vehicular
communication systems. This research focuses on optimizing a Random Forest
Classifier model to achieve maximum accuracy and minimal detection time,

Abstract: Aiming at the shortcomings of the gazelle optimization algorithm, such as the
imbalance between exploration and exploitation and the insufficient information
exchange within the population, this paper proposes a multi-strategy improved
gazelle optimization algorithm (MSIGOA). To address these issues, MSIGOA
proposes an iteration-based updating framework that switches between
exploitation and exploration according to the optimization process, which
effectively enhances the balance between local exploitation and global
exploration in the optimization process and improves the convergence speed. Two
adaptive parameter tuning strategies improve the applicability of the algorithm
and promote a smoother optimization process. The dominant population-based
restart strategy enhances the algorithms ability to escape from local optima
and avoid its premature convergence. These enhancements significantly improve
the exploration and exploitation capabilities of MSIGOA, bringing superior
convergence and efficiency in dealing with complex problems. In this paper, the
parameter sensitivity, strategy effectiveness, convergence and stability of the
proposed method are evaluated on two benchmark test sets including CEC2017 and
CEC2022. Test results and statistical tests show that MSIGOA outperforms basic
GOA and other advanced algorithms. On the CEC2017 and CEC2022 test sets, the
proportion of functions where MSIGOA is not worse than GOA is 92.2% and 83.3%,
respectively, and the proportion of functions where MSIGOA is not worse than
other algorithms is 88.57% and 87.5%, respectively. Finally, the extensibility
of MSIGAO is further verified by several engineering design optimization
problems.

Abstract: Interatomic potentials (IPs) with wide elemental coverage and high accuracy
are powerful tools for high-throughput materials discovery. While the past few
years witnessed the development of multiple new universal IPs that cover wide
ranges of the periodic table, their applicability to target chemical systems
should be carefully investigated. We benchmark several universal IPs using
equilibrium zeolite structures as testbeds. We select a diverse set of
universal IPs encompassing two major categories: (i) universal analytic IPs,
including GFN-FF, UFF, and Dreiding; (ii) pretrained universal machine learning
IPs (MLIPs), comprising CHGNet, ORB-v3, MatterSim, eSEN-30M-OAM, PFP-v7, and
EquiformerV2-lE4-lF100-S2EFS-OC22. We compare them with established tailor-made
IPs, SLC, ClayFF, and BSFF using experimental data and density functional
theory (DFT) calculations with dispersion correction as the reference. The
tested zeolite structures comprise pure silica frameworks and aluminosilicates
containing copper species, potassium, and organic cations. We found that GFN-FF
is the best among the tested universal analytic IPs, but it does not achieve
satisfactory accuracy for highly strained silica rings and aluminosilicate
systems. All MLIPs can well reproduce experimental or DFT-level geometries and
energetics. Among the universal MLIPs, the eSEN-30M-OAM model shows the most
consistent performance across all zeolite structures studied. These findings
show that the modern pretrained universal MLIPs are practical tools in zeolite
screening workflows involving various compositions.

Abstract: How should well-being be prioritised in society, and what trade-offs are
people willing to make between fairness and personal well-being? We investigate
these questions using a stated preference experiment with a nationally
representative UK sample (n = 300), in which participants evaluated life
satisfaction outcomes for both themselves and others under conditions of
uncertainty. Individual-level utility functions were estimated using an
Expected Utility Maximisation (EUM) framework and tested for sensitivity to the
overweighting of small probabilities, as characterised by Cumulative Prospect
Theory (CPT). A majority of participants displayed concave (risk-averse)
utility curves and showed stronger aversion to inequality in societal life
satisfaction outcomes than to personal risk. These preferences were unrelated
to political alignment, suggesting a shared normative stance on fairness in
well-being that cuts across ideological boundaries. The results challenge use
of average life satisfaction as a policy metric, and support the development of
nonlinear utility-based alternatives that more accurately reflect collective
human values. Implications for public policy, well-being measurement, and the
design of value-aligned AI systems are discussed.

Abstract: Physical activity is a modifiable lifestyle factor with potential to support
cognitive resilience. However, the association of moderate-to-vigorous physical
activity (MVPA) intensity, and timing, with cognitive function and
region-specific brain structure remain poorly understood. We analyzed data from
45,892 UK Biobank participants aged 60 years and older with valid wrist-worn
accelerometer data, cognitive testing, and structural brain MRI. MVPA was
measured both continuously (mins per week) and categorically (thresholded using
>=150 min/week based on WHO guidelines). Associations with cognitive
performance and regional brain volumes were evaluated using multivariable
linear models adjusted for demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related
covariates. We conducted secondary analyses on MVPA timing and subgroup
effects. Higher MVPA was associated with better performance across cognitive
domains, including reasoning, memory, executive function, and processing speed.
These associations persisted in fully adjusted models and were higher among
participants meeting WHO guidelines. Greater MVPA was also associated with
subcortical brain regions (caudate, putamen, pallidum, thalamus), as well as
regional gray matter volumes involved in emotion, working memory, and
perceptual processing. Secondary analyses showed that MVPA at any time of day
was associated with cognitive functions and brain volume particularly in the
midday-afternoon and evening. Sensitivity analysis shows consistent findings
across subgroups, with evidence of dose-response relationships. Higher MVPA is
associated with preserved brain structure and enhanced cognitive function in
later life. Public health strategies to increase MVPA may support healthy
cognitive aging and generate substantial economic benefits, with global gains
projected to reach USD 760 billion annually by 2050.

408 scans and 1224 datasets using Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Haar wavelet-based Perceptual Similarity

Abstract: Large language models excel at basic reasoning but struggle with tasks that

Conclusion: CARE框架通过精确干预、及时纠正和有效自校正，实现了优越的安全-质量权衡，为大语言模型的安全部署提供了有效的解码时解决方案

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, ensuring the safety of their outputs during decoding has become a
critical challenge. However, existing decoding-time interventions, such as
Contrastive Decoding, often force a severe trade-off between safety and
response quality. In this work, we propose CARE, a novel framework for
decoding-time safety alignment that integrates three key components: (1) a
guard model for real-time safety monitoring, enabling detection of potentially
unsafe content; (2) a rollback mechanism with a token buffer to correct unsafe
outputs efficiently at an earlier stage without disrupting the user experience;
and (3) a novel introspection-based intervention strategy, where the model
generates self-reflective critiques of its previous outputs and incorporates
these reflections into the context to guide subsequent decoding steps. The
framework achieves a superior safety-quality trade-off by using its guard model
for precise interventions, its rollback mechanism for timely corrections, and

Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide
range of tasks, yet their large parameter sizes pose challenges for practical
deployment, especially in decentralized environments. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT), such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), reduces local computing
and memory overhead, making it attractive for federated learning. However,
existing federated LoRA methods typically assume uniform rank configurations
and unimodal inputs, overlooking two key real-world challenges: (1)
heterogeneous client resources have different LoRA ranks, and (2) multimodal
data settings with potentially missing modalities. In this work, we propose
FediLoRA, a simple yet effective framework for federated multimodal fine-tuning
under heterogeneous LoRA ranks and missing modalities. FediLoRA introduces a
dimension-wise aggregation strategy that reweights LoRA updates without
information dilution during aggregation. It also includes a lightweight
layer-wise model editing method that selectively incorporates global parameters
to repair local components which improves both client and global model
performances. Experimental results on three multimodal benchmark datasets
demonstrate that FediLoRA achieves superior performance over competitive
baselines in both global and personalized settings, particularly in the
presence of modality incompleteness.

Abstract: The increasing size of large neural network models, specifically language
models and foundational image models, poses deployment challenges, prompting
efforts to reduce memory requirements and enhance computational efficiency.
These efforts are critical to ensure practical deployment and effective
utilization of these models across various applications. In this work, a novel
type of neural network layers and models is developed that uses only single-bit
parameters. In this novel type of models all parameters of all layers,
including kernel weights and biases, only have values equal to zero or one.
This novel type of models uses layers named as binary normalized layer. These
binary normalized layers can be of any type, such as fully connected,
convolutional, attention, etc., and they consist of slight variations of the
corresponding conventional layers. To show the effectiveness of the binary
normalized layers, two different models are configured to solve a multiclass
image classification problem and a language decoder to predict the next token
of a sequence. The model to solve the image classification has convolutional
and fully connected layers, and the language model is composed of transformer
blocks with multi-head attention. The results show that models with binary
normalized layers present almost the same results obtained by equivalent models
with real 32-bit parameters. The binary normalized layers allow to develop
models that use 32 times less memory than current models and have equivalent
performance. Besides, the binary normalized layers can be easily implemented on
current computers using 1-bit arrays, and do not require the development of
dedicated electronic hardware. This novel type of layers opens a new era for
large neural network models with reduced memory requirements that can be
deployed using simple and cheap hardware, such as mobile devices or only cpus.

Abstract: Graph foundation models (GFMs) have recently emerged as a promising paradigm
for achieving broad generalization across various graph data. However, existing
GFMs are often trained on datasets that were shown to poorly represent
real-world graphs, limiting their generalization performance. In contrast,
tabular foundation models (TFMs) not only excel at classical tabular prediction
tasks but have also shown strong applicability in other domains such as time
series forecasting, natural language processing, and computer vision. Motivated
by this, we take an alternative view to the standard perspective of GFMs and
reformulate node classification as a tabular problem. Each node can be
represented as a row with feature, structure, and label information as columns,
enabling TFMs to directly perform zero-shot node classification via in-context
learning. In this work, we introduce TabGFM, a graph foundation model framework
that first converts a graph into a table via feature and structural encoders,
applies multiple TFMs to diversely subsampled tables, and then aggregates their
outputs through ensemble selection. Through experiments on 28 real-world
datasets, TabGFM achieves consistent improvements over task-specific GNNs and
state-of-the-art GFMs, highlighting the potential of tabular reformulation for
scalable and generalizable graph learning.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability has identified functional subgraphs within large
language models (LLMs), known as Transformer Circuits (TCs), that appear to
implement specific algorithms. Yet we lack a formal, single-pass way to
quantify when an active circuit is behaving coherently and thus likely
trustworthy. Building on prior systems-theoretic proposals, we specialize a
sheaf/cohomology and causal emergence perspective to TCs and introduce the
Effective-Information Consistency Score (EICS). EICS combines (i) a normalized
sheaf inconsistency computed from local Jacobians and activations, with (ii) a
Gaussian EI proxy for circuit-level causal emergence derived from the same
forward state. The construction is white-box, single-pass, and makes units
explicit so that the score is dimensionless. We further provide practical
guidance on score interpretation, computational overhead (with fast and exact
modes), and a toy sanity-check analysis. Empirical validation on LLM tasks is
deferred.

Motivation: 在基于可验证奖励的强化学习（RLVR）微调大语言模型时，经常出现多尝试性能（Pass@k）下降和灾难性遗忘的问题。现有方法对散度项的选择和功能缺乏系统研究，标准RLVR目标缺乏知识保留机制。

Method: 提出DPH-RL框架，使用mass-covering f-divergences（如前向KL散度和JS散度）作为排练机制，持续参考初始策略，强制模型保持广泛的解决方案覆盖范围。该方法通过生成函数计算f散度，只需要从初始策略采样，无需在线参考模型。

Result: 在数学和SQL生成任务上的实验表明，DPH-RL不仅解决了Pass@k退化问题，还同时提高了域内和域外的Pass@1和Pass@k性能，且训练效率更高。

Conclusion: 散度度量的正确选择是构建更通用和多样化推理模型的有力工具，DPH-RL为改进RLVR提供了一个关键但被忽视的维度。

Abstract: A central paradox in fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) is the frequent
degradation of multi-attempt performance (Pass@k) despite improvements in
single-attempt accuracy (Pass@1). This is often accompanied by catastrophic
forgetting, where models lose previously acquired skills. While various methods
have been proposed, the choice and function of the divergence term have been
surprisingly unexamined as a proactive solution. We argue that standard RLVR
objectives -- both those using the mode-seeking reverse KL-divergence and those
forgoing a divergence term entirely -- lack a crucial mechanism for knowledge
retention. The reverse-KL actively accelerates this decay by narrowing the
policy, while its absence provides no safeguard against the model drifting from
its diverse knowledge base. We propose a fundamental shift in perspective:
using the divergence term itself as the solution. Our framework,
Diversity-Preserving Hybrid RL (DPH-RL), leverages mass-covering f-divergences
(like forward-KL and JS-divergence) to function as a rehearsal mechanism. By
continuously referencing the initial policy, this approach forces the model to
maintain broad solution coverage. Extensive experiments on math and SQL
generation demonstrate that DPH-RL not only resolves the Pass@k degradation but
improves both Pass@1 and Pass@k in- and out-of-domain. Additionally, DPH-RL is
more training-efficient because it computes f-divergence using generator
functions, requiring only sampling from the initial policy and no online
reference model. Our work highlights a crucial, overlooked axis for improving
RLVR, demonstrating that the proper selection of a divergence measure is a
powerful tool for building more general and diverse reasoning models.

Abstract: We propose $\Delta L$ Normalization, a simple yet effective loss aggregation
method tailored to the characteristic of dynamic generation lengths in
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Recently, RLVR has
demonstrated strong potential in improving the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs), but a major challenge lies in the large variability of
response lengths during training, which leads to high gradient variance and
unstable optimization. Although previous methods such as GRPO, DAPO, and Dr.
GRPO introduce different loss normalization terms to address this issue, they
either produce biased estimates or still suffer from high gradient variance. By
analyzing the effect of varying lengths on policy loss both theoretically and
empirically, we reformulate the problem as finding a minimum-variance unbiased
estimator. Our proposed $\Delta L$ Normalization not only provides an unbiased
estimate of the true policy loss but also minimizes gradient variance in
theory. Extensive experiments show that it consistently achieves superior
results across different model sizes, maximum lengths, and tasks. Our code will

Conclusion: MoE模型中不同层次专家对压缩误差的敏感性不同，需要分层制定压缩策略，浅层和深层专家可容忍更高压缩率，中层专家需要更保守的压缩

Abstract: With the widespread application of Mixture of Experts (MoE) reasoning models
in the field of LLM learning, efficiently serving MoE models under limited GPU
memory constraints has emerged as a significant challenge. Offloading the
non-activated experts to main memory has been identified as an efficient
approach to address such a problem, while it brings the challenges of
transferring the expert between the GPU memory and main memory. We need to
explore an efficient approach to compress the expert and analyze how the
compression error affects the inference performance.
  To bridge this gap, we propose employing error-bounded lossy compression
algorithms (such as SZ3 and CuSZp) to compress non-activated experts, thereby
reducing data transfer overhead during MoE inference. We conduct extensive
experiments across various benchmarks and present a comprehensive analysis of
how compression-induced errors in different experts affect overall inference
accuracy. The results indicate that experts in the shallow layers, which are
primarily responsible for the attention mechanism and the transformation of
input tokens into vector representations, exhibit minimal degradation in
inference accuracy when subjected to bounded errors. In contrast, errors in the
middle-layer experts, which are central to model reasoning, significantly
impair inference accuracy. Interestingly, introducing bounded errors in the
deep-layer experts, which are mainly responsible for instruction following and
output integration, can sometimes lead to improvements in inference accuracy.

Motivation: 标准注意力机制的低维投影会导致高维输入信息丢失，且对所有输入对使用相同的评分函数，缺乏对序列中相邻token的距离依赖性计算偏置。

Method: 使用计算高效的结构化矩阵（BTT和MLR）构建高秩评分函数，这些矩阵能够编码全秩或距离依赖的计算偏置。

Conclusion: BTT和MLR属于一个更广泛的能够编码全秩或距离依赖计算偏置的高效结构化矩阵家族，有效解决了标准注意力的重要缺陷。

Abstract: The core component of attention is the scoring function, which transforms the
inputs into low-dimensional queries and keys and takes the dot product of each
pair. While the low-dimensional projection improves efficiency, it causes
information loss for certain tasks that have intrinsically high-dimensional
inputs. Additionally, attention uses the same scoring function for all input
pairs, without imposing a distance-dependent compute bias for neighboring
tokens in the sequence. In this work, we address these shortcomings by
proposing new scoring functions based on computationally efficient structured
matrices with high ranks, including Block Tensor-Train (BTT) and Multi-Level
Low Rank (MLR) matrices. On in-context regression tasks with high-dimensional
inputs, our proposed scoring functions outperform standard attention for any
fixed compute budget. On language modeling, a task that exhibits locality
patterns, our MLR-based attention method achieves improved scaling laws
compared to both standard attention and variants of sliding window attention.
Additionally, we show that both BTT and MLR fall under a broader family of
efficient structured matrices capable of encoding either full-rank or
distance-dependent compute biases, thereby addressing significant shortcomings
of standard attention. Finally, we show that MLR attention has promising
results for long-range time-series forecasting.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have scaled rapidly in size and complexity,
requiring increasingly intricate parallelism for distributed training, such as
3D parallelism. This sophistication motivates a shift toward simpler, more
debuggable programming paradigm like Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD).
However, SPMD in eager execution introduces two key challenges: ensuring
consistency with single-device execution and achieving high performance at
scale. In this paper, we introduce veScale, an eager-mode training system that
fully embraces SPMD paradigm to democratize distributed tensor programming.
veScale addresses the prevalent issue of inconsistent results in systems like
PyTorch by introducing a novel algorithm of distributed Random Number
Generation (RNG) compatible with arbitrary sharded operators. veScale also
significantly boosts training performance by reducing PyTorch primitive's
overhead and improving communication efficiency. Evaluations show that veScale

Result: 相比现有方法，在热力学稳定性、独特性和新颖性方面提高了约50%的生成率，无条件生成和空间群条件生成分别实现了115%和50%的改进

Conclusion: 证明了将自然语言处理的后训练技术应用于材料设计的潜力，为靶向高效的新材料发现开辟了新途径

Abstract: Discovering novel materials is critical for technological advancements such
as solar cells, batteries, and carbon capture. However, the development of new
materials is constrained by a slow and expensive trial-and-error process. To
accelerate this pipeline, we introduce PLaID++, a Large Language Model (LLM)
fine-tuned for stable and property-guided crystal generation. We fine-tune
Qwen-2.5 7B to generate crystal structures using a novel Wyckoff-based text
representation. We show that generation can be effectively guided with a
reinforcement learning technique based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO),
with sampled structures categorized by their stability, novelty, and space
group. By encoding symmetry constraints directly into text and guiding model
outputs towards desirable chemical space, PLaID++ generates structures that are
thermodynamically stable, unique, and novel at a $\sim$50\% greater rate than
prior methods and conditionally generates structures with desired space group
properties. Our experiments highlight the effectiveness of iterative DPO,
achieving $\sim$115\% and $\sim$50\% improvements in unconditional and space
group conditioned generation, respectively, compared to fine-tuning alone. Our
work demonstrates the potential of adapting post-training techniques from
natural language processing to materials design, paving the way for targeted
and efficient discovery of novel materials.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ALICE是一个用于解密替换密码的编码器Transformer，在仅训练1500个密码样本后就能泛化到未见过的密码，并通过可解释的解码头和早期退出分析揭示了其类似人类的分层解密策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究神经网络在组合复杂领域中的泛化能力，密码解密任务提供了理想的测试平台，因为其具有26!种可能的映射组合，需要模型在没有明确密码信息的情况下进行推理。

Method: 开发了ALICE架构：简单的编码器Transformer，使用新颖的双射解码头通过Gumbel-Sinkhorn方法显式建模排列，支持直接提取学习到的密码映射。采用早期退出分析来研究模型的分层处理过程。

Result: ALICE在准确性和速度上都达到了新的最先进水平，仅用约1500个独特密码（占可能密码空间的3.7×10^{-24}）训练后就能泛化到未见过的密码。分析显示模型分层处理：早期层使用基于频率的启发式，中间层形成单词结构，最终层修正单个字符。

Conclusion: 该架构和分析方法可推广到任何具有双射映射和组合结构的领域，为神经网络泛化能力和可解释性提供了新的见解。密码解密任务可作为研究组合复杂领域中神经网络行为的有效测试平台。

Abstract: We present cryptogram solving as an ideal testbed for studying neural network
generalization in combinatorially complex domains. In this task, models must
decrypt text encoded with substitution ciphers, choosing from 26! possible
mappings without explicit access to the cipher. We develop ALICE (an
Architecture for Learning Interpretable Cryptogram dEcipherment): a simple
encoder-only Transformer that sets a new state-of-the-art for both accuracy and
speed on this decryption problem. Surprisingly, ALICE generalizes to unseen
ciphers after training on only ${\sim}1500$ unique ciphers, a minute fraction
($3.7 \times 10^{-24}$) of the possible cipher space. To enhance
interpretability, we introduce a novel bijective decoding head that explicitly
models permutations via the Gumbel-Sinkhorn method, enabling direct extraction
of learned cipher mappings. Through early exit analysis, we reveal how ALICE
progressively refines its predictions in a way that appears to mirror common
human strategies for this task: early layers employ frequency-based heuristics,
middle layers form word structures, and final layers correct individual
characters. Our architectural innovations and analysis methods extend beyond
cryptograms to any domain with bijective mappings and combinatorial structure,
offering new insights into neural network generalization and interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络对伪相关敏感，现有方法主要处理不完全伪相关，但完全伪相关会导致模型泛化根本性的欠定问题，需要新方法来解决这种underspecification

Method: 提出ACE方法：1)学习一组与训练数据一致但对新未标注输入做出不同预测的概念；2)采用自训练方法鼓励自信和选择性分歧；3)支持先验知识编码和无监督模型选择

Result: ACE在完全伪相关基准测试中匹配或超越现有方法，同时对不完全伪相关保持鲁棒性；在语言模型对齐的测量篡改检测基准中，无需访问不可信测量即可获得竞争性性能

Conclusion: ACE在解决模型欠定问题方面取得显著进展，虽然仍存在重要限制，但为克服underspecification提供了有效方法

Abstract: Deep neural networks are notoriously sensitive to spurious correlations -
where a model learns a shortcut that fails out-of-distribution. Existing work
on spurious correlations has often focused on incomplete
correlations,leveraging access to labeled instances that break the correlation.
But in cases where the spurious correlations are complete, the correct
generalization is fundamentally \textit{underspecified}. To resolve this
underspecification, we propose learning a set of concepts that are consistent
with training data but make distinct predictions on a subset of novel unlabeled
inputs. Using a self-training approach that encourages \textit{confident} and
\textit{selective} disagreement, our method ACE matches or outperforms existing
methods on a suite of complete-spurious correlation benchmarks, while remaining
robust to incomplete spurious correlations. ACE is also more configurable than
prior approaches, allowing for straight-forward encoding of prior knowledge and
principled unsupervised model selection. In an early application to
language-model alignment, we find that ACE achieves competitive performance on
the measurement tampering detection benchmark \textit{without} access to
untrusted measurements. While still subject to important limitations, ACE
represents significant progress towards overcoming underspecification.

Motivation: 现有图自监督学习方法主要在单数据集上开发和评估，缺乏对跨数据集迁移性的系统研究，限制了知识迁移和大规模预训练的发展

Method: 在ogbn-papers100M上进行大规模预训练，评估5种代表性SSL方法在多样化目标图上的表现，标准化实验设置分离混杂因素

Result: 大多数图SSL方法泛化困难，有些甚至比随机初始化更差；GraphMAE方法在迁移性能上表现一致优异

Conclusion: 为图学习的"预训练-迁移"范式奠定基础，提供指导未来可迁移图SSL研究的见解

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown great promise in graph
representation learning. However, most existing graph SSL methods are developed
and evaluated under a single-dataset setting, leaving their cross-dataset
transferability largely unexplored and limiting their ability to leverage
knowledge transfer and large-scale pretraining, factors that are critical for
developing generalized intelligence beyond fitting training data. To address
this gap and advance foundation model research for graphs, we present GSTBench,
the first systematic benchmark for evaluating the transferability of graph SSL
methods. We conduct large-scale pretraining on ogbn-papers100M and evaluate
five representative SSL methods across a diverse set of target graphs. Our
standardized experimental setup decouples confounding factors such as model
architecture, dataset characteristics, and adaptation protocols, enabling
rigorous comparisons focused solely on pretraining objectives. Surprisingly, we
observe that most graph SSL methods struggle to generalize, with some
performing worse than random initialization. In contrast, GraphMAE, a masked
autoencoder approach, consistently improves transfer performance. We analyze
the underlying factors that drive these differences and offer insights to guide
future research on transferable graph SSL, laying a solid foundation for the
"pretrain-then-transfer" paradigm in graph learning. Our code is available at

Result: 在多个基准测试中：推理FLOPs减少6.0倍；在甲烷配置数据集上H100吞吐量提高10倍以上；CNN中推理FLOPs减少1.6-2.1倍（CIFAR-10）和1.7倍（ImageNet-1k）

Conclusion: lmKANs提供了线性层的高效替代方案，在保持模型灵活性的同时显著降低计算成本

Abstract: High-dimensional linear mappings, or linear layers, dominate both the
parameter count and the computational cost of most modern deep-learning models.
We introduce a general drop-in replacement, lookup multivariate
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (lmKANs), which deliver a substantially better
trade-off between capacity and inference cost. Our construction expresses a
general high-dimensional mapping through trainable low-dimensional multivariate
functions. These functions can carry dozens or hundreds of trainable parameters
each, and yet it takes only a few multiplications to compute them because they
are implemented as spline lookup tables. Empirically, lmKANs reduce inference
FLOPs by up to 6.0x while matching the flexibility of MLPs in general
high-dimensional function approximation. In another feedforward fully connected
benchmark, on the tabular-like dataset of randomly displaced methane
configurations, lmKANs enable more than 10x higher H100 throughput at equal
accuracy. Within frameworks of Convolutional Neural Networks, lmKAN-based CNNs
cut inference FLOPs at matched accuracy by 1.6-2.1x and by 1.7x on the CIFAR-10

Conclusion: 量化过程会加剧模型的不公平性，需要专门的公平性优化技术来确保量化神经网络的可信部署。提出的混合精度QAT方法能有效缓解这一问题。

Abstract: Post Training Quantization (PTQ) is widely adopted due to its high
compression capacity and speed with minimal impact on accuracy. However, we
observed that disparate impacts are exacerbated by quantization, especially for
minority groups. Our analysis explains that in the course of quantization there
is a chain of factors attributed to a disparate impact across groups during
forward and backward passes. We explore how the changes in weights and
activations induced by quantization cause cascaded impacts in the network,
resulting in logits with lower variance, increased loss, and compromised group
accuracies. We extend our study to verify the influence of these impacts on
group gradient norms and eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix, providing insights
into the state of the network from an optimization point of view. To mitigate
these effects, we propose integrating mixed precision Quantization Aware
Training (QAT) with dataset sampling methods and weighted loss functions,
therefore providing fair deployment of quantized neural networks.

Abstract: In multi-task learning (MTL), gradient conflict poses a significant

CAGrad, and GradNorm, in their original implementations are computationally

adaptive arbitration mechanism. We evaluated GCond on self-supervised learning
tasks using MobileNetV3-Small and ConvNeXt architectures on the ImageNet 1K
dataset and a combined head and neck CT scan dataset, comparing the proposed
method against baseline linear combinations and state-of-the-art gradient
conflict resolution methods. The stochastic mode of GCond achieved a two-fold
computational speedup while maintaining optimization quality, and demonstrated
superior performance across all evaluated metrics, achieving lower L1 and SSIM
losses compared to other methods on both datasets. GCond exhibited high
scalability, being successfully applied to both compact models
(MobileNetV3-Small) and large architectures (ConvNeXt-tiny and ConvNeXt-Base).
It also showed compatibility with modern optimizers such as AdamW and
Lion/LARS. Therefore, GCond offers a scalable and efficient solution to the
problem of gradient conflicts in multi-task learning.

Abstract: The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) provides evidence-based
guidelines for cancer treatment. Translating complex patient presentations into
guideline-compliant treatment recommendations is time-intensive, requires
specialized expertise, and is prone to error. Advances in large language model
(LLM) capabilities promise to reduce the time required to generate treatment
recommendations and improve accuracy. We present an LLM agent-based approach to
automatically generate guideline-concordant treatment trajectories for patients
with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our contributions are threefold.
First, we construct a novel longitudinal dataset of 121 cases of NSCLC patients
that includes clinical encounters, diagnostic results, and medical histories,
each expertly annotated with the corresponding NCCN guideline trajectories by
board-certified oncologists. Second, we demonstrate that existing LLMs possess
domain-specific knowledge that enables high-quality proxy benchmark generation
for both model development and evaluation, achieving strong correlation
(Spearman coefficient r=0.88, RMSE = 0.08) with expert-annotated benchmarks.
Third, we develop a hybrid approach combining expensive human annotations with
model consistency information to create both the agent framework that predicts
the relevant guidelines for a patient, as well as a meta-classifier that
verifies prediction accuracy with calibrated confidence scores for treatment
recommendations (AUROC=0.800), a critical capability for communicating the
accuracy of outputs, custom-tailoring tradeoffs in performance, and supporting
regulatory compliance. This work establishes a framework for clinically viable
LLM-based guideline adherence systems that balance accuracy, interpretability,
and regulatory requirements while reducing annotation costs, providing a
scalable pathway toward automated clinical decision support.

Abstract: In heterogeneous multi-task learning, tasks not only exhibit diverse
observation and action spaces but also vary substantially in intrinsic
difficulty. While conventional multi-task world models like UniZero excel in
single-task settings, we find that when handling large-scale heterogeneous
environments, gradient conflicts and the loss of model plasticity often
constrain their sample and computational efficiency. In this work, we address
these challenges from two perspectives: the single learning iteration and the
overall learning process. First, we investigate the impact of key design spaces
on extending UniZero to multi-task planning. We find that a Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) architecture provides the most substantial performance gains by
mitigating gradient conflicts, leading to our proposed model,
\textit{ScaleZero}. Second, to dynamically balance the computational load
across the learning process, we introduce an online, LoRA-based \textit{dynamic
parameter scaling} (DPS) strategy. This strategy progressively integrates LoRA
adapters in response to task-specific progress, enabling adaptive knowledge
retention and parameter expansion. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks
such as Atari, DMControl (DMC), and Jericho demonstrate that ScaleZero, relying
exclusively on online reinforcement learning with one model, attains
performance on par with specialized single-task baselines. Furthermore, when
augmented with our dynamic parameter scaling strategy, our method achieves
competitive performance while requiring only 80\% of the single-task
environment interaction steps. These findings underscore the potential of
ScaleZero for effective large-scale multi-task learning. Our code is available

preservation, by keeping sensitive multi-modal student and institutional data
local; (ii) personalization, through modular architectures enabling tailored
models for students, instructors, and institutions; and (iii) equity and
inclusivity, by facilitating participation from underrepresented and
resource-constrained entities. We finally identify various open research

regulations, (ii) the non-uniformity of data modalities' characteristics, (iii)
the unlearning approaches for M3T FedFMs, (iv) the continual learning

To resolve this gap between theory and practice, we first propose a novel

both theoretically and empirically. Under the novel smoothness assumption, we
study the convergence properties of gradient descent (GD) in both deterministic
and stochastic settings. It is shown that learning rate warmup consistently

Personalized Information Environments (PIEs), i.e., algorithmically induced
filter bubbles that constrain content diversity. These adapted PKGs are used to
construct structured prompts that steer the language model toward more diverse,
Out-PIE recommendations while preserving topical relevance. We introduce a
family of symbolic adaptation strategies, including soft reweighting, hard

Conclusion: 将确定性任务树整合到LLM推理管道中可以显著提高自动化网络安全评估的准确性和效率

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven interest in
automating cybersecurity penetration testing workflows, offering the promise of
faster and more consistent vulnerability assessment for enterprise systems.
Existing LLM agents for penetration testing primarily rely on self-guided
reasoning, which can produce inaccurate or hallucinated procedural steps. As a
result, the LLM agent may undertake unproductive actions, such as exploiting
unused software libraries or generating cyclical responses that repeat prior
tactics. In this work, we propose a guided reasoning pipeline for penetration
testing LLM agents that incorporates a deterministic task tree built from the
MITRE ATT&CK Matrix, a proven penetration testing kll chain, to constrain the
LLM's reaoning process to explicitly defined tactics, techniques, and
procedures. This anchors reasoning in proven penetration testing methodologies
and filters out ineffective actions by guiding the agent towards more
productive attack procedures. To evaluate our approach, we built an automated
penetration testing LLM agent using three LLMs (Llama-3-8B, Gemini-1.5, and
GPT-4) and applied it to navigate 10 HackTheBox cybersecurity exercises with
103 discrete subtasks representing real-world cyberattack scenarios. Our
proposed reasoning pipeline guided the LLM agent through 71.8\%, 72.8\%, and
78.6\% of subtasks using Llama-3-8B, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4, respectively.
Comparatively, the state-of-the-art LLM penetration testing tool using
self-guided reasoning completed only 13.5\%, 16.5\%, and 75.7\% of subtasks and
required 86.2\%, 118.7\%, and 205.9\% more model queries. This suggests that
incorporating a deterministic task tree into LLM reasoning pipelines can
enhance the accuracy and efficiency of automated cybersecurity assessments

Abstract: Traffic demand prediction plays a critical role in intelligent transportation
systems. Existing traffic prediction models primarily rely on temporal traffic
data, with limited efforts incorporating human knowledge and experience for
urban traffic demand forecasting. However, in real-world scenarios, traffic
knowledge and experience derived from human daily life significantly influence
precise traffic prediction. Such knowledge and experiences can guide the model
in uncovering latent patterns within traffic data, thereby enhancing the
accuracy and robustness of predictions. To this end, this paper proposes
integrating structured temporal traffic data with textual data representing
human knowledge and experience, resulting in a novel knowledge-guided
cross-modal feature representation learning (KGCM) model for traffic demand
prediction. Based on regional transportation characteristics, we construct a
prior knowledge dataset using a large language model combined with manual
authoring and revision, covering both regional and global knowledge and
experiences. The KGCM model then learns multimodal data features through
designed local and global adaptive graph networks, as well as a cross-modal
feature fusion mechanism. A proposed reasoning-based dynamic update strategy
enables dynamic optimization of the graph model's parameters, achieving optimal
performance. Experiments on multiple traffic datasets demonstrate that our
model accurately predicts future traffic demand and outperforms existing
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.

Abstract: A common challenge with supervised machine learning (ML) in high energy
physics (HEP) is the reliance on simulations for labeled data, which can often
mismodel the underlying collision or detector response. To help mitigate this
problem of domain shift, we propose RINO (Renormalization Group Invariance with
No Labels), a self-supervised learning approach that can instead pretrain
models directly on collision data, learning embeddings invariant to
renormalization group flow scales. In this work, we pretrain a
transformer-based model on jets originating from quantum chromodynamic (QCD)
interactions from the JetClass dataset, emulating real QCD-dominated
experimental data, and then finetune on the JetNet dataset -- emulating
simulations -- for the task of identifying jets originating from top quark
decays. RINO demonstrates improved generalization from the JetNet training data
to JetClass data compared to supervised training on JetNet from scratch,
demonstrating the potential for RINO pretraining on real collision data
followed by fine-tuning on small, high-quality MC datasets, to improve the
robustness of ML models in HEP.

Result: 72.0%的运行通过测试，检测模型和编译后端特别容易出现漂移，主要由于非确定性后处理。确定性适配器和选择性回退可以显著提高一致性。

Conclusion: 这是第一个系统量化并减轻深度学习跨后端漂移的统一框架，为异构运行时的可靠部署提供了可重复的方法论。

Abstract: This paper presents a configuration-first framework for evaluating
cross-backend compatibility in deep learning systems deployed on CPU, GPU, and
compiled runtimes. The framework decouples experiments from code using YAML,
supports both library and repository models, and employs a three-tier
verification protocol covering tensor-level closeness, activation alignment,
and task-level metrics. Through 672 checks across multiple models and tolerance
settings, we observe that 72.0% of runs pass, with most discrepancies occurring
under stricter thresholds. Our results show that detection models and compiled
backends are particularly prone to drift, often due to nondeterministic
post-processing. We further demonstrate that deterministic adapters and
selective fallbacks can substantially improve agreement without significant
performance loss. To our knowledge, this is the first unified framework that
systematically quantifies and mitigates cross-backend drift in deep learning,
providing a reproducible methodology for dependable deployment across
heterogeneous runtimes.

Conclusion: 所提出的DRL环境建模方法有效提升了FJSP调度性能，证明了环境建模在DRL调度中的重要性。

Abstract: The Flexible Job-shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP) is a classical combinatorial
optimization problem that has a wide-range of applications in the real world.
In order to generate fast and accurate scheduling solutions for FJSP, various
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) scheduling methods have been developed.
However, these methods are mainly focused on the design of DRL scheduling
Agent, overlooking the modeling of DRL environment. This paper presents a
simple chronological DRL environment for FJSP based on discrete event
simulation and an end-to-end DRL scheduling model is proposed based on the
proximal policy optimization (PPO). Furthermore, a short novel state
representation of FJSP is proposed based on two state variables in the
scheduling environment and a novel comprehensible reward function is designed
based on the scheduling area of machines. Experimental results on public
benchmark instances show that the performance of simple priority dispatching
rules (PDR) is improved in our scheduling environment and our DRL scheduling
model obtains competing performance compared with OR-Tools, meta-heuristic, DRL
and PDR scheduling methods.

Abstract: The Bayesian paradigm offers principled tools for sequential decision-making
under uncertainty, but its reliance on a probabilistic model for all parameters
can hinder the incorporation of complex structural constraints. We introduce a
minimalist Bayesian framework that places a prior only on the component of
interest, such as the location of the optimum. Nuisance parameters are
eliminated via profile likelihood, which naturally handles constraints. As a
direct instantiation, we develop a MINimalist Thompson Sampling (MINTS)
algorithm. Our framework accommodates structured problems, including
continuum-armed Lipschitz bandits and dynamic pricing. It also provides a
probabilistic lens on classical convex optimization algorithms such as the
center of gravity and ellipsoid methods. We further analyze MINTS for
multi-armed bandits and establish near-optimal regret guarantees.

Abstract: This paper presents a methodological approach to financial time series
analysis by combining causal discovery and uncertainty-aware forecasting. As a
case study, we focus on four key U.S. macroeconomic indicators -- GDP, economic
growth, inflation, and unemployment -- and we apply the LPCMCI framework with
Gaussian Process Distance Correlation (GPDC) to uncover dynamic causal
relationships in quarterly data from 1970 to 2021. Our results reveal a robust
unidirectional causal link from economic growth to GDP and highlight the
limited connectivity of inflation, suggesting the influence of latent factors.
Unemployment exhibits strong autoregressive dependence, motivating its use as a
case study for probabilistic forecasting. Leveraging the Chronos framework, a
large language model trained for time series, we perform zero-shot predictions
on unemployment. This approach delivers accurate forecasts one and two quarters
ahead, without requiring task-specific training. Crucially, the model's
uncertainty-aware predictions yield 90\% confidence intervals, enabling
effective anomaly detection through statistically principled deviation
analysis. This study demonstrates the value of combining causal structure
learning with probabilistic language models to inform economic policy and
enhance forecasting robustness.

Conclusion: Fed-REACT能有效处理联邦学习中的异构和演化数据问题，提升模型性能

Abstract: Motivated by the high resource costs and privacy concerns associated with
centralized machine learning, federated learning (FL) has emerged as an
efficient alternative that enables clients to collaboratively train a global
model while keeping their data local. However, in real-world deployments,
client data distributions often evolve over time and differ significantly
across clients, introducing heterogeneity that degrades the performance of
standard FL algorithms. In this work, we introduce Fed-REACT, a federated
learning framework designed for heterogeneous and evolving client data.
Fed-REACT combines representation learning with evolutionary clustering in a
two-stage process: (1) in the first stage, each client learns a local model to
extracts feature representations from its data; (2) in the second stage, the
server dynamically groups clients into clusters based on these representations
and coordinates cluster-wise training of task-specific models for downstream
objectives such as classification or regression. We provide a theoretical
analysis of the representation learning stage, and empirically demonstrate that
Fed-REACT achieves superior accuracy and robustness on real-world datasets.

Abstract: We introduce a robust framework for learning various generalized Hamiltonian
dynamics from noisy, sparse phase-space data and in an unsupervised manner
based on variational Bayesian inference. Although conservative, dissipative,
and port-Hamiltonian systems might share the same initial total energy of a
closed system, it is challenging for a single Hamiltonian network model to
capture the distinctive and varying motion dynamics and physics of a phase
space, from sampled observational phase space trajectories. To address this
complicated Hamiltonian manifold learning challenge, we extend sparse
symplectic, random Fourier Gaussian processes learning with predictive
successive numerical estimations of the Hamiltonian landscape, using a
generalized form of state and conjugate momentum Hamiltonian dynamics,
appropriate to different classes of conservative, dissipative and
port-Hamiltonian physical systems. In addition to the kernelized evidence lower
bound (ELBO) loss for data fidelity, we incorporate stability and conservation
constraints as additional hyper-parameter balanced loss terms to regularize the
model's multi-gradients, enforcing physics correctness for improved prediction
accuracy with bounded uncertainty.

Abstract: Demographic attributes are universally present in electronic health records
and serve as vital predictors in clinical risk stratification and treatment
decisions. Despite their significance, these attributes are often relegated to
auxiliary roles in model design, with limited attention has been given to
learning their representations. This study proposes a General Demographic
Pre-trained (GDP) model as a foundational representation framework tailored to
age and gender. The model is pre-trained and evaluated using datasets with
diverse diseases and population compositions from different geographic regions.
The GDP architecture explores combinations of ordering strategies and encoding
methods to transform tabular demographic inputs into latent embeddings.
Experimental results demonstrate that sequential ordering substantially
improves model performance in discrimination, calibration, and the
corresponding information gain at each decision tree split, particularly in
diseases where age and gender contribute significantly to risk stratification.
Even in datasets where demographic attributes hold relatively low predictive
value, GDP enhances the representational importance, increasing their influence
in downstream gradient boosting models. The findings suggest that foundational
models for tabular demographic attributes can generalize across tasks and
populations, offering a promising direction for improving predictive
performance in healthcare applications.

richer representations by capturing multimodality and uncertainty at the level
of individual neurons, while retaining the scalability of standard feedforward
networks. We demonstrate that uGMM-NN can achieve competitive discriminative
performance compared to conventional multilayer perceptrons, while additionally
offering a probabilistic interpretation of activations. The proposed framework

Conclusion: IBN为带有缺失变量的多元时间序列预测提供了更可靠和可解释的框架

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) often faces challenges from
missing variables, which hinder conventional spatial-temporal graph neural
networks in modeling inter-variable correlations. While GinAR addresses
variable missing using attention-based imputation and adaptive graph learning
for the first time, it lacks interpretability and fails to capture more latent
temporal patterns due to its simple recursive units (RUs). To overcome these
limitations, we propose the Interpretable Bidirectional-modeling Network (IBN),
integrating Uncertainty-Aware Interpolation (UAI) and Gaussian kernel-based
Graph Convolution (GGCN). IBN estimates the uncertainty of reconstructed values
using MC Dropout and applies an uncertainty-weighted strategy to mitigate
high-risk reconstructions. GGCN explicitly models spatial correlations among
variables, while a bidirectional RU enhances temporal dependency modeling.
Extensive experiments show that IBN achieves state-of-the-art forecasting
performance under various missing-rate scenarios, providing a more reliable and
interpretable framework for MTSF with missing variables. Code is available at:

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of Online Convex-Concave Optimization,
which extends Online Convex Optimization to two-player time-varying
convex-concave games. The goal is to minimize the dynamic duality gap (D-DGap),
a critical performance measure that evaluates players' strategies against
arbitrary comparator sequences. Existing algorithms fail to deliver optimal
performance, particularly in stationary or predictable environments. To address
this, we propose a novel modular algorithm with three core components: an
Adaptive Module that dynamically adjusts to varying levels of non-stationarity,
a Multi-Predictor Aggregator that identifies the best predictor among multiple
candidates, and an Integration Module that effectively combines their
strengths. Our algorithm achieves a minimax optimal D-DGap upper bound, up to a
logarithmic factor, while also ensuring prediction error-driven D-DGap bounds.
The modular design allows for the seamless replacement of components that
regulate adaptability to dynamic environments, as well as the incorporation of
components that integrate ``side knowledge'' from multiple predictors.
Empirical results further demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of the
proposed method.

Abstract: Given a continuous finitely piecewise linear function $f:\mathbb{R}^{n_0} \to
\mathbb{R}$ and a fixed architecture $(n_0,\ldots,n_k;1)$ of feedforward ReLU
neural networks, the exact function realization problem is to determine when
some network with the given architecture realizes $f$. To develop a systematic
way to answer these questions, we establish a connection between toric geometry
and ReLU neural networks. This approach enables us to utilize numerous
structures and tools from algebraic geometry to study ReLU neural networks.
Starting with an unbiased ReLU neural network with rational weights, we define
the ReLU fan, the ReLU toric variety, and the ReLU Cartier divisor associated
with the network. This work also reveals the connection between the tropical
geometry and the toric geometry of ReLU neural networks. As an application of
the toric geometry framework, we prove a necessary and sufficient criterion of
functions realizable by unbiased shallow ReLU neural networks by computing
intersection numbers of the ReLU Cartier divisor and torus-invariant curves.

Abstract: The Trapped Gyro-Landau Fluid (TGLF) model provides fast, accurate
predictions of turbulent transport in tokamaks, but whole device simulations
requiring thousands of evaluations remain computationally expensive. Neural
network (NN) surrogates offer accelerated inference with fully differentiable
approximations that enable gradient-based coupling but typically require large
training datasets to capture transport flux variations across plasma
conditions, creating significant training burden and limiting applicability to
expensive gyrokinetic simulations. We propose \textbf{TGLF-SINN
(Spectra-Informed Neural Network)} with three key innovations: (1) principled
feature engineering that reduces target prediction range, simplifying the
learning task; (2) physics-guided regularization of transport spectra to
improve generalization under sparse data; and (3) Bayesian Active Learning
(BAL) to strategically select training samples based on model uncertainty,
reducing data requirements while maintaining accuracy. Our approach achieves
superior performance with significantly less training data. In offline
settings, TGLF-SINN reduces logarithmic root mean squared error (LRMSE) by 12.
4\% compared to the current baseline \base. Using only 25\% of the complete
dataset with BAL, we achieve LRMSE only 0.0165 higher than \base~and 0.0248
higher than our offline model (0.0583). In downstream flux matching
applications, our NN surrogate provides 45x speedup over TGLF while maintaining
comparable accuracy, demonstrating potential for training efficient surrogates
for higher-fidelity models where data acquisition is costly and sparse.

Motivation: 随着去中心化AI和边缘智能的普及，分布式环境中的鲁棒性和可信性变得至关重要。传统去中心化算法容易受到数据污染的影响，因为它们通常依赖简单统计量（如均值或和），因此需要更鲁棒的统计方法。

Abstract: As decentralized AI and edge intelligence become increasingly prevalent,
ensuring robustness and trustworthiness in such distributed settings has become
a critical issue-especially in the presence of corrupted or adversarial data.
Traditional decentralized algorithms are vulnerable to data contamination as
they typically rely on simple statistics (e.g., means or sum), motivating the
need for more robust statistics. In line with recent work on decentralized
estimation of trimmed means and ranks, we develop gossip algorithms for
computing a broad class of rank-based statistics, including L-statistics and
rank statistics-both known for their robustness to outliers. We apply our
method to perform robust distributed two-sample hypothesis testing, introducing
the first gossip algorithm for Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. We provide rigorous
convergence guarantees, including the first convergence rate bound for
asynchronous gossip-based rank estimation. We empirically validate our
theoretical results through experiments on diverse network topologies.

Abstract: Causal relationships play a fundamental role in understanding the world
around us. The ability to identify and understand cause-effect relationships is
critical to making informed decisions, predicting outcomes, and developing
effective strategies. However, deciphering causal relationships from
observational data is a difficult task, as correlations alone may not provide
definitive evidence of causality. In recent years, the field of machine
learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool, offering new opportunities for
uncovering hidden causal mechanisms and better understanding complex systems.
In this work, we address the issue of detecting the intrinsic causal links of a
large class of complex systems in the framework of the response theory in
physics. We develop some theoretical ideas put forward by [1], and technically
we use state-of-the-art ML techniques to build up models from data. We consider
both linear stochastic and non-linear systems. Finally, we compute the
asymptotic efficiency of the linear response based causal predictor in a case
of large scale Markov process network of linear interactions.

Abstract: Modern paradigms for robot imitation train expressive policy architectures on
large amounts of human demonstration data. Yet performance on contact-rich,
deformable-object, and long-horizon tasks plateau far below perfect execution,
even with thousands of expert demonstrations. This is due to the inefficiency
of existing ``expert'' data collection procedures based on human teleoperation.
To address this issue, we introduce RaC, a new phase of training on
human-in-the-loop rollouts after imitation learning pre-training. In RaC, we
fine-tune a robotic policy on human intervention trajectories that illustrate
recovery and correction behaviors. Specifically, during a policy rollout, human
operators intervene when failure appears imminent, first rewinding the robot
back to a familiar, in-distribution state and then providing a corrective
segment that completes the current sub-task. Training on this data composition
expands the robotic skill repertoire to include retry and adaptation behaviors,
which we show are crucial for boosting both efficiency and robustness on
long-horizon tasks. Across three real-world bimanual control tasks: shirt
hanging, airtight container lid sealing, takeout box packing, and a simulated
assembly task, RaC outperforms the prior state-of-the-art using 10$\times$ less
data collection time and samples. We also show that RaC enables test-time
scaling: the performance of the trained RaC policy scales linearly in the
number of recovery maneuvers it exhibits. Videos of the learned policy are
available at https://rac-scaling-robot.github.io/.

Abstract: Normalization layers are crucial for deep learning, but their Euclidean
formulations are inadequate for data on manifolds. On the other hand, many
Riemannian manifolds in machine learning admit gyro-structures, enabling
principled extensions of Euclidean neural networks to non-Euclidean domains.
Inspired by this, we introduce GyroBN, a principled Riemannian batch
normalization framework for gyrogroups. We establish two necessary conditions,
namely \emph{pseudo-reduction} and \emph{gyroisometric gyrations}, that
guarantee GyroBN with theoretical control over sample statistics, and show that
these conditions hold for all known gyrogroups in machine learning. Our
framework also incorporates several existing Riemannian normalization methods
as special cases. We further instantiate GyroBN on seven representative
geometries, including the Grassmannian, five constant curvature spaces, and the
correlation manifold, and derive novel gyro and Riemannian structures to enable
these instantiations. Experiments across these geometries demonstrate the
effectiveness of GyroBN. The code is available at

Abstract: Survival analysis is a fundamental tool for modeling time-to-event outcomes
in healthcare. Recent advances have introduced flexible neural network
approaches for improved predictive performance. However, most of these models
do not provide interpretable insights into the association between exposures
and the modeled outcomes, a critical requirement for decision-making in
clinical practice. To address this limitation, we propose Additive Deep Hazard
Analysis Mixtures (ADHAM), an interpretable additive survival model. ADHAM
assumes a conditional latent structure that defines subgroups, each
characterized by a combination of covariate-specific hazard functions. To
select the number of subgroups, we introduce a post-training refinement that
reduces the number of equivalent latent subgroups by merging similar groups. We
perform comprehensive studies to demonstrate ADHAM's interpretability at the
population, subgroup, and individual levels. Extensive experiments on
real-world datasets show that ADHAM provides novel insights into the
association between exposures and outcomes. Further, ADHAM remains on par with
existing state-of-the-art survival baselines in terms of predictive
performance, offering a scalable and interpretable approach to time-to-event
prediction in healthcare.

Abstract: Quadratic programming is a workhorse of modern nonlinear optimization,
control, and data science. Although regularized methods offer convergence
guarantees under minimal assumptions on the problem data, they can exhibit the
slow tail-convergence typical of first-order schemes, thus requiring many
iterations to achieve high-accuracy solutions. Moreover, hyperparameter tuning
significantly impacts on the solver performance but how to find an appropriate
parameter configuration remains an elusive research question. To address these
issues, we explore how data-driven approaches can accelerate the solution
process. Aiming at high-accuracy solutions, we focus on a stabilized
interior-point solver and carefully handle its two-loop flow and control
parameters. We will show that reinforcement learning can make a significant
contribution to facilitating the solver tuning and to speeding up the
optimization process. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, after a
lightweight training, the learned policy generalizes well to different problem
classes with varying dimensions and to various solver configurations.

Abstract: In reliability engineering, conventional surrogate models encounter the
"curse of dimensionality" as the number of random variables increases. While
the active learning Kriging surrogate approaches with high-dimensional model
representation (HDMR) enable effective approximation of high-dimensional
functions and are widely applied to optimization problems, there are rare
studies specifically focused on reliability analysis, which prioritizes
prediction accuracy in critical regions over uniform accuracy across the entire
domain. This study develops an active learning surrogate model method based on
the Kriging-HDMR modeling for reliability analysis. The proposed approach
facilitates the approximation of high-dimensional limit state functions through
a composite representation constructed from multiple low-dimensional
sub-surrogate models. The architecture of the surrogate modeling framework
comprises three distinct stages: developing single-variable sub-surrogate
models for all random variables, identifying the requirements for
coupling-variable sub-surrogate models, and constructing the coupling-variable
sub-surrogate models. Optimization mathematical models for selection of design
of experiment samples are formulated based on each stage's characteristics,
with objectives incorporating uncertainty variance, predicted mean, sample
location and inter-sample distances. A candidate sample pool-free approach is
adopted to achieve the selection of informative samples. Numerical experiments
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high computational efficiency
while maintaining strong predictive accuracy in solving high-dimensional
reliability problems.

Abstract: Arrival time prediction (ATP) of public transport vehicles is essential in
improving passenger experience and supporting traffic management. Deep learning
has demonstrated outstanding performance in ATP due to its ability to model
non-linear and temporal dynamics. In the multi-step ATP, non-stationary data
will degrade the model performance due to the variation in variables' joint
distribution along the temporal direction. Previous studies mainly applied
normalization to eliminate the non-stationarity in time series, thereby
achieving better predictability. However, the normalization may obscure useful
characteristics inherent in non-stationarity, which is known as the
over-stationarization. In this work, to trade off predictability and
non-stationarity, a new approach for multi-step ATP, named non-stationary ATP (
NSATP), is proposed. The method consists of two stages: series stationarization
and non-stationarity effect recovery. The first stage aims at improving the
predictability. As for the latter, NSATP extends a state-of-the-art method from
one-dimensional to two dimensional based models to capture the hidden
periodicity in time series and designs a compensation module of
over-stationarization by learning scaling and shifting factors from raw data.
125 days' public transport operational data of Dresden is collected for
validation. Experimental results show that compared to baseline methods, the
proposed NSATP can reduce RMSE, MAE, and MAPE by 2.37%, 1.22%, and 2.26% for
trams and by 1.72%, 0.60%, and 1.17% for buses, respectively.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence deployment for automated photovoltaic (PV) monitoring

transformers (ViT-Tiny, Swin-Tiny) for thermal PV fault detection, using XRAI
saliency analysis to assess alignment with thermal physics principles. This

thermal PV fault detection with physics-validated interpretability. Evaluation
on 20,000 infrared images spanning normal operation and 11 fault categories
shows that Swin Transformer achieves the highest performance (94% binary
accuracy; 73% multiclass accuracy) compared to CNN approaches. XRAI analysis
reveals that models learn physically meaningful features, such as localized
hotspots for cell defects, linear thermal paths for diode failures, and thermal
boundaries for vegetation shading, consistent with expected thermal signatures.
However, performance varies significantly across fault types: electrical faults
achieve strong detection (F1-scores >0.90) while environmental factors like
soiling remain challenging (F1-scores 0.20-0.33), indicating limitations
imposed by thermal imaging resolution. The thermal physics-guided
interpretability approach provides methodology for validating AI
decision-making in energy monitoring applications, addressing deployment
barriers in renewable energy infrastructure.

human biological molecule-protein pathways to generate a predicted efficacy
value. We demonstrate how the method works on a real-world dataset with patient
treatments and outcomes, with two different weight impact score algorithms We
include methods for evaluating the generalisation performance on unseen
treatments, and to characterise conditions under which the approach can be
expected to be most predictive. We discuss specific ways in which our approach

observed data requires a new, expensive training procedure. We present
Inverse-Parameter Basis PINNs (IP-Basis PINNs), a meta-learning framework that
extends the foundational work of Desai et al. (2022) to enable rapid and
efficient inference for inverse problems. Our method employs an offline-online
decomposition: a deep network is first trained offline to produce a rich set of
basis functions that span the solution space of a parametric differential
equation. For each new inverse problem online, this network is frozen, and
solutions and parameters are inferred by training only a lightweight linear
output layer against observed data. Key innovations that make our approach
effective for inverse problems include: (1) a novel online loss formulation for
simultaneous solution reconstruction and parameter identification, (2) a
significant reduction in computational overhead via forward-mode automatic
differentiation for PDE loss evaluation, and (3) a non-trivial validation and
early-stopping mechanism for robust offline training. We demonstrate the
efficacy of IP-Basis PINNs on three diverse benchmarks, including an extension
to universal PINNs for unknown functional terms-showing consistent performance
across constant and functional parameter estimation, a significant speedup per
query over standard PINNs, and robust operation with scarce and noisy data.

TL;DR: FedTeddi是一种面向联邦边缘学习的时序漂移和发散感知调度算法，针对动态数据演化和通信资源限制，通过量化数据的时间动态性和非独立同分布特性，实现快速收敛。

Motivation: 现实世界中客户端数据具有时变和非独立同分布特性，现有研究大多假设静态数据集，需要开发能够及时高效适应动态数据演化的联邦学习方法。

Conclusion: FedTeddi能够有效处理动态数据演化，使联邦学习系统快速学习新数据而不遗忘先前知识，在资源受限环境下表现优异。

Abstract: Federated edge learning (FEEL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients over wireless networks without exposing raw data. While
most existing studies assume static datasets, in real-world scenarios clients
may continuously collect data with time-varying and non-independent and
identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) characteristics. A critical challenge is
how to adapt models in a timely yet efficient manner to such evolving data. In
this paper, we propose FedTeddi, a temporal-drift-and-divergence-aware
scheduling algorithm that facilitates fast convergence of FEEL under dynamic
data evolution and communication resource limits. We first quantify the
temporal dynamics and non-i.i.d. characteristics of data using temporal drift
and collective divergence, respectively, and represent them as the Earth
Mover's Distance (EMD) of class distributions for classification tasks. We then
propose a novel optimization objective and develop a joint scheduling and
bandwidth allocation algorithm, enabling the FEEL system to learn from new data
quickly without forgetting previous knowledge. Experimental results show that
our algorithm achieves higher test accuracy and faster convergence compared to
benchmark methods, improving the rate of convergence by 58.4% on CIFAR-10 and
49.2% on CIFAR-100 compared to random scheduling.

Method: 提出SBS方法：1）单向排序平滑改善输出空间核平滑性；2）基于排序平滑的自适应随机傅里叶特征，根据层参数数量调节输入编码频率带宽

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet数据集上的ResNet模型评估显示，SBS以更少参数实现了比SOTA更好的重建精度

Conclusion: SBS通过有效抑制频谱偏差，为神经网络权重压缩提供了参数高效的增强方案

Abstract: Implicit neural representations have recently been extended to represent
convolutional neural network weights via neural representation for neural
networks, offering promising parameter compression benefits. However, standard
multi-layer perceptrons used in neural representation for neural networks
exhibit a pronounced spectral bias, hampering their ability to reconstruct
high-frequency details effectively. In this paper, we propose SBS, a
parameter-efficient enhancement to neural representation for neural networks
that suppresses spectral bias using two techniques: (1) a unidirectional
ordering-based smoothing that improves kernel smoothness in the output space,
and (2) unidirectional ordering-based smoothing aware random fourier features
that adaptively modulate the frequency bandwidth of input encodings based on
layer-wise parameter count. Extensive evaluations on various ResNet models with
datasets CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, demonstrate that SBS achieves
significantly better reconstruction accuracy with less parameters compared to
SOTA.

Abstract: We introduce a new convolutional AutoEncoder architecture for user modelling
and recommendation tasks with several improvements over the state of the art.
Firstly, our model has the flexibility to learn a set of associations and
combinations between different interaction types in a way that carries over to
each user and item. Secondly, our model is able to learn jointly from both the
explicit ratings and the implicit information in the sampling pattern (which we
refer to as `implicit feedback'). It can also make separate predictions for the
probability of consuming content and the likelihood of granting it a high
rating if observed. This not only allows the model to make predictions for both
the implicit and explicit feedback, but also increases the informativeness of
the predictions: in particular, our model can identify items which users would
not have been likely to consume naturally, but would be likely to enjoy if
exposed to them. Finally, we provide several generalization bounds for our
model, which to the best of our knowledge, are among the first generalization
bounds for auto-encoders in a Recommender Systems setting; we also show that
optimizing our loss function guarantees the recovery of the exact sampling
distribution over interactions up to a small error in total variation. In
experiments on several real-life datasets, we achieve state-of-the-art
performance on both the implicit and explicit feedback prediction tasks despite
relying on a single model for both, and benefiting from additional
interpretability in the form of individual predictions for the probabilities of
each possible rating.

Abstract: Identifying recurring patterns and rare events in large-scale signals is a
fundamental challenge in fields such as astronomy, physical simulations, and
biomedical science. Convolutional Dictionary Learning (CDL) offers a powerful
framework for modeling local structures in signals, but its use for detecting
rare or anomalous events remains largely unexplored. In particular, CDL faces
two key challenges in this setting: high computational cost and sensitivity to
artifacts and outliers. In this paper, we introduce RoseCDL, a scalable and
robust CDL algorithm designed for unsupervised rare event detection in long
signals. RoseCDL combines stochastic windowing for efficient training on large
datasets with inline outlier detection to enhance robustness and isolate
anomalous patterns. This reframes CDL as a practical tool for event discovery
and characterization in real-world signals, extending its role beyond
traditional tasks like compression or denoising.

Conclusion: 双重公式化可作为收敛质量的可靠指标，将其集成到PINN框架中增强了在微观力学均匀化问题中的适用性。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown promise in solving
partial differential equations (PDEs) relevant to multiscale modeling, but they
often fail when applied to materials with discontinuous coefficients, such as
media with piecewise constant properties. This paper introduces a dual
formulation for the PINN framework to improve the reliability of the
homogenization of periodic thermo-conductive composites, for both strong and
variational (weak) formulations. The dual approach facilitates the derivation
of guaranteed upper and lower error bounds, enabling more robust detection of
PINN failure. We compare standard PINNs applied to smoothed material
approximations with variational PINNs (VPINNs) using both spectral and neural
network-based test functions. Our results indicate that while strong-form PINNs
may outperform VPINNs in controlled settings, they are sensitive to material
discontinuities and may fail without clear diagnostics. In contrast, VPINNs
accommodate piecewise constant material parameters directly but require careful
selection of test functions to avoid instability. Dual formulation serves as a
reliable indicator of convergence quality, and its integration into PINN
frameworks enhances their applicability to homogenization problems in
micromechanics.

Abstract: Class imbalance poses a significant challenge to supervised classification,
particularly in critical domains like medical diagnostics and anomaly detection
where minority class instances are rare. While numerous studies have explored
rebalancing techniques to address this issue, less attention has been given to
evaluating the performance of binary classifiers under imbalance when no such
techniques are applied. Therefore, the goal of this study is to assess the
performance of binary classifiers "as-is", without performing any explicit
rebalancing. Specifically, we systematically evaluate the robustness of a
diverse set of binary classifiers across both real-world and synthetic
datasets, under progressively reduced minority class sizes, using one-shot and
few-shot scenarios as baselines. Our approach also explores varying data
complexities through synthetic decision boundary generation to simulate
real-world conditions. In addition to standard classifiers, we include
experiments using undersampling, oversampling strategies, and one-class
classification (OCC) methods to examine their behavior under severe imbalance.
The results confirm that classification becomes more difficult as data
complexity increases and the minority class size decreases. While traditional
classifiers deteriorate under extreme imbalance, advanced models like TabPFN
and boosting-based ensembles retain relatively higher performance and better
generalization compared to traditional classifiers. Visual interpretability and
evaluation metrics further validate these findings. Our work offers valuable
guidance on model selection for imbalanced learning, providing insights into
classifier robustness without dependence on explicit rebalancing techniques.

Abstract: Neighbour embeddings (NE) allow the representation of high dimensional
datasets into lower dimensional spaces and are often used in data
visualisation. In practice, accelerated approximations are employed to handle
very large datasets. Accelerating NE is challenging, and two main directions
have been explored: very coarse approximations based on negative sampling (as
in UMAP) achieve high effective speed but may lack quality in the extracted
structures; less coarse approximations, as used in FIt-SNE or BH-t-SNE, offer
better structure preservation at the cost of speed, while also restricting the
target dimensionality to 2 or 3, limiting NE to visualisation. In some
variants, the precision of these costlier accelerations also enables
finer-grained control on the extracted structures through dedicated
hyperparameters.
  This paper proposes to bridge the gab between both approaches by introducing
a novel way to accelerate NE, requiring a small number of computations per
iteration while maintaining good fine-grained structure preservation and
flexibility through hyperparameter tuning, without limiting the dimensionality
of the embedding space. The method was designed for interactive exploration of
data; as such, it abandons the traditional two-phased approach of other NE
methods, allowing instantaneous visual feedback when changing hyperparameters,
even when these control processes happening on the high-dimensional side of the
computations. Experiments using a publicly available, GPU accelerated GUI
integration of the method show promising results in terms of speed, flexibility
in the structures getting extracted, and show potential uses in broader machine
learning contexts with minimal algorithmic modifications. Central to this
algorithm is a novel approach to iterative approximate nearest neighbour
search, which shows promising results compared to nearest neighbour descent.

Abstract: Predicting injuries and fatalities in traffic crashes plays a critical role
in enhancing road safety, improving emergency response, and guiding public
health interventions. This study investigates the added value of unstructured
crash narratives (written by police officers at the scene) when combined with
structured crash data to predict injury severity. Two widely used Natural
Language Processing (NLP) techniques, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency
(TF-IDF) and Word2Vec, were employed to extract semantic meaning from the
narratives, and their effectiveness was compared. To address the challenge of
class imbalance, a K-Nearest Neighbors-based oversampling method was applied to
the training data prior to modeling. The dataset consists of crash records from
Kentucky spanning 2019 to 2023. To account for roadway heterogeneity, three
road classification schemes were used: (1) eight detailed functional classes
(e.g., Urban Two-Lane, Rural Interstate, Urban Multilane Divided), (2) four
broader paired categories (e.g., Urban vs. Rural, Freeway vs. Non-Freeway), and
(3) a unified dataset without classification. A total of 102 machine learning
models were developed by combining structured features and narrative-based
features using the two NLP techniques alongside three ensemble algorithms:
XGBoost, Random Forest, and AdaBoost. Results demonstrate that models
incorporating narrative data consistently outperform those relying solely on
structured data. Among all combinations, TF-IDF coupled with XGBoost yielded
the most accurate predictions in most subgroups. The findings highlight the
power of integrating textual and structured crash information to enhance
person-level injury prediction. This work offers a practical and adaptable
framework for transportation safety professionals to improve crash severity
modeling, guide policy decisions, and design more effective countermeasures.

Abstract: Personalizing combination therapies in oncology requires navigating an
immense space of possible drug and dose combinations, a task that remains
largely infeasible through exhaustive experimentation. Recent developments in
patient-derived models have enabled high-throughput ex vivo screening, but the
number of feasible experiments is limited. Further, a tight therapeutic window
makes gathering molecular profiling information (e.g. RNA-seq) impractical as a
means of guiding drug response prediction. This leads to a challenging
cold-start problem: how do we select the most informative combinations to test
early, when no prior information about the patient is available? We propose a
strategy that leverages a pretrained deep learning model built on historical
drug response data. The model provides both embeddings for drug combinations
and dose-level importance scores, enabling a principled selection of initial
experiments. We combine clustering of drug embeddings to ensure functional
diversity with a dose-weighting mechanism that prioritizes doses based on their
historical informativeness. Retrospective simulations on large-scale drug
combination datasets show that our method substantially improves initial
screening efficiency compared to baselines, offering a viable path for more
effective early-phase decision-making in personalized combination drug screens.

Abstract: Many data applications involve counting queries, where a client specifies a
feasible range of variables and a database returns the corresponding item
counts. A program that produces the counts of different queries often risks
leaking sensitive individual-level information. A popular approach to enhance
data privacy is to return a noisy version of the actual count. It is typically
achieved by adding independent noise to each query and then control the total
privacy budget within a period. This approach may be limited in the number of
queries and output accuracy in practice. Also, the returned counts do not
maintain the total order for nested queries, an important feature in many
applications. This work presents the design and analysis of a new method,
sigma-counting, that addresses these challenges. Sigma-counting uses the notion
of sigma-algebra to construct privacy-preserving counting queries. We show that
the proposed concepts and methods can significantly improve output accuracy
while maintaining a desired privacy level in the presence of massive queries to
the same data. We also discuss how the technique can be applied to address
large and time-varying datasets.

Abstract: Keyword spotting (KWS) is a key enabling technology for hands-free
interaction in embedded and IoT devices, where stringent memory and energy
constraints challenge the deployment of AI-enabeld devices. In this work, we
systematically evaluate and compare several state-of-the-art lightweight neural

processing pipeline, from Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) feature
extraction to neural inference, and is benchmarked across three STM32 platforms

footprint without compromising the accuracy. Moreover, the N6 MCU with
integrated neural acceleration achieves the best energy-delay product (EDP),
enabling efficient, low-latency operation even with high-resolution features.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in multivariate time series is crucial to ensure the
quality of data coming from a physics experiment. Accurately identifying the
moments when unexpected errors or defects occur is essential, yet challenging
due to scarce labels, unknown anomaly types, and complex correlations across
dimensions. To address the scarcity and unreliability of labelled data, we use
the Lorenzetti Simulator to generate synthetic events with injected calorimeter
anomalies. We then assess the sensitivity of several time series anomaly
detection methods, including transformer-based and other deep learning models.
The approach employed here is generic and applicable to different detector
designs and defects.

Abstract: Clustering financial assets based on return correlations is a fundamental
task in portfolio optimization and statistical arbitrage. However, classical
clustering methods often fall short when dealing with signed correlation
structures, typically requiring lossy transformations and heuristic assumptions
such as a fixed number of clusters. In this work, we apply the Graph-based
Coalition Structure Generation algorithm (GCS-Q) to directly cluster signed,
weighted graphs without relying on such transformations. GCS-Q formulates each
partitioning step as a QUBO problem, enabling it to leverage quantum annealing
for efficient exploration of exponentially large solution spaces. We validate
our approach on both synthetic and real-world financial data, benchmarking
against state-of-the-art classical algorithms such as SPONGE and k-Medoids. Our
experiments demonstrate that GCS-Q consistently achieves higher clustering
quality, as measured by Adjusted Rand Index and structural balance penalties,
while dynamically determining the number of clusters. These results highlight
the practical utility of near-term quantum computing for graph-based
unsupervised learning in financial applications.

Abstract: Sleep quality significantly impacts well-being. Therefore, healthcare
providers and individuals need accessible and reliable forecasting tools for
preventive interventions. This paper introduces an interpretable,
individualized two-stage adaptive spatial-temporal model for predicting sleep
quality scores. Our proposed framework combines multi-scale convolutional
layers to model spatial interactions across multiple input variables, recurrent
layers and attention mechanisms to capture long-term temporal dependencies, and
a two-stage domain adaptation strategy to enhance generalization. The first
adaptation stage is applied during training to mitigate overfitting on the
training set. In the second stage, a source-free test-time adaptation mechanism
is employed to adapt the model to new users without requiring labels. We
conducted various experiments with five input window sizes (3, 5, 7, 9, and 11
days) and five prediction window sizes (1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 days). Our model
consistently outperformed time series forecasting baseline approaches,
including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Informer, PatchTST, and TimesNet. The
best performance was achieved with a three-day input window and a one-day
prediction window, yielding a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.216.
Furthermore, the model demonstrated good predictive performance even for longer
forecasting horizons (e.g, with a 0.257 RMSE for a three-day prediction
window), highlighting its practical utility for real-world applications. We
also conducted an explainability analysis to examine how different features
influence sleep quality. These findings proved that the proposed framework
offers a robust, adaptive, and explainable solution for personalized sleep
forecasting using sparse data from commercial wearable devices.

Conclusion: 虽然接触率和传播概率存在部分不可识别性，但该方法能更准确地重现流行病曲线，实现了快速实用的模型校准

Abstract: Calibrating agent-based epidemic models is computationally demanding. We
present a supervised machine learning calibrator that learns the inverse
mapping from epidemic time series to SIR parameters. A three-layer
bidirectional LSTM ingests 60-day incidence together with population size and
recovery rate, and outputs transmission probability, contact rate, and R0.
Training uses a composite loss with an epidemiology-motivated consistency
penalty that encourages R0 \* recovery rate to equal transmission probability
\* contact rate.
  In a 1000-scenario simulation study, we compare the calibrator with
Approximate Bayesian Computation (likelihood-free MCMC). The method achieves
lower error across all targets (MAE: R0 0.0616 vs 0.275; transmission 0.0715 vs
0.128; contact 1.02 vs 4.24), produces tighter predictive intervals with near
nominal coverage, and reduces wall clock time from 77.4 s to 2.35 s per
calibration. Although contact rate and transmission probability are partially
nonidentifiable, the approach reproduces epidemic curves more faithfully than
ABC, enabling fast and practical calibration. We evaluate it on SIR agent based
epidemics generated with epiworldR and provide an implementation in R.

Abstract: Slow feature analysis (SFA), as a method for learning slowly varying features
in classification and signal analysis, has attracted increasing attention in
recent years. Recent probabilistic extensions to SFA learn effective
representations for classification tasks. Notably, the Probabilistic Adaptive
Slow Feature Analysis models the slow features as states in an ARMA process and
estimate the model from the observations. However, there is a need to develop
efficient methods to infer the states (slow features) from the observations and
the model. In this paper, a recursive extension to the linear PASFA has been
proposed. The proposed algorithm performs MMSE estimation of states evolving
according to an ARMA process, given the observations and the model. Although
current methods tackle this problem using Kalman filters after transforming the
ARMA process into a state space model, the original states (or slow features)
that form useful representations cannot be easily recovered. The proposed
technique is evaluated on a synthetic dataset to demonstrate its correctness.

Abstract: Advancements in smart metering technologies have significantly improved the
ability to monitor and manage water utilities. In the context of increasing
uncertainty due to climate change, securing water resources and supply has
emerged as an urgent global issue with extensive socioeconomic ramifications.
Hourly consumption data from end-users have yielded substantial insights for
projecting demand across regions characterized by diverse consumption patterns.
Nevertheless, the prediction of water demand remains challenging due to
influencing non-deterministic factors, such as meteorological conditions. This
work introduces a novel method for short-term water demand forecasting for
District Metered Areas (DMAs) which encompass commercial, agricultural, and
residential consumers. Unsupervised contrastive learning is applied to
categorize end-users according to distinct consumption behaviors present within
a DMA. Subsequently, the distinct consumption behaviors are utilized as
features in the ensuing demand forecasting task using wavelet-transformed
convolutional networks that incorporate a cross-attention mechanism combining
both historical data and the derived representations. The proposed approach is
evaluated on real-world DMAs over a six-month period, demonstrating improved
forecasting performance in terms of MAPE across different DMAs, with a maximum
improvement of 4.9%. Additionally, it identifies consumers whose behavior is
shaped by socioeconomic factors, enhancing prior knowledge about the
deterministic patterns that influence demand.

Abstract: Automatic sleep staging typically relies on gold-standard EEG setups, which
are accurate but obtrusive and impractical for everyday use outside sleep
laboratories. This limits applicability in real-world settings, such as home
environments, where continuous, long-term monitoring is needed. Detecting sleep
onset is particularly relevant, enabling consumer applications (e.g.
automatically pausing media playback when the user falls asleep). Recent
research has shown correlations between in-ear EEG and full-scalp EEG for
various phenomena, suggesting wearable, in-ear devices could allow unobtrusive
sleep monitoring. We investigated the feasibility of using single-channel
in-ear electrophysiological (ExG) signals for automatic sleep staging in a
wearable device by conducting a sleep study with 11~participants (mean age:
24), using a custom earpiece with a dry eartip electrode (D\"atwyler SoftPulse)
as a measurement electrode in one ear and a reference in the other. Ground
truth sleep stages were obtained from an Apple Watch Ultra, validated for sleep
staging. Our system achieved 90.5% accuracy for binary sleep detection (Awake
vs. Asleep) and 65.1% accuracy for four-class staging (Awake, REM, Core, Deep)
using leave-one-subject-out validation. These findings demonstrate the
potential of in-ear electrodes as a low-effort, comfortable approach to sleep
monitoring, with applications such as stopping podcasts when users fall asleep.

Conclusion: PGDiT提供了一个新颖的生成式ASR框架，能够实现高保真度的HAR dMRI重建，在神经科学和临床研究中具有应用潜力

Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) angular super-resolution (ASR) aims to reconstruct
high-angular-resolution (HAR) signals from limited low-angular-resolution (LAR)
data without prolonging scan time. However, existing methods are limited in
recovering fine-grained angular details or preserving high fidelity due to
inadequate modeling of q-space geometry and insufficient incorporation of
physical constraints. In this paper, we introduce a Physics-Guided Diffusion
Transformer (PGDiT) designed to explore physical priors throughout both
training and inference stages. During training, a Q-space Geometry-Aware Module
(QGAM) with b-vector modulation and random angular masking facilitates
direction-aware representation learning, enabling the network to generate
directionally consistent reconstructions with fine angular details from sparse
and noisy data. In inference, a two-stage Spherical Harmonics-Guided Posterior
Sampling (SHPS) enforces alignment with the acquired data, followed by
heat-diffusion-based SH regularization to ensure physically plausible
reconstructions. This coarse-to-fine refinement strategy mitigates
oversmoothing and artifacts commonly observed in purely data-driven or
generative models. Extensive experiments on general ASR tasks and two
downstream applications, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and Neurite Orientation
Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI), demonstrate that PGDiT outperforms
existing deep learning models in detail recovery and data fidelity. Our
approach presents a novel generative ASR framework that offers high-fidelity
HAR dMRI reconstructions, with potential applications in neuroscience and
clinical research.

is critical in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. In this work,
we propose a quantum bagging framework that uses QMeans clustering as the base

Unlike bagging frameworks built on supervised learners, our method leverages
the unsupervised nature of QMeans, combined with quantum bootstrapping via
QRAM-based sampling and bagging aggregation through majority voting. Through
extensive simulations on both noisy classification and regression tasks, we
demonstrate that the proposed quantum bagging algorithm performs comparably to
its classical counterpart using KMeans while exhibiting greater resilience to
label corruption than supervised bagging methods. This highlights the potential
of unsupervised quantum bagging in learning from unreliable data.

Abstract: Preterm birth is a major cause of mortality and lifelong morbidity in
childhood. Its complex and multifactorial origins limit the effectiveness of
current clinical predictors and impede optimal care. In this study, a
dual-branch deep learning architecture (PUUMA) was developed to predict
gestational age (GA) at birth using T2* fetal MRI data from 295 pregnancies,
encompassing a heterogeneous and imbalanced population. The model integrates
both global whole-uterus and local placental features. Its performance was
benchmarked against linear regression using cervical length measurements
obtained by experienced clinicians from anatomical MRI and other Deep Learning
architectures. The GA at birth predictions were assessed using mean absolute
error. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were used to assess preterm
classification. Both the fully automated MRI-based pipeline and the cervical
length regression achieved comparable mean absolute errors (3 weeks) and good
sensitivity (0.67) for detecting preterm birth, despite pronounced class
imbalance in the dataset. These results provide a proof of concept for
automated prediction of GA at birth from functional MRI, and underscore the
value of whole-uterus functional imaging in identifying at-risk pregnancies.
Additionally, we demonstrate that manual, high-definition cervical length
measurements derived from MRI, not currently routine in clinical practice,
offer valuable predictive information. Future work will focus on expanding the
cohort size and incorporating additional organ-specific imaging to improve
generalisability and predictive performance.

Abstract: Nested logit (NL) has been commonly used for discrete choice analysis,
including a wide range of applications such as travel mode choice, automobile
ownership, or location decisions. However, the classical NL models are
restricted by their limited representation capability and handcrafted utility
specification. While researchers introduced deep neural networks (DNNs) to
tackle such challenges, the existing DNNs cannot explicitly capture
inter-alternative correlations in the discrete choice context. To address the
challenges, this study proposes a novel concept - alternative graph - to
represent the relationships among travel mode alternatives. Using a nested
alternative graph, this study further designs a nested-utility graph neural
network (NestGNN) as a generalization of the classical NL model in the neural
network family. Theoretically, NestGNNs generalize the classical NL models and
existing DNNs in terms of model representation, while retaining the crucial
two-layer substitution patterns of the NL models: proportional substitution
within a nest but non-proportional substitution beyond a nest. Empirically, we
find that the NestGNNs significantly outperform the benchmark models,
particularly the corresponding NL models by 9.2\%. As shown by elasticity
tables and substitution visualization, NestGNNs retain the two-layer
substitution patterns as the NL model, and yet presents more flexibility in its
model design space. Overall, our study demonstrates the power of NestGNN in
prediction, interpretation, and its flexibility of generalizing the classical
NL model for analyzing travel mode choice.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了对LASSO PCR方法的改进，通过引入基于主成分索引的正则化惩罚和新的JSRL混合方法，在神经影像分析中实现了更好的分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的LASSO PCR方法假设所有主成分同等重要，但实际上任务相关信号可能集中在特定成分中。作者旨在开发能够更好地选择最优主成分集的方法，以最大化与认知过程相关的信号。

Method: 提出了两种改进方法：1）基于主成分索引的正则化惩罚，反映任务相关信号更可能集中在解释更大方差的成分中的先验信念；2）JSRL混合方法，在信息对等框架下整合成分级和体素级活动，并施加排序稀疏性来指导成分选择。

Result: 改进方法在所有分类任务中都达到或优于标准LASSO PCR方法，JSRL在交叉验证偏差R²上实现了高达51.7%的改进，在交叉验证AUC上实现了7.3%的改进。

Conclusion: 将稀疏性排序纳入LASSO PCR可以产生具有增强分类性能的模型，为MVPA提供了强大的替代方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in neuroimaging analysis have enabled accurate decoding of
mental state from brain activation patterns during functional magnetic
resonance imaging scans. A commonly applied tool for this purpose is principal
components regression regularized with the least absolute shrinkage and
selection operator (LASSO PCR), a type of multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA).
This model presumes that all components are equally likely to harbor relevant
information, when in fact the task-related signal may be concentrated in
specific components. In such cases, the model will fail to select the optimal
set of principal components that maximizes the total signal relevant to the
cognitive process under study. Here, we present modifications to LASSO PCR that
allow for a regularization penalty tied directly to the index of the principal
component, reflecting a prior belief that task-relevant signal is more likely
to be concentrated in components explaining greater variance. Additionally, we
propose a novel hybrid method, Joint Sparsity-Ranked LASSO (JSRL), which
integrates component-level and voxel-level activity under an information parity
framework and imposes ranked sparsity to guide component selection. We apply
the models to brain activation during risk taking, monetary incentive, and
emotion regulation tasks. Results demonstrate that incorporating sparsity
ranking into LASSO PCR produces models with enhanced classification
performance, with JSRL achieving up to 51.7\% improvement in cross-validated
deviance $R^2$ and 7.3\% improvement in cross-validated AUC. Furthermore,
sparsity-ranked models perform as well as or better than standard LASSO PCR
approaches across all classification tasks and allocate predictive weight to
brain regions consistent with their established functional roles, offering a
robust alternative for MVPA.

Result: 研究发现严格因果处理会导致转录准确率下降，预处理延迟和预测准确性之间存在权衡关系。系统实现了低于30ms的实时转录延迟。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个基线系统，支持研究人员设计最小延迟的实时转录模型，证明了现有模型可以适配为实时应用，但需要权衡准确性和延迟。

Abstract: Advances in neural network design and the availability of large-scale labeled
datasets have driven major improvements in piano transcription. Existing
approaches target either offline applications, with no restrictions on
computational demands, or online transcription, with delays of 128-320 ms.
However, most real-time musical applications require latencies below 30 ms. In
this work, we investigate whether and how the current state-of-the-art online
transcription model can be adapted for real-time piano transcription.
Specifically, we eliminate all non-causal processing, and reduce computational
load through shared computations across core model components and variations in
model size. Additionally, we explore different pre- and postprocessing
strategies, and related label encoding schemes, and discuss their suitability
for real-time transcription. Evaluating the adaptions on the MAESTRO dataset,
we find a drop in transcription accuracy due to strictly causal processing as
well as a tradeoff between the preprocessing latency and prediction accuracy.
We release our system as a baseline to support researchers in designing models
towards minimum latency real-time transcription.

Abstract: Deep learning appears as an appealing solution for Automatic Synthesizer
Programming (ASP), which aims to assist musicians and sound designers in
programming sound synthesizers. However, integrating software synthesizers into
training pipelines is challenging due to their potential non-differentiability.
This work tackles this challenge by introducing a method to approximate
arbitrary synthesizers. Specifically, we train a neural network to map
synthesizer presets onto an audio embedding space derived from a pretrained
model. This facilitates the definition of a neural proxy that produces compact
yet effective representations, thereby enabling the integration of audio
embedding loss into neural-based ASP systems for black-box synthesizers. We
evaluate the representations derived by various pretrained audio models in the
context of neural-based nASP and assess the effectiveness of several neural
network architectures, including feedforward, recurrent, and transformer-based
models, in defining neural proxies. We evaluate the proposed method using both
synthetic and hand-crafted presets from three popular software synthesizers and
assess its performance in a synthesizer sound matching downstream task. While
the benefits of the learned representation are nuanced by resource
requirements, encouraging results were obtained for all synthesizers, paving
the way for future research into the application of synthesizer proxies for
neural-based ASP systems.

Abstract: We study decentralized online Riemannian optimization over manifolds with
possibly positive curvature, going beyond the Hadamard manifold setting.
Decentralized optimization techniques rely on a consensus step that is well
understood in Euclidean spaces because of their linearity. However, in
positively curved Riemannian spaces, a main technical challenge is that
geodesic distances may not induce a globally convex structure. In this work, we
first analyze a curvature-aware Riemannian consensus step that enables a linear
convergence beyond Hadamard manifolds. Building on this step, we establish a
$O(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound for the decentralized online Riemannian gradient
descent algorithm. Then, we investigate the two-point bandit feedback setup,
where we employ computationally efficient gradient estimators using smoothing
techniques, and we demonstrate the same $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound through the
subconvexity analysis of smoothed objectives.

creates a realistic and individualized cardiovascular system model of the

attached to the patient, which can help in the constant assessment of the
patient and the impact of possible treatment plans. As shown by our

and, at the same time, efficient. Combining highly advanced techniques such as
deep learning and digital twin (DT) technology presents the possibility of
using an active and individual approach to predicting cardiac disease.

Abstract: Personalized ultra-fractionated stereotactic adaptive radiotherapy (PULSAR)
is a novel treatment that delivers radiation in pulses of protracted intervals.
Accurate prediction of gross tumor volume (GTV) changes through regression
models has substantial prognostic value. This study aims to develop a
multi-omics based support vector regression (SVR) model for predicting GTV
change. A retrospective cohort of 39 patients with 69 brain metastases was
analyzed, based on radiomics (MRI images) and dosiomics (dose maps) features.
Delta features were computed to capture relative changes between two time
points. A feature selection pipeline using least absolute shrinkage and
selection operator (Lasso) algorithm with weight- or frequency-based ranking
criterion was implemented. SVR models with various kernels were evaluated using
the coefficient of determination (R2) and relative root mean square error
(RRMSE). Five-fold cross-validation with 10 repeats was employed to mitigate
the limitation of small data size. Multi-omics models that integrate radiomics,
dosiomics, and their delta counterparts outperform individual-omics models.
Delta-radiomic features play a critical role in enhancing prediction accuracy
relative to features at single time points. The top-performing model achieves
an R2 of 0.743 and an RRMSE of 0.022. The proposed multi-omics SVR model shows
promising performance in predicting continuous change of GTV. It provides a
more quantitative and personalized approach to assist patient selection and
treatment adjustment in PULSAR.

Abstract: The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Working
Party on Nuclear Criticality Safety (WPNCS) proposed a benchmark exercise to
assess the performance of current nuclear data adjustment techniques applied to
nonlinear applications and experiments with low correlation to applications.
This work introduces Bayesian Inverse Uncertainty Quantification (IUQ) as a
method for nuclear data adjustments in this benchmark, and compares IUQ to the
more traditional methods of Generalized Linear Least Squares (GLLS) and Monte
Carlo Bayes (MOCABA). Posterior predictions from IUQ showed agreement with GLLS
and MOCABA for linear applications. When comparing GLLS, MOCABA, and IUQ
posterior predictions to computed model responses using adjusted parameters, we
observe that GLLS predictions fail to replicate computed response distributions
for nonlinear applications, while MOCABA shows near agreement, and IUQ uses
computed model responses directly. We also discuss observations on why
experiments with low correlation to applications can be informative to nuclear
data adjustments and identify some properties useful in selecting experiments
for inclusion in nuclear data adjustment. Performance in this benchmark
indicates potential for Bayesian IUQ in nuclear data adjustments.
