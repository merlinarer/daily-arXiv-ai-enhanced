Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种几何方法，将神经元定义为具有非正交基的分类向量空间，通过内部注意力机制识别关键分类区域以提高语言模型效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解人工神经网络中多义神经元的本质，探索更高效的神经元表示方法。

Method: 将神经元定义为分类向量空间，提取前一层神经元的分类子维度，通过内部注意力机制识别关键分类区域。

Result: 提出了一种新的神经元表示方法，能够更高效地利用分类子维度。

Conclusion: 几何定义和内部注意力机制为语言模型的神经元表示提供了新思路。

Abstract: The polysemantic nature of synthetic neurons in artificial intelligence
language models is currently understood as the result of a necessary
superposition of distributed features within the latent space. We propose an
alternative approach, geometrically defining a neuron in layer n as a
categorical vector space with a non-orthogonal basis, composed of categorical
sub-dimensions extracted from preceding neurons in layer n-1. This categorical
vector space is structured by the activation space of each neuron and enables,
via an intra-neuronal attention process, the identification and utilization of
a critical categorical zone for the efficiency of the language model - more
homogeneous and located at the intersection of these different categorical
sub-dimensions.

### [2] [A Tale of Two Identities: An Ethical Audit of Human and AI-Crafted Personas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07850)
*Pranav Narayanan Venkit,Jiayi Li,Yingfan Zhou,Sarah Rajtmajer,Shomir Wilson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文分析了三种大语言模型（GPT4o、Gemini 1.5 Pro、Deepseek 2.5）生成的合成人物在种族身份上的表现，揭示了模型过度强调种族标记、文化编码语言，导致刻板印象等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在数据有限领域（如健康、隐私、HCI）中生成合成人物的应用增多，需评估其对少数群体身份的刻画是否准确。

Method: 采用混合方法（细读、词汇分析、参数化创造力框架），比较1512个模型生成人物与人类撰写的回应。

Result: 发现模型生成的种族身份呈现过度标记化、文化编码语言过多，导致刻板印象、异化等社会技术危害。

Conclusion: 提出“算法他者化”概念，并建议设计叙事感知评估指标和社区中心验证协议。

Abstract: As LLMs (large language models) are increasingly used to generate synthetic
personas particularly in data-limited domains such as health, privacy, and HCI,
it becomes necessary to understand how these narratives represent identity,
especially that of minority communities. In this paper, we audit synthetic
personas generated by 3 LLMs (GPT4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Deepseek 2.5) through the
lens of representational harm, focusing specifically on racial identity. Using
a mixed methods approach combining close reading, lexical analysis, and a
parameterized creativity framework, we compare 1512 LLM generated personas to
human-authored responses. Our findings reveal that LLMs disproportionately
foreground racial markers, overproduce culturally coded language, and construct
personas that are syntactically elaborate yet narratively reductive. These
patterns result in a range of sociotechnical harms, including stereotyping,
exoticism, erasure, and benevolent bias, that are often obfuscated by
superficially positive narrations. We formalize this phenomenon as algorithmic
othering, where minoritized identities are rendered hypervisible but less
authentic. Based on these findings, we offer design recommendations for
narrative-aware evaluation metrics and community-centered validation protocols
for synthetic identity generation.

### [3] [Joint Detection of Fraud and Concept Drift inOnline Conversations with LLM-Assisted Judgment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07852)
*Ali Senol,Garima Agrawal,Huan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段检测框架，结合集成分类模型和概念漂移分析，用于提高数字通信平台中虚假交互检测的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字通信平台中的虚假交互问题尚未得到充分解决，传统静态异常检测方法难以适应动态对话变化，容易误判良性话题转换。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1) 使用集成分类模型识别可疑对话；2) 通过概念漂移分析（OCDD）和大型语言模型（LLM）判断是否为欺诈行为。

Result: 在社交工程聊天数据集上验证，框架在实时欺诈检测中提高了准确性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 模块化方法优于双LLM基线，能够更可靠地检测虚假交互并减少误判。

Abstract: Detecting fake interactions in digital communication platforms remains a
challenging and insufficiently addressed problem. These interactions may appear
as harmless spam or escalate into sophisticated scam attempts, making it
difficult to flag malicious intent early. Traditional detection methods often
rely on static anomaly detection techniques that fail to adapt to dynamic
conversational shifts. One key limitation is the misinterpretation of benign
topic transitions referred to as concept drift as fraudulent behavior, leading
to either false alarms or missed threats. We propose a two stage detection
framework that first identifies suspicious conversations using a tailored
ensemble classification model. To improve the reliability of detection, we
incorporate a concept drift analysis step using a One Class Drift Detector
(OCDD) to isolate conversational shifts within flagged dialogues. When drift is
detected, a large language model (LLM) assesses whether the shift indicates
fraudulent manipulation or a legitimate topic change. In cases where no drift
is found, the behavior is inferred to be spam like. We validate our framework
using a dataset of social engineering chat scenarios and demonstrate its
practical advantages in improving both accuracy and interpretability for real
time fraud detection. To contextualize the trade offs, we compare our modular
approach against a Dual LLM baseline that performs detection and judgment using
different language models.

### [4] [CrashSage: A Large Language Model-Centered Framework for Contextual and Interpretable Traffic Crash Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07853)
*Hao Zhen,Jidong J. Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CrashSage是一个基于大型语言模型（LLM）的框架，通过表格到文本转换、数据增强、模型微调和可解释性技术，提升交通事故分析的准确性和可操作性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球每年因交通事故造成130万人死亡和1.8万亿美元经济损失，现有方法忽视上下文信息且信息损失严重，亟需更有效的分析工具。

Method: 1. 表格到文本转换；2. 数据增强；3. 微调LLaMA3-8B模型；4. 梯度可解释性技术。

Result: CrashSage在事故严重性推断上优于基线模型（如GPT-4o、LLaMA3-70B），并提供更透明的决策解释。

Conclusion: CrashSage为交通事故分析提供了更高效、透明的解决方案，有助于针对性安全干预。

Abstract: Road crashes claim over 1.3 million lives annually worldwide and incur global
economic losses exceeding \$1.8 trillion. Such profound societal and financial
impacts underscore the urgent need for road safety research that uncovers crash
mechanisms and delivers actionable insights. Conventional statistical models
and tree ensemble approaches typically rely on structured crash data,
overlooking contextual nuances and struggling to capture complex relationships
and underlying semantics. Moreover, these approaches tend to incur significant
information loss, particularly in narrative elements related to multi-vehicle
interactions, crash progression, and rare event characteristics. This study
presents CrashSage, a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-centered framework
designed to advance crash analysis and modeling through four key innovations.
First, we introduce a tabular-to-text transformation strategy paired with
relational data integration schema, enabling the conversion of raw,
heterogeneous crash data into enriched, structured textual narratives that
retain essential structural and relational context. Second, we apply
context-aware data augmentation using a base LLM model to improve narrative
coherence while preserving factual integrity. Third, we fine-tune the LLaMA3-8B
model for crash severity inference, demonstrating superior performance over
baseline approaches, including zero-shot, zero-shot with chain-of-thought
prompting, and few-shot learning, with multiple models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini,
LLaMA3-70B). Finally, we employ a gradient-based explainability technique to
elucidate model decisions at both the individual crash level and across broader
risk factor dimensions. This interpretability mechanism enhances transparency
and enables targeted road safety interventions by providing deeper insights
into the most influential factors.

### [5] [Unpacking Robustness in Inflectional Languages: Adversarial Evaluation and Mechanistic Insights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07856)
*Paweł Walkowiak,Marek Klonowski,Marcin Oleksy,Arkadiusz Janz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了对抗性攻击在屈折语言中的表现，提出了一种基于Edge Attribution Patching（EAP）的新评估协议，并创建了一个基于MultiEmo数据集的新基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗性攻击方法主要在非屈折语言（如英语）中开发和评估，本文旨在研究这些方法在屈折语言中的表现及其对模型鲁棒性的影响。

Method: 设计了基于EAP的新评估协议，利用波兰语和英语的平行语料库，创建了基于MultiEmo数据集的新基准。

Result: 通过分析模型在攻击下的行为，揭示了屈折与对抗鲁棒性之间的关系。

Conclusion: 本文为屈折语言中的对抗性攻击研究提供了新的方法和基准，有助于理解模型在攻击下的行为机制。

Abstract: Various techniques are used in the generation of adversarial examples,
including methods such as TextBugger which introduce minor, hardly visible
perturbations to words leading to changes in model behaviour. Another class of
techniques involves substituting words with their synonyms in a way that
preserves the text's meaning but alters its predicted class, with TextFooler
being a prominent example of such attacks. Most adversarial example generation
methods are developed and evaluated primarily on non-inflectional languages,
typically English. In this work, we evaluate and explain how adversarial
attacks perform in inflectional languages. To explain the impact of inflection
on model behaviour and its robustness under attack, we designed a novel
protocol inspired by mechanistic interpretability, based on Edge Attribution
Patching (EAP) method. The proposed evaluation protocol relies on parallel
task-specific corpora that include both inflected and syncretic variants of
texts in two languages -- Polish and English. To analyse the models and explain
the relationship between inflection and adversarial robustness, we create a new
benchmark based on task-oriented dataset MultiEmo, enabling the identification
of mechanistic inflection-related elements of circuits within the model and
analyse their behaviour under attack.

### [6] [Enhanced Urdu Intent Detection with Large Language Models and Prototype-Informed Predictive Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07857)
*Faiza Hassan,Summra Saleem,Kashif Javed,Muhammad Nabeel Asim,Abdur Rehman,Andreas Dengel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于对比学习的意图检测方法LLMPIA，专门针对乌尔都语，结合预训练语言模型和原型注意力机制，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乌尔都语作为第十大语言，其意图检测领域缺乏少样本学习策略，传统方法局限于训练集中的类别。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用对比学习策略，利用未标注数据重新训练预训练语言模型，并结合原型注意力机制构建LLMPIA管道。

Result: 在ATIS和Web Queries数据集上，LLMPIA在少样本设置下分别达到83.28%/98.25%和76.23%/84.42%的F1分数，并在相同类别测试中超越现有方法53.55%。

Conclusion: LLMPIA为乌尔都语意图检测提供了高效解决方案，验证了对比学习和原型注意力机制的有效性。

Abstract: Multifarious intent detection predictors are developed for different
languages, including English, Chinese and French, however, the field remains
underdeveloped for Urdu, the 10th most spoken language. In the realm of
well-known languages, intent detection predictors utilize the strategy of
few-shot learning and prediction of unseen classes based on the model training
on seen classes. However, Urdu language lacks few-shot strategy based intent
detection predictors and traditional predictors are focused on prediction of
the same classes which models have seen in the train set. To empower Urdu
language specific intent detection, this introduces a unique contrastive
learning approach that leverages unlabeled Urdu data to re-train pre-trained
language models. This re-training empowers LLMs representation learning for the
downstream intent detection task. Finally, it reaps the combined potential of
pre-trained LLMs and the prototype-informed attention mechanism to create a
comprehensive end-to-end LLMPIA intent detection pipeline. Under the paradigm
of proposed predictive pipeline, it explores the potential of 6 distinct
language models and 13 distinct similarity computation methods. The proposed
framework is evaluated on 2 public benchmark datasets, namely ATIS encompassing
5836 samples and Web Queries having 8519 samples. Across ATIS dataset under
4-way 1 shot and 4-way 5 shot experimental settings LLMPIA achieved 83.28% and
98.25% F1-Score and on Web Queries dataset produced 76.23% and 84.42% F1-Score,
respectively. In an additional case study on the Web Queries dataset under same
classes train and test set settings, LLMPIA outperformed state-of-the-art
predictor by 53.55% F1-Score.

### [7] [Scaling Laws for Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07858)
*Siyuan Yan,Mo Zhu,Guo-qing Jiang,Jianfei Wang,Jiaxing Chen,Wentai Zhang,Xiang Liao,Xiao Cui,Chen Zhang,Zhuoran Song,Ran Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过密集LLM架构探索推测解码技术，发现对数线性缩放定律，并开发了Scylla系统，显著提升了推理任务的解码效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在推理密集型任务中需要高效解码，但现有方法的缩放规律尚未充分探索。

Method: 研究通过密集LLM架构分析推测解码技术，发现对数线性缩放定律（定理1.1-1.3），并开发了Scylla系统。

Result: Scylla在解码速度和接受率上优于EAGLE2和EAGLE3，工业部署中解码吞吐量提升2倍。

Conclusion: 系统性缩放对高效LLM推理具有变革潜力，Scylla展示了显著性能提升。

Abstract: The escalating demand for efficient decoding in large language models (LLMs)
is particularly critical for reasoning-intensive architectures like OpenAI-o3
and DeepSeek-R1, which depend on extended chain-of-thought reasoning. This
study investigates speculative decoding techniques through dense LLM
architectures to establish foundational insights for accelerating reasoning
tasks. While speculative decoding methods leveraging parallel
draft-verification cycles have emerged as promising acceleration techniques,
the scaling laws governing decoding efficiency remain under-explored compared
to conventional backbone LLMs developed through Pretraining->SFT->RLHF training
paradigms. In this work, we discover Log-linear Scaling Laws (Theorem 1.1, 1.2
and 1.3) governing draft model acceptance rate (or decoding speed) across three
dimensions: pretraining token volume, draft model capacity, and decoding batch
size. Building on these laws, we achieve Scylla, which coordinates
multi-dimensional scaling for popular LLMs (Llama2/3, Qwen2.5). Empirical
validation shows Scylla achieves 1.5-2.2 higher acceptance rate than EAGLE2 and
0.3 higher than EAGLE3 at temperature T = 0, with peak performance gains on
summarization and QA tasks (Figure 2). Industrial inference engine deployments
demonstrate 2X decoding throughput improvements over EAGLE2 (Table 5),
validating the transformative potential of systematic scaling for efficient LLM
inference. Code will be released later.

### [8] [Boosting Performance on ARC is a Matter of Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07859)
*Daniel Franzen,Jan Disselhoff,David Hartmann*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过数据增强和深度优先搜索算法提升LLM在ARC-AGI任务中表现的方法，并利用LLM作为生成器和评分器，实现了71.6%的得分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在抽象推理任务（如ARC-AGI）中的局限性。

Method: 在训练、生成和评分阶段使用任务特定的数据增强，结合深度优先搜索算法生成多样化的候选解决方案，并利用LLM的输出概率选择最佳方案。

Result: 在公开ARC-AGI评估集上获得71.6%的得分（286.5/400任务），推理成本低至每任务约2分钱。

Conclusion: 该方法在透明性、可重复性和低成本方面表现突出，尽管分数低于某些闭源方法。

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC-AGI) poses a significant challenge
for large language models (LLMs), exposing limitations in their abstract
reasoning abilities. In this work, we leverage task-specific data augmentations
throughout the training, generation, and scoring phases, and employ a
depth-first search algorithm to generate diverse, high-probability candidate
solutions. Furthermore, we utilize the LLM not only as a generator but also as
a scorer, using its output probabilities to select the most promising
solutions. Our method achieves a score of 71.6% (286.5/400 solved tasks) on the
public ARC-AGI evaluation set, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance among
publicly available approaches. While concurrent closed-source work has reported
higher scores, our method distinguishes itself through its transparency,
reproducibility, and remarkably low inference cost, averaging only around 2ct
per task on readily available hardware (we assume a price of 36ct/hour for a
Nvidia 4090 GPU).

### [9] [Scalable LLM Math Reasoning Acceleration with Low-rank Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07861)
*Harry Dong,Bilge Acun,Beidi Chen,Yuejie Chi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Caprese是一种低成本蒸馏方法，用于恢复因高效推理方法部署而丢失的数学能力，同时不损害语言任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的数学推理需要大量计算资源和时间，现有高效推理方法在语言任务上表现良好，但会严重降低数学性能。

Method: 提出Caprese方法，通过仅增加约1%的参数和20K合成训练样本，恢复高效推理中丢失的数学能力，同时保持原始权重不变。

Result: Caprese显著减少了活跃参数数量（如Gemma 2 9B和Llama 3.1 8B减少约2B），并降低了延迟（如Qwen 2.5 14B生成2048个令牌时延迟减少>11%）。

Conclusion: Caprese是一种高效且低成本的方法，能够恢复数学推理能力，同时优化模型性能。

Abstract: Due to long generations, large language model (LLM) math reasoning demands
significant computational resources and time. While many existing efficient
inference methods have been developed with excellent performance preservation
on language tasks, they often severely degrade math performance. In this paper,
we propose Caprese, a low-cost distillation method to recover lost capabilities
from deploying efficient inference methods, focused primarily in feedforward
blocks. With original weights unperturbed, roughly 1% of additional parameters,
and only 20K synthetic training samples, we are able to recover much if not all
of the math capabilities lost from efficient inference for thinking LLMs and
without harm to language tasks for instruct LLMs. Moreover, Caprese slashes the
number of active parameters (~2B cut for Gemma 2 9B and Llama 3.1 8B) and
integrates cleanly into existing model layers to reduce latency (>11% reduction
to generate 2048 tokens with Qwen 2.5 14B) while encouraging response brevity.

### [10] [Graph Laplacian Wavelet Transformer via Learnable Spectral Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07862)
*Andrew Kiruluta,Eric Lundy,Priscilla Burity*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Graph Wavelet Transformer（GWT）的新架构，通过多尺度小波变换替代传统的点积自注意力机制，以解决计算和内存的二次复杂度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的序列到序列模型在处理结构化语言任务时，依赖点积自注意力机制，导致计算和内存的二次复杂度。

Method: 引入GWT架构，使用基于语法或语义解析图拉普拉斯的多尺度小波变换替代点积自注意力。

Result: 多尺度谱分解为图结构序列建模提供了一种可解释、高效且表达能力强的替代方案。

Conclusion: GWT是一种高效且表达力强的替代方案，适用于图结构序列建模。

Abstract: Existing sequence to sequence models for structured language tasks rely
heavily on the dot product self attention mechanism, which incurs quadratic
complexity in both computation and memory for input length N. We introduce the
Graph Wavelet Transformer (GWT), a novel architecture that replaces this
bottleneck with a learnable, multi scale wavelet transform defined over an
explicit graph Laplacian derived from syntactic or semantic parses. Our
analysis shows that multi scale spectral decomposition offers an interpretable,
efficient, and expressive alternative to quadratic self attention for graph
structured sequence modeling.

### [11] [QoSBERT: An Uncertainty-Aware Approach based on Pre-trained Language Models for Service Quality Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07863)
*Ziliang Wang,Xiaohong Zhang,Ze Shi Li,Meng Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QoSBERT是一个基于预训练语言模型的QoS预测框架，通过自然语言描述自动编码用户服务元数据，并结合蒙特卡洛Dropout进行不确定性估计，显著提升了预测精度和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统QoS模型依赖手动特征工程且仅提供点估计，缺乏对预测置信度的洞察。QoSBERT旨在通过语义回归和不确定性估计解决这一问题。

Method: QoSBERT将QoS预测重新定义为语义回归任务，利用预训练语言模型编码元数据，结合蒙特卡洛Dropout估计不确定性，并通过注意力池化和轻量级多层感知机回归器优化预测。

Result: 在标准QoS数据集上，QoSBERT在响应时间和吞吐量预测上分别平均降低了11.7%的MAE和6.7%的RMSE，以及6.9%的MAE，同时提供校准的置信区间。

Conclusion: QoSBERT不仅提升了预测精度，还实现了可靠的不确定性量化，为更可信的数据驱动服务选择和优化奠定了基础。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of Quality of Service (QoS) metrics is fundamental for
selecting and managing cloud based services. Traditional QoS models rely on
manual feature engineering and yield only point estimates, offering no insight
into the confidence of their predictions. In this paper, we propose QoSBERT,
the first framework that reformulates QoS prediction as a semantic regression
task based on pre trained language models. Unlike previous approaches relying
on sparse numerical features, QoSBERT automatically encodes user service
metadata into natural language descriptions, enabling deep semantic
understanding. Furthermore, we integrate a Monte Carlo Dropout based
uncertainty estimation module, allowing for trustworthy and risk-aware service
quality prediction, which is crucial yet underexplored in existing QoS models.
QoSBERT applies attentive pooling over contextualized embeddings and a
lightweight multilayer perceptron regressor, fine tuned jointly to minimize
absolute error. We further exploit the resulting uncertainty estimates to
select high quality training samples, improving robustness in low resource
settings. On standard QoS benchmark datasets, QoSBERT achieves an average
reduction of 11.7% in MAE and 6.7% in RMSE for response time prediction, and
6.9% in MAE for throughput prediction compared to the strongest baselines,
while providing well calibrated confidence intervals for robust and trustworthy
service quality estimation. Our approach not only advances the accuracy of
service quality prediction but also delivers reliable uncertainty
quantification, paving the way for more trustworthy, data driven service
selection and optimization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于句子多样性的蜕变关系（MRs）优先级排序方法，用于高效检测大语言模型（LLMs）中的公平性问题，实验表明其优于随机和基于距离的排序方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）的广泛应用，其输出中的公平性和潜在偏见问题日益突出，亟需高效的测试方法。

Method: 采用基于句子多样性的方法计算并排序蜕变关系（MRs），以优化故障检测效率。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在故障检测率上比随机排序高22%，比基于距离排序高12%，同时首次故障时间分别减少15%和8%。

Conclusion: 多样性基础的MR优先级排序方法在提升LLMs公平性测试中有效且计算成本低。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in various
applications, raising critical concerns about fairness and potential biases in
their outputs. This paper explores the prioritization of metamorphic relations
(MRs) in metamorphic testing as a strategy to efficiently detect fairness
issues within LLMs. Given the exponential growth of possible test cases,
exhaustive testing is impractical; therefore, prioritizing MRs based on their
effectiveness in detecting fairness violations is crucial. We apply a sentence
diversity-based approach to compute and rank MRs to optimize fault detection.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed prioritization approach
improves fault detection rates by 22% compared to random prioritization and 12%
compared to distance-based prioritization, while reducing the time to the first
failure by 15% and 8%, respectively. Furthermore, our approach performs within
5% of fault-based prioritization in effectiveness, while significantly reducing
the computational cost associated with fault labeling. These results validate
the effectiveness of diversity-based MR prioritization in enhancing fairness
testing for LLMs.

### [13] [Evaluating Financial Sentiment Analysis with Annotators Instruction Assisted Prompting: Enhancing Contextual Interpretation and Stock Prediction Accuracy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07871)
*A M Muntasir Rahman,Ajim Uddin,Guiling "Grace" Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的评估提示方法（AIAP），通过整合人类标注者的任务指令来改进金融情感分析（FSA）的LLM性能，并在WSBS数据集上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融情感分析（FSA）的现有基准数据集（如Financial Phrasebank）存在标注主观性强、类别定义模糊的问题，导致LLM在评估时表现不佳。

Method: 提出Annotators' Instruction Assisted Prompt（AIAP），将人类标注者的任务指令整合到LLM的提示框架中，以标准化情感理解。

Result: AIAP显著提升了LLM性能（最高提升9.08%），并引入了一种基于模型置信度的情感索引方法，改进了股票价格预测。

Conclusion: AIAP通过改进任务定义和评估方法，提升了FSA的性能，同时凸显了WSB作为金融文本来源的重要性。

Abstract: Financial sentiment analysis (FSA) presents unique challenges to LLMs that
surpass those in typical sentiment analysis due to the nuanced language used in
financial contexts. The prowess of these models is often undermined by the
inherent subjectivity of sentiment classifications in existing benchmark
datasets like Financial Phrasebank. These datasets typically feature undefined
sentiment classes that reflect the highly individualized perspectives of
annotators, leading to significant variability in annotations. This variability
results in an unfair expectation for LLMs during benchmarking, where they are
tasked to conjecture the subjective viewpoints of human annotators without
sufficient context. In this paper, we introduce the Annotators' Instruction
Assisted Prompt, a novel evaluation prompt designed to redefine the task
definition of FSA for LLMs. By integrating detailed task instructions
originally intended for human annotators into the LLMs' prompt framework, AIAP
aims to standardize the understanding of sentiment across both human and
machine interpretations, providing a fair and context-rich foundation for
sentiment analysis. We utilize a new dataset, WSBS, derived from the
WallStreetBets subreddit to demonstrate how AIAP significantly enhances LLM
performance by aligning machine operations with the refined task definitions.
Experimental results demonstrate that AIAP enhances LLM performance
significantly, with improvements up to 9.08. This context-aware approach not
only yields incremental gains in performance but also introduces an innovative
sentiment-indexing method utilizing model confidence scores. This method
enhances stock price prediction models and extracts more value from the
financial sentiment analysis, underscoring the significance of WSB as a
critical source of financial text. Our research offers insights into both
improving FSA through better evaluation methods.

*Yu Wang,Runxi Yu,Zhongyuan Wang,Jing He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过结合LIWC特征和RoBERTa模型，分析了美国政治演讲中的民粹主义声音，揭示了其直接、自信的语言风格及其在左右翼、反精英和人民中心主义中的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索民粹主义在政治演讲中的语言表现，特别是其情感和风格特征，以揭示不同民粹主义维度的共同点和差异。

Method: 整合LIWC情感和风格特征与RoBERTa模型，分析美国总统就职演说和国情咨文中的语言标记。

Result: 民粹主义演讲具有直接、自信的语言风格，右翼和人民中心主义更情感化，而左翼和反精英主义则相对克制。

Conclusion: 民粹主义语言风格是策略性调整的，不同维度在情感表达上有显著差异。

Abstract: This study explores the sound of populism by integrating the classic
Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) features, which capture the emotional
and stylistic tones of language, with a fine-tuned RoBERTa model, a
state-of-the-art context-aware language model trained to detect nuanced
expressions of populism. This approach allows us to uncover the auditory
dimensions of political rhetoric in U.S. presidential inaugural and State of
the Union addresses. We examine how four key populist dimensions (i.e.,
left-wing, right-wing, anti-elitism, and people-centrism) manifest in the
linguistic markers of speech, drawing attention to both commonalities and
distinct tonal shifts across these variants. Our findings reveal that populist
rhetoric consistently features a direct, assertive ``sound" that forges a
connection with ``the people'' and constructs a charismatic leadership persona.
However, this sound is not simply informal but strategically calibrated.
Notably, right-wing populism and people-centrism exhibit a more emotionally
charged discourse, resonating with themes of identity, grievance, and crisis,
in contrast to the relatively restrained emotional tones of left-wing and
anti-elitist expressions.

### [15] [Recovering Event Probabilities from Large Language Model Embeddings via Axiomatic Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07883)
*Jian-Qiao Zhu,Haijiang Yan,Thomas L. Griffiths*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何从LLM嵌入中恢复符合概率论公理的事件概率，通过变分自编码器（VAE）在潜在空间中强制概率论约束，实验表明该方法能生成比LLM直接输出更一致的概率估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成的事件概率常违反概率论公理，研究旨在探索是否能从嵌入中恢复符合公理的概率，以提升不确定性事件中的估计准确性。

Method: 提出在LLM嵌入的潜在空间中通过扩展的VAE强制概率论公理约束（如加法规则），使概率在潜在空间中自然生成。

Result: 实验表明，从嵌入中恢复的概率比LLM直接输出的更一致，且更接近真实概率。

Conclusion: 通过VAE在潜在空间中强制概率论约束，可以有效恢复符合公理的事件概率，提升LLM在不确定性事件中的表现。

Abstract: Rational decision-making under uncertainty requires coherent degrees of
belief in events. However, event probabilities generated by Large Language
Models (LLMs) have been shown to exhibit incoherence, violating the axioms of
probability theory. This raises the question of whether coherent event
probabilities can be recovered from the embeddings used by the models. If so,
those derived probabilities could be used as more accurate estimates in events
involving uncertainty. To explore this question, we propose enforcing axiomatic
constraints, such as the additive rule of probability theory, in the latent
space learned by an extended variational autoencoder (VAE) applied to LLM
embeddings. This approach enables event probabilities to naturally emerge in
the latent space as the VAE learns to both reconstruct the original embeddings
and predict the embeddings of semantically related events. We evaluate our
method on complementary events (i.e., event A and its complement, event not-A),
where the true probabilities of the two events must sum to 1. Experiment
results on open-weight language models demonstrate that probabilities recovered
from embeddings exhibit greater coherence than those directly reported by the
corresponding models and align closely with the true probabilities.

*S. E Emedem,I. E Onyenwe,E. G Onyedinma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个名为WAZOBIA-NER的系统，针对尼日利亚的三种主要语言（豪萨语、约鲁巴语和伊博语）进行命名实体识别（NER），填补了资源匮乏语言的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管非洲语言在计算语言学中受到越来越多的关注，但现有的NER系统主要集中在英语、欧洲语言等少数全球语言上，资源匮乏的语言存在显著差距。

Method: 研究通过编译注释数据集，结合条件随机场（CRF）和深度学习模型（如BiLSTM、BERT和RNN），评估这些方法在识别人名、组织和地点实体中的有效性。系统还利用OCR技术处理文本图像。

Result: 系统在精确率、召回率、F1分数和准确率上分别达到0.9511、0.9400、0.9564和0.9301，证明了其在多语言环境中的有效性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，利用当前NLP框架和迁移学习，可以为资源匮乏的非洲语言构建强大的NER工具。

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition NER is very crucial for various natural language
processing applications, including information extraction, machine translation,
and sentiment analysis. Despite the ever-increasing interest in African
languages within computational linguistics, existing NER systems focus mainly
on English, European, and a few other global languages, leaving a significant
gap for under-resourced languages. This research presents the development of a
WAZOBIA-NER system tailored for the three most prominent Nigerian languages:
Hausa, Yoruba, and Igbo. This research begins with a comprehensive compilation
of annotated datasets for each language, addressing data scarcity and
linguistic diversity challenges. Exploring the state-of-the-art machine
learning technique, Conditional Random Fields (CRF) and deep learning models
such as Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), Bidirectional Encoder
Representation from Transformers (Bert) and fine-tune with a Recurrent Neural
Network (RNN), the study evaluates the effectiveness of these approaches in
recognizing three entities: persons, organizations, and locations. The system
utilizes optical character recognition (OCR) technology to convert textual
images into machine-readable text, thereby enabling the Wazobia system to
accept both input text and textual images for extraction purposes. The system
achieved a performance of 0.9511 in precision, 0.9400 in recall, 0.9564 in
F1-score, and 0.9301 in accuracy. The model's evaluation was conducted across
three languages, with precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy as key
assessment metrics. The Wazobia-NER system demonstrates that it is feasible to
build robust NER tools for under-resourced African languages using current NLP
frameworks and transfer learning.

### [17] [PLHF: Prompt Optimization with Few-Shot Human Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07886)
*Chun-Pai Yang,Kan Zheng,Shou-De Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PLHF是一种基于人类反馈的提示优化框架，通过单轮反馈高效优化大语言模型的提示，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在输出质量难以通过标准样本评估时，缺乏有效的优化指标，PLHF旨在解决这一问题。

Method: PLHF采用类似RLHF的技术，引入评估模块作为质量指标，仅需单轮人类反馈完成优化。

Result: 在公开和工业数据集上，PLHF的表现优于先前的输出评分策略。

Conclusion: PLHF为无明确指标的提示优化提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Automatic prompt optimization frameworks are developed to obtain suitable
prompts for large language models (LLMs) with respect to desired output quality
metrics. Although existing approaches can handle conventional tasks such as
fixed-solution question answering, defining the metric becomes complicated when
the output quality cannot be easily assessed by comparisons with standard
golden samples. Consequently, optimizing the prompts effectively and
efficiently without a clear metric becomes a critical challenge. To address the
issue, we present PLHF (which stands for "P"rompt "L"earning with "H"uman
"F"eedback), a few-shot prompt optimization framework inspired by the
well-known RLHF technique. Different from naive strategies, PLHF employs a
specific evaluator module acting as the metric to estimate the output quality.
PLHF requires only a single round of human feedback to complete the entire
prompt optimization process. Empirical results on both public and industrial
datasets show that PLHF outperforms prior output grading strategies for LLM
prompt optimizations.

### [18] [Implementing Long Text Style Transfer with LLMs through Dual-Layered Sentence and Paragraph Structure Extraction and Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07888)
*Yusen Wu,Xiaotie Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于零样本学习的分层框架ZeroStylus，用于长文本风格迁移，结合句子级风格适应和段落级结构连贯性，显著提升了风格一致性、内容保留和表达质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长文本风格迁移中句子级和段落级语义一致性的挑战，避免对平行语料库或LLM微调的依赖。

Method: 提出分层框架ZeroStylus，包括从参考文本中获取分层模板和基于模板的多粒度匹配生成，动态构建句子和段落模板库。

Result: 实验显示，ZeroStylus在风格一致性、内容保留和表达质量上优于基线方法（6.90 vs. 6.70）。消融研究验证了分层模板的必要性。

Conclusion: ZeroStylus为无需平行语料库或LLM微调的长文本风格迁移提供了新方法，证明了分层模板的有效性。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge in long-text style transfer using
zero-shot learning of large language models (LLMs), proposing a hierarchical
framework that combines sentence-level stylistic adaptation with
paragraph-level structural coherence. We argue that in the process of effective
paragraph-style transfer, to preserve the consistency of original syntactic and
semantic information, it is essential to perform style transfer not only at the
sentence level but also to incorporate paragraph-level semantic considerations,
while ensuring structural coherence across inter-sentential relationships. Our
proposed framework, ZeroStylus, operates through two systematic phases:
hierarchical template acquisition from reference texts and template-guided
generation with multi-granular matching. The framework dynamically constructs
sentence and paragraph template repositories, enabling context-aware
transformations while preserving inter-sentence logical relationships.
Experimental evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over baseline
methods, with structured rewriting achieving 6.90 average score compared to
6.70 for direct prompting approaches in tri-axial metrics assessing style
consistency, content preservation, and expression quality. Ablation studies
validate the necessity of both template hierarchies during style transfer,
showing higher content preservation win rate against sentence-only approaches
through paragraph-level structural encoding, as well as direct prompting method
through sentence-level pattern extraction and matching. The results establish
new capabilities for coherent long-text style transfer without requiring
parallel corpora or LLM fine-tuning.

*Yuyang Liu,Liuzhenghao Lv,Xiancheng Zhang,Li Yuan,Yonghong Tian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BioProBench是一个首个大规模、多任务的生物协议理解与推理基准，包含五个核心任务，评估了12个主流LLM，发现它们在深层推理和结构化生成任务上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物协议对生命科学研究的可重复性和安全性至关重要，但目前LLM在这些高度专业化、准确性要求高的文本上的系统性评估有限。

Method: 构建了BioProBench基准，基于27K原始协议生成了556K高质量结构化实例，评估了12个主流LLM在五个核心任务上的表现。

Result: 实验显示，顶级LLM在表面理解任务上表现良好，但在深层推理和结构化生成任务（如排序和生成）上表现较差。开源模型在某些任务上接近闭源模型，但生物专用小模型落后于通用LLM。

Conclusion: 生物协议中的程序推理对当前LLM仍是一个重大挑战。BioProBench为诊断这些局限性提供了标准化框架，并指导开发更适合自动化复杂科学程序的AI系统。

Abstract: Biological protocols are fundamental to reproducible and safe life science
research. While LLMs excel on general tasks, their systematic evaluation on
these highly specialized, accuracy-critical, and inherently procedural texts
remains limited. In this work, we present BioProBench, the first large-scale,
integrated multi-task benchmark for biological protocol understanding and
reasoning. While limited benchmarks have touched upon specific aspects like
protocol QA, BioProBench provides a comprehensive suite of five core tasks:
Protocol Question Answering, Step Ordering, Error Correction, Protocol
Generation, and Protocol Reasoning, enabling a holistic evaluation of LLMs on
procedural biological texts. Built upon 27K original protocols, it yields
nearly 556K high-quality structured instances. We evaluate 12 mainstream
open/closed-source LLMs on BioProBench. Experimental results reveal that while
top models preform well on surface understanding tasks, struggle significantly
with deep reasoning and structured generation tasks like ordering and
generation. Furthermore, model comparisons reveal diverse performance: certain
open-source models approach closed-source levels on some tasks, yet
bio-specific small models lag behind general LLMs, indicating limitations on
complex procedural content. Overall, our findings underscore that procedural
reasoning within biological protocols represents a significant challenge for
current LLMs. BioProBench serves as a standardized framework to diagnose these
specific limitations and guide the development of AI systems better equipped
for safely automating complex scientific procedures. The code and data are

### [20] [TSLFormer: A Lightweight Transformer Model for Turkish Sign Language Recognition Using Skeletal Landmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07890)
*Kutay Ertürk,Furkan Altınışık,İrem Sarıaltın,Ömer Nezih Gerek*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TSLFormer是一种轻量级且鲁棒的土耳其手语识别模型，将手势视为有序的字符串语言，仅使用3D关节位置作为输入，通过序列到序列翻译实现高效识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手语识别通常依赖RGB或深度视频，计算成本高。本研究旨在通过仅使用3D关节位置降低输入维度，同时保留语义信息，实现实时和移动辅助通信。

Method: 使用Google的Mediapipe库提取手和躯干的3D关节位置作为输入，采用序列到序列的Transformer模型（TSLFormer），利用自注意力机制捕捉手势序列的时序共现和运动模式。

Result: 在AUTSL数据集（36,000样本，227个单词）上表现优异，计算成本低，表明基于关节的输入足以支持实时移动辅助通信。

Conclusion: TSLFormer证明了仅需3D关节位置即可高效识别手语，为听障人士的实时辅助通信系统提供了可行方案。

Abstract: This study presents TSLFormer, a light and robust word-level Turkish Sign
Language (TSL) recognition model that treats sign gestures as ordered,
string-like language. Instead of using raw RGB or depth videos, our method only
works with 3D joint positions - articulation points - extracted using Google's
Mediapipe library, which focuses on the hand and torso skeletal locations. This
creates efficient input dimensionality reduction while preserving important
semantic gesture information.
  Our approach revisits sign language recognition as sequence-to-sequence
translation, inspired by the linguistic nature of sign languages and the
success of transformers in natural language processing. Since TSLFormer uses
the self-attention mechanism, it effectively captures temporal co-occurrence
within gesture sequences and highlights meaningful motion patterns as words
unfold.
  Evaluated on the AUTSL dataset with over 36,000 samples and 227 different
words, TSLFormer achieves competitive performance with minimal computational
cost. These results show that joint-based input is sufficient for enabling
real-time, mobile, and assistive communication systems for hearing-impaired
individuals.

*Ching Nam Hang,Pei-Duo Yu,Chee Wei Tan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TrumorGPT是一种基于生成式AI的健康领域事实核查工具，通过语义健康知识图谱和GraphRAG技术，有效区分真实健康谣言（'trumors'）与虚假信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体时代，虚假信息快速传播形成信息疫情，对社会构成威胁，需高效工具区分健康谣言与事实。

Method: 利用大语言模型（LLM）和少样本学习构建语义健康知识图谱，结合GraphRAG技术动态更新数据，减少LLM幻觉问题。

Result: 在广泛医疗数据集测试中，TrumorGPT在公共卫生声明的事实核查上表现优异。

Conclusion: TrumorGPT为对抗健康虚假信息提供了高效工具，提升了数字时代信息的可信度和准确性。

Abstract: In the age of social media, the rapid spread of misinformation and rumors has
led to the emergence of infodemics, where false information poses a significant
threat to society. To combat this issue, we introduce TrumorGPT , a novel
generative artificial intelligence solution designed for fact-checking in the
health domain. TrumorGPT aims to distinguish "trumors", which are
health-related rumors that turn out to be true, providing a crucial tool in
differentiating between mere speculation and verified facts. This framework
leverages a large language model (LLM) with few-shot learning for semantic
health knowledge graph construction and semantic reasoning. TrumorGPT
incorporates graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG) to address
the hallucination issue common in LLMs and the limitations of static training
data. GraphRAG involves accessing and utilizing information from regularly
updated semantic health knowledge graphs that consist of the latest medical
news and health information, ensuring that fact-checking by TrumorGPT is based
on the most recent data. Evaluating with extensive healthcare datasets,
TrumorGPT demonstrates superior performance in fact-checking for public health
claims. Its ability to effectively conduct fact-checking across various
platforms marks a critical step forward in the fight against health-related
misinformation, enhancing trust and accuracy in the digital information age.

*Stefano Rando,Luca Romani,Alessio Sampieri,Yuta Kyuragi,Luca Franco,Fabio Galasso,Tatsunori Hashimoto,John Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了LongCodeBench（LCB），一个用于测试长上下文模型中代码理解和修复能力的基准测试，基于真实GitHub问题构建任务，发现所有模型在长上下文任务中表现下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代长上下文模型的上下文长度快速增长，但缺乏真实的长上下文基准测试，尤其是在代码理解和修复领域。

Method: 通过从真实GitHub问题中构建QA（LongCodeQA）和bug修复（LongSWE-Bench）任务，设计分层复杂度的基准测试LongCodeBench。

Result: 所有模型在长上下文任务中表现显著下降，例如Claude 3.5 Sonnet从29%降至3%，Qwen2.5从70.2%降至40%。

Conclusion: 长上下文仍是模型的弱点，LongCodeBench为评估和改进长上下文模型提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Context lengths for models have grown rapidly, from thousands to millions of
tokens in just a few years. The extreme context sizes of modern long-context
models have made it difficult to construct realistic long-context benchmarks --
not only due to the cost of collecting million-context tasks but also in
identifying realistic scenarios that require significant contexts. We identify
code comprehension and repair as a natural testbed and challenge task for
long-context models and introduce LongCodeBench (LCB), a benchmark to test LLM
coding abilities in long-context scenarios. Our benchmark tests both the
comprehension and repair capabilities of LCLMs in realistic and important
settings by drawing from real-world GitHub issues and constructing QA
(LongCodeQA) and bug fixing (LongSWE-Bench) tasks. We carefully stratify the
complexity of our benchmark, enabling us to evaluate models across different
scales -- ranging from Qwen2.5 14B Instruct to Google's flagship Gemini model.
We find that long-context remains a weakness for all models, with performance
drops such as from 29% to 3% for Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or from 70.2% to 40% for
Qwen2.5.

TL;DR: DeltaEdit通过动态正交约束策略优化更新参数，解决长期知识编辑中叠加噪声积累问题，显著提升编辑成功率和模型泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有连续知识编辑方法在长期编辑后编辑成功率显著下降，模型输出偏离目标，称为叠加噪声积累问题。

Method: 提出DeltaEdit，通过动态正交约束策略优化更新参数，减少编辑间的干扰。

Result: 实验表明DeltaEdit在编辑成功率和泛化能力保留上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DeltaEdit能在长期连续编辑下保持模型性能稳定可靠。

Abstract: Sequential knowledge editing techniques aim to continuously update the
knowledge in large language models at a low cost, preventing the models from
generating outdated or incorrect information. However, existing sequential
editing methods suffer from a significant decline in editing success rates
after long-term editing. Through theoretical analysis and experiments, we
identify that as the number of edits increases, the model's output increasingly
deviates from the desired target, leading to a drop in editing success rates.
We refer to this issue as the accumulation of superimposed noise problem. To
address this, we identify the factors contributing to this deviation and
propose DeltaEdit, a novel method that optimizes update parameters through a
dynamic orthogonal constraints strategy, effectively reducing interference
between edits to mitigate deviation. Experimental results demonstrate that
DeltaEdit significantly outperforms existing methods in edit success rates and
the retention of generalization capabilities, ensuring stable and reliable
model performance even under extensive sequential editing.

*Zeyang Sha,Shiwen Cui,Weiqiang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SEM的后训练强化学习框架，旨在优化大型语言模型（LLMs）的搜索行为，减少冗余搜索并提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法导致LLMs频繁进行冗余搜索，造成效率低下和成本过高。

Method: 通过结合MuSiQue和MMLU构建平衡数据集，设计结构化推理模板，并使用Group Relative Policy Optimization（GRPO）后训练模型。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著减少了冗余搜索操作，同时保持或提高了多个基准测试的答案准确性。

Conclusion: SEM框架提升了模型的推理效率，并扩展了其明智利用外部知识的能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models(LLMs) have demonstrated their
capabilities not only in reasoning but also in invoking external tools,
particularly search engines. However, teaching models to discern when to invoke
search and when to rely on their internal knowledge remains a significant
challenge. Existing reinforcement learning approaches often lead to redundant
search behaviors, resulting in inefficiencies and over-cost. In this paper, we
propose SEM, a novel post-training reinforcement learning framework that
explicitly trains LLMs to optimize search usage. By constructing a balanced
dataset combining MuSiQue and MMLU, we create scenarios where the model must
learn to distinguish between questions it can answer directly and those
requiring external retrieval. We design a structured reasoning template and
employ Group Relative Policy Optimization(GRPO) to post-train the model's
search behaviors. Our reward function encourages accurate answering without
unnecessary search while promoting effective retrieval when needed.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly reduces
redundant search operations while maintaining or improving answer accuracy
across multiple challenging benchmarks. This framework advances the model's
reasoning efficiency and extends its capability to judiciously leverage
external knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 同行评审系统因提交量激增和重复提交低质量稿件而超负荷，缺乏作者自我评估工具。LLMs的潜力受限于现有数据集的质量和多样性。

Method: 构建Re^2数据集，包含初始提交、评审意见和反驳，支持多轮对话范式，用于静态和动态LLM辅助任务。

Result: Re^2数据集包含19,926份初始提交、70,668条评审意见和53,818条反驳，覆盖24个会议和21个研讨会。

Conclusion: Re^2数据集为作者和评审提供实用工具，有望缓解评审负担并提升稿件质量。

Abstract: Peer review is a critical component of scientific progress in the fields like
AI, but the rapid increase in submission volume has strained the reviewing
system, which inevitably leads to reviewer shortages and declines review
quality. Besides the growing research popularity, another key factor in this
overload is the repeated resubmission of substandard manuscripts, largely due
to the lack of effective tools for authors to self-evaluate their work before
submission. Large Language Models (LLMs) show great promise in assisting both
authors and reviewers, and their performance is fundamentally limited by the
quality of the peer review data. However, existing peer review datasets face
three major limitations: (1) limited data diversity, (2) inconsistent and
low-quality data due to the use of revised rather than initial submissions, and
(3) insufficient support for tasks involving rebuttal and reviewer-author
interactions. To address these challenges, we introduce the largest
consistency-ensured peer review and rebuttal dataset named Re^2, which
comprises 19,926 initial submissions, 70,668 review comments, and 53,818
rebuttals from 24 conferences and 21 workshops on OpenReview. Moreover, the
rebuttal and discussion stage is framed as a multi-turn conversation paradigm
to support both traditional static review tasks and dynamic interactive LLM
assistants, providing more practical guidance for authors to refine their
manuscripts and helping alleviate the growing review burden. Our data and code
are available in https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ReviewBench_anon/.

Method: 开发了DriftMedQA基准测试，模拟指南演变，评估了七种LLMs的时间可靠性，并探索了检索增强生成和偏好微调两种缓解策略。

Result: 模型在拒绝过时建议和避免矛盾指导方面表现不佳，但两种缓解策略结合使用效果最佳。

Conclusion: 需提升LLMs对时间变化的鲁棒性，以确保其在临床实践中的可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have great potential in the field of health
care, yet they face great challenges in adapting to rapidly evolving medical
knowledge. This can lead to outdated or contradictory treatment suggestions.
This study investigated how LLMs respond to evolving clinical guidelines,
focusing on concept drift and internal inconsistencies. We developed the
DriftMedQA benchmark to simulate guideline evolution and assessed the temporal
reliability of various LLMs. Our evaluation of seven state-of-the-art models
across 4,290 scenarios demonstrated difficulties in rejecting outdated
recommendations and frequently endorsing conflicting guidance. Additionally, we
explored two mitigation strategies: Retrieval-Augmented Generation and
preference fine-tuning via Direct Preference Optimization. While each method
improved model performance, their combination led to the most consistent and
reliable results. These findings underscore the need to improve LLM robustness
to temporal shifts to ensure more dependable applications in clinical practice.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的任务自适应语义通信框架，动态调整语义信息传递以适应不同下游任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 下一代网络通信需要从比特级数据传输转向语义传递以提高带宽效率，同时需适应接收端多样化任务需求。

Method: 通过扩散模型初始化传输深度压缩的通用语义表示，接收端生成任务特定提示作为反馈，结合注意力机制更新语义传输。

Result: 测试表明该方法能自适应保留任务关键信息，同时保持高压缩效率。

Conclusion: 该框架为语义通信提供了一种高效、任务自适应的解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic communications represent a new paradigm of next-generation
networking that shifts bit-wise data delivery to conveying the semantic
meanings for bandwidth efficiency. To effectively accommodate various potential
downstream tasks at the receiver side, one should adaptively convey the most
critical semantic information. This work presents a novel task-adaptive
semantic communication framework based on diffusion models that is capable of
dynamically adjusting the semantic message delivery according to various
downstream tasks. Specifically, we initialize the transmission of a
deep-compressed general semantic representation from the transmitter to enable
diffusion-based coarse data reconstruction at the receiver. The receiver
identifies the task-specific demands and generates textual prompts as feedback.
Integrated with the attention mechanism, the transmitter updates the semantic
transmission with more details to better align with the objectives of the
intended receivers. Our test results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
method in adaptively preserving critical task-relevant information for semantic
communications while preserving high compression efficiency.

Abstract: Over the past three years, the rapid advancement of Large Language Models
(LLMs) has had a profound impact on multiple areas of Artificial Intelligence
(AI), particularly in Natural Language Processing (NLP) across diverse
languages, including Arabic. Although Arabic is considered one of the most
widely spoken languages across 27 countries in the Arabic world and used as a
second language in some other non-Arabic countries as well, there is still a
scarcity of Arabic resources, datasets, and tools. Arabic NLP tasks face
various challenges due to the complexities of the Arabic language, including
its rich morphology, intricate structure, and diverse writing standards, among
other factors. Researchers have been actively addressing these challenges,
demonstrating that pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on
multilingual corpora achieve significant success in various Arabic NLP tasks.
This study provides an overview of using large language models (LLMs) for the
Arabic language, highlighting early pre-trained Arabic Language models across
various NLP applications and their ability to handle diverse Arabic content
tasks and dialects. It also provides an overview of how techniques like
finetuning and prompt engineering can enhance the performance of these models.
Additionally, the study summarizes common Arabic benchmarks and datasets while
presenting our observations on the persistent upward trend in the adoption of
LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对藏文多级拼写错误（字符和音节级别）的校正方法TiSpell，通过数据增强和半掩码策略提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注单级校正，缺乏对字符和音节级别错误的有效整合，且缺乏针对藏文的开源数据集或增强方法。

Method: 提出数据增强方法生成多级错误，并设计半掩码模型TiSpell，支持字符和音节级别校正。

Result: 实验表明，TiSpell在模拟和真实数据上优于基线模型，与最先进方法性能相当。

Conclusion: TiSpell通过多级校正和数据增强，有效解决了藏文拼写错误问题。

Abstract: Multi-level Tibetan spelling correction addresses errors at both the
character and syllable levels within a unified model. Existing methods focus
mainly on single-level correction and lack effective integration of both
levels. Moreover, there are no open-source datasets or augmentation methods
tailored for this task in Tibetan. To tackle this, we propose a data
augmentation approach using unlabeled text to generate multi-level corruptions,
and introduce TiSpell, a semi-masked model capable of correcting both
character- and syllable-level errors. Although syllable-level correction is
more challenging due to its reliance on global context, our semi-masked
strategy simplifies this process. We synthesize nine types of corruptions on
clean sentences to create a robust training set. Experiments on both simulated
and real-world data demonstrate that TiSpell, trained on our dataset,
outperforms baseline models and matches the performance of state-of-the-art
approaches, confirming its effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型（LLMs）在安全对齐中对良性查询过度拒绝的问题，提升模型在敏感场景的实用性。

Method: 提出FalseReject资源，包含16k看似有毒的查询和结构化响应，采用图引导的多智能体对抗框架生成多样化提示，并设计训练数据集和基准测试集。

Result: 在29个SOTA LLMs上的实验表明，FalseReject显著减少了不必要的拒绝，同时保持安全性和语言能力。

Conclusion: FalseReject通过结构化响应和多样化提示生成，有效解决了LLMs的过度拒绝问题，提升了模型的实用性。

Abstract: Safety alignment approaches in large language models (LLMs) often lead to the
over-refusal of benign queries, significantly diminishing their utility in
sensitive scenarios. To address this challenge, we introduce FalseReject, a
comprehensive resource containing 16k seemingly toxic queries accompanied by
structured responses across 44 safety-related categories. We propose a
graph-informed adversarial multi-agent interaction framework to generate
diverse and complex prompts, while structuring responses with explicit
reasoning to aid models in accurately distinguishing safe from unsafe contexts.
FalseReject includes training datasets tailored for both standard
instruction-tuned models and reasoning-oriented models, as well as a
human-annotated benchmark test set. Our extensive benchmarking on 29
state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs reveals persistent over-refusal challenges.
Empirical results demonstrate that supervised finetuning with FalseReject
substantially reduces unnecessary refusals without compromising overall safety
or general language capabilities.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）是否能模拟人类伦理推理，并通过基准数据集和复合指标评估了多个前沿LLM的表现。结果显示LLM在词汇和结构对齐上优于非专家人类，但在历史背景和复杂策略上仍有不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM是否能作为人类伦理判断的可信代理，填补其在伦理推理能力研究上的空白。

Method: 引入包含196个真实伦理困境的基准数据集，采用复合指标（BLEU、Damerau-Levenshtein距离等）评估LLM与非专家人类的表现。

Result: LLM在词汇和结构对齐上优于人类，但在历史背景和复杂策略上表现不佳；人类虽结构松散，但语义相似性偶尔接近。

Conclusion: LLM在伦理决策中展现出潜力，但在抽象推理和背景理解上仍需改进。

Abstract: One open question in the study of Large Language Models (LLMs) is whether
they can emulate human ethical reasoning and act as believable proxies for
human judgment. To investigate this, we introduce a benchmark dataset
comprising 196 real-world ethical dilemmas and expert opinions, each segmented
into five structured components: Introduction, Key Factors, Historical
Theoretical Perspectives, Resolution Strategies, and Key Takeaways. We also
collect non-expert human responses for comparison, limited to the Key Factors
section due to their brevity. We evaluate multiple frontier LLMs (GPT-4o-mini,
Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Deepseek-V3, Gemini-1.5-Flash) using a composite metric
framework based on BLEU, Damerau-Levenshtein distance, TF-IDF cosine
similarity, and Universal Sentence Encoder similarity. Metric weights are
computed through an inversion-based ranking alignment and pairwise AHP
analysis, enabling fine-grained comparison of model outputs to expert
responses. Our results show that LLMs generally outperform non-expert humans in
lexical and structural alignment, with GPT-4o-mini performing most consistently
across all sections. However, all models struggle with historical grounding and
proposing nuanced resolution strategies, which require contextual abstraction.
Human responses, while less structured, occasionally achieve comparable
semantic similarity, suggesting intuitive moral reasoning. These findings
highlight both the strengths and current limitations of LLMs in ethical
decision-making.

Motivation: 探讨语言模型代理架构的复杂性是否必要，尤其是在SWE-bench等复杂任务中。

Method: 使用长上下文语言模型（LCLM）直接处理任务，无需复杂支架或工具，并测试Gemini和Claude模型的表现。

Result: Gemini-1.5-Pro无支架方法达到38%解决率，Gemini-2.5-Pro提升至50.8%，两阶段方法（Gemini-1.5-Pro + Claude-3.7）达到48.6%。

Conclusion: 部分复杂代理架构的支架可以简化，长上下文语言模型在特定任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Recent advances in language model (LM) agents have demonstrated significant
potential for automating complex real-world tasks. To make progress on these
difficult tasks, LM agent architectures have become increasingly complex, often
incorporating multi-step retrieval tools, multiple agents, and scaffolding
adapted to the underlying LM. In this work, we investigate whether all of this
complexity is necessary, or if parts of these scaffolds can be removed on
challenging tasks like SWE-bench. We show that in the case of SWE-bench, simply
putting the entire environment into the context of a long context language
model (LCLM) and properly prompting the model makes it competitive with
carefully tuned, complex agent scaffolds. We show that a Gemini-1.5-Pro model
without any scaffolding or tools achieves 38% on SWE-Bench-Verified, comparable
with approaches using carefully tuned agent scaffolds (32%). While the
unscaffolded approach with Gemini-1.5-Pro falls short of the strongest agentic
architectures, we demonstrate that the more capable Gemini-2.5-Pro using the
same unscaffolded approach directly attains a 50.8% solve rate. Additionally, a
two-stage approach combining Gemini-1.5-Pro with Claude-3.7 achieves a
competitive 48.6% solve rate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型和搜索引擎在满足校园特定信息需求（如多语言和实时性）方面存在不足。

Method: 引入ALOHA系统，结合分层检索和外部API集成，提供交互式服务。

Result: 系统在多语言查询中表现优异，超越商业聊天机器人和搜索引擎，已服务超过12,000人。

Conclusion: ALOHA系统能有效提供准确、及时且用户友好的多语言校园信息检索服务。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models~(LLMs) revolutionizes information
retrieval, allowing users to obtain required answers through complex
instructions within conversations. However, publicly available services remain
inadequate in addressing the needs of faculty and students to search
campus-specific information. It is primarily due to the LLM's lack of
domain-specific knowledge and the limitation of search engines in supporting
multilingual and timely scenarios. To tackle these challenges, we introduce
ALOHA, a multilingual agent enhanced by hierarchical retrieval for university
orientation. We also integrate external APIs into the front-end interface to
provide interactive service. The human evaluation and case study show our
proposed system has strong capabilities to yield correct, timely, and
user-friendly responses to the queries in multiple languages, surpassing
commercial chatbots and search engines. The system has been deployed and has
provided service for more than 12,000 people.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的快速发展为领域特定LLMs提供了支持，但使用非物质文化遗产（ICH）数据微调这些模型时面临偏见、知识继承错误和灾难性遗忘等挑战。

Method: 提出了一种结合双向思维链和奖励机制的训练方法，基于专门为非物质文化遗产设计的ICH-Qwen模型，通过反向提问和推理激活潜在知识，并引入奖励机制优化决策过程。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在问答任务中的准确性、Bleu-4和Rouge-L分数上优于0-shot、逐步推理、知识蒸馏和问题增强方法，并在多个领域特定数据集上表现出泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅适用于非物质文化遗产领域，还能推广到金融、Wikidata和StrategyQA等多个领域，为未来跨领域模型训练提供了有价值的参考。

Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has provided
significant support and opportunities for the advancement of domain-specific
LLMs. However, fine-tuning these large models using Intangible Cultural
Heritage (ICH) data inevitably faces challenges such as bias, incorrect
knowledge inheritance, and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we
propose a novel training method that integrates a bidirectional chains of
thought and a reward mechanism. This method is built upon ICH-Qwen, a large
language model specifically designed for the field of intangible cultural
heritage. The proposed method enables the model to not only perform forward
reasoning but also enhances the accuracy of the generated answers by utilizing
reverse questioning and reverse reasoning to activate the model's latent
knowledge. Additionally, a reward mechanism is introduced during training to
optimize the decision-making process. This mechanism improves the quality of
the model's outputs through structural and content evaluations with different
weighting schemes. We conduct comparative experiments on ICH-Qwen, with results
demonstrating that our method outperforms 0-shot, step-by-step reasoning,
knowledge distillation, and question augmentation methods in terms of accuracy,
Bleu-4, and Rouge-L scores on the question-answering task. Furthermore, the
paper highlights the effectiveness of combining the bidirectional chains of
thought and reward mechanism through ablation experiments. In addition, a
series of generalizability experiments are conducted, with results showing that
the proposed method yields improvements on various domain-specific datasets and
advanced models in areas such as Finance, Wikidata, and StrategyQA. This
demonstrates that the method is adaptable to multiple domains and provides a
valuable approach for model training in future applications across diverse
fields.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种文本语义增强（TSA）方法，通过引入更多文本语义监督信号来提升文本属性图（TAG）中的少样本和零样本节点分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要基于图增强技术训练节点和文本嵌入，而文本增强技术尚未充分探索。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 设计了两种文本语义增强技术：正语义匹配和负语义对比，以提供更多参考文本。

Result: 在5个数据集上与13个基线方法对比，TSA始终表现最优，通常比最佳基线方法提升5%以上的准确率。

Conclusion: TSA通过文本语义增强显著提升了节点分类性能，证明了文本增强在TAG中的重要性。

Abstract: Text-attributed graph (TAG) provides a text description for each graph node,
and few- and zero-shot node classification on TAGs have many applications in
fields such as academia and social networks. Existing work utilizes various
graph-based augmentation techniques to train the node and text embeddings,
while text-based augmentations are largely unexplored. In this paper, we
propose Text Semantics Augmentation (TSA) to improve accuracy by introducing
more text semantic supervision signals. Specifically, we design two
augmentation techniques, i.e., positive semantics matching and negative
semantics contrast, to provide more reference texts for each graph node or text
description. Positive semantic matching retrieves texts with similar embeddings
to match with a graph node. Negative semantic contrast adds a negative prompt
to construct a text description with the opposite semantics, which is
contrasted with the original node and text. We evaluate TSA on 5 datasets and
compare with 13 state-of-the-art baselines. The results show that TSA
consistently outperforms all baselines, and its accuracy improvements over the
best-performing baseline are usually over 5%.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种预训练的不确定性量化（UQ）模块，用于增强大型语言模型（LLMs）检测幻觉（虚假信息）的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs容易生成虚假信息（幻觉），且难以被用户察觉，因此需要一种有效的方法来量化模型输出的不确定性。

Method: 设计了基于Transformer架构的预训练UQ模块，利用LLM的注意力图提取特征，显著优于无监督方法。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在领域内外均实现了最先进的幻觉检测性能，并具备跨语言的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 预训练的UQ模块为LLMs提供了一种高效且鲁棒的幻觉检测工具，相关代码和模型已公开。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have the tendency to hallucinate, i.e., to
sporadically generate false or fabricated information. This presents a major
challenge, as hallucinations often appear highly convincing and users generally
lack the tools to detect them. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) provides a
framework for assessing the reliability of model outputs, aiding in the
identification of potential hallucinations. In this work, we introduce
pre-trained UQ heads: supervised auxiliary modules for LLMs that substantially
enhance their ability to capture uncertainty compared to unsupervised UQ
methods. Their strong performance stems from the powerful Transformer
architecture in their design and informative features derived from LLM
attention maps. Experimental evaluation shows that these heads are highly
robust and achieve state-of-the-art performance in claim-level hallucination
detection across both in-domain and out-of-domain prompts. Moreover, these
modules demonstrate strong generalization to languages they were not explicitly
trained on. We pre-train a collection of UQ heads for popular LLM series,
including Mistral, Llama, and Gemma 2. We publicly release both the code and
the pre-trained heads.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has outpaced
traditional evaluation methodologies. It presents novel challenges, such as
measuring human-like psychological constructs, navigating beyond static and
task-specific benchmarks, and establishing human-centered evaluation. These
challenges intersect with Psychometrics, the science of quantifying the
intangible aspects of human psychology, such as personality, values, and
intelligence. This survey introduces and synthesizes an emerging
interdisciplinary field of LLM Psychometrics, which leverages psychometric
instruments, theories, and principles to evaluate, understand, and enhance
LLMs. We systematically explore the role of Psychometrics in shaping
benchmarking principles, broadening evaluation scopes, refining methodologies,
validating results, and advancing LLM capabilities. This paper integrates
diverse perspectives to provide a structured framework for researchers across
disciplines, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of this nascent field.
Ultimately, we aim to provide actionable insights for developing future
evaluation paradigms that align with human-level AI and promote the advancement
of human-centered AI systems for societal benefit. A curated repository of LLM

Result: 实验表明，所提方法能提升扩展性、优化效率，并改善多跳推理性能。

Conclusion: ACC和混合框架为实际知识集成挑战提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid progress in large language models (LLMs) has paved the way for
novel approaches in knowledge-intensive tasks. Among these, Cache-Augmented
Generation (CAG) has emerged as a promising alternative to Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG). CAG minimizes retrieval latency and simplifies system design
by preloading knowledge into the model's context. However, challenges persist
in scaling CAG to accommodate large and dynamic knowledge bases effectively.
This paper introduces Adaptive Contextual Compression (ACC), an innovative
technique designed to dynamically compress and manage context inputs, enabling
efficient utilization of the extended memory capabilities of modern LLMs. To
further address the limitations of standalone CAG, we propose a Hybrid CAG-RAG
Framework, which integrates selective retrieval to augment preloaded contexts
in scenarios requiring additional information. Comprehensive evaluations on
diverse datasets highlight the proposed methods' ability to enhance
scalability, optimize efficiency, and improve multi-hop reasoning performance,
offering practical solutions for real-world knowledge integration challenges.

Motivation: 探究黑盒提示优化方法在大规模LLMs中的有效性，验证模型规模对优化效果的影响。

Method: 选择三种黑盒优化方法，在DeepSeek V3和Gemini 2.0 Flash等大规模LLMs上进行评估，并分析不同规模模型（Qwen 2.5系列）的效果。

Result: 黑盒优化方法在大规模LLMs中效果有限，且随着模型规模增大，优化效果逐渐减弱（逆缩放定律）。

Conclusion: 模型规模是黑盒提示优化效果的关键因素，大规模LLMs可能需要其他优化策略。

Abstract: Black-Box prompt optimization methods have emerged as a promising strategy
for refining input prompts to better align large language models (LLMs),
thereby enhancing their task performance. Although these methods have
demonstrated encouraging results, most studies and experiments have primarily
focused on smaller-scale models (e.g., 7B, 14B) or earlier versions (e.g.,
GPT-3.5) of LLMs. As the scale of LLMs continues to increase, such as with
DeepSeek V3 (671B), it remains an open question whether these black-box
optimization techniques will continue to yield significant performance
improvements for models of such scale. In response to this, we select three
well-known black-box optimization methods and evaluate them on large-scale LLMs
(DeepSeek V3 and Gemini 2.0 Flash) across four NLU and NLG datasets. The
results show that these black-box prompt optimization methods offer only
limited improvements on these large-scale LLMs. Furthermore, we hypothesize
that the scale of the model is the primary factor contributing to the limited
benefits observed. To explore this hypothesis, we conducted experiments on LLMs
of varying sizes (Qwen 2.5 series, ranging from 7B to 72B) and observed an
inverse scaling law, wherein the effectiveness of black-box optimization
methods diminished as the model size increased.

Result: 研究发现最重要的SVD因子在训练初期被学习，并提出基于谱聚类的嵌入分析方法，揭示了可解释的语义结构。

Conclusion: 论文连接了分布语义学、神经崩溃几何和神经网络训练动态，揭示了NTP隐式偏置如何塑造语言模型中的意义表示。

Abstract: Modern language models demonstrate a remarkable ability to capture linguistic
meaning despite being trained solely through next-token prediction (NTP). We
investigate how this conceptually simple training objective leads models to
extract and encode latent semantic and grammatical concepts. Our analysis
reveals that NTP optimization implicitly guides models to encode concepts via
singular value decomposition (SVD) factors of a centered data-sparsity matrix
that captures next-word co-occurrence patterns. While the model never
explicitly constructs this matrix, learned word and context embeddings
effectively factor it to capture linguistic structure. We find that the most
important SVD factors are learned first during training, motivating the use of
spectral clustering of embeddings to identify human-interpretable semantics,
including both classical k-means and a new orthant-based method directly
motivated by our interpretation of concepts. Overall, our work bridges
distributional semantics, neural collapse geometry, and neural network training
dynamics, providing insights into how NTP's implicit biases shape the emergence
of meaning representations in language models.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）作为第二语言学习自适应导师的潜力，评估了系统提示能否可靠约束LLMs生成适合学生能力水平的文本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在语言学习中的适应性，尤其是通过系统提示控制文本难度，以支持个性化学习。

Method: 使用7B至12B参数的指令调优开源LLMs模拟西班牙语师生对话，通过CEFR分级提示控制文本难度。

Result: 系统提示可约束模型输出，但提示单独使用在长期交互中不够稳定（对齐漂移现象）。

Conclusion: LLMs作为自适应导师具有潜力，但需改进提示方法以支持长期交互，同时提供了一种低成本评估模型性能的方法。

Abstract: This paper investigates the potentials of Large Language Models (LLMs) as
adaptive tutors in the context of second-language learning. In particular, we
evaluate whether system prompting can reliably constrain LLMs to generate only
text appropriate to the student's competence level. We simulate full
teacher-student dialogues in Spanish using instruction-tuned, open-source LLMs
ranging in size from 7B to 12B parameters. Dialogues are generated by having an
LLM alternate between tutor and student roles with separate chat histories. The
output from the tutor model is then used to evaluate the effectiveness of
CEFR-based prompting to control text difficulty across three proficiency levels
(A1, B1, C1). Our findings suggest that while system prompting can be used to
constrain model outputs, prompting alone is too brittle for sustained,
long-term interactional contexts - a phenomenon we term alignment drift. Our
results provide insights into the feasibility of LLMs for personalized,
proficiency-aligned adaptive tutors and provide a scalable method for low-cost
evaluation of model performance without human participants.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM评估因污染问题而不可靠，需要开发抗污染基准以准确评估模型能力。

Method: 提出基于凯撒密码的污染抵抗基准，并在不同设置下测试广泛使用的LLMs。

Result: LLMs在污染受控时表现不佳，暴露了其真实能力的不足。

Conclusion: 该研究为开发抗污染基准提供了方向，有助于更严谨地评估LLMs的真实能力与局限性。

Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has transformed the
landscape of natural language processing. Evaluating LLMs properly is crucial
for understanding their potential and addressing concerns such as safety.
However, LLM evaluation is confronted by various factors, among which
contamination stands out as a key issue that undermines the reliability of
evaluations. In this work, we introduce the concept of contamination resistance
to address this challenge. We propose a benchmark based on Caesar ciphers
(e.g., "ab" to "bc" when the shift is 1), which, despite its simplicity, is an
excellent example of a contamination resistant benchmark. We test this
benchmark on widely used LLMs under various settings, and we find that these
models struggle with this benchmark when contamination is controlled. Our
findings reveal issues in current LLMs and raise important questions regarding
their true capabilities. Our work contributes to the development of
contamination resistant benchmarks, enabling more rigorous LLM evaluation and
offering insights into the true capabilities and limitations of LLMs.

### [45] [Accelerating Chain-of-Thought Reasoning: When Goal-Gradient Importance Meets Dynamic Skipping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08392)
*Ren Zhuang,Ben Wang,Shuifa Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出Adaptive GoGI-Skip框架，通过动态压缩Chain-of-Thought（CoT）提示，结合Goal-Gradient Importance（GoGI）和Adaptive Dynamic Skipping（ADS），显著提升推理效率并保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前CoT压缩技术依赖通用重要性指标和静态压缩率，可能导致关键信息丢失或无法适应不同推理复杂度。

Method: 提出GoGI指标衡量中间表示对最终答案损失的影响，结合ADS机制动态调节压缩率。

Result: 在MATH数据上训练，跨领域测试显示平均减少45%的CoT标记，推理速度提升1.6-2.0倍，同时保持高准确性。

Conclusion: Adaptive GoGI-Skip在效率和准确性上优于现有基线，推动了CoT推理的优化。

Abstract: Large Language Models leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting for complex
tasks, but their reasoning traces are often excessively verbose and
inefficient, leading to significant computational costs and latency. Current
CoT compression techniques typically rely on generic importance metrics and
static compression rates, which may inadvertently remove functionally critical
tokens or fail to adapt to varying reasoning complexity. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Adaptive GoGI-Skip, a novel framework learning dynamic
CoT compression via supervised fine-tuning. This approach introduces two
synergistic innovations: (1) Goal-Gradient Importance (GoGI), a novel metric
accurately identifying functionally relevant tokens by measuring the gradient
influence of their intermediate representations on the final answer loss, and
(2) Adaptive Dynamic Skipping (ADS), a mechanism dynamically regulating the
compression rate based on runtime model uncertainty while ensuring local
coherence through an adaptive N-token constraint. To our knowledge, this is the
first work unifying a goal-oriented, gradient-based importance metric with
dynamic, uncertainty-aware skipping for CoT compression. Trained on compressed
MATH data, Adaptive GoGI-Skip demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization
across diverse reasoning benchmarks including AIME, GPQA, and GSM8K. It
achieves substantial efficiency gains - reducing CoT token counts by over 45%
on average and delivering 1.6-2.0 times inference speedups - while maintaining
high reasoning accuracy. Notably, it significantly outperforms existing
baselines by preserving accuracy even at high effective compression rates,
advancing the state of the art in the CoT reasoning efficiency-accuracy
trade-off.

TL;DR: TUMS框架通过将工具级处理转化为参数级处理，提升了LLMs的工具使用能力，显著提高了在ToolQA基准上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在工具集成中面临非可执行操作和参数错误的问题，TUMS旨在通过细化参数生成过程解决这些问题。

Method: TUMS框架包含意图识别器、任务分解器、子任务处理器和执行器，通过多结构处理器生成准确参数。

Result: 在ToolQA基准测试中，TUMS在简单和困难任务上分别提升了19.6%和50.6%。

Conclusion: TUMS框架有效提升了LLMs的工具使用能力，并通过消融实验验证了各组件的重要性。

Abstract: Recently, large language models(LLMs) have played an increasingly important
role in solving a wide range of NLP tasks, leveraging their capabilities of
natural language understanding and generating. Integration with external tools
further enhances LLMs' effectiveness, providing more precise, timely, and
specialized responses. However, LLMs still encounter difficulties with
non-executable actions and improper actions, which are primarily attributed to
incorrect parameters. The process of generating parameters by LLMs is confined
to the tool level, employing the coarse-grained strategy without considering
the different difficulties of various tools. To address this issue, we propose
TUMS, a novel framework designed to enhance the tool-use capabilities of LLMs
by transforming tool-level processing into parameter-level processing.
Specifically, our framework consists of four key components: (1) an intent
recognizer that identifies the user's intent to help LLMs better understand the
task; (2) a task decomposer that breaks down complex tasks into simpler
subtasks, each involving a tool call; (3) a subtask processor equipped with
multi-structure handlers to generate accurate parameters; and (4) an executor.
Our empirical studies have evidenced the effectiveness and efficiency of the
TUMS framework with an average of 19.6\% and 50.6\% improvement separately on
easy and hard benchmarks of ToolQA, meanwhile, we demonstrated the key
contribution of each part with ablation experiments, offering more insights and
stimulating future research on Tool-augmented LLMs.

Conclusion: Hakim为波斯语理解提供了新基础，特别适用于检索任务和聊天机器人应用。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text embedding have significantly improved natural
language understanding across many languages, yet Persian remains notably
underrepresented in large-scale embedding research. In this paper, we present
Hakim, a novel state-of-the-art Persian text embedding model that achieves a
8.5% performance improvement over existing approaches on the FaMTEB benchmark,
outperforming all previously developed Persian language models. As part of this
work, we introduce three new datasets - Corpesia, Pairsia-sup, and
Pairsia-unsup - to support supervised and unsupervised training scenarios.
Additionally, Hakim is designed for applications in chatbots and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, particularly addressing retrieval
tasks that require incorporating message history within these systems. We also
propose a new baseline model built on the BERT architecture. Our language model
consistently achieves higher accuracy across various Persian NLP tasks, while
the RetroMAE-based model proves particularly effective for textual information
retrieval applications. Together, these contributions establish a new
foundation for advancing Persian language understanding.

Motivation: 意大利法律研究中缺乏公开数据集，限制了最高法院判决中法律主题的分析。

Method: 开发了一个集成文档布局分析（YOLOv8x）、光学字符识别和文本匿名化的处理流程。

Result: 文档布局分析的mAP@50为0.964，OCR检测器的mAP@50-95为0.9022，文本识别器的字符错误率为0.0047。数据集提升了主题建模的多样性（0.6198）和一致性（0.6638）。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了主题建模效果，并通过大型语言模型生成标签和摘要，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Topic modeling in Italian legal research is hindered by the lack of public
datasets, limiting the analysis of legal themes in Supreme Court judgments. To
address this, we developed a document processing pipeline that produces an
anonymized dataset optimized for topic modeling.
  The pipeline integrates document layout analysis (YOLOv8x), optical character
recognition, and text anonymization. The DLA module achieved a mAP@50 of 0.964
and a mAP@50-95 of 0.800. The OCR detector reached a mAP@50-95 of 0.9022, and
the text recognizer (TrOCR) obtained a character error rate of 0.0047 and a
word error rate of 0.0248. Compared to OCR-only methods, our dataset improved
topic modeling with a diversity score of 0.6198 and a coherence score of
0.6638.
  We applied BERTopic to extract topics and used large language models to
generate labels and summaries. Outputs were evaluated against domain expert
interpretations. Claude Sonnet 3.7 achieved a BERTScore F1 of 0.8119 for
labeling and 0.9130 for summarization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IterKey是一个基于稀疏检索的LLM驱动框架，通过迭代生成关键词来增强RAG，平衡了准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决密集检索方法缺乏可解释性和稀疏检索方法无法完全捕捉查询意图的问题。

Method: 采用三阶段LLM驱动流程：生成检索关键词、基于检索文档生成答案、验证答案。若验证失败，则迭代优化关键词。

Result: 在四个QA任务中，IterKey比基于BM25的RAG和简单基线方法准确率提升5%至20%，性能接近密集检索方法。

Conclusion: IterKey是一种新颖的基于BM25的方法，利用LLM迭代优化RAG，有效平衡准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a way to complement the
in-context knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external
documents. However, real-world applications demand not only accuracy but also
interpretability. While dense retrieval methods provide high accuracy, they
lack interpretability; conversely, sparse retrieval methods offer transparency
but often fail to capture the full intent of queries due to their reliance on
keyword matching. To address these issues, we introduce IterKey, an LLM-driven
iterative keyword generation framework that enhances RAG via sparse retrieval.
IterKey consists of three LLM-driven stages: generating keywords for retrieval,
generating answers based on retrieved documents, and validating the answers. If
validation fails, the process iteratively repeats with refined keywords. Across
four QA tasks, experimental results show that IterKey achieves 5% to 20%
accuracy improvements over BM25-based RAG and simple baselines. Its performance
is comparable to dense retrieval-based RAG and prior iterative query refinement
methods using dense models. In summary, IterKey is a novel BM25-based approach
leveraging LLMs to iteratively refine RAG, effectively balancing accuracy with
interpretability.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为RepCali的方法，通过在校准块中调整预训练语言模型（PLM）的潜在空间表示，以解决编码器与解码器输入之间的不匹配问题。该方法具有通用性、即插即用性和易实现性，实验表明其在多种任务中显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练语言模型（PLM）在微调后仍存在编码器表示与解码器输入不匹配的问题，限制了其在下游任务中的表现。

Method: 提出RepCali方法，通过在编码器后的潜在空间中集成校准块，调整表示并作为解码器输入。

Result: 在25个PLM模型和8个任务上的实验表明，RepCali显著提升了性能，优于现有微调基线。

Conclusion: RepCali是一种通用且高效的表示校准方法，能够显著提升PLM在下游任务中的表现。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained language models (PLMs) has become a dominant paradigm
in applying PLMs to downstream tasks. However, with limited fine-tuning, PLMs
still struggle with the discrepancies between the representation obtained from
the PLMs' encoder and the optimal input to the PLMs' decoder. This paper
tackles this challenge by learning to calibrate the representation of PLMs in
the latent space. In the proposed representation calibration method (RepCali),
we integrate a specific calibration block to the latent space after the encoder
and use the calibrated output as the decoder input. The merits of the proposed
RepCali include its universality to all PLMs with encoder-decoder
architectures, its plug-and-play nature, and ease of implementation. Extensive
experiments on 25 PLM-based models across 8 tasks (including both English and
Chinese datasets) demonstrate that the proposed RepCali offers desirable
enhancements to PLMs (including LLMs) and significantly improves the
performance of downstream tasks. Comparison experiments across 4 benchmark
tasks indicate that RepCali is superior to the representative fine-tuning
baselines.

Abstract: Stance detection is essential for understanding subjective content across
various platforms such as social media, news articles, and online reviews.
Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized stance
detection by introducing novel capabilities in contextual understanding,
cross-domain generalization, and multimodal analysis. Despite these
progressions, existing surveys often lack comprehensive coverage of approaches
that specifically leverage LLMs for stance detection. To bridge this critical
gap, our review article conducts a systematic analysis of stance detection,
comprehensively examining recent advancements of LLMs transforming the field,
including foundational concepts, methodologies, datasets, applications, and
emerging challenges. We present a novel taxonomy for LLM-based stance detection
approaches, structured along three key dimensions: 1) learning methods,
including supervised, unsupervised, few-shot, and zero-shot; 2) data
modalities, such as unimodal, multimodal, and hybrid; and 3) target
relationships, encompassing in-target, cross-target, and multi-target
scenarios. Furthermore, we discuss the evaluation techniques and analyze
benchmark datasets and performance trends, highlighting the strengths and
limitations of different architectures. Key applications in misinformation
detection, political analysis, public health monitoring, and social media
moderation are discussed. Finally, we identify critical challenges such as
implicit stance expression, cultural biases, and computational constraints,
while outlining promising future directions, including explainable stance
reasoning, low-resource adaptation, and real-time deployment frameworks. Our
survey highlights emerging trends, open challenges, and future directions to
guide researchers and practitioners in developing next-generation stance
detection systems powered by large language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图表理解任务评估方法成本高且耗时，限制了实际应用。利用LVLM作为评估工具可以简化流程，但面临数据集、模型访问和成本等挑战。

Method: 设计了成对和点对评估任务，涵盖事实正确性、信息量和相关性等标准，并分析了格式遵循、位置一致性、长度偏差和指令遵循等指标。

Result: 实验结果显示，部分开源LVLM评估性能接近GPT-4（约80%一致），但其他模型表现较差（低于10%一致）。

Conclusion: 开源LVLM可作为图表任务的低成本自动评估工具，但仍需解决位置偏好和长度偏差等问题。

Abstract: Charts are ubiquitous as they help people understand and reason with data.
Recently, various downstream tasks, such as chart question answering,
chart2text, and fact-checking, have emerged. Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) show promise in tackling these tasks, but their evaluation is costly
and time-consuming, limiting real-world deployment. While using LVLMs as judges
to assess the chart comprehension capabilities of other LVLMs could streamline
evaluation processes, challenges like proprietary datasets, restricted access
to powerful models, and evaluation costs hinder their adoption in industrial
settings. To this end, we present a comprehensive evaluation of 13 open-source
LVLMs as judges for diverse chart comprehension and reasoning tasks. We design
both pairwise and pointwise evaluation tasks covering criteria like factual
correctness, informativeness, and relevancy. Additionally, we analyze LVLM
judges based on format adherence, positional consistency, length bias, and
instruction-following. We focus on cost-effective LVLMs (<10B parameters)
suitable for both research and commercial use, following a standardized
evaluation protocol and rubric to measure the LVLM judge's accuracy.
Experimental results reveal notable variability: while some open LVLM judges
achieve GPT-4-level evaluation performance (about 80% agreement with GPT-4
judgments), others struggle (below ~10% agreement). Our findings highlight that
state-of-the-art open-source LVLMs can serve as cost-effective automatic
evaluators for chart-related tasks, though biases such as positional preference
and length bias persist.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本方法直接生成绝对分数，容易因模型偏差和不一致评分偏离人工评分，需要更可靠的方法。

Method: 提出LCES方法，将作文评分任务转化为成对比较，利用LLM判断两篇作文的优劣，并通过RankNet将比较结果转换为连续分数。

Result: 实验表明，LCES在准确性上优于传统零样本方法，且计算效率高，对不同LLM主干具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LCES为零样本自动作文评分提供了一种高效、准确的解决方案，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled zero-shot
automated essay scoring (AES), providing a promising way to reduce the cost and
effort of essay scoring in comparison with manual grading. However, most
existing zero-shot approaches rely on LLMs to directly generate absolute
scores, which often diverge from human evaluations owing to model biases and
inconsistent scoring. To address these limitations, we propose LLM-based
Comparative Essay Scoring (LCES), a method that formulates AES as a pairwise
comparison task. Specifically, we instruct LLMs to judge which of two essays is
better, collect many such comparisons, and convert them into continuous scores.
Considering that the number of possible comparisons grows quadratically with
the number of essays, we improve scalability by employing RankNet to
efficiently transform LLM preferences into scalar scores. Experiments using AES
benchmark datasets show that LCES outperforms conventional zero-shot methods in
accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. Moreover, LCES is robust
across different LLM backbones, highlighting its applicability to real-world
zero-shot AES.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于三元组的线性化方法，以解决Penman编码在AMR图线性化中的局限性，并比较了其效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Penman编码在深度图中可能导致相关节点在文本中距离过远，且需要逆角色处理节点重入，增加了关系类型的预测数量。

Method: 提出了一种基于三元组的线性化方法，并与Penman线性化进行了效率比较。

Result: 三元组编码在表示图结构方面表现良好，但仍需改进以更好地与Penman的简洁嵌套图表示竞争。

Conclusion: 三元组编码有潜力，但需进一步优化以超越Penman编码的表现。

Abstract: Sequence-to-sequence models are widely used to train Abstract Meaning
Representation (Banarescu et al., 2013, AMR) parsers. To train such models, AMR
graphs have to be linearized into a one-line text format. While Penman encoding
is typically used for this purpose, we argue that it has limitations: (1) for
deep graphs, some closely related nodes are located far apart in the linearized
text (2) Penman's tree-based encoding necessitates inverse roles to handle node
re-entrancy, doubling the number of relation types to predict. To address these
issues, we propose a triple-based linearization method and compare its
efficiency with Penman linearization. Although triples are well suited to
represent a graph, our results suggest room for improvement in triple encoding
to better compete with Penman's concise and explicit representation of a nested
graph structure.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的评估指标MPA，用于衡量NMT系统对性别线索的依赖程度，发现现有模型更倾向于忽略性别线索而依赖统计性别刻板印象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估指标未能充分捕捉NMT系统对上下文性别线索的整合程度，因此需要一种更精确的评估方法。

Method: 提出Minimal Pair Accuracy (MPA)指标，通过最小对句子（仅性别代词不同）评估模型对性别线索的依赖。

Result: 现有NMT模型大多忽略性别线索，依赖刻板印象；在反刻板情况下，模型更倾向于考虑男性线索而忽略女性线索。

Conclusion: 性别信息在模型中编码存在差异，男性线索引发更分散的响应，女性线索则更集中和专门化。

Abstract: While gender bias in modern Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems has
received much attention, traditional evaluation metrics do not to fully capture
the extent to which these systems integrate contextual gender cues. We propose
a novel evaluation metric called Minimal Pair Accuracy (MPA), which measures
the reliance of models on gender cues for gender disambiguation. MPA is
designed to go beyond surface-level gender accuracy metrics by focusing on
whether models adapt to gender cues in minimal pairs -- sentence pairs that
differ solely in the gendered pronoun, namely the explicit indicator of the
target's entity gender in the source language (EN). We evaluate a number of NMT
models on the English-Italian (EN--IT) language pair using this metric, we show
that they ignore available gender cues in most cases in favor of (statistical)
stereotypical gender interpretation. We further show that in anti-stereotypical
cases, these models tend to more consistently take masculine gender cues into
account while ignoring the feminine cues. Furthermore, we analyze the attention
head weights in the encoder component and show that while all models encode
gender information to some extent, masculine cues elicit a more diffused
response compared to the more concentrated and specialized responses to
feminine gender cues.

TL;DR: 论文指出，尽管GPT等大型语言模型（LLMs）在AI教育领域（AIED）中占据主导地位，但小型语言模型（SLMs）如Phi-2在资源受限的教育机构中具有潜力，能提供高质量且经济的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AIED领域过度关注资源密集型LLMs（如GPT），可能忽视了SLMs在提供公平且经济的高质量AI工具方面的潜力。

Method: 通过知识组件（KC）发现的实验，验证了SLMs（如Phi-2）在不依赖复杂提示策略下的有效性。

Result: SLMs在解决AIED关键挑战（如KC发现）上表现优异，证明了其潜力。

Conclusion: 呼吁更多关注SLM-based的AIED方法，以促进资源受限机构的公平访问。

Abstract: GPT has become nearly synonymous with large language models (LLMs), an
increasingly popular term in AIED proceedings. A simple keyword-based search
reveals that 61% of the 76 long and short papers presented at AIED 2024
describe novel solutions using LLMs to address some of the long-standing
challenges in education, and 43% specifically mention GPT. Although LLMs
pioneered by GPT create exciting opportunities to strengthen the impact of AI
on education, we argue that the field's predominant focus on GPT and other
resource-intensive LLMs (with more than 10B parameters) risks neglecting the
potential impact that small language models (SLMs) can make in providing
resource-constrained institutions with equitable and affordable access to
high-quality AI tools. Supported by positive results on knowledge component
(KC) discovery, a critical challenge in AIED, we demonstrate that SLMs such as
Phi-2 can produce an effective solution without elaborate prompting strategies.
Hence, we call for more attention to developing SLM-based AIED approaches.

Abstract: Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming pathology by
integrat-ing large language models (LLMs) with retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) and domain-specific foundation models. This study explores the
application of RAG-enhanced LLMs coupled with pathology foundation models for
thyroid cytology diagnosis, addressing challenges in cytological
interpretation, standardization, and diagnostic accuracy. By leveraging a
curated knowledge base, RAG facilitates dy-namic retrieval of relevant case
studies, diagnostic criteria, and expert interpreta-tion, improving the
contextual understanding of LLMs. Meanwhile, pathology foun-dation models,
trained on high-resolution pathology images, refine feature extrac-tion and
classification capabilities. The fusion of these AI-driven approaches en-hances
diagnostic consistency, reduces variability, and supports pathologists in
dis-tinguishing benign from malignant thyroid lesions. Our results demonstrate

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了下游任务中推测解码的效率问题，显著提升了准确率和速度。

Abstract: Speculative decoding, which combines a draft model with a target model, has
emerged as an effective approach to accelerate large language model (LLM)
inference. However, existing methods often face a trade-off between the
acceptance rate and decoding speed in downstream tasks due to the limited
capacity of the draft model, making it difficult to ensure efficiency across
diverse tasks. To address this problem, we propose a speculative decoding
algorithm tailored for downstream task optimization. It includes an automatic
task partitioning and assigning method, which automatically categorizes
downstream tasks into different sub-tasks and assigns them to a set of
heterogeneous draft models. Each draft model is aligned with the target model
using task-specific data, thereby enhancing the consistency of inference
results. In addition, our proposed method incorporates an online lightweight
prompt classifier to dynamically route prompts to the appropriate draft model.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves draft
accuracy by 6% to 50% over vanilla speculative decoding, while achieving a
speedup of 1.10x to 2.64x in LLM inference.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs隐藏状态是否包含比直接输出更丰富的经济信息。

Method: 使用简单线性模型训练开源LLMs的隐藏状态，并分析学习曲线和迁移学习方法。

Result: 隐藏状态能更准确地估算经济数据，且仅需少量标注样本。迁移学习方法无需目标变量标注数据即可提升准确性。

Conclusion: 隐藏状态在经济数据超分辨率和填补任务中具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: We investigate whether the hidden states of large language models (LLMs) can
be used to estimate and impute economic and financial statistics. Focusing on
county-level (e.g. unemployment) and firm-level (e.g. total assets) variables,
we show that a simple linear model trained on the hidden states of open-source
LLMs outperforms the models' text outputs. This suggests that hidden states
capture richer economic information than the responses of the LLMs reveal
directly. A learning curve analysis indicates that only a few dozen labelled
examples are sufficient for training. We also propose a transfer learning
method that improves estimation accuracy without requiring any labelled data
for the target variable. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of
hidden-state representations in super-resolution and data imputation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有事件抽取系统存在模式固定和缺乏联合评估基准的问题，且大语言模型在实际部署中存在模式幻觉和上下文窗口限制的挑战。

Method: 提出ASEE方法，结合模式改写和检索增强生成技术，构建了多维度模式感知事件抽取基准（MD-SEE）。

Result: ASEE在MD-SEE基准上表现出强大的适应性，显著提高了事件抽取的准确性。

Conclusion: ASEE为解决事件抽取中的模式适应性和评估问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Event extraction (EE) is a fundamental task in natural language processing
(NLP) that involves identifying and extracting event information from
unstructured text. Effective EE in real-world scenarios requires two key steps:
selecting appropriate schemas from hundreds of candidates and executing the
extraction process. Existing research exhibits two critical gaps: (1) the rigid
schema fixation in existing pipeline systems, and (2) the absence of benchmarks
for evaluating joint schema matching and extraction. Although large language
models (LLMs) offer potential solutions, their schema hallucination tendencies
and context window limitations pose challenges for practical deployment. In
response, we propose Adaptive Schema-aware Event Extraction (ASEE), a novel
paradigm combining schema paraphrasing with schema retrieval-augmented
generation. ASEE adeptly retrieves paraphrased schemas and accurately generates
targeted structures. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we construct the
Multi-Dimensional Schema-aware Event Extraction (MD-SEE) benchmark, which
systematically consolidates 12 datasets across diverse domains, complexity
levels, and language settings. Extensive evaluations on MD-SEE show that our
proposed ASEE demonstrates strong adaptability across various scenarios,
significantly improving the accuracy of event extraction.

Abstract: This work introduces the first benchmark for nursing value alignment,
consisting of five core value dimensions distilled from international nursing
codes: Altruism, Human Dignity, Integrity, Justice, and Professionalism. The
benchmark comprises 1,100 real-world nursing behavior instances collected
through a five-month longitudinal field study across three hospitals of varying
tiers. These instances are annotated by five clinical nurses and then augmented
with LLM-generated counterfactuals with reversed ethic polarity. Each original
case is paired with a value-aligned and a value-violating version, resulting in
2,200 labeled instances that constitute the Easy-Level dataset. To increase
adversarial complexity, each instance is further transformed into a
dialogue-based format that embeds contextual cues and subtle misleading
signals, yielding a Hard-Level dataset. We evaluate 23 state-of-the-art (SoTA)
LLMs on their alignment with nursing values. Our findings reveal three key
insights: (1) DeepSeek-V3 achieves the highest performance on the Easy-Level
dataset (94.55), where Claude 3.5 Sonnet outperforms other models on the
Hard-Level dataset (89.43), significantly surpassing the medical LLMs; (2)
Justice is consistently the most difficult nursing value dimension to evaluate;
and (3) in-context learning significantly improves alignment. This work aims to
provide a foundation for value-sensitive LLMs development in clinical settings.

Result: 理论表明序列困惑度在不同分词顺序下不变，但实证发现实际训练中存在系统性偏差，尤其是随机排列顺序。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM的位置偏差，并提出了检测不一致概率分布的方法。

Abstract: Can autoregressive large language models (LLMs) learn consistent probability
distributions when trained on sequences in different token orders? We prove
formally that for any well-defined probability distribution, sequence
perplexity is invariant under any factorization, including forward, backward,
or arbitrary permutations. This result establishes a rigorous theoretical
foundation for studying how LLMs learn from data and defines principled
protocols for empirical evaluation. Applying these protocols, we show that
prior studies examining ordering effects suffer from critical methodological
flaws. We retrain GPT-2 models across forward, backward, and arbitrary permuted
orders on scientific text. We find systematic deviations from theoretical
invariance across all orderings with arbitrary permutations strongly deviating
from both forward and backward models, which largely (but not completely)
agreed with one another. Deviations were traceable to differences in
self-attention, reflecting positional and locality biases in processing. Our
theoretical and empirical results provide novel avenues for understanding
positional biases in LLMs and suggest methods for detecting when LLMs'
probability distributions are inconsistent and therefore untrustworthy.

Result: AC-Reason显著提升LLM性能，在BBH-CJ和AC-Bench上均优于基线。

Conclusion: 将形式因果理论融入LLM有效，AC-Reason算法贡献最大性能提升。

Abstract: Actual causality (AC), a fundamental aspect of causal reasoning (CR), is
responsible for attribution and responsibility assignment in real-world
scenarios. However, existing LLM-based methods lack grounding in formal AC
theory, resulting in limited interpretability. Therefore, we propose AC-Reason,
a semi-formal reasoning framework that identifies causally relevant events
within an AC scenario, infers the values of their formal causal factors (e.g.,
sufficiency, necessity, and normality), and answers AC queries via a
theory-guided algorithm with explanations. While AC-Reason does not explicitly
construct a causal graph, it operates over variables in the underlying causal
structure to support principled reasoning. To enable comprehensive evaluation,
we introduce AC-Bench, a new benchmark built upon and substantially extending
Big-Bench Hard Causal Judgment (BBH-CJ). AC-Bench comprises ~1K carefully
annotated samples, each with detailed reasoning steps and focuses solely on
actual causation. The case study shows that synthesized samples in AC-Bench
present greater challenges for LLMs. Extensive experiments on BBH-CJ and
AC-Bench show that AC-Reason consistently improves LLM performance over
baselines. On BBH-CJ, all tested LLMs surpass the average human rater accuracy
of 69.60%, with GPT-4 + AC-Reason achieving 75.04%. On AC-Bench, GPT-4 +
AC-Reason again achieves the highest accuracy of 71.82%. AC-Bench further
enables fine-grained analysis of reasoning faithfulness, revealing that only
Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and GPT-4o exhibit faithful
reasoning, whereas GPT-4 tends to exploit shortcuts. Finally, our ablation
study proves that integrating AC theory into LLMs is highly effective, with the
proposed algorithm contributing the most significant performance gains.

Conclusion: 该研究在多语言多模态领域取得了进展，展示了高效计算与高性能的结合方法。

Abstract: Building multimodal language models is fundamentally challenging: it requires
aligning vision and language modalities, curating high-quality instruction
data, and avoiding the degradation of existing text-only capabilities once
vision is introduced. These difficulties are further magnified in the
multilingual setting, where the need for multimodal data in different languages
exacerbates existing data scarcity, machine translation often distorts meaning,
and catastrophic forgetting is more pronounced. To address the aforementioned
challenges, we introduce novel techniques spanning both data and modeling.
First, we develop a synthetic annotation framework that curates high-quality,
diverse multilingual multimodal instruction data, enabling Aya Vision models to
produce natural, human-preferred responses to multimodal inputs across many
languages. Complementing this, we propose a cross-modal model merging technique
that mitigates catastrophic forgetting, effectively preserving text-only
capabilities while simultaneously enhancing multimodal generative performance.
Aya-Vision-8B achieves best-in-class performance compared to strong multimodal
models such as Qwen-2.5-VL-7B, Pixtral-12B, and even much larger
Llama-3.2-90B-Vision. We further scale this approach with Aya-Vision-32B, which
outperforms models more than twice its size, such as Molmo-72B and
LLaMA-3.2-90B-Vision. Our work advances multilingual progress on the
multi-modal frontier, and provides insights into techniques that effectively
bend the need for compute while delivering extremely high performance.

dimensions (e.g., accuracy, instruction following, communication). HealthBench
performance over the last two years reflects steady initial progress (compare
GPT-3.5 Turbo's 16% to GPT-4o's 32%) and more rapid recent improvements (o3
scores 60%). Smaller models have especially improved: GPT-4.1 nano outperforms
GPT-4o and is 25 times cheaper. We additionally release two HealthBench

Abstract: The polysemantic nature of synthetic neurons in artificial intelligence
language models is currently understood as the result of a necessary
superposition of distributed features within the latent space. We propose an
alternative approach, geometrically defining a neuron in layer n as a
categorical vector space with a non-orthogonal basis, composed of categorical
sub-dimensions extracted from preceding neurons in layer n-1. This categorical
vector space is structured by the activation space of each neuron and enables,
via an intra-neuronal attention process, the identification and utilization of
a critical categorical zone for the efficiency of the language model - more
homogeneous and located at the intersection of these different categorical
sub-dimensions.

Abstract: As LLMs (large language models) are increasingly used to generate synthetic
personas particularly in data-limited domains such as health, privacy, and HCI,
it becomes necessary to understand how these narratives represent identity,
especially that of minority communities. In this paper, we audit synthetic
personas generated by 3 LLMs (GPT4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Deepseek 2.5) through the
lens of representational harm, focusing specifically on racial identity. Using
a mixed methods approach combining close reading, lexical analysis, and a
parameterized creativity framework, we compare 1512 LLM generated personas to
human-authored responses. Our findings reveal that LLMs disproportionately
foreground racial markers, overproduce culturally coded language, and construct
personas that are syntactically elaborate yet narratively reductive. These
patterns result in a range of sociotechnical harms, including stereotyping,
exoticism, erasure, and benevolent bias, that are often obfuscated by
superficially positive narrations. We formalize this phenomenon as algorithmic
othering, where minoritized identities are rendered hypervisible but less
authentic. Based on these findings, we offer design recommendations for
narrative-aware evaluation metrics and community-centered validation protocols
for synthetic identity generation.

Conclusion: 模块化方法优于双LLM基线，在实时欺诈检测中具有实用优势。

Abstract: Detecting fake interactions in digital communication platforms remains a
challenging and insufficiently addressed problem. These interactions may appear
as harmless spam or escalate into sophisticated scam attempts, making it
difficult to flag malicious intent early. Traditional detection methods often
rely on static anomaly detection techniques that fail to adapt to dynamic
conversational shifts. One key limitation is the misinterpretation of benign
topic transitions referred to as concept drift as fraudulent behavior, leading
to either false alarms or missed threats. We propose a two stage detection
framework that first identifies suspicious conversations using a tailored
ensemble classification model. To improve the reliability of detection, we
incorporate a concept drift analysis step using a One Class Drift Detector
(OCDD) to isolate conversational shifts within flagged dialogues. When drift is
detected, a large language model (LLM) assesses whether the shift indicates
fraudulent manipulation or a legitimate topic change. In cases where no drift
is found, the behavior is inferred to be spam like. We validate our framework
using a dataset of social engineering chat scenarios and demonstrate its
practical advantages in improving both accuracy and interpretability for real
time fraud detection. To contextualize the trade offs, we compare our modular
approach against a Dual LLM baseline that performs detection and judgment using
different language models.

Abstract: Road crashes claim over 1.3 million lives annually worldwide and incur global
economic losses exceeding \$1.8 trillion. Such profound societal and financial
impacts underscore the urgent need for road safety research that uncovers crash
mechanisms and delivers actionable insights. Conventional statistical models
and tree ensemble approaches typically rely on structured crash data,
overlooking contextual nuances and struggling to capture complex relationships
and underlying semantics. Moreover, these approaches tend to incur significant
information loss, particularly in narrative elements related to multi-vehicle
interactions, crash progression, and rare event characteristics. This study
presents CrashSage, a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-centered framework
designed to advance crash analysis and modeling through four key innovations.
First, we introduce a tabular-to-text transformation strategy paired with
relational data integration schema, enabling the conversion of raw,
heterogeneous crash data into enriched, structured textual narratives that
retain essential structural and relational context. Second, we apply
context-aware data augmentation using a base LLM model to improve narrative
coherence while preserving factual integrity. Third, we fine-tune the LLaMA3-8B
model for crash severity inference, demonstrating superior performance over
baseline approaches, including zero-shot, zero-shot with chain-of-thought
prompting, and few-shot learning, with multiple models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini,
LLaMA3-70B). Finally, we employ a gradient-based explainability technique to
elucidate model decisions at both the individual crash level and across broader
risk factor dimensions. This interpretability mechanism enhances transparency
and enables targeted road safety interventions by providing deeper insights
into the most influential factors.

Conclusion: 屈折语言中的对抗性攻击表现与非屈折语言不同，新协议和基准为理解模型在攻击下的行为提供了新视角。

Abstract: Various techniques are used in the generation of adversarial examples,
including methods such as TextBugger which introduce minor, hardly visible
perturbations to words leading to changes in model behaviour. Another class of
techniques involves substituting words with their synonyms in a way that
preserves the text's meaning but alters its predicted class, with TextFooler
being a prominent example of such attacks. Most adversarial example generation
methods are developed and evaluated primarily on non-inflectional languages,
typically English. In this work, we evaluate and explain how adversarial
attacks perform in inflectional languages. To explain the impact of inflection
on model behaviour and its robustness under attack, we designed a novel
protocol inspired by mechanistic interpretability, based on Edge Attribution
Patching (EAP) method. The proposed evaluation protocol relies on parallel
task-specific corpora that include both inflected and syncretic variants of
texts in two languages -- Polish and English. To analyse the models and explain
the relationship between inflection and adversarial robustness, we create a new
benchmark based on task-oriented dataset MultiEmo, enabling the identification
of mechanistic inflection-related elements of circuits within the model and
analyse their behaviour under attack.

Abstract: Multifarious intent detection predictors are developed for different
languages, including English, Chinese and French, however, the field remains
underdeveloped for Urdu, the 10th most spoken language. In the realm of
well-known languages, intent detection predictors utilize the strategy of
few-shot learning and prediction of unseen classes based on the model training
on seen classes. However, Urdu language lacks few-shot strategy based intent
detection predictors and traditional predictors are focused on prediction of
the same classes which models have seen in the train set. To empower Urdu
language specific intent detection, this introduces a unique contrastive
learning approach that leverages unlabeled Urdu data to re-train pre-trained
language models. This re-training empowers LLMs representation learning for the
downstream intent detection task. Finally, it reaps the combined potential of
pre-trained LLMs and the prototype-informed attention mechanism to create a
comprehensive end-to-end LLMPIA intent detection pipeline. Under the paradigm
of proposed predictive pipeline, it explores the potential of 6 distinct
language models and 13 distinct similarity computation methods. The proposed
framework is evaluated on 2 public benchmark datasets, namely ATIS encompassing
5836 samples and Web Queries having 8519 samples. Across ATIS dataset under
4-way 1 shot and 4-way 5 shot experimental settings LLMPIA achieved 83.28% and
98.25% F1-Score and on Web Queries dataset produced 76.23% and 84.42% F1-Score,
respectively. In an additional case study on the Web Queries dataset under same
classes train and test set settings, LLMPIA outperformed state-of-the-art
predictor by 53.55% F1-Score.

TL;DR: 本文研究了通过密集LLM架构的推测解码技术，发现了控制解码效率的对数线性缩放定律，并提出了Scylla系统，显著提升了推理任务的解码速度和接受率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在推理密集型任务中需要高效的解码技术，但现有方法的解码效率缩放规律尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过密集LLM架构研究推测解码技术，发现对数线性缩放定律（定理1.1-1.3），并开发了Scylla系统。

Result: Scylla在解码接受率和速度上显著优于现有方法（如EAGLE2/3），并在工业部署中实现了2倍的解码吞吐量提升。

Conclusion: 系统性缩放对高效LLM推理具有变革性潜力，Scylla为推理任务提供了显著的性能改进。

Abstract: The escalating demand for efficient decoding in large language models (LLMs)
is particularly critical for reasoning-intensive architectures like OpenAI-o3
and DeepSeek-R1, which depend on extended chain-of-thought reasoning. This
study investigates speculative decoding techniques through dense LLM
architectures to establish foundational insights for accelerating reasoning
tasks. While speculative decoding methods leveraging parallel
draft-verification cycles have emerged as promising acceleration techniques,
the scaling laws governing decoding efficiency remain under-explored compared
to conventional backbone LLMs developed through Pretraining->SFT->RLHF training
paradigms. In this work, we discover Log-linear Scaling Laws (Theorem 1.1, 1.2
and 1.3) governing draft model acceptance rate (or decoding speed) across three
dimensions: pretraining token volume, draft model capacity, and decoding batch
size. Building on these laws, we achieve Scylla, which coordinates
multi-dimensional scaling for popular LLMs (Llama2/3, Qwen2.5). Empirical
validation shows Scylla achieves 1.5-2.2 higher acceptance rate than EAGLE2 and
0.3 higher than EAGLE3 at temperature T = 0, with peak performance gains on
summarization and QA tasks (Figure 2). Industrial inference engine deployments
demonstrate 2X decoding throughput improvements over EAGLE2 (Table 5),
validating the transformative potential of systematic scaling for efficient LLM
inference. Code will be released later.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLMs）在抽象推理任务（ARC-AGI）中的局限性。

Method: 在训练、生成和评分阶段采用任务特定的数据增强，结合深度优先搜索算法生成多样化的候选解决方案，并利用LLM的输出概率选择最优解。

Result: 在公开的ARC-AGI评估集上达到71.6%的得分（286.5/400任务），推理成本极低（约2ct/任务）。

Conclusion: 该方法在透明性、可重复性和低成本方面表现突出，尽管闭源方法得分更高。

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC-AGI) poses a significant challenge
for large language models (LLMs), exposing limitations in their abstract
reasoning abilities. In this work, we leverage task-specific data augmentations
throughout the training, generation, and scoring phases, and employ a
depth-first search algorithm to generate diverse, high-probability candidate
solutions. Furthermore, we utilize the LLM not only as a generator but also as
a scorer, using its output probabilities to select the most promising
solutions. Our method achieves a score of 71.6% (286.5/400 solved tasks) on the
public ARC-AGI evaluation set, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance among
publicly available approaches. While concurrent closed-source work has reported
higher scores, our method distinguishes itself through its transparency,
reproducibility, and remarkably low inference cost, averaging only around 2ct
per task on readily available hardware (we assume a price of 36ct/hour for a
Nvidia 4090 GPU).

TL;DR: Caprese是一种低成本蒸馏方法，用于恢复因高效推理方法部署而丢失的数学能力，同时不影响语言任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在数学推理中需要大量计算资源，现有高效推理方法在语言任务中表现良好，但会严重降低数学性能。

Method: Caprese通过仅添加约1%的参数和20K合成训练样本，在不扰动原始权重的情况下恢复数学能力。

Result: Caprese显著减少了活跃参数数量（如Gemma 2 9B和Llama 3.1 8B减少约2B），并降低了延迟（Qwen 2.5 14B生成2048个令牌的延迟减少11%以上）。

Conclusion: Caprese是一种高效且低成本的方法，能够恢复数学能力并优化推理效率。

Abstract: Due to long generations, large language model (LLM) math reasoning demands
significant computational resources and time. While many existing efficient
inference methods have been developed with excellent performance preservation
on language tasks, they often severely degrade math performance. In this paper,
we propose Caprese, a low-cost distillation method to recover lost capabilities
from deploying efficient inference methods, focused primarily in feedforward
blocks. With original weights unperturbed, roughly 1% of additional parameters,
and only 20K synthetic training samples, we are able to recover much if not all
of the math capabilities lost from efficient inference for thinking LLMs and
without harm to language tasks for instruct LLMs. Moreover, Caprese slashes the
number of active parameters (~2B cut for Gemma 2 9B and Llama 3.1 8B) and
integrates cleanly into existing model layers to reduce latency (>11% reduction
to generate 2048 tokens with Qwen 2.5 14B) while encouraging response brevity.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Graph Wavelet Transformer（GWT）的新架构，用于替代传统序列模型中计算和内存复杂度较高的点积自注意力机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的序列到序列模型在处理结构化语言任务时，依赖点积自注意力机制，导致计算和内存复杂度为输入长度的平方。

Method: GWT通过可学习的多尺度小波变换替代点积自注意力，该变换基于显式图拉普拉斯矩阵，源自语法或语义解析。

Result: 分析表明，多尺度谱分解为图结构序列建模提供了一种可解释、高效且表达能力强的替代方案。

Conclusion: GWT是一种高效的替代方案，适用于图结构序列建模。

Abstract: Existing sequence to sequence models for structured language tasks rely
heavily on the dot product self attention mechanism, which incurs quadratic
complexity in both computation and memory for input length N. We introduce the
Graph Wavelet Transformer (GWT), a novel architecture that replaces this
bottleneck with a learnable, multi scale wavelet transform defined over an
explicit graph Laplacian derived from syntactic or semantic parses. Our
analysis shows that multi scale spectral decomposition offers an interpretable,
efficient, and expressive alternative to quadratic self attention for graph
structured sequence modeling.

TL;DR: QoSBERT是一个基于预训练语言模型的QoS预测框架，通过语义回归任务和不确定性估计模块，显著提升了预测精度和可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统QoS模型依赖手工特征工程且仅提供点估计，缺乏预测置信度信息，限制了其在实际应用中的可靠性。

Method: QoSBERT将用户服务元数据编码为自然语言描述，结合蒙特卡洛Dropout进行不确定性估计，并采用注意力池化和轻量级回归器进行联合优化。

Result: 在标准数据集上，QoSBERT在响应时间和吞吐量预测上分别降低了11.7%和6.9%的MAE，同时提供了校准的置信区间。

Conclusion: QoSBERT不仅提升了预测精度，还提供了可靠的不确定性量化，为更可信的服务选择与优化奠定了基础。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of Quality of Service (QoS) metrics is fundamental for
selecting and managing cloud based services. Traditional QoS models rely on
manual feature engineering and yield only point estimates, offering no insight
into the confidence of their predictions. In this paper, we propose QoSBERT,
the first framework that reformulates QoS prediction as a semantic regression
task based on pre trained language models. Unlike previous approaches relying
on sparse numerical features, QoSBERT automatically encodes user service
metadata into natural language descriptions, enabling deep semantic
understanding. Furthermore, we integrate a Monte Carlo Dropout based
uncertainty estimation module, allowing for trustworthy and risk-aware service
quality prediction, which is crucial yet underexplored in existing QoS models.
QoSBERT applies attentive pooling over contextualized embeddings and a
lightweight multilayer perceptron regressor, fine tuned jointly to minimize
absolute error. We further exploit the resulting uncertainty estimates to
select high quality training samples, improving robustness in low resource
settings. On standard QoS benchmark datasets, QoSBERT achieves an average
reduction of 11.7% in MAE and 6.7% in RMSE for response time prediction, and
6.9% in MAE for throughput prediction compared to the strongest baselines,
while providing well calibrated confidence intervals for robust and trustworthy
service quality estimation. Our approach not only advances the accuracy of
service quality prediction but also delivers reliable uncertainty
quantification, paving the way for more trustworthy, data driven service
selection and optimization.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于句子多样性的蜕变关系（MRs）优先级排序方法，用于高效检测大语言模型（LLMs）中的公平性问题。实验表明，该方法在故障检测率和时间效率上优于随机和距离基准方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）的广泛应用，其输出中的公平性和偏见问题日益突出。由于测试用例数量庞大，全面测试不现实，因此需要一种高效的蜕变关系优先级排序方法。

Method: 采用基于句子多样性的方法计算和排序蜕变关系（MRs），以优化故障检测。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法比随机优先级排序和距离基准方法分别提高了22%和12%的故障检测率，同时将首次故障发现时间缩短了15%和8%。

Conclusion: 多样性为基础的MR优先级排序方法在提升LLMs公平性测试方面有效且高效，同时显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in various
applications, raising critical concerns about fairness and potential biases in
their outputs. This paper explores the prioritization of metamorphic relations
(MRs) in metamorphic testing as a strategy to efficiently detect fairness
issues within LLMs. Given the exponential growth of possible test cases,
exhaustive testing is impractical; therefore, prioritizing MRs based on their
effectiveness in detecting fairness violations is crucial. We apply a sentence
diversity-based approach to compute and rank MRs to optimize fault detection.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed prioritization approach
improves fault detection rates by 22% compared to random prioritization and 12%
compared to distance-based prioritization, while reducing the time to the first
failure by 15% and 8%, respectively. Furthermore, our approach performs within
5% of fault-based prioritization in effectiveness, while significantly reducing
the computational cost associated with fault labeling. These results validate
the effectiveness of diversity-based MR prioritization in enhancing fairness
testing for LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为AIAP的新提示方法，通过整合人类标注者的任务指令，改善金融情感分析（FSA）中LLM的性能，并在新数据集WSBS上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融情感分析（FSA）中LLM的表现受限于现有基准数据集的主观性和标注不一致性，导致模型性能评估不公平。

Method: 提出Annotators' Instruction Assisted Prompt（AIAP），将人类标注者的详细任务指令融入LLM提示框架，标准化情感理解。

Result: 实验显示AIAP显著提升LLM性能（最高提升9.08），并引入基于模型置信度的情感索引方法，增强股票价格预测。

Conclusion: AIAP通过改进任务定义和评估方法，提升了FSA的准确性和实用性，同时凸显了WSB作为金融文本来源的价值。

Abstract: Financial sentiment analysis (FSA) presents unique challenges to LLMs that
surpass those in typical sentiment analysis due to the nuanced language used in
financial contexts. The prowess of these models is often undermined by the
inherent subjectivity of sentiment classifications in existing benchmark
datasets like Financial Phrasebank. These datasets typically feature undefined
sentiment classes that reflect the highly individualized perspectives of
annotators, leading to significant variability in annotations. This variability
results in an unfair expectation for LLMs during benchmarking, where they are
tasked to conjecture the subjective viewpoints of human annotators without
sufficient context. In this paper, we introduce the Annotators' Instruction
Assisted Prompt, a novel evaluation prompt designed to redefine the task
definition of FSA for LLMs. By integrating detailed task instructions
originally intended for human annotators into the LLMs' prompt framework, AIAP
aims to standardize the understanding of sentiment across both human and
machine interpretations, providing a fair and context-rich foundation for
sentiment analysis. We utilize a new dataset, WSBS, derived from the
WallStreetBets subreddit to demonstrate how AIAP significantly enhances LLM
performance by aligning machine operations with the refined task definitions.
Experimental results demonstrate that AIAP enhances LLM performance
significantly, with improvements up to 9.08. This context-aware approach not
only yields incremental gains in performance but also introduces an innovative
sentiment-indexing method utilizing model confidence scores. This method
enhances stock price prediction models and extracts more value from the
financial sentiment analysis, underscoring the significance of WSB as a
critical source of financial text. Our research offers insights into both
improving FSA through better evaluation methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索民粹主义在政治演讲中的语言表现，特别是其情感和风格特征，以揭示民粹主义修辞的共性和差异。

Method: 整合LIWC特征和RoBERTa模型，分析美国总统就职演讲和国情咨文中的语言标记，聚焦四种民粹主义维度。

Result: 民粹主义修辞具有直接、自信的语言风格，右翼民粹主义和人民中心主义更情感化，而左翼和反精英主义则相对克制。

Conclusion: 民粹主义语言风格是战略性的，不同维度在情感表达上有显著差异，右翼和人民中心主义更倾向于情感化表达。

Abstract: This study explores the sound of populism by integrating the classic
Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) features, which capture the emotional
and stylistic tones of language, with a fine-tuned RoBERTa model, a
state-of-the-art context-aware language model trained to detect nuanced
expressions of populism. This approach allows us to uncover the auditory
dimensions of political rhetoric in U.S. presidential inaugural and State of
the Union addresses. We examine how four key populist dimensions (i.e.,
left-wing, right-wing, anti-elitism, and people-centrism) manifest in the
linguistic markers of speech, drawing attention to both commonalities and
distinct tonal shifts across these variants. Our findings reveal that populist
rhetoric consistently features a direct, assertive ``sound" that forges a
connection with ``the people'' and constructs a charismatic leadership persona.
However, this sound is not simply informal but strategically calibrated.
Notably, right-wing populism and people-centrism exhibit a more emotionally
charged discourse, resonating with themes of identity, grievance, and crisis,
in contrast to the relatively restrained emotional tones of left-wing and
anti-elitist expressions.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何从LLM的嵌入中恢复符合概率论公理的连贯事件概率，通过变分自编码器（VAE）在潜在空间中强制概率论约束，实验表明该方法比直接使用LLM生成的概率更准确。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成的事件概率存在不连贯性，违反概率论公理，因此需要探索是否能从嵌入中恢复连贯的概率。

Method: 使用扩展的VAE在潜在空间中强制概率论公理约束（如加法规则），使事件概率自然生成。

Result: 实验表明，从嵌入中恢复的概率比LLM直接生成的更连贯，且更接近真实概率。

Conclusion: 通过VAE在潜在空间中强制概率约束，可以有效恢复连贯的事件概率，提升不确定性事件中的概率估计准确性。

Abstract: Rational decision-making under uncertainty requires coherent degrees of
belief in events. However, event probabilities generated by Large Language
Models (LLMs) have been shown to exhibit incoherence, violating the axioms of
probability theory. This raises the question of whether coherent event
probabilities can be recovered from the embeddings used by the models. If so,
those derived probabilities could be used as more accurate estimates in events
involving uncertainty. To explore this question, we propose enforcing axiomatic
constraints, such as the additive rule of probability theory, in the latent
space learned by an extended variational autoencoder (VAE) applied to LLM
embeddings. This approach enables event probabilities to naturally emerge in
the latent space as the VAE learns to both reconstruct the original embeddings
and predict the embeddings of semantically related events. We evaluate our
method on complementary events (i.e., event A and its complement, event not-A),
where the true probabilities of the two events must sum to 1. Experiment
results on open-weight language models demonstrate that probabilities recovered
from embeddings exhibit greater coherence than those directly reported by the
corresponding models and align closely with the true probabilities.

Motivation: 现有NER系统主要针对英语和欧洲语言，非洲语言资源匮乏，缺乏专门的NER工具。本研究旨在为尼日利亚的三种主要语言开发高效的NER系统。

Method: 研究首先为每种语言构建标注数据集，并采用CRF、BiLSTM、BERT和RNN等机器学习与深度学习模型进行训练。系统还利用OCR技术处理图像文本输入。

Result: 系统在三种语言上的评估结果显示，精度为0.9511，召回率为0.9400，F1分数为0.9564，准确率为0.9301。

Conclusion: 研究表明，利用现有NLP框架和迁移学习，可以为低资源非洲语言构建高效的NER工具。

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition NER is very crucial for various natural language
processing applications, including information extraction, machine translation,
and sentiment analysis. Despite the ever-increasing interest in African
languages within computational linguistics, existing NER systems focus mainly
on English, European, and a few other global languages, leaving a significant
gap for under-resourced languages. This research presents the development of a
WAZOBIA-NER system tailored for the three most prominent Nigerian languages:
Hausa, Yoruba, and Igbo. This research begins with a comprehensive compilation
of annotated datasets for each language, addressing data scarcity and
linguistic diversity challenges. Exploring the state-of-the-art machine
learning technique, Conditional Random Fields (CRF) and deep learning models
such as Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), Bidirectional Encoder
Representation from Transformers (Bert) and fine-tune with a Recurrent Neural
Network (RNN), the study evaluates the effectiveness of these approaches in
recognizing three entities: persons, organizations, and locations. The system
utilizes optical character recognition (OCR) technology to convert textual
images into machine-readable text, thereby enabling the Wazobia system to
accept both input text and textual images for extraction purposes. The system
achieved a performance of 0.9511 in precision, 0.9400 in recall, 0.9564 in
F1-score, and 0.9301 in accuracy. The model's evaluation was conducted across
three languages, with precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy as key
assessment metrics. The Wazobia-NER system demonstrates that it is feasible to
build robust NER tools for under-resourced African languages using current NLP
frameworks and transfer learning.

TL;DR: PLHF是一个基于人类反馈的少样本提示优化框架，旨在解决难以定义输出质量指标时的提示优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以处理输出质量无法通过标准样本评估的任务，因此需要一种无需明确指标的优化方法。

Method: PLHF采用类似RLHF的技术，通过一个评估模块估计输出质量，仅需一轮人类反馈即可完成优化。

Result: 实验表明，PLHF在公共和工业数据集上优于先前的输出评分策略。

Conclusion: PLHF为提示优化提供了一种高效且无需复杂指标的方法。

Abstract: Automatic prompt optimization frameworks are developed to obtain suitable
prompts for large language models (LLMs) with respect to desired output quality
metrics. Although existing approaches can handle conventional tasks such as
fixed-solution question answering, defining the metric becomes complicated when
the output quality cannot be easily assessed by comparisons with standard
golden samples. Consequently, optimizing the prompts effectively and
efficiently without a clear metric becomes a critical challenge. To address the
issue, we present PLHF (which stands for "P"rompt "L"earning with "H"uman
"F"eedback), a few-shot prompt optimization framework inspired by the
well-known RLHF technique. Different from naive strategies, PLHF employs a
specific evaluator module acting as the metric to estimate the output quality.
PLHF requires only a single round of human feedback to complete the entire
prompt optimization process. Empirical results on both public and industrial
datasets show that PLHF outperforms prior output grading strategies for LLM
prompt optimizations.

<details>

Motivation: 解决长文本风格迁移中句子级和段落级信息一致性的挑战，避免对平行语料库或LLM微调的依赖。

Method: 采用分层模板获取和模板引导生成的两阶段框架，动态构建句子和段落模板库，实现上下文感知的转换。

Result: 实验表明，ZeroStylus在风格一致性、内容保留和表达质量上优于基线方法，平均得分6.90（基线6.70）。

Conclusion: ZeroStylus为无需平行语料库或微调的长文本风格迁移提供了新方法，验证了分层模板的必要性。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge in long-text style transfer using
zero-shot learning of large language models (LLMs), proposing a hierarchical
framework that combines sentence-level stylistic adaptation with
paragraph-level structural coherence. We argue that in the process of effective
paragraph-style transfer, to preserve the consistency of original syntactic and
semantic information, it is essential to perform style transfer not only at the
sentence level but also to incorporate paragraph-level semantic considerations,
while ensuring structural coherence across inter-sentential relationships. Our
proposed framework, ZeroStylus, operates through two systematic phases:
hierarchical template acquisition from reference texts and template-guided
generation with multi-granular matching. The framework dynamically constructs
sentence and paragraph template repositories, enabling context-aware
transformations while preserving inter-sentence logical relationships.
Experimental evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over baseline
methods, with structured rewriting achieving 6.90 average score compared to
6.70 for direct prompting approaches in tri-axial metrics assessing style
consistency, content preservation, and expression quality. Ablation studies
validate the necessity of both template hierarchies during style transfer,
showing higher content preservation win rate against sentence-only approaches
through paragraph-level structural encoding, as well as direct prompting method
through sentence-level pattern extraction and matching. The results establish
new capabilities for coherent long-text style transfer without requiring
parallel corpora or LLM fine-tuning.

Method: 构建了BioProBench基准，包含27K原始协议和556K高质量结构化实例，评估了12种LLM在五个核心任务上的表现。

Result: 顶级LLM在表面理解任务上表现良好，但在深层推理和结构化生成任务上表现较差；开源模型在某些任务上接近闭源模型，但生物专用小模型落后于通用LLM。

Conclusion: 生物协议中的程序推理对当前LLM仍具挑战性，BioProBench为诊断局限性和指导AI系统开发提供了标准化框架。

Abstract: Biological protocols are fundamental to reproducible and safe life science
research. While LLMs excel on general tasks, their systematic evaluation on
these highly specialized, accuracy-critical, and inherently procedural texts
remains limited. In this work, we present BioProBench, the first large-scale,
integrated multi-task benchmark for biological protocol understanding and
reasoning. While limited benchmarks have touched upon specific aspects like
protocol QA, BioProBench provides a comprehensive suite of five core tasks:
Protocol Question Answering, Step Ordering, Error Correction, Protocol
Generation, and Protocol Reasoning, enabling a holistic evaluation of LLMs on
procedural biological texts. Built upon 27K original protocols, it yields
nearly 556K high-quality structured instances. We evaluate 12 mainstream
open/closed-source LLMs on BioProBench. Experimental results reveal that while
top models preform well on surface understanding tasks, struggle significantly
with deep reasoning and structured generation tasks like ordering and
generation. Furthermore, model comparisons reveal diverse performance: certain
open-source models approach closed-source levels on some tasks, yet
bio-specific small models lag behind general LLMs, indicating limitations on
complex procedural content. Overall, our findings underscore that procedural
reasoning within biological protocols represents a significant challenge for
current LLMs. BioProBench serves as a standardized framework to diagnose these
specific limitations and guide the development of AI systems better equipped
for safely automating complex scientific procedures. The code and data are

Motivation: 手语识别通常依赖高维视频数据，计算成本高。本研究旨在通过仅使用3D关节位置降低输入维度，同时保留语义信息，实现高效且实用的手语识别。

Method: TSLFormer采用序列到序列翻译框架，利用Transformer的自注意力机制捕捉手势序列中的时间共现和运动模式。输入为通过Mediapipe提取的手和躯干的3D关节位置。

Result: 在AUTSL数据集（36,000样本，227个单词）上，TSLFormer以较低计算成本实现了竞争性性能。

Conclusion: 基于关节的输入足以支持实时、移动和辅助性手语通信系统，为听力障碍者提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: This study presents TSLFormer, a light and robust word-level Turkish Sign
Language (TSL) recognition model that treats sign gestures as ordered,
string-like language. Instead of using raw RGB or depth videos, our method only
works with 3D joint positions - articulation points - extracted using Google's
Mediapipe library, which focuses on the hand and torso skeletal locations. This
creates efficient input dimensionality reduction while preserving important
semantic gesture information.
  Our approach revisits sign language recognition as sequence-to-sequence
translation, inspired by the linguistic nature of sign languages and the
success of transformers in natural language processing. Since TSLFormer uses
the self-attention mechanism, it effectively captures temporal co-occurrence
within gesture sequences and highlights meaningful motion patterns as words
unfold.
  Evaluated on the AUTSL dataset with over 36,000 samples and 227 different
words, TSLFormer achieves competitive performance with minimal computational
cost. These results show that joint-based input is sufficient for enabling
real-time, mobile, and assistive communication systems for hearing-impaired
individuals.

*Ching Nam Hang,Pei-Duo Yu,Chee Wei Tan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TrumorGPT是一种基于生成式人工智能的健康领域事实核查工具，旨在区分真实的健康谣言（trumors），利用大型语言模型和语义健康知识图谱进行推理，并通过GraphRAG技术减少幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体时代，虚假信息的快速传播对社会构成威胁，尤其是在健康领域。TrumorGPT旨在解决这一问题，区分真实与虚假的健康信息。

Method: 结合大型语言模型（LLM）和少样本学习，构建语义健康知识图谱，并采用GraphRAG技术动态更新数据以减少幻觉问题。

Result: 在广泛的健康数据集上，TrumorGPT表现出卓越的事实核查能力，尤其在公共卫生声明中。

Conclusion: TrumorGPT为对抗健康相关虚假信息提供了重要工具，提升了数字信息时代的信任与准确性。

Abstract: In the age of social media, the rapid spread of misinformation and rumors has
led to the emergence of infodemics, where false information poses a significant
threat to society. To combat this issue, we introduce TrumorGPT , a novel
generative artificial intelligence solution designed for fact-checking in the
health domain. TrumorGPT aims to distinguish "trumors", which are
health-related rumors that turn out to be true, providing a crucial tool in
differentiating between mere speculation and verified facts. This framework
leverages a large language model (LLM) with few-shot learning for semantic
health knowledge graph construction and semantic reasoning. TrumorGPT
incorporates graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG) to address
the hallucination issue common in LLMs and the limitations of static training
data. GraphRAG involves accessing and utilizing information from regularly
updated semantic health knowledge graphs that consist of the latest medical
news and health information, ensuring that fact-checking by TrumorGPT is based
on the most recent data. Evaluating with extensive healthcare datasets,
TrumorGPT demonstrates superior performance in fact-checking for public health
claims. Its ability to effectively conduct fact-checking across various
platforms marks a critical step forward in the fight against health-related
misinformation, enhancing trust and accuracy in the digital information age.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了LongCodeBench（LCB），一个用于测试长上下文模型在代码理解和修复任务中表现的基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着模型上下文长度的快速增长，构建真实的长上下文基准变得困难。代码理解和修复被选为自然测试任务。

Method: 通过从真实GitHub问题中构建QA和bug修复任务，设计了LongCodeBench基准。

Result: 所有模型在长上下文任务中表现下降，例如Claude 3.5 Sonnet从29%降至3%，Qwen2.5从70.2%降至40%。

Conclusion: 长上下文仍是模型的弱点，LongCodeBench为评估模型提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Context lengths for models have grown rapidly, from thousands to millions of
tokens in just a few years. The extreme context sizes of modern long-context
models have made it difficult to construct realistic long-context benchmarks --
not only due to the cost of collecting million-context tasks but also in
identifying realistic scenarios that require significant contexts. We identify
code comprehension and repair as a natural testbed and challenge task for
long-context models and introduce LongCodeBench (LCB), a benchmark to test LLM
coding abilities in long-context scenarios. Our benchmark tests both the
comprehension and repair capabilities of LCLMs in realistic and important
settings by drawing from real-world GitHub issues and constructing QA
(LongCodeQA) and bug fixing (LongSWE-Bench) tasks. We carefully stratify the
complexity of our benchmark, enabling us to evaluate models across different
scales -- ranging from Qwen2.5 14B Instruct to Google's flagship Gemini model.
We find that long-context remains a weakness for all models, with performance
drops such as from 29% to 3% for Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or from 70.2% to 40% for
Qwen2.5.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有连续知识编辑方法在长期编辑后成功率显著下降，导致模型输出偏离目标。

Method: 提出DeltaEdit，采用动态正交约束策略优化更新参数，减少编辑间的干扰。

Result: 实验表明DeltaEdit在编辑成功率和泛化能力保留上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DeltaEdit能确保模型在长期连续编辑下保持稳定可靠的性能。

Abstract: Sequential knowledge editing techniques aim to continuously update the
knowledge in large language models at a low cost, preventing the models from
generating outdated or incorrect information. However, existing sequential
editing methods suffer from a significant decline in editing success rates
after long-term editing. Through theoretical analysis and experiments, we
identify that as the number of edits increases, the model's output increasingly
deviates from the desired target, leading to a drop in editing success rates.
We refer to this issue as the accumulation of superimposed noise problem. To
address this, we identify the factors contributing to this deviation and
propose DeltaEdit, a novel method that optimizes update parameters through a
dynamic orthogonal constraints strategy, effectively reducing interference
between edits to mitigate deviation. Experimental results demonstrate that
DeltaEdit significantly outperforms existing methods in edit success rates and
the retention of generalization capabilities, ensuring stable and reliable
model performance even under extensive sequential editing.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SEM的后训练强化学习框架，旨在优化大型语言模型（LLMs）在调用搜索引擎时的行为，减少冗余搜索并提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在调用外部工具（如搜索引擎）时存在冗余搜索行为，导致效率低下和成本过高，需要一种方法优化其搜索决策。

Method: 通过结合MuSiQue和MMLU数据集构建平衡场景，设计结构化推理模板，并使用Group Relative Policy Optimization（GRPO）进行后训练，优化模型的搜索行为。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著减少了冗余搜索操作，同时在多个基准测试中保持或提高了答案准确性。

Conclusion: SEM框架提升了模型的推理效率，并扩展了其明智利用外部知识的能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models(LLMs) have demonstrated their
capabilities not only in reasoning but also in invoking external tools,
particularly search engines. However, teaching models to discern when to invoke
search and when to rely on their internal knowledge remains a significant
challenge. Existing reinforcement learning approaches often lead to redundant
search behaviors, resulting in inefficiencies and over-cost. In this paper, we
propose SEM, a novel post-training reinforcement learning framework that
explicitly trains LLMs to optimize search usage. By constructing a balanced
dataset combining MuSiQue and MMLU, we create scenarios where the model must
learn to distinguish between questions it can answer directly and those
requiring external retrieval. We design a structured reasoning template and
employ Group Relative Policy Optimization(GRPO) to post-train the model's
search behaviors. Our reward function encourages accurate answering without
unnecessary search while promoting effective retrieval when needed.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly reduces
redundant search operations while maintaining or improving answer accuracy
across multiple challenging benchmarks. This framework advances the model's
reasoning efficiency and extends its capability to judiciously leverage
external knowledge.

Conclusion: Re^2数据集为作者提供了更实用的指导，帮助减轻评审负担，并推动了同行评审系统的改进。

Abstract: Peer review is a critical component of scientific progress in the fields like
AI, but the rapid increase in submission volume has strained the reviewing
system, which inevitably leads to reviewer shortages and declines review
quality. Besides the growing research popularity, another key factor in this
overload is the repeated resubmission of substandard manuscripts, largely due
to the lack of effective tools for authors to self-evaluate their work before
submission. Large Language Models (LLMs) show great promise in assisting both
authors and reviewers, and their performance is fundamentally limited by the
quality of the peer review data. However, existing peer review datasets face
three major limitations: (1) limited data diversity, (2) inconsistent and
low-quality data due to the use of revised rather than initial submissions, and
(3) insufficient support for tasks involving rebuttal and reviewer-author
interactions. To address these challenges, we introduce the largest
consistency-ensured peer review and rebuttal dataset named Re^2, which
comprises 19,926 initial submissions, 70,668 review comments, and 53,818
rebuttals from 24 conferences and 21 workshops on OpenReview. Moreover, the
rebuttal and discussion stage is framed as a multi-turn conversation paradigm
to support both traditional static review tasks and dynamic interactive LLM
assistants, providing more practical guidance for authors to refine their
manuscripts and helping alleviate the growing review burden. Our data and code
are available in https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ReviewBench_anon/.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have great potential in the field of health
care, yet they face great challenges in adapting to rapidly evolving medical
knowledge. This can lead to outdated or contradictory treatment suggestions.
This study investigated how LLMs respond to evolving clinical guidelines,
focusing on concept drift and internal inconsistencies. We developed the
DriftMedQA benchmark to simulate guideline evolution and assessed the temporal
reliability of various LLMs. Our evaluation of seven state-of-the-art models
across 4,290 scenarios demonstrated difficulties in rejecting outdated
recommendations and frequently endorsing conflicting guidance. Additionally, we
explored two mitigation strategies: Retrieval-Augmented Generation and
preference fine-tuning via Direct Preference Optimization. While each method
improved model performance, their combination led to the most consistent and
reliable results. These findings underscore the need to improve LLM robustness
to temporal shifts to ensure more dependable applications in clinical practice.

Result: 测试表明该方法能自适应保留任务关键信息，同时保持高压缩效率。

Conclusion: 该框架有效支持任务自适应的语义通信，提升带宽利用效率。

Abstract: Semantic communications represent a new paradigm of next-generation
networking that shifts bit-wise data delivery to conveying the semantic
meanings for bandwidth efficiency. To effectively accommodate various potential
downstream tasks at the receiver side, one should adaptively convey the most
critical semantic information. This work presents a novel task-adaptive
semantic communication framework based on diffusion models that is capable of
dynamically adjusting the semantic message delivery according to various
downstream tasks. Specifically, we initialize the transmission of a
deep-compressed general semantic representation from the transmitter to enable
diffusion-based coarse data reconstruction at the receiver. The receiver
identifies the task-specific demands and generates textual prompts as feedback.
Integrated with the attention mechanism, the transmitter updates the semantic
transmission with more details to better align with the objectives of the
intended receivers. Our test results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
method in adaptively preserving critical task-relevant information for semantic
communications while preserving high compression efficiency.

Abstract: Over the past three years, the rapid advancement of Large Language Models
(LLMs) has had a profound impact on multiple areas of Artificial Intelligence
(AI), particularly in Natural Language Processing (NLP) across diverse
languages, including Arabic. Although Arabic is considered one of the most
widely spoken languages across 27 countries in the Arabic world and used as a
second language in some other non-Arabic countries as well, there is still a
scarcity of Arabic resources, datasets, and tools. Arabic NLP tasks face
various challenges due to the complexities of the Arabic language, including
its rich morphology, intricate structure, and diverse writing standards, among
other factors. Researchers have been actively addressing these challenges,
demonstrating that pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on
multilingual corpora achieve significant success in various Arabic NLP tasks.
This study provides an overview of using large language models (LLMs) for the
Arabic language, highlighting early pre-trained Arabic Language models across
various NLP applications and their ability to handle diverse Arabic content
tasks and dialects. It also provides an overview of how techniques like
finetuning and prompt engineering can enhance the performance of these models.
Additionally, the study summarizes common Arabic benchmarks and datasets while
presenting our observations on the persistent upward trend in the adoption of
LLMs.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注单级校正且缺乏对字符和音节级错误的有效整合，同时缺乏针对藏文的多级拼写校正的开源数据集和增强方法。

Method: 提出数据增强方法生成多级错误，并设计半掩码模型TiSpell，同时校正字符和音节级错误。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据上的实验表明，TiSpell优于基线模型，并与最先进方法性能相当。

Conclusion: TiSpell在多级藏文拼写校正任务中表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Multi-level Tibetan spelling correction addresses errors at both the
character and syllable levels within a unified model. Existing methods focus
mainly on single-level correction and lack effective integration of both
levels. Moreover, there are no open-source datasets or augmentation methods
tailored for this task in Tibetan. To tackle this, we propose a data
augmentation approach using unlabeled text to generate multi-level corruptions,
and introduce TiSpell, a semi-masked model capable of correcting both
character- and syllable-level errors. Although syllable-level correction is
more challenging due to its reliance on global context, our semi-masked
strategy simplifies this process. We synthesize nine types of corruptions on
clean sentences to create a robust training set. Experiments on both simulated
and real-world data demonstrate that TiSpell, trained on our dataset,
outperforms baseline models and matches the performance of state-of-the-art
approaches, confirming its effectiveness.

Motivation: 现有安全对齐方法导致LLMs过度拒绝良性查询，降低了其在敏感场景中的实用性。

Method: 提出FalseReject资源，包含16k查询和结构化响应；采用图引导的对抗多智能体交互框架生成多样化提示；提供训练数据集和人工标注测试集。

Result: 在29个SOTA LLMs上的实验表明，FalseReject显著减少了不必要的拒绝，同时保持安全性和语言能力。

Conclusion: FalseReject有效解决了LLMs的过度拒绝问题，提升了模型的实用性和安全性。

Abstract: Safety alignment approaches in large language models (LLMs) often lead to the
over-refusal of benign queries, significantly diminishing their utility in
sensitive scenarios. To address this challenge, we introduce FalseReject, a
comprehensive resource containing 16k seemingly toxic queries accompanied by
structured responses across 44 safety-related categories. We propose a
graph-informed adversarial multi-agent interaction framework to generate
diverse and complex prompts, while structuring responses with explicit
reasoning to aid models in accurately distinguishing safe from unsafe contexts.
FalseReject includes training datasets tailored for both standard
instruction-tuned models and reasoning-oriented models, as well as a
human-annotated benchmark test set. Our extensive benchmarking on 29
state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs reveals persistent over-refusal challenges.
Empirical results demonstrate that supervised finetuning with FalseReject
substantially reduces unnecessary refusals without compromising overall safety
or general language capabilities.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否能够模拟人类伦理推理，并作为人类判断的可信代理。

Method: 引入包含196个真实伦理困境的基准数据集，使用复合指标（BLEU、Damerau-Levenshtein距离等）评估多个LLMs，并与非专家人类回答对比。

Result: LLMs在词汇和结构对齐上优于非专家人类，但缺乏历史背景和复杂策略的能力。人类回答虽结构松散，但语义相似性偶尔接近。

Conclusion: LLMs在伦理决策中表现出潜力，但在上下文抽象和历史背景方面仍有局限。

Abstract: One open question in the study of Large Language Models (LLMs) is whether
they can emulate human ethical reasoning and act as believable proxies for
human judgment. To investigate this, we introduce a benchmark dataset
comprising 196 real-world ethical dilemmas and expert opinions, each segmented
into five structured components: Introduction, Key Factors, Historical
Theoretical Perspectives, Resolution Strategies, and Key Takeaways. We also
collect non-expert human responses for comparison, limited to the Key Factors
section due to their brevity. We evaluate multiple frontier LLMs (GPT-4o-mini,
Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Deepseek-V3, Gemini-1.5-Flash) using a composite metric
framework based on BLEU, Damerau-Levenshtein distance, TF-IDF cosine
similarity, and Universal Sentence Encoder similarity. Metric weights are
computed through an inversion-based ranking alignment and pairwise AHP
analysis, enabling fine-grained comparison of model outputs to expert
responses. Our results show that LLMs generally outperform non-expert humans in
lexical and structural alignment, with GPT-4o-mini performing most consistently
across all sections. However, all models struggle with historical grounding and
proposing nuanced resolution strategies, which require contextual abstraction.
Human responses, while less structured, occasionally achieve comparable
semantic similarity, suggesting intuitive moral reasoning. These findings
highlight both the strengths and current limitations of LLMs in ethical
decision-making.

Motivation: 探讨语言模型代理架构的复杂性是否必要，尤其是在SWE-bench等挑战性任务中。

Method: 将整个任务环境放入长上下文语言模型（LCLM）中，并通过适当提示模型，避免使用复杂的代理架构。

Result: Gemini-1.5-Pro无架构支持达到38%解决率，Gemini-2.5-Pro达到50.8%，两阶段方法（结合Gemini-1.5-Pro和Claude-3.7）达到48.6%。

Conclusion: 部分复杂代理架构可能不必要，长上下文语言模型结合适当提示即可取得竞争性表现。

Abstract: Recent advances in language model (LM) agents have demonstrated significant
potential for automating complex real-world tasks. To make progress on these
difficult tasks, LM agent architectures have become increasingly complex, often
incorporating multi-step retrieval tools, multiple agents, and scaffolding
adapted to the underlying LM. In this work, we investigate whether all of this
complexity is necessary, or if parts of these scaffolds can be removed on
challenging tasks like SWE-bench. We show that in the case of SWE-bench, simply
putting the entire environment into the context of a long context language
model (LCLM) and properly prompting the model makes it competitive with
carefully tuned, complex agent scaffolds. We show that a Gemini-1.5-Pro model
without any scaffolding or tools achieves 38% on SWE-Bench-Verified, comparable
with approaches using carefully tuned agent scaffolds (32%). While the
unscaffolded approach with Gemini-1.5-Pro falls short of the strongest agentic
architectures, we demonstrate that the more capable Gemini-2.5-Pro using the
same unscaffolded approach directly attains a 50.8% solve rate. Additionally, a
two-stage approach combining Gemini-1.5-Pro with Claude-3.7 achieves a
competitive 48.6% solve rate.

Conclusion: ALOHA系统在校园信息检索中表现优于商业聊天机器人和搜索引擎，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models~(LLMs) revolutionizes information
retrieval, allowing users to obtain required answers through complex
instructions within conversations. However, publicly available services remain
inadequate in addressing the needs of faculty and students to search
campus-specific information. It is primarily due to the LLM's lack of
domain-specific knowledge and the limitation of search engines in supporting
multilingual and timely scenarios. To tackle these challenges, we introduce
ALOHA, a multilingual agent enhanced by hierarchical retrieval for university
orientation. We also integrate external APIs into the front-end interface to
provide interactive service. The human evaluation and case study show our
proposed system has strong capabilities to yield correct, timely, and
user-friendly responses to the queries in multiple languages, surpassing
commercial chatbots and search engines. The system has been deployed and has
provided service for more than 12,000 people.

Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has provided
significant support and opportunities for the advancement of domain-specific
LLMs. However, fine-tuning these large models using Intangible Cultural
Heritage (ICH) data inevitably faces challenges such as bias, incorrect
knowledge inheritance, and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we
propose a novel training method that integrates a bidirectional chains of
thought and a reward mechanism. This method is built upon ICH-Qwen, a large
language model specifically designed for the field of intangible cultural
heritage. The proposed method enables the model to not only perform forward
reasoning but also enhances the accuracy of the generated answers by utilizing
reverse questioning and reverse reasoning to activate the model's latent
knowledge. Additionally, a reward mechanism is introduced during training to
optimize the decision-making process. This mechanism improves the quality of
the model's outputs through structural and content evaluations with different
weighting schemes. We conduct comparative experiments on ICH-Qwen, with results
demonstrating that our method outperforms 0-shot, step-by-step reasoning,
knowledge distillation, and question augmentation methods in terms of accuracy,
Bleu-4, and Rouge-L scores on the question-answering task. Furthermore, the
paper highlights the effectiveness of combining the bidirectional chains of
thought and reward mechanism through ablation experiments. In addition, a
series of generalizability experiments are conducted, with results showing that
the proposed method yields improvements on various domain-specific datasets and
advanced models in areas such as Finance, Wikidata, and StrategyQA. This
demonstrates that the method is adaptable to multiple domains and provides a
valuable approach for model training in future applications across diverse
fields.

### [102] [Exploiting Text Semantics for Few and Zero Shot Node Classification on Text-attributed Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08168)

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为TSA的文本语义增强方法，通过引入更多文本语义监督信号，显著提升了文本属性图（TAG）上少样本和零样本节点分类的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要基于图增强技术训练节点和文本嵌入，而文本增强方法研究较少。本文旨在通过文本语义增强提升分类性能。

Method: 设计了两种文本语义增强技术：正语义匹配（检索相似文本嵌入）和负语义对比（构造相反语义的文本描述）。

Result: 在5个数据集上与13个基线方法对比，TSA表现最优，准确率通常比最佳基线提升5%以上。

Conclusion: TSA通过文本语义增强显著提升了TAG上节点分类的准确性，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Text-attributed graph (TAG) provides a text description for each graph node,
and few- and zero-shot node classification on TAGs have many applications in
fields such as academia and social networks. Existing work utilizes various
graph-based augmentation techniques to train the node and text embeddings,
while text-based augmentations are largely unexplored. In this paper, we
propose Text Semantics Augmentation (TSA) to improve accuracy by introducing
more text semantic supervision signals. Specifically, we design two
augmentation techniques, i.e., positive semantics matching and negative
semantics contrast, to provide more reference texts for each graph node or text
description. Positive semantic matching retrieves texts with similar embeddings
to match with a graph node. Negative semantic contrast adds a negative prompt
to construct a text description with the opposite semantics, which is
contrasted with the original node and text. We evaluate TSA on 5 datasets and
compare with 13 state-of-the-art baselines. The results show that TSA
consistently outperforms all baselines, and its accuracy improvements over the
best-performing baseline are usually over 5%.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种预训练的不确定性量化（UQ）模块，用于增强大型语言模型（LLMs）检测幻觉的能力，其性能优于无监督方法，并在多语言任务中表现出强泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs容易产生幻觉（虚假信息），而用户缺乏检测工具，因此需要一种可靠的方法来量化模型输出的不确定性。

Method: 引入预训练的UQ头部模块，利用Transformer架构和LLM注意力图的特征，增强不确定性量化能力。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在幻觉检测任务中表现优异，具有强鲁棒性和泛化能力，支持多语言。

Conclusion: 预训练的UQ头部模块显著提升了LLMs的不确定性量化能力，为幻觉检测提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have the tendency to hallucinate, i.e., to
sporadically generate false or fabricated information. This presents a major
challenge, as hallucinations often appear highly convincing and users generally
lack the tools to detect them. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) provides a
framework for assessing the reliability of model outputs, aiding in the
identification of potential hallucinations. In this work, we introduce
pre-trained UQ heads: supervised auxiliary modules for LLMs that substantially
enhance their ability to capture uncertainty compared to unsupervised UQ
methods. Their strong performance stems from the powerful Transformer
architecture in their design and informative features derived from LLM
attention maps. Experimental evaluation shows that these heads are highly
robust and achieve state-of-the-art performance in claim-level hallucination
detection across both in-domain and out-of-domain prompts. Moreover, these
modules demonstrate strong generalization to languages they were not explicitly
trained on. We pre-train a collection of UQ heads for popular LLM series,
including Mistral, Llama, and Gemma 2. We publicly release both the code and
the pre-trained heads.

intelligence. This survey introduces and synthesizes an emerging
interdisciplinary field of LLM Psychometrics, which leverages psychometric
instruments, theories, and principles to evaluate, understand, and enhance
LLMs. We systematically explore the role of Psychometrics in shaping
benchmarking principles, broadening evaluation scopes, refining methodologies,
validating results, and advancing LLM capabilities. This paper integrates
diverse perspectives to provide a structured framework for researchers across
disciplines, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of this nascent field.

evaluation paradigms that align with human-level AI and promote the advancement
of human-centered AI systems for societal benefit. A curated repository of LLM

Conclusion: 提出的方法为实际知识集成挑战提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid progress in large language models (LLMs) has paved the way for
novel approaches in knowledge-intensive tasks. Among these, Cache-Augmented
Generation (CAG) has emerged as a promising alternative to Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG). CAG minimizes retrieval latency and simplifies system design
by preloading knowledge into the model's context. However, challenges persist
in scaling CAG to accommodate large and dynamic knowledge bases effectively.
This paper introduces Adaptive Contextual Compression (ACC), an innovative
technique designed to dynamically compress and manage context inputs, enabling
efficient utilization of the extended memory capabilities of modern LLMs. To
further address the limitations of standalone CAG, we propose a Hybrid CAG-RAG
Framework, which integrates selective retrieval to augment preloaded contexts
in scenarios requiring additional information. Comprehensive evaluations on
diverse datasets highlight the proposed methods' ability to enhance
scalability, optimize efficiency, and improve multi-hop reasoning performance,
offering practical solutions for real-world knowledge integration challenges.

Motivation: 研究黑盒提示优化方法是否适用于当前不断增大的语言模型规模。

Method: 选择三种知名黑盒优化方法，在DeepSeek V3和Gemini 2.0 Flash等大规模模型上评估，并分析模型规模对优化效果的影响。

Result: 黑盒优化方法在大规模模型上效果有限，且模型规模越大，优化效果越差。

Conclusion: 模型规模是影响黑盒提示优化效果的主要因素，未来研究需考虑这一因素。

Abstract: Black-Box prompt optimization methods have emerged as a promising strategy
for refining input prompts to better align large language models (LLMs),
thereby enhancing their task performance. Although these methods have
demonstrated encouraging results, most studies and experiments have primarily
focused on smaller-scale models (e.g., 7B, 14B) or earlier versions (e.g.,
GPT-3.5) of LLMs. As the scale of LLMs continues to increase, such as with
DeepSeek V3 (671B), it remains an open question whether these black-box
optimization techniques will continue to yield significant performance
improvements for models of such scale. In response to this, we select three
well-known black-box optimization methods and evaluate them on large-scale LLMs
(DeepSeek V3 and Gemini 2.0 Flash) across four NLU and NLG datasets. The
results show that these black-box prompt optimization methods offer only
limited improvements on these large-scale LLMs. Furthermore, we hypothesize
that the scale of the model is the primary factor contributing to the limited
benefits observed. To explore this hypothesis, we conducted experiments on LLMs
of varying sizes (Qwen 2.5 series, ranging from 7B to 72B) and observed an
inverse scaling law, wherein the effectiveness of black-box optimization
methods diminished as the model size increased.

Result: 研究发现最重要的SVD因子在训练早期被学习，支持通过谱聚类识别可解释的语义结构。

Conclusion: 研究连接了分布语义学、神经崩溃几何和神经网络训练动态，揭示了NTP如何塑造语言模型中的意义表示。

Abstract: Modern language models demonstrate a remarkable ability to capture linguistic
meaning despite being trained solely through next-token prediction (NTP). We
investigate how this conceptually simple training objective leads models to
extract and encode latent semantic and grammatical concepts. Our analysis
reveals that NTP optimization implicitly guides models to encode concepts via
singular value decomposition (SVD) factors of a centered data-sparsity matrix
that captures next-word co-occurrence patterns. While the model never
explicitly constructs this matrix, learned word and context embeddings
effectively factor it to capture linguistic structure. We find that the most
important SVD factors are learned first during training, motivating the use of
spectral clustering of embeddings to identify human-interpretable semantics,
including both classical k-means and a new orthant-based method directly
motivated by our interpretation of concepts. Overall, our work bridges
distributional semantics, neural collapse geometry, and neural network training
dynamics, providing insights into how NTP's implicit biases shape the emergence
of meaning representations in language models.

Method: 方法包括使用7B到12B参数的指令调优开源LLMs模拟西班牙语师生对话，通过交替角色生成对话，并基于CEFR提示评估文本难度控制效果。

Result: 研究发现系统提示可以约束模型输出，但仅靠提示在长期交互中不够稳定（称为“对齐漂移”）。

Conclusion: 结论是LLMs在个性化、能力对齐的自适应导师中具有潜力，但需要更稳定的方法，同时提供了一种无需人类参与的低成本评估模型性能的方法。

Abstract: This paper investigates the potentials of Large Language Models (LLMs) as
adaptive tutors in the context of second-language learning. In particular, we
evaluate whether system prompting can reliably constrain LLMs to generate only
text appropriate to the student's competence level. We simulate full
teacher-student dialogues in Spanish using instruction-tuned, open-source LLMs
ranging in size from 7B to 12B parameters. Dialogues are generated by having an
LLM alternate between tutor and student roles with separate chat histories. The
output from the tutor model is then used to evaluate the effectiveness of
CEFR-based prompting to control text difficulty across three proficiency levels
(A1, B1, C1). Our findings suggest that while system prompting can be used to
constrain model outputs, prompting alone is too brittle for sustained,
long-term interactional contexts - a phenomenon we term alignment drift. Our
results provide insights into the feasibility of LLMs for personalized,
proficiency-aligned adaptive tutors and provide a scalable method for low-cost
evaluation of model performance without human participants.

Conclusion: 该研究为开发污染抵抗基准提供了贡献，有助于更严格地评估LLMs并揭示其真实能力。

Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has transformed the
landscape of natural language processing. Evaluating LLMs properly is crucial
for understanding their potential and addressing concerns such as safety.
However, LLM evaluation is confronted by various factors, among which
contamination stands out as a key issue that undermines the reliability of
evaluations. In this work, we introduce the concept of contamination resistance
to address this challenge. We propose a benchmark based on Caesar ciphers
(e.g., "ab" to "bc" when the shift is 1), which, despite its simplicity, is an
excellent example of a contamination resistant benchmark. We test this
benchmark on widely used LLMs under various settings, and we find that these
models struggle with this benchmark when contamination is controlled. Our
findings reveal issues in current LLMs and raise important questions regarding
their true capabilities. Our work contributes to the development of
contamination resistant benchmarks, enabling more rigorous LLM evaluation and
offering insights into the true capabilities and limitations of LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出Adaptive GoGI-Skip框架，通过动态压缩Chain-of-Thought（CoT）提示，提高推理效率并减少计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前CoT压缩技术依赖通用重要性指标和静态压缩率，可能导致关键信息丢失或无法适应复杂推理任务。

Method: 结合Goal-Gradient Importance（GoGI）和Adaptive Dynamic Skipping（ADS），动态识别关键令牌并调节压缩率。

Result: 在MATH数据上训练后，Adaptive GoGI-Skip平均减少45%的令牌数量，推理速度提升1.6-2.0倍，同时保持高精度。

Conclusion: Adaptive GoGI-Skip在效率和准确性上优于现有基线，推动了CoT推理的优化。

Abstract: Large Language Models leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting for complex
tasks, but their reasoning traces are often excessively verbose and
inefficient, leading to significant computational costs and latency. Current
CoT compression techniques typically rely on generic importance metrics and
static compression rates, which may inadvertently remove functionally critical
tokens or fail to adapt to varying reasoning complexity. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Adaptive GoGI-Skip, a novel framework learning dynamic
CoT compression via supervised fine-tuning. This approach introduces two
synergistic innovations: (1) Goal-Gradient Importance (GoGI), a novel metric
accurately identifying functionally relevant tokens by measuring the gradient
influence of their intermediate representations on the final answer loss, and
(2) Adaptive Dynamic Skipping (ADS), a mechanism dynamically regulating the
compression rate based on runtime model uncertainty while ensuring local
coherence through an adaptive N-token constraint. To our knowledge, this is the
first work unifying a goal-oriented, gradient-based importance metric with
dynamic, uncertainty-aware skipping for CoT compression. Trained on compressed
MATH data, Adaptive GoGI-Skip demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization
across diverse reasoning benchmarks including AIME, GPQA, and GSM8K. It
achieves substantial efficiency gains - reducing CoT token counts by over 45%
on average and delivering 1.6-2.0 times inference speedups - while maintaining
high reasoning accuracy. Notably, it significantly outperforms existing
baselines by preserving accuracy even at high effective compression rates,
advancing the state of the art in the CoT reasoning efficiency-accuracy
trade-off.

Conclusion: TUMS框架有效提升了LLMs的工具使用能力，为工具增强型LLMs的未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recently, large language models(LLMs) have played an increasingly important
role in solving a wide range of NLP tasks, leveraging their capabilities of
natural language understanding and generating. Integration with external tools
further enhances LLMs' effectiveness, providing more precise, timely, and
specialized responses. However, LLMs still encounter difficulties with
non-executable actions and improper actions, which are primarily attributed to
incorrect parameters. The process of generating parameters by LLMs is confined
to the tool level, employing the coarse-grained strategy without considering
the different difficulties of various tools. To address this issue, we propose
TUMS, a novel framework designed to enhance the tool-use capabilities of LLMs
by transforming tool-level processing into parameter-level processing.
Specifically, our framework consists of four key components: (1) an intent
recognizer that identifies the user's intent to help LLMs better understand the
task; (2) a task decomposer that breaks down complex tasks into simpler
subtasks, each involving a tool call; (3) a subtask processor equipped with
multi-structure handlers to generate accurate parameters; and (4) an executor.
Our empirical studies have evidenced the effectiveness and efficiency of the
TUMS framework with an average of 19.6\% and 50.6\% improvement separately on
easy and hard benchmarks of ToolQA, meanwhile, we demonstrated the key
contribution of each part with ablation experiments, offering more insights and
stimulating future research on Tool-augmented LLMs.

Pairsia-unsup - to support supervised and unsupervised training scenarios.
Additionally, Hakim is designed for applications in chatbots and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, particularly addressing retrieval
tasks that require incorporating message history within these systems. We also
propose a new baseline model built on the BERT architecture. Our language model
consistently achieves higher accuracy across various Persian NLP tasks, while
the RetroMAE-based model proves particularly effective for textual information
retrieval applications. Together, these contributions establish a new
foundation for advancing Persian language understanding.

Abstract: Topic modeling in Italian legal research is hindered by the lack of public

address this, we developed a document processing pipeline that produces an
anonymized dataset optimized for topic modeling.
  The pipeline integrates document layout analysis (YOLOv8x), optical character
recognition, and text anonymization. The DLA module achieved a mAP@50 of 0.964
and a mAP@50-95 of 0.800. The OCR detector reached a mAP@50-95 of 0.9022, and
the text recognizer (TrOCR) obtained a character error rate of 0.0047 and a
word error rate of 0.0248. Compared to OCR-only methods, our dataset improved
topic modeling with a diversity score of 0.6198 and a coherence score of
0.6638.
  We applied BERTopic to extract topics and used large language models to
generate labels and summaries. Outputs were evaluated against domain expert
interpretations. Claude Sonnet 3.7 achieved a BERTScore F1 of 0.8119 for
labeling and 0.9130 for summarization.

TL;DR: IterKey是一个基于LLM的迭代关键词生成框架，通过稀疏检索增强RAG，平衡了准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用需要RAG不仅准确，还要可解释。密集检索方法准确性高但缺乏可解释性，稀疏检索方法透明但难以捕捉查询意图。

Method: IterKey通过三个阶段迭代优化：生成检索关键词、基于检索文档生成答案、验证答案。验证失败时，迭代优化关键词。

Result: 在四个QA任务中，IterKey比BM25-based RAG和简单基线方法提高了5%到20%的准确性，性能与密集检索方法相当。

Conclusion: IterKey是一种新颖的BM25-based方法，利用LLM迭代优化RAG，有效平衡了准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a way to complement the
in-context knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external
documents. However, real-world applications demand not only accuracy but also
interpretability. While dense retrieval methods provide high accuracy, they
lack interpretability; conversely, sparse retrieval methods offer transparency
but often fail to capture the full intent of queries due to their reliance on
keyword matching. To address these issues, we introduce IterKey, an LLM-driven
iterative keyword generation framework that enhances RAG via sparse retrieval.
IterKey consists of three LLM-driven stages: generating keywords for retrieval,
generating answers based on retrieved documents, and validating the answers. If
validation fails, the process iteratively repeats with refined keywords. Across
four QA tasks, experimental results show that IterKey achieves 5% to 20%
accuracy improvements over BM25-based RAG and simple baselines. Its performance
is comparable to dense retrieval-based RAG and prior iterative query refinement
methods using dense models. In summary, IterKey is a novel BM25-based approach
leveraging LLMs to iteratively refine RAG, effectively balancing accuracy with

Method: 提出RepCali方法，在编码器后加入校准模块，对潜在空间表示进行校准，并将其作为解码器输入。该方法具有通用性、即插即用性和易实现性。

Result: 在8个任务（包括中英文数据集）的25个PLM模型上验证，RepCali显著提升了模型性能，优于代表性微调基线。

Conclusion: RepCali是一种有效且通用的方法，能够显著改善PLM在下游任务中的表现。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained language models (PLMs) has become a dominant paradigm
in applying PLMs to downstream tasks. However, with limited fine-tuning, PLMs
still struggle with the discrepancies between the representation obtained from
the PLMs' encoder and the optimal input to the PLMs' decoder. This paper
tackles this challenge by learning to calibrate the representation of PLMs in
the latent space. In the proposed representation calibration method (RepCali),
we integrate a specific calibration block to the latent space after the encoder
and use the calibrated output as the decoder input. The merits of the proposed
RepCali include its universality to all PLMs with encoder-decoder
architectures, its plug-and-play nature, and ease of implementation. Extensive
experiments on 25 PLM-based models across 8 tasks (including both English and
Chinese datasets) demonstrate that the proposed RepCali offers desirable
enhancements to PLMs (including LLMs) and significantly improves the
performance of downstream tasks. Comparison experiments across 4 benchmark
tasks indicate that RepCali is superior to the representative fine-tuning
baselines.

Abstract: Stance detection is essential for understanding subjective content across
various platforms such as social media, news articles, and online reviews.
Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized stance
detection by introducing novel capabilities in contextual understanding,
cross-domain generalization, and multimodal analysis. Despite these
progressions, existing surveys often lack comprehensive coverage of approaches
that specifically leverage LLMs for stance detection. To bridge this critical
gap, our review article conducts a systematic analysis of stance detection,
comprehensively examining recent advancements of LLMs transforming the field,
including foundational concepts, methodologies, datasets, applications, and
emerging challenges. We present a novel taxonomy for LLM-based stance detection
approaches, structured along three key dimensions: 1) learning methods,
including supervised, unsupervised, few-shot, and zero-shot; 2) data
modalities, such as unimodal, multimodal, and hybrid; and 3) target
relationships, encompassing in-target, cross-target, and multi-target
scenarios. Furthermore, we discuss the evaluation techniques and analyze
benchmark datasets and performance trends, highlighting the strengths and
limitations of different architectures. Key applications in misinformation
detection, political analysis, public health monitoring, and social media
moderation are discussed. Finally, we identify critical challenges such as
implicit stance expression, cultural biases, and computational constraints,
while outlining promising future directions, including explainable stance
reasoning, low-resource adaptation, and real-time deployment frameworks. Our
survey highlights emerging trends, open challenges, and future directions to
guide researchers and practitioners in developing next-generation stance
detection systems powered by large language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型视觉语言模型评估成本高且耗时，限制了实际应用。希望通过开源LVLMs作为评估工具，降低成本并提高效率。

Method: 设计了成对和点对评估任务，涵盖事实准确性、信息量和相关性等标准，并分析了格式遵循、位置一致性和长度偏差等因素。

Result: 部分开源LVLMs评估性能接近GPT-4（约80%一致性），但其他模型表现较差（低于10%一致性）。

Conclusion: 开源LVLMs可作为图表任务的低成本自动评估工具，但仍需解决位置偏好和长度偏差等问题。

Abstract: Charts are ubiquitous as they help people understand and reason with data.
Recently, various downstream tasks, such as chart question answering,
chart2text, and fact-checking, have emerged. Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) show promise in tackling these tasks, but their evaluation is costly
and time-consuming, limiting real-world deployment. While using LVLMs as judges
to assess the chart comprehension capabilities of other LVLMs could streamline
evaluation processes, challenges like proprietary datasets, restricted access
to powerful models, and evaluation costs hinder their adoption in industrial
settings. To this end, we present a comprehensive evaluation of 13 open-source
LVLMs as judges for diverse chart comprehension and reasoning tasks. We design
both pairwise and pointwise evaluation tasks covering criteria like factual
correctness, informativeness, and relevancy. Additionally, we analyze LVLM
judges based on format adherence, positional consistency, length bias, and
instruction-following. We focus on cost-effective LVLMs (<10B parameters)
suitable for both research and commercial use, following a standardized
evaluation protocol and rubric to measure the LVLM judge's accuracy.
Experimental results reveal notable variability: while some open LVLM judges
achieve GPT-4-level evaluation performance (about 80% agreement with GPT-4
judgments), others struggle (below ~10% agreement). Our findings highlight that
state-of-the-art open-source LVLMs can serve as cost-effective automatic
evaluators for chart-related tasks, though biases such as positional preference
and length bias persist.

*Takumi Shibata,Yuichi Miyamura*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的零样本自动作文评分方法LCES，通过将评分任务转化为成对比较，提高了评分的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本方法直接生成绝对分数，容易因模型偏见和不一致评分偏离人工评分，因此需要更准确的评分方法。

Method: 提出LCES方法，将作文评分任务转化为成对比较，利用LLM判断两篇作文的优劣，并通过RankNet将比较结果转换为连续分数。

Result: 实验表明，LCES在准确性上优于传统零样本方法，且计算效率高，适用于不同LLM模型。

Conclusion: LCES是一种高效、准确的零样本自动作文评分方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled zero-shot
automated essay scoring (AES), providing a promising way to reduce the cost and
effort of essay scoring in comparison with manual grading. However, most
existing zero-shot approaches rely on LLMs to directly generate absolute
scores, which often diverge from human evaluations owing to model biases and
inconsistent scoring. To address these limitations, we propose LLM-based
Comparative Essay Scoring (LCES), a method that formulates AES as a pairwise
comparison task. Specifically, we instruct LLMs to judge which of two essays is
better, collect many such comparisons, and convert them into continuous scores.
Considering that the number of possible comparisons grows quadratically with
the number of essays, we improve scalability by employing RankNet to
efficiently transform LLM preferences into scalar scores. Experiments using AES
benchmark datasets show that LCES outperforms conventional zero-shot methods in
accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. Moreover, LCES is robust
across different LLM backbones, highlighting its applicability to real-world
zero-shot AES.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于三元组的线性化方法，以解决Penman编码在AMR解析中的局限性，但结果表明三元组编码仍需改进以匹敌Penman的简洁性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Penman编码在AMR解析中存在局限性，如深层次图中节点距离远、需处理逆角色等问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于三元组的线性化方法，并与Penman编码进行比较。

Result: 三元组编码在表示图结构上有优势，但在简洁性和嵌套结构表示上仍需改进。

Conclusion: 三元组编码是一种有潜力的替代方案，但需进一步优化以更好地与Penman编码竞争。

Abstract: Sequence-to-sequence models are widely used to train Abstract Meaning
Representation (Banarescu et al., 2013, AMR) parsers. To train such models, AMR
graphs have to be linearized into a one-line text format. While Penman encoding
is typically used for this purpose, we argue that it has limitations: (1) for
deep graphs, some closely related nodes are located far apart in the linearized
text (2) Penman's tree-based encoding necessitates inverse roles to handle node
re-entrancy, doubling the number of relation types to predict. To address these
issues, we propose a triple-based linearization method and compare its
efficiency with Penman linearization. Although triples are well suited to
represent a graph, our results suggest room for improvement in triple encoding
to better compete with Penman's concise and explicit representation of a nested
graph structure.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的评估指标MPA，用于衡量NMT系统对性别线索的依赖程度，发现现有模型更倾向于忽略性别线索而依赖统计性别刻板印象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估指标未能充分捕捉NMT系统对上下文性别线索的整合程度，因此需要一种更精确的评估方法。

Method: 提出Minimal Pair Accuracy (MPA)指标，通过最小对句子（仅性别代词不同）评估模型对性别线索的依赖。

Result: 实验显示NMT模型大多忽略性别线索，倾向于刻板性别解释；在反刻板情况下，模型更关注男性线索而忽略女性线索。

Conclusion: NMT系统对性别线索的处理存在偏差，男性线索引发更分散的响应，而女性线索响应更集中且专门化。

Abstract: While gender bias in modern Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems has
received much attention, traditional evaluation metrics do not to fully capture
the extent to which these systems integrate contextual gender cues. We propose
a novel evaluation metric called Minimal Pair Accuracy (MPA), which measures
the reliance of models on gender cues for gender disambiguation. MPA is
designed to go beyond surface-level gender accuracy metrics by focusing on
whether models adapt to gender cues in minimal pairs -- sentence pairs that
differ solely in the gendered pronoun, namely the explicit indicator of the
target's entity gender in the source language (EN). We evaluate a number of NMT
models on the English-Italian (EN--IT) language pair using this metric, we show
that they ignore available gender cues in most cases in favor of (statistical)
stereotypical gender interpretation. We further show that in anti-stereotypical
cases, these models tend to more consistently take masculine gender cues into
account while ignoring the feminine cues. Furthermore, we analyze the attention
head weights in the encoder component and show that while all models encode
gender information to some extent, masculine cues elicit a more diffused
response compared to the more concentrated and specialized responses to
feminine gender cues.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在AIED领域的广泛应用及其局限性，强调SLMs在资源受限环境中的潜在价值。

Method: 通过关键词搜索分析AIED 2024论文中LLMs的使用情况，并以知识组件（KC）发现为例，展示SLMs（如Phi-2）的有效性。

Result: 61%的AIED 2024论文使用LLMs，43%提到GPT；SLMs在KC发现任务中表现良好，无需复杂提示策略。

Conclusion: 呼吁更多关注SLMs在AIED中的应用，以实现更公平和经济的AI工具普及。

Abstract: GPT has become nearly synonymous with large language models (LLMs), an
increasingly popular term in AIED proceedings. A simple keyword-based search
reveals that 61% of the 76 long and short papers presented at AIED 2024
describe novel solutions using LLMs to address some of the long-standing
challenges in education, and 43% specifically mention GPT. Although LLMs
pioneered by GPT create exciting opportunities to strengthen the impact of AI
on education, we argue that the field's predominant focus on GPT and other
resource-intensive LLMs (with more than 10B parameters) risks neglecting the
potential impact that small language models (SLMs) can make in providing
resource-constrained institutions with equitable and affordable access to
high-quality AI tools. Supported by positive results on knowledge component
(KC) discovery, a critical challenge in AIED, we demonstrate that SLMs such as
Phi-2 can produce an effective solution without elaborate prompting strategies.
Hence, we call for more attention to developing SLM-based AIED approaches.

Abstract: Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming pathology by
integrat-ing large language models (LLMs) with retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) and domain-specific foundation models. This study explores the
application of RAG-enhanced LLMs coupled with pathology foundation models for
thyroid cytology diagnosis, addressing challenges in cytological
interpretation, standardization, and diagnostic accuracy. By leveraging a
curated knowledge base, RAG facilitates dy-namic retrieval of relevant case
studies, diagnostic criteria, and expert interpreta-tion, improving the
contextual understanding of LLMs. Meanwhile, pathology foun-dation models,
trained on high-resolution pathology images, refine feature extrac-tion and
classification capabilities. The fusion of these AI-driven approaches en-hances
diagnostic consistency, reduces variability, and supports pathologists in
dis-tinguishing benign from malignant thyroid lesions. Our results demonstrate
that integrating RAG with pathology-specific LLMs significantly improves
diagnostic efficiency and interpretability, paving the way for AI-assisted
thyroid cytopathology, with foundation model UNI achieving AUC 0.73-0.93 for
correct prediction of surgi-cal pathology diagnosis from thyroid cytology
samples.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了现有推测解码的局限性，显著提升了LLM推理的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Speculative decoding, which combines a draft model with a target model, has
emerged as an effective approach to accelerate large language model (LLM)
inference. However, existing methods often face a trade-off between the
acceptance rate and decoding speed in downstream tasks due to the limited
capacity of the draft model, making it difficult to ensure efficiency across
diverse tasks. To address this problem, we propose a speculative decoding
algorithm tailored for downstream task optimization. It includes an automatic
task partitioning and assigning method, which automatically categorizes
downstream tasks into different sub-tasks and assigns them to a set of
heterogeneous draft models. Each draft model is aligned with the target model
using task-specific data, thereby enhancing the consistency of inference
results. In addition, our proposed method incorporates an online lightweight
prompt classifier to dynamically route prompts to the appropriate draft model.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves draft
accuracy by 6% to 50% over vanilla speculative decoding, while achieving a
speedup of 1.10x to 2.64x in LLM inference.

Result: 隐藏状态在县级和公司级变量估计中表现优异，少量标签数据即可训练，迁移学习进一步提高了准确性。

Conclusion: 隐藏状态在经济统计任务中具有实用价值，尤其在超分辨率和数据填补任务中表现突出。

Abstract: We investigate whether the hidden states of large language models (LLMs) can
be used to estimate and impute economic and financial statistics. Focusing on
county-level (e.g. unemployment) and firm-level (e.g. total assets) variables,
we show that a simple linear model trained on the hidden states of open-source
LLMs outperforms the models' text outputs. This suggests that hidden states
capture richer economic information than the responses of the LLMs reveal
directly. A learning curve analysis indicates that only a few dozen labelled
examples are sufficient for training. We also propose a transfer learning
method that improves estimation accuracy without requiring any labelled data
for the target variable. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of
hidden-state representations in super-resolution and data imputation tasks.

Conclusion: ASEE为事件抽取提供了一种灵活且高效的解决方案，并通过MD-SEE基准推动了领域发展。

Abstract: Event extraction (EE) is a fundamental task in natural language processing
(NLP) that involves identifying and extracting event information from
unstructured text. Effective EE in real-world scenarios requires two key steps:
selecting appropriate schemas from hundreds of candidates and executing the
extraction process. Existing research exhibits two critical gaps: (1) the rigid
schema fixation in existing pipeline systems, and (2) the absence of benchmarks
for evaluating joint schema matching and extraction. Although large language
models (LLMs) offer potential solutions, their schema hallucination tendencies
and context window limitations pose challenges for practical deployment. In
response, we propose Adaptive Schema-aware Event Extraction (ASEE), a novel
paradigm combining schema paraphrasing with schema retrieval-augmented
generation. ASEE adeptly retrieves paraphrased schemas and accurately generates
targeted structures. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we construct the
Multi-Dimensional Schema-aware Event Extraction (MD-SEE) benchmark, which
systematically consolidates 12 datasets across diverse domains, complexity
levels, and language settings. Extensive evaluations on MD-SEE show that our
proposed ASEE demonstrates strong adaptability across various scenarios,
significantly improving the accuracy of event extraction.

Abstract: This work introduces the first benchmark for nursing value alignment,
consisting of five core value dimensions distilled from international nursing
codes: Altruism, Human Dignity, Integrity, Justice, and Professionalism. The
benchmark comprises 1,100 real-world nursing behavior instances collected
through a five-month longitudinal field study across three hospitals of varying
tiers. These instances are annotated by five clinical nurses and then augmented
with LLM-generated counterfactuals with reversed ethic polarity. Each original
case is paired with a value-aligned and a value-violating version, resulting in
2,200 labeled instances that constitute the Easy-Level dataset. To increase
adversarial complexity, each instance is further transformed into a
dialogue-based format that embeds contextual cues and subtle misleading
signals, yielding a Hard-Level dataset. We evaluate 23 state-of-the-art (SoTA)
LLMs on their alignment with nursing values. Our findings reveal three key
insights: (1) DeepSeek-V3 achieves the highest performance on the Easy-Level
dataset (94.55), where Claude 3.5 Sonnet outperforms other models on the
Hard-Level dataset (89.43), significantly surpassing the medical LLMs; (2)
Justice is consistently the most difficult nursing value dimension to evaluate;
and (3) in-context learning significantly improves alignment. This work aims to
provide a foundation for value-sensitive LLMs development in clinical settings.

Conclusion: 研究为理解LLM的位置偏差提供了新视角，并提出了检测概率分布不一致性的方法。

Abstract: Can autoregressive large language models (LLMs) learn consistent probability
distributions when trained on sequences in different token orders? We prove
formally that for any well-defined probability distribution, sequence
perplexity is invariant under any factorization, including forward, backward,
or arbitrary permutations. This result establishes a rigorous theoretical
foundation for studying how LLMs learn from data and defines principled
protocols for empirical evaluation. Applying these protocols, we show that
prior studies examining ordering effects suffer from critical methodological
flaws. We retrain GPT-2 models across forward, backward, and arbitrary permuted
orders on scientific text. We find systematic deviations from theoretical
invariance across all orderings with arbitrary permutations strongly deviating
from both forward and backward models, which largely (but not completely)
agreed with one another. Deviations were traceable to differences in
self-attention, reflecting positional and locality biases in processing. Our
theoretical and empirical results provide novel avenues for understanding
positional biases in LLMs and suggest methods for detecting when LLMs'
probability distributions are inconsistent and therefore untrustworthy.

Abstract: Actual causality (AC), a fundamental aspect of causal reasoning (CR), is
responsible for attribution and responsibility assignment in real-world
scenarios. However, existing LLM-based methods lack grounding in formal AC
theory, resulting in limited interpretability. Therefore, we propose AC-Reason,
a semi-formal reasoning framework that identifies causally relevant events
within an AC scenario, infers the values of their formal causal factors (e.g.,
sufficiency, necessity, and normality), and answers AC queries via a
theory-guided algorithm with explanations. While AC-Reason does not explicitly
construct a causal graph, it operates over variables in the underlying causal
structure to support principled reasoning. To enable comprehensive evaluation,
we introduce AC-Bench, a new benchmark built upon and substantially extending
Big-Bench Hard Causal Judgment (BBH-CJ). AC-Bench comprises ~1K carefully
annotated samples, each with detailed reasoning steps and focuses solely on
actual causation. The case study shows that synthesized samples in AC-Bench
present greater challenges for LLMs. Extensive experiments on BBH-CJ and
AC-Bench show that AC-Reason consistently improves LLM performance over
baselines. On BBH-CJ, all tested LLMs surpass the average human rater accuracy
of 69.60%, with GPT-4 + AC-Reason achieving 75.04%. On AC-Bench, GPT-4 +
AC-Reason again achieves the highest accuracy of 71.82%. AC-Bench further
enables fine-grained analysis of reasoning faithfulness, revealing that only
Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and GPT-4o exhibit faithful
reasoning, whereas GPT-4 tends to exploit shortcuts. Finally, our ablation
study proves that integrating AC theory into LLMs is highly effective, with the
proposed algorithm contributing the most significant performance gains.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建多语言多模态模型面临数据稀缺、模态对齐和性能退化等挑战，需创新解决方案。

Method: 开发了合成注释框架和跨模态模型合并技术，以优化数据质量和模型性能。

Result: Aya-Vision-8B和Aya-Vision-32B在性能上超越了更大的模型，如Qwen-2.5-VL-7B和LLaMA-3.2-90B-Vision。

Conclusion: 该研究推动了多语言多模态模型的进展，并提供了高效计算的高性能技术。

Abstract: Building multimodal language models is fundamentally challenging: it requires
aligning vision and language modalities, curating high-quality instruction
data, and avoiding the degradation of existing text-only capabilities once
vision is introduced. These difficulties are further magnified in the
multilingual setting, where the need for multimodal data in different languages
exacerbates existing data scarcity, machine translation often distorts meaning,
and catastrophic forgetting is more pronounced. To address the aforementioned
challenges, we introduce novel techniques spanning both data and modeling.
First, we develop a synthetic annotation framework that curates high-quality,
diverse multilingual multimodal instruction data, enabling Aya Vision models to
produce natural, human-preferred responses to multimodal inputs across many
languages. Complementing this, we propose a cross-modal model merging technique
that mitigates catastrophic forgetting, effectively preserving text-only
capabilities while simultaneously enhancing multimodal generative performance.
Aya-Vision-8B achieves best-in-class performance compared to strong multimodal
models such as Qwen-2.5-VL-7B, Pixtral-12B, and even much larger
Llama-3.2-90B-Vision. We further scale this approach with Aya-Vision-32B, which
outperforms models more than twice its size, such as Molmo-72B and
LLaMA-3.2-90B-Vision. Our work advances multilingual progress on the
multi-modal frontier, and provides insights into techniques that effectively
bend the need for compute while delivering extremely high performance.

TL;DR: MilChat是一种轻量级多模态语言模型，专为分析偏远地区的遥感图像设计，通过专家验证的数据集和强化学习优化，显著优于通用模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型在专业领域（如军事遥感）的适应性和资源效率有限，需要针对性解决方案。

Method: 使用2B参数的开源MLLM进行监督微调，结合链式思维标注和GRPO强化学习，优化军事场景检测能力。

Result: 在MilData基准测试中达到80%召回率和98%精度，优于通用模型和现有遥感方法。

Conclusion: 针对性的微调和强化学习可显著提升专业领域多模态模型性能。

Abstract: Remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating text-image content
have been demonstrated by recent advancements in multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). However, their effectiveness in specialized
domains-particularly those requiring resource-efficient and domain-specific
adaptations-has remained limited. In this work, a lightweight multimodal
language model termed MilChat is introduced, specifically adapted to analyze
remote sensing imagery in secluded areas, including challenging missile launch
sites. A new dataset, MilData, was compiled by verifying hundreds of aerial
images through expert review, and subtle military installations were
highlighted via detailed captions. Supervised fine-tuning on a 2B-parameter
open-source MLLM with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning annotations was
performed, enabling more accurate and interpretable explanations. Additionally,
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) was leveraged to enhance the model's
ability to detect critical domain-specific cues-such as defensive layouts and
key military structures-while minimizing false positives on civilian scenes.
Through empirical evaluations, it has been shown that MilChat significantly
outperforms both larger, general-purpose multimodal models and existing remote
sensing-adapted approaches on open-ended captioning and classification metrics.
Over 80% recall and 98% precision were achieved on the newly proposed MilData
benchmark, underscoring the potency of targeted fine-tuning and reinforcement
learning in specialized real-world applications.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于视觉基础模型的语义异常检测框架，通过比较运行时图像的局部视觉嵌入与安全场景数据库，实现了高性能的异常检测与定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义异常可能导致自主系统推理失败，因此需要一种有效的检测方法。

Method: 提出两种框架变体：基于原始网格嵌入和基于实例分割的对象中心表示，并引入过滤机制减少误报。

Result: 在CARLA模拟异常中，基于实例分割的方法性能接近GPT-4o，并能精确定位异常。

Conclusion: 视觉基础模型的嵌入在自主系统实时异常检测中具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Semantic anomalies are contextually invalid or unusual combinations of
familiar visual elements that can cause undefined behavior and failures in
system-level reasoning for autonomous systems. This work explores semantic
anomaly detection by leveraging the semantic priors of state-of-the-art vision
foundation models, operating directly on the image. We propose a framework that
compares local vision embeddings from runtime images to a database of nominal
scenarios in which the autonomous system is deemed safe and performant. In this
work, we consider two variants of the proposed framework: one using raw
grid-based embeddings, and another leveraging instance segmentation for
object-centric representations. To further improve robustness, we introduce a
simple filtering mechanism to suppress false positives. Our evaluations on
CARLA-simulated anomalies show that the instance-based method with filtering
achieves performance comparable to GPT-4o, while providing precise anomaly
localization. These results highlight the potential utility of vision
embeddings from foundation models for real-time anomaly detection in autonomous
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在结构从运动和SLAM中，特征检测与描述在视角变化等挑战性场景下的鲁棒性仍未解决。现有方法未能有效学习长距离关系中的视觉线索。

Method: 提出RDD方法，利用可变形Transformer的可变形自注意力机制，聚焦关键位置，降低搜索空间复杂度并建模几何不变性。同时，结合Air-to-Ground数据集进行训练。

Result: RDD在稀疏匹配任务中优于所有现有方法，并能进行半稠密匹配。论文还引入了两个新基准测试，验证了方法的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RDD通过全局上下文和几何不变性建模，显著提升了特征检测与描述的性能，为复杂场景下的3D重建提供了新思路。

Abstract: As a core step in structure-from-motion and SLAM, robust feature detection
and description under challenging scenarios such as significant viewpoint
changes remain unresolved despite their ubiquity. While recent works have
identified the importance of local features in modeling geometric
transformations, these methods fail to learn the visual cues present in
long-range relationships. We present Robust Deformable Detector (RDD), a novel
and robust keypoint detector/descriptor leveraging the deformable transformer,
which captures global context and geometric invariance through deformable
self-attention mechanisms. Specifically, we observed that deformable attention
focuses on key locations, effectively reducing the search space complexity and
modeling the geometric invariance. Furthermore, we collected an Air-to-Ground
dataset for training in addition to the standard MegaDepth dataset. Our
proposed method outperforms all state-of-the-art keypoint detection/description
methods in sparse matching tasks and is also capable of semi-dense matching. To
ensure comprehensive evaluation, we introduce two challenging benchmarks: one
emphasizing large viewpoint and scale variations, and the other being an
Air-to-Ground benchmark -- an evaluation setting that has recently gaining
popularity for 3D reconstruction across different altitudes.

Result: 在两个基准测试中，VISTAR显著提升了推理准确性并保持了可解释性。

Conclusion: VISTAR为复杂视觉问题的多步推理提供了高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Answering complex visual questions like `Which red furniture can be used for
sitting?' requires multi-step reasoning, including object recognition,
attribute filtering, and relational understanding. Recent work improves
interpretability in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by decomposing
tasks into sub-task programs, but these methods are computationally expensive
and less accurate due to poor adaptation to target data. To address this, we
introduce VISTAR (Visually Interpretable Subtask-Aware Reasoning Model), a
subtask-driven training framework that enhances both interpretability and
reasoning by generating textual and visual explanations within MLLMs. Instead
of relying on external models, VISTAR fine-tunes MLLMs to produce structured
Subtask-of-Thought rationales (step-by-step reasoning sequences). Experiments
on two benchmarks show that VISTAR consistently improves reasoning accuracy
while maintaining interpretability. Our code and dataset will be available at
https://github.com/ChengJade/VISTAR.

Conclusion: 该方法在常见伤口类型的分类中表现出卓越的准确性，为临床诊断提供了高效工具。

Abstract: The effective diagnosis of acute and hard-to-heal wounds is crucial for wound
care practitioners to provide effective patient care. Poor clinical outcomes
are often linked to infection, peripheral vascular disease, and increasing
wound depth, which collectively exacerbate these comorbidities. However,
diagnostic tools based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) speed up the
interpretation of medical images and improve early detection of disease. In
this article, we propose a multi-modal AI model based on transfer learning
(TL), which combines two state-of-the-art architectures, Xception and GMRNN,
for wound classification. The multi-modal network is developed by concatenating
the features extracted by a transfer learning algorithm and location features
to classify the wound types of diabetic, pressure, surgical, and venous ulcers.
The proposed method is comprehensively compared with deep neural networks (DNN)
for medical image analysis. The experimental results demonstrate a notable
wound-class classifications (containing only diabetic, pressure, surgical, and
venous) vary from 78.77 to 100\% in various experiments. The results presented
in this study showcase the exceptional accuracy of the proposed methodology in
accurately classifying the most commonly occurring wound types using wound
images and their corresponding locations.

Abstract: Point cloud processing has gained significant attention due to its critical
role in applications such as autonomous driving and 3D object recognition.
However, deploying high-performance models like Point Transformer V3 in
resource-constrained environments remains challenging due to their high
computational and memory demands. This work introduces a novel distillation
framework that leverages topology-aware representations and gradient-guided
knowledge distillation to effectively transfer knowledge from a high-capacity
teacher to a lightweight student model. Our approach captures the underlying
geometric structures of point clouds while selectively guiding the student
model's learning process through gradient-based feature alignment. Experimental
results in the Nuscenes, SemanticKITTI, and Waymo datasets demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves competitive performance, with an approximately 16x
reduction in model size and a nearly 1.9x decrease in inference time compared
to its teacher model. Notably, on NuScenes, our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance among knowledge distillation techniques trained
solely on LiDAR data, surpassing prior knowledge distillation baselines in
segmentation performance. Our implementation is available publicly at:

Motivation: 睡眠姿势影响睡眠质量和睡眠障碍（如呼吸暂停）的发生率，但临床环境中缺乏大量标注数据，限制了深度学习模型的应用。

Method: 采用迁移学习，利用预训练的ViTMAE和ViTPose模型，对低分辨率PSM数据进行睡眠姿势分类。

Result: 在112晚患者记录和13名患者的高分辨率数据集上验证，模型表现优于传统方法（TCN、SVM、XGBoost、Random Forest）。

Conclusion: 该方法在临床环境中具有实际应用潜力，尽管低分辨率数据带来挑战。

Abstract: Bed-based pressure-sensitive mats (PSMs) offer a non-intrusive way of
monitoring patients during sleep. We focus on four-way sleep position
classification using data collected from a PSM placed under a mattress in a
sleep clinic. Sleep positions can affect sleep quality and the prevalence of
sleep disorders, such as apnea. Measurements were performed on patients with
suspected sleep disorders referred for assessments at a sleep clinic. Training
deep learning models can be challenging in clinical settings due to the need
for large amounts of labeled data. To overcome the shortage of labeled training
data, we utilize transfer learning to adapt pre-trained deep learning models to
accurately estimate sleep positions from a low-resolution PSM dataset collected
in a polysomnography sleep lab. Our approach leverages Vision Transformer
models pre-trained on ImageNet using masked autoencoding (ViTMAE) and a
pre-trained model for human pose estimation (ViTPose). These approaches
outperform previous work from PSM-based sleep pose classification using deep
learning (TCN) as well as traditional machine learning models (SVM, XGBoost,
Random Forest) that use engineered features. We evaluate the performance of
sleep position classification from 112 nights of patient recordings and
validate it on a higher resolution 13-patient dataset. Despite the challenges
of differentiating between sleep positions from low-resolution PSM data, our
approach shows promise for real-world deployment in clinical settings

Motivation: 目前尚无研究探讨无人机和卫星图像在建筑损害评估中的标签一致性，现有工作因标签模式、建筑位置和数据量的限制而无法提供可靠结论。

Method: 本研究通过使用相同的损害标签模式和建筑位置，对比了三种飓风中的15,814栋建筑，数据量是之前相关研究的19.05倍。

Result: 卫星标签比无人机标签至少低估20.43%的损害（p<1.2x10^-117），且两种标签分布显著不同（p<5.1x10^-175），表明基于其中一种分布的模型会误判实际状况。

Conclusion: 为避免伦理风险和社会危害，本文提出了四项建议，以提高CV/ML损害评估系统的可靠性和透明度。

Abstract: This paper audits damage labels derived from coincident satellite and drone
aerial imagery for 15,814 buildings across Hurricanes Ian, Michael, and Harvey,
finding 29.02% label disagreement and significantly different distributions
between the two sources, which presents risks and potential harms during the
deployment of machine learning damage assessment systems. Currently, there is
no known study of label agreement between drone and satellite imagery for
building damage assessment. The only prior work that could be used to infer if
such imagery-derived labels agree is limited by differing damage label schemas,
misaligned building locations, and low data quantities. This work overcomes
these limitations by comparing damage labels using the same damage label
schemas and building locations from three hurricanes, with the 15,814 buildings
representing 19.05 times more buildings considered than the most relevant prior
work. The analysis finds satellite-derived labels significantly under-report
damage by at least 20.43% compared to drone-derived labels (p<1.2x10^-117), and
satellite- and drone-derived labels represent significantly different
distributions (p<5.1x10^-175). This indicates that computer vision and machine
learning (CV/ML) models trained on at least one of these distributions will
misrepresent actual conditions, as the differing satellite and drone-derived
distributions cannot simultaneously represent the distribution of actual
conditions in a scene. This potential misrepresentation poses ethical risks and
potential societal harm if not managed. To reduce the risk of future societal
harms, this paper offers four recommendations to improve reliability and
transparency to decisio-makers when deploying CV/ML damage assessment systems
in practice

Motivation: 传统多材料分解方法依赖谱CT扫描仪和预测量X射线能谱，限制了临床应用。现有单能CT方法存在两步分解流程的缺陷，导致非线性束硬化伪影和噪声。

Method: 提出JSover框架，联合重建多材料成分并直接从单能CT投影估计能量谱，结合物理先验和隐式神经表示（INR）作为无监督深度学习求解器。

Conclusion: JSover通过一步式框架和物理先验的引入，为单能CT多材料分解提供了更可靠和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-material decomposition (MMD) enables quantitative reconstruction of
tissue compositions in the human body, supporting a wide range of clinical
applications. However, traditional MMD typically requires spectral CT scanners
and pre-measured X-ray energy spectra, significantly limiting clinical
applicability. To this end, various methods have been developed to perform MMD
using conventional (i.e., single-energy, SE) CT systems, commonly referred to
as SEMMD. Despite promising progress, most SEMMD methods follow a two-step
image decomposition pipeline, which first reconstructs monochromatic CT images
using algorithms such as FBP, and then performs decomposition on these images.
The initial reconstruction step, however, neglects the energy-dependent
attenuation of human tissues, introducing severe nonlinear beam hardening
artifacts and noise into the subsequent decomposition. This paper proposes
JSover, a fundamentally reformulated one-step SEMMD framework that jointly
reconstructs multi-material compositions and estimates the energy spectrum
directly from SECT projections. By explicitly incorporating physics-informed
spectral priors into the SEMMD process, JSover accurately simulates a virtual
spectral CT system from SE acquisitions, thereby improving the reliability and
accuracy of decomposition. Furthermore, we introduce implicit neural
representation (INR) as an unsupervised deep learning solver for representing
the underlying material maps. The inductive bias of INR toward continuous image
patterns constrains the solution space and further enhances estimation quality.
Extensive experiments on both simulated and real CT datasets show that JSover
outperforms state-of-the-art SEMMD methods in accuracy and computational
efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模机器人应用（如搜救、智慧城市和采矿）需要快速且可扩展的场景编码，但机器人计算资源有限，现有方法难以满足需求。

Method: SLAG将2D视觉语言模型特征（SAM和CLIP）集成到3D场景中，通过归一化加权平均计算语言嵌入，无需损失函数，并引入向量数据库存储和检索嵌入。

Result: 在16-GPU设置下，SLAG比OpenGaussian快18倍，同时在ScanNet和LERF数据集上保持嵌入质量。

Conclusion: SLAG为资源受限的机器人提供了高效、可扩展的语言增强场景表示解决方案。

Abstract: Language-augmented scene representations hold great promise for large-scale
robotics applications such as search-and-rescue, smart cities, and mining. Many
of these scenarios are time-sensitive, requiring rapid scene encoding while
also being data-intensive, necessitating scalable solutions. Deploying these
representations on robots with limited computational resources further adds to
the challenge. To address this, we introduce SLAG, a multi-GPU framework for
language-augmented Gaussian splatting that enhances the speed and scalability
of embedding large scenes. Our method integrates 2D visual-language model
features into 3D scenes using SAM and CLIP. Unlike prior approaches, SLAG
eliminates the need for a loss function to compute per-Gaussian language
embeddings. Instead, it derives embeddings from 3D Gaussian scene parameters
via a normalized weighted average, enabling highly parallelized scene encoding.
Additionally, we introduce a vector database for efficient embedding storage
and retrieval. Our experiments show that SLAG achieves an 18 times speedup in
embedding computation on a 16-GPU setup compared to OpenGaussian, while
preserving embedding quality on the ScanNet and LERF datasets. For more

Conclusion: AEMOT是一种高效的多对象跟踪算法，适用于动态环境，且代码和数据集将开源。

Abstract: Events cameras are ideal sensors for enabling robots to detect and track
objects in highly dynamic environments due to their low latency output, high
temporal resolution, and high dynamic range. In this paper, we present the
Asynchronous Event Multi-Object Tracking (AEMOT) algorithm for detecting and
tracking multiple objects by processing individual raw events asynchronously.
AEMOT detects salient event blob features by identifying regions of consistent
optical flow using a novel Field of Active Flow Directions built from the
Surface of Active Events. Detected features are tracked as candidate objects
using the recently proposed Asynchronous Event Blob (AEB) tracker in order to
construct small intensity patches of each candidate object. A novel learnt
validation stage promotes or discards candidate objects based on classification
of their intensity patches, with promoted objects having their position,
velocity, size, and orientation estimated at their event rate. We evaluate
AEMOT on a new Bee Swarm Dataset, where it tracks dozens of small bees with
precision and recall performance exceeding that of alternative event-based
detection and tracking algorithms by over 37%. Source code and the labelled
event Bee Swarm Dataset will be open sourced

the disparity in knowledge representation between teacher and student models.
To address these, we propose Multi-Task Optimization for Knowledge Distillation
(MoKD). MoKD tackles two main gradient issues: a) Gradient Conflicts, where
task-specific and distillation gradients are misaligned, and b) Gradient
Dominance, where one objective's gradient dominates, causing imbalance. MoKD
reformulates KD as a multi-objective optimization problem, enabling better
balance between objectives. Additionally, it introduces a subspace learning
framework to project feature representations into a high-dimensional space,
improving knowledge transfer. Our MoKD is demonstrated to outperform existing
methods through extensive experiments on image classification using the
ImageNet-1K dataset and object detection using the COCO dataset, achieving
state-of-the-art performance with greater efficiency. To the best of our
knowledge, MoKD models also achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to
models trained from scratch.

TL;DR: 本文提出TSCNet，一种两阶段因果建模方法，通过多尺度因果干预解决ViT在长尾分类中的性能问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果模型在ViT上性能不佳，因其全局特征表示难以建模细粒度特征与预测的关联，导致尾部类别分类困难。

Method: TSCNet包括分层因果表示学习（HCRL）和反事实对数偏差校准（CLBC）两阶段，分别通过多尺度干预和反事实数据分布优化模型。

Result: 在多个长尾基准测试中，TSCNet显著优于现有方法，有效消除数据不平衡引入的偏差。

Conclusion: TSCNet通过细粒度因果关联建模和反事实优化，提升了ViT在长尾分类中的性能。

Abstract: Causal inference has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate long-tail
classification by handling the biases introduced by class imbalance. However,
along with the change of advanced backbone models from Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) to Visual Transformers (ViT), existing causal models may not
achieve an expected performance gain. This paper investigates the influence of
existing causal models on CNNs and ViT variants, highlighting that ViT's global
feature representation makes it hard for causal methods to model associations
between fine-grained features and predictions, which leads to difficulties in
classifying tail classes with similar visual appearance. To address these
issues, this paper proposes TSCNet, a two-stage causal modeling method to
discover fine-grained causal associations through multi-scale causal
interventions. Specifically, in the hierarchical causal representation learning
stage (HCRL), it decouples the background and objects, applying backdoor
interventions at both the patch and feature level to prevent model from using
class-irrelevant areas to infer labels which enhances fine-grained causal
representation. In the counterfactual logits bias calibration stage (CLBC), it
refines the optimization of model's decision boundary by adaptive constructing
counterfactual balanced data distribution to remove the spurious associations
in the logits caused by data distribution. Extensive experiments conducted on
various long-tail benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed TSCNet can eliminate
multiple biases introduced by data imbalance, which outperforms existing
methods.

Method: 提出DGORNet，结合单目深度信息和位置嵌入模块，并引入光学流差异损失（OFDLoss）利用未标记数据。

Result: 在SCARED数据集上，DGORNet在EPE和RMSE指标上优于现有方法，尤其在遮挡和无纹理区域。

Conclusion: DGORNet有效提升了腹腔镜手术中的视差估计，解决了数据限制和遮挡问题。

Abstract: Occlusion and the scarcity of labeled surgical data are significant
challenges in disparity estimation for stereo laparoscopic images. To address
these issues, this study proposes a Depth Guided Occlusion-Aware Disparity
Refinement Network (DGORNet), which refines disparity maps by leveraging
monocular depth information unaffected by occlusion. A Position Embedding (PE)
module is introduced to provide explicit spatial context, enhancing the
network's ability to localize and refine features. Furthermore, we introduce an
Optical Flow Difference Loss (OFDLoss) for unlabeled data, leveraging temporal
continuity across video frames to improve robustness in dynamic surgical
scenes. Experiments on the SCARED dataset demonstrate that DGORNet outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of End-Point Error (EPE) and Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE), particularly in occlusion and texture-less regions.
Ablation studies confirm the contributions of the Position Embedding and
Optical Flow Difference Loss, highlighting their roles in improving spatial and
temporal consistency. These results underscore DGORNet's effectiveness in
enhancing disparity estimation for laparoscopic surgery, offering a practical
solution to challenges in disparity estimation and data limitations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单图像雨滴去除任务具有挑战性，传统方法依赖检测雨滴区域后进行背景修复，而扩散模型在图像修复领域表现出色。

Method: 采用基于扩散模型的图像修复技术，直接对单图像进行雨滴去除。

Result: 该方法在单图像雨滴去除任务中表现出色，优于传统GAN方法。

Conclusion: 扩散模型为单图像雨滴去除提供了新的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Raindrop removal is a challenging task in image processing. Removing
raindrops while relying solely on a single image further increases the
difficulty of the task. Common approaches include the detection of raindrop
regions in the image, followed by performing a background restoration process
conditioned on those regions. While various methods can be applied for the
detection step, the most common architecture used for background restoration is
the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). Recent advances in the use of
diffusion models have led to state-of-the-art image inpainting techniques. In
this paper, we introduce a novel technique for raindrop removal from a single
image using diffusion-based image inpainting.

Motivation: 现有4D高斯泼溅方法忽略了相邻高斯基元间的冗余性，导致性能不佳。

Method: ADC-GS采用锚点驱动结构，结合分层粗到细管道和率失真优化，减少变形冗余。

Result: 实验显示ADC-GS渲染速度提升300%-800%，存储效率达到最优，且不影响渲染质量。

Conclusion: ADC-GS是一种高效紧凑的动态场景表示方法，优于现有技术。

Abstract: Existing 4D Gaussian Splatting methods rely on per-Gaussian deformation from
a canonical space to target frames, which overlooks redundancy among adjacent
Gaussian primitives and results in suboptimal performance. To address this
limitation, we propose Anchor-Driven Deformable and Compressed Gaussian
Splatting (ADC-GS), a compact and efficient representation for dynamic scene
reconstruction. Specifically, ADC-GS organizes Gaussian primitives into an
anchor-based structure within the canonical space, enhanced by a temporal
significance-based anchor refinement strategy. To reduce deformation
redundancy, ADC-GS introduces a hierarchical coarse-to-fine pipeline that
captures motions at varying granularities. Moreover, a rate-distortion
optimization is adopted to achieve an optimal balance between bitrate
consumption and representation fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that
ADC-GS outperforms the per-Gaussian deformation approaches in rendering speed
by 300%-800% while achieving state-of-the-art storage efficiency without
compromising rendering quality. The code is released at

Conclusion: 开发创新的水印解决方案对保护数字内容所有权至关重要，尤其是在生成式AI时代。

Abstract: As generative artificial intelligence technologies like Stable Diffusion
advance, visual content becomes more vulnerable to misuse, raising concerns
about copyright infringement. Visual watermarks serve as effective protection
mechanisms, asserting ownership and deterring unauthorized use. Traditional
deepfake detection methods often rely on passive techniques that struggle with
sophisticated manipulations. In contrast, diffusion models enhance detection
accuracy by allowing for the effective learning of features, enabling the
embedding of imperceptible and robust watermarks. We analyze the strengths and
challenges of watermark techniques related to diffusion models, focusing on
their robustness and application in watermark generation. By exploring the
integration of advanced diffusion models and watermarking security, we aim to
advance the discourse on preserving watermark robustness against evolving
forgery threats. It emphasizes the critical importance of developing innovative
solutions to protect digital content and ensure the preservation of ownership
rights in the era of generative AI.

Conclusion: Navigation12和HMPNet为海事目标检测提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: In the realm of intelligent maritime navigation, object detection from a
shipborne perspective is paramount. Despite the criticality, the paucity of
maritime-specific data impedes the deployment of sophisticated visual
perception techniques, akin to those utilized in autonomous vehicular systems,
within the maritime context. To bridge this gap, we introduce Navigation12, a

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖多分支架构或复杂预处理，限制了实际应用中的扩展性和泛化能力。

Method: 引入GMSGI层，结合分组像素级卷积、动态多尺度核生成和图关系建模，端到端优化局部和全局特征。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，F1-score达0.83±0.02，Rank-1准确率97.0%-99.1%，EER低至0.5%，参数和计算量大幅减少。

Conclusion: G-MSGINet在性能和效率上显著优于现有方法，适用于实际无接触生物识别场景。

Abstract: This paper presents G-MSGINet, a unified and efficient framework for robust
contactless fingerprint recognition that jointly performs minutiae localization
and identity embedding directly from raw input images. Existing approaches rely
on multi-branch architectures, orientation labels, or complex preprocessing
steps, which limit scalability and generalization across real-world acquisition
scenarios. In contrast, the proposed architecture introduces the GMSGI layer, a
novel computational module that integrates grouped pixel-level involution,
dynamic multi-scale kernel generation, and graph-based relational modelling
into a single processing unit. Stacked GMSGI layers progressively refine both
local minutiae-sensitive features and global topological representations
through end-to-end optimization. The architecture eliminates explicit
orientation supervision and adapts graph connectivity directly from learned
kernel descriptors, thereby capturing meaningful structural relationships among
fingerprint regions without fixed heuristics. Extensive experiments on three
benchmark datasets, namely PolyU, CFPose, and Benchmark 2D/3D, demonstrate that
G-MSGINet consistently achieves minutiae F1-scores in the range of
$0.83\pm0.02$ and Rank-1 identification accuracies between 97.0% and 99.1%,
while maintaining an Equal Error Rate (EER) as low as 0.5%. These results
correspond to improvements of up to 4.8% in F1-score and 1.4% in Rank-1
accuracy when compared to prior methods, using only 0.38 million parameters and
6.63 giga floating-point operations, which represents up to ten times fewer
parameters than competitive baselines. This highlights the scalability and
effectiveness of G-MSGINet in real-world contactless biometric recognition
scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文揭示了当前语义水印的漏洞，提出了一种名为SemanticRegen的三阶段攻击方法，能够有效擦除水印并保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI生成图像的普及，水印技术成为版权保护的重要手段，但其对抗适应性攻击的鲁棒性尚未充分研究。

Method: SemanticRegen通过三个阶段攻击水印：(i) 使用视觉语言模型生成细粒度描述，(ii) 零样本分割提取前景掩码，(iii) 基于LLM引导的扩散模型修复背景。

Result: SemanticRegen成功击败了TreeRing水印，并将其他水印方案的比特准确率降至0.75以下，同时保持高感知质量（mSSIM=0.94）。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前水印技术的不足，呼吁开发更具鲁棒性的水印算法以应对内容保留的再生攻击。

Abstract: As AI-generated imagery becomes ubiquitous, invisible watermarks have emerged
as a primary line of defense for copyright and provenance. The newest
watermarking schemes embed semantic signals - content-aware patterns that are
designed to survive common image manipulations - yet their true robustness
against adaptive adversaries remains under-explored. We expose a previously
unreported vulnerability and introduce SemanticRegen, a three-stage, label-free
attack that erases state-of-the-art semantic and invisible watermarks while
leaving an image's apparent meaning intact. Our pipeline (i) uses a
vision-language model to obtain fine-grained captions, (ii) extracts foreground
masks with zero-shot segmentation, and (iii) inpaints only the background via
an LLM-guided diffusion model, thereby preserving salient objects and style
cues. Evaluated on 1,000 prompts across four watermarking systems - TreeRing,
StegaStamp, StableSig, and DWT/DCT - SemanticRegen is the only method to defeat
the semantic TreeRing watermark (p = 0.10 > 0.05) and reduces bit-accuracy
below 0.75 for the remaining schemes, all while maintaining high perceptual
quality (masked SSIM = 0.94 +/- 0.01). We further introduce masked SSIM (mSSIM)
to quantify fidelity within foreground regions, showing that our attack
achieves up to 12 percent higher mSSIM than prior diffusion-based attackers.
These results highlight an urgent gap between current watermark defenses and
the capabilities of adaptive, semantics-aware adversaries, underscoring the
need for watermarking algorithms that are resilient to content-preserving
regenerative attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统事件相机VFI方法在大运动和复杂场景下高保真图像重建的不足，同时避免显式运动建模的限制。

Method: 提出Event-Frame Hybrid AutoEncoder（HAE）和Spatial-Temporal Cross Attention（STCA）模块，结合两阶段训练策略（预训练HAE后与扩散模型联合优化）。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，PSNR提升最高达1.98dB，推理速度比现有扩散方法快4.24倍。

Conclusion: EventDiff在多样化和挑战性VFI场景中表现出色，为事件相机VFI提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) is a fundamental yet challenging task in
computer vision, particularly under conditions involving large motion,
occlusion, and lighting variation. Recent advancements in event cameras have
opened up new opportunities for addressing these challenges. While existing
event-based VFI methods have succeeded in recovering large and complex motions
by leveraging handcrafted intermediate representations such as optical flow,
these designs often compromise high-fidelity image reconstruction under subtle
motion scenarios due to their reliance on explicit motion modeling. Meanwhile,
diffusion models provide a promising alternative for VFI by reconstructing
frames through a denoising process, eliminating the need for explicit motion
estimation or warping operations. In this work, we propose EventDiff, a unified
and efficient event-based diffusion model framework for VFI. EventDiff features
a novel Event-Frame Hybrid AutoEncoder (HAE) equipped with a lightweight
Spatial-Temporal Cross Attention (STCA) module that effectively fuses dynamic
event streams with static frames. Unlike previous event-based VFI methods,
EventDiff performs interpolation directly in the latent space via a denoising
diffusion process, making it more robust across diverse and challenging VFI
scenarios. Through a two-stage training strategy that first pretrains the HAE
and then jointly optimizes it with the diffusion model, our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple synthetic and real-world event VFI
datasets. The proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art event-based
VFI methods by up to 1.98dB in PSNR on Vimeo90K-Triplet and shows superior
performance in SNU-FILM tasks with multiple difficulty levels. Compared to the
emerging diffusion-based VFI approach, our method achieves up to 5.72dB PSNR
gain on Vimeo90K-Triplet and 4.24X faster inference.

Abstract: Diffusion models, today's leading image generative models, estimate the score
function, i.e. the gradient of the log probability of (perturbed) data samples,
without direct access to the underlying probability distribution. This work
investigates whether the estimated score function can be leveraged to compute
higher-order differentials, namely p-Laplace operators. We show here these
operators can be employed to identify memorized training data. We propose a
numerical p-Laplace approximation based on the learned score functions, showing
its effectiveness in identifying key features of the probability landscape. We
analyze the structured case of Gaussian mixture models, and demonstrate the
results carry-over to image generative models, where memorization
identification based on the p-Laplace operator is performed for the first time.

Conclusion: FSNCD框架通过结合少量样本知识，显著提升了模型在开放集场景下的适应性和性能。

Abstract: The recently proposed Novel Category Discovery (NCD) adapt paradigm of
transductive learning hinders its application in more real-world scenarios. In
fact, few labeled data in part of new categories can well alleviate this
burden, which coincides with the ease that people can label few of new category
data. Therefore, this paper presents a new setting in which a trained agent is
able to flexibly switch between the tasks of identifying examples of known
(labelled) classes and clustering novel (completely unlabeled) classes as the
number of query examples increases by leveraging knowledge learned from only a
few (handful) support examples. Drawing inspiration from the discovery of novel
categories using prior-based clustering algorithms, we introduce a novel
framework that further relaxes its assumptions to the real-world open set level
by unifying the concept of model adaptability in few-shot learning. We refer to
this setting as Few-Shot Novel Category Discovery (FSNCD) and propose
Semi-supervised Hierarchical Clustering (SHC) and Uncertainty-aware K-means
Clustering (UKC) to examine the model's reasoning capabilities. Extensive
experiments and detailed analysis on five commonly used datasets demonstrate
that our methods can achieve leading performance levels across different task
settings and scenarios.

Abstract: Message-passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) and structural features (SFs)

overlooked in the MPNN community. For the first time, we equip MPNNs with
vision structural awareness by proposing an effective framework called Graph

empirical results demonstrate that with the proposed frameworks, GVN
consistently benefits from the vision enhancement across seven link prediction

compatible with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and GVNs achieve new
SOTA results, thereby underscoring a promising novel direction for link

Abstract: We introduce IrrMap, the first large-scale dataset (1.1 million patches) for
irrigation method mapping across regions. IrrMap consists of multi-resolution
satellite imagery from LandSat and Sentinel, along with key auxiliary data such
as crop type, land use, and vegetation indices. The dataset spans 1,687,899
farms and 14,117,330 acres across multiple western U.S. states from 2013 to
2023, providing a rich and diverse foundation for irrigation analysis and
ensuring geospatial alignment and quality control. The dataset is ML-ready,
with standardized 224x224 GeoTIFF patches, the multiple input modalities,
carefully chosen train-test-split data, and accompanying dataloaders for
seamless deep learning model training andbenchmarking in irrigation mapping.
The dataset is also accompanied by a complete pipeline for dataset generation,
enabling researchers to extend IrrMap to new regions for irrigation data
collection or adapt it with minimal effort for other similar applications in
agricultural and geospatial analysis. We also analyze the irrigation method
distribution across crop groups, spatial irrigation patterns (using Shannon
diversity indices), and irrigated area variations for both LandSat and
Sentinel, providing insights into regional and resolution-based differences. To
promote further exploration, we openly release IrrMap, along with the derived
datasets, benchmark models, and pipeline code, through a GitHub repository:

TL;DR: ResULIC提出了一种基于残差引导的超低码率图像压缩方法，通过语义残差编码和压缩感知扩散模型提升重建质量和编码效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在语义检索、潜在压缩和生成模型上的碎片化集成导致重建保真度和编码效率不佳。

Method: 引入语义残差编码（SRC）捕捉原始图像与压缩表示的语义差异，并应用感知保真优化器；提出压缩感知扩散模型（CDM）优化比特率与扩散时间步的匹配。

Result: 实验表明ResULIC在LPIPS和FID指标上分别节省80.7%和66.3%的BD-rate，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ResULIC通过残差信号和扩散模型的协同优化，显著提升了超低码率图像压缩的性能。

Abstract: Existing multimodal large model-based image compression frameworks often rely
on a fragmented integration of semantic retrieval, latent compression, and
generative models, resulting in suboptimal performance in both reconstruction
fidelity and coding efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a
residual-guided ultra lowrate image compression named ResULIC, which
incorporates residual signals into both semantic retrieval and the
diffusion-based generation process. Specifically, we introduce Semantic
Residual Coding (SRC) to capture the semantic disparity between the original
image and its compressed latent representation. A perceptual fidelity optimizer
is further applied for superior reconstruction quality. Additionally, we
present the Compression-aware Diffusion Model (CDM), which establishes an
optimal alignment between bitrates and diffusion time steps, improving
compression-reconstruction synergy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of ResULIC, achieving superior objective and subjective
performance compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods with - 80.7%,
-66.3% BD-rate saving in terms of LPIPS and FID. Project page is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文通过机器学习定量分析日本浮世绘的创造力，发现整体创造力随文化成熟下降，但风格创造力保持高水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统艺术研究依赖主观判断，机器学习为东方绘画（如浮世绘）提供定量分析新视角。

Method: 使用11,000张高分辨率浮世绘图像，基于网络计算创造力，分析作品和艺术家的创造力。

Result: 整体创造力随文化成熟下降，但风格创造力因文化细分保持高水平。

Conclusion: 研究为浮世绘和东方艺术分析提供新见解，揭示其在文化历史中的演变与意义。

Abstract: Artwork research has long relied on human sensibility and subjective
judgment, but recent developments in machine learning have enabled the
quantitative assessment of features that humans could not discover. In Western
paintings, comprehensive analyses have been conducted from various perspectives
in conjunction with large databases, but such extensive analysis has not been
sufficiently conducted for Eastern paintings. Then, we focus on Ukiyo-e, a
traditional Japanese art form, as a case study of Eastern paintings, and
conduct a quantitative analysis of creativity in works of art using 11,000
high-resolution images. This involves using the concept of calculating
creativity from networks to analyze both the creativity of the artwork and that
of the artists. As a result, In terms of Ukiyo-e as a whole, it was found that
the creativity of its appearance has declined with the maturation of culture,
but in terms of style, it has become more segmented with the maturation of
culture and has maintained a high level of creativity. This not only provides
new insights into the study of Ukiyo-e but also shows how Ukiyo-e has evolved
within the ongoing cultural history, playing a culturally significant role in
the analysis of Eastern art.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FauForensics的新框架，通过引入生物不变的面部动作单元（FAUs）来检测多模态深度伪造内容，解决了现有方法在处理异质模态特征和跨数据集泛化能力不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI的快速发展导致音频-视觉深度伪造威胁加剧，现有方法主要针对单模态伪造，难以应对多模态伪造的挑战。

Method: 提出FauForensics框架，利用生物不变的面部动作单元（FAUs）作为伪造抗性表征，并通过专用的融合模块计算细粒度帧级视听相似性。

Result: 在FakeAVCeleb和LAV-DF数据集上实现了最先进的性能，跨数据集泛化能力平均提升4.83%。

Conclusion: FauForensics框架在多模态深度伪造检测中表现出色，尤其在跨数据集泛化能力上优于现有方法。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of generative AI has increased the threat of realistic
audio-visual deepfakes, demanding robust detection methods. Existing solutions
primarily address unimodal (audio or visual) forgeries but struggle with
multimodal manipulations due to inadequate handling of heterogeneous modality
features and poor generalization across datasets. To this end, we propose a
novel framework called FauForensics by introducing biologically invariant
facial action units (FAUs), which is a quantitative descriptor of facial muscle
activity linked to emotion physiology. It serves as forgery-resistant
representations that reduce domain dependency while capturing subtle dynamics
often disrupted in synthetic content. Besides, instead of comparing entire
video clips as in prior works, our method computes fine-grained frame-wise
audiovisual similarities via a dedicated fusion module augmented with learnable
cross-modal queries. It dynamically aligns temporal-spatial lip-audio
relationships while mitigating multi-modal feature heterogeneity issues.
Experiments on FakeAVCeleb and LAV-DF show state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance
and superior cross-dataset generalizability with up to an average of 4.83\%
than existing methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Swin-Transformer的知识驱动灌溉映射方法（KIIM），通过多模态信息融合和迁移学习，显著提升了灌溉分类的精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于光谱特征的卫星图像模型在复杂农业景观和有限训练数据下效果不佳，亟需更高效的灌溉映射方法。

Method: KIIM结合了作物到灌溉概率的投影矩阵、空间注意力图、双向交叉注意力和加权集成，并采用两阶段迁移学习。

Result: 在五个美国州的实验中，KIIM比基线提升22.9%（IoU），滴灌分类提升71.4%；迁移学习在数据有限州提升51% IoU。

Conclusion: KIIM显著减少对大量标注数据的依赖，仅需40%训练数据即可达到基线性能，为大规模自动化灌溉映射提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Accurate mapping of irrigation methods is crucial for sustainable
agricultural practices and food systems. However, existing models that rely
solely on spectral features from satellite imagery are ineffective due to the
complexity of agricultural landscapes and limited training data, making this a
challenging problem. We present Knowledge-Informed Irrigation Mapping (KIIM), a
novel Swin-Transformer based approach that uses (i) a specialized projection
matrix to encode crop to irrigation probability, (ii) a spatial attention map
to identify agricultural lands from non-agricultural lands, (iii)
bi-directional cross-attention to focus complementary information from
different modalities, and (iv) a weighted ensemble for combining predictions
from images and crop information. Our experimentation on five states in the US
shows up to 22.9\% (IoU) improvement over baseline with a 71.4% (IoU)
improvement for hard-to-classify drip irrigation. In addition, we propose a
two-phase transfer learning approach to enhance cross-state irrigation mapping,
achieving a 51% IoU boost in a state with limited labeled data. The ability to
achieve baseline performance with only 40% of the training data highlights its
efficiency, reducing the dependency on extensive manual labeling efforts and
making large-scale, automated irrigation mapping more feasible and
cost-effective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非凸正则化逆问题因其复杂的优化空间和多局部极小值而难以解决，但其能提供高质量的任务导向解，尤其在医学影像中需要增强临床相关特征。

Method: incDG框架结合深度学习与增量模型优化，利用深度神经网络生成有效初始化，再通过正则化增量迭代优化重建。

Result: 在TpV正则化任务中，incDG在医学图像去模糊和断层重建中表现优于传统迭代方法和深度学习方法，且无需真实数据训练仍保持高性能。

Conclusion: incDG是一种高效、稳健的工具，适用于解决成像及其他领域的非凸逆问题。

Abstract: Solving non-convex regularized inverse problems is challenging due to their
complex optimization landscapes and multiple local minima. However, these
models remain widely studied as they often yield high-quality, task-oriented
solutions, particularly in medical imaging, where the goal is to enhance
clinically relevant features rather than merely minimizing global error. We
propose incDG, a hybrid framework that integrates deep learning with
incremental model-based optimization to efficiently approximate the
$\ell_0$-optimal solution of imaging inverse problems. Built on the Deep Guess
strategy, incDG exploits a deep neural network to generate effective
initializations for a non-convex variational solver, which refines the
reconstruction through regularized incremental iterations. This design combines
the efficiency of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools with the theoretical
guarantees of model-based optimization, ensuring robustness and stability. We
validate incDG on TpV-regularized optimization tasks, demonstrating its
effectiveness in medical image deblurring and tomographic reconstruction across
diverse datasets, including synthetic images, brain CT slices, and
chest-abdomen scans. Results show that incDG outperforms both conventional
iterative solvers and deep learning-based methods, achieving superior accuracy
and stability. Moreover, we confirm that training incDG without ground truth
does not significantly degrade performance, making it a practical and powerful
tool for solving non-convex inverse problems in imaging and beyond.

*Xue Cui,Vincent Gbouna Zakka,Minhyun Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于低分辨率热成像和计算机视觉技术的占用检测模型，解决了传统RGB图像带来的隐私问题，同时降低了计算资源需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HVAC系统基于固定时间表运行，不考虑实际占用情况，而基于RGB图像的占用检测方法存在隐私问题。

Method: 采用低分辨率热成像结合计算机视觉技术，通过迁移学习微调YOLOv5模型。

Result: 模型性能优异，精确度、召回率和mAP50值接近1.000。

Conclusion: 该模型不仅缓解了隐私问题，还减少了计算资源需求，为HVAC系统的智能控制提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Occupancy plays an essential role in influencing the energy consumption and
operation of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems.
Traditional HVAC typically operate on fixed schedules without considering
occupancy. Advanced occupant-centric control (OCC) adopted occupancy status in
regulating HVAC operations. RGB images combined with computer vision (CV)
techniques are widely used for occupancy detection, however, the detailed
facial and body features they capture raise significant privacy concerns.
Low-resolution thermal images offer a non-invasive solution that mitigates
privacy issues. The study developed an occupancy detection model utilizing
low-resolution thermal images and CV techniques, where transfer learning was
applied to fine-tune the You Only Look Once version 5 (YOLOv5) model. The
developed model ultimately achieved satisfactory performance, with precision,
recall, mAP50, and mAP50 values approaching 1.000. The contributions of this
model lie not only in mitigating privacy concerns but also in reducing
computing resource demands.

*Ruixiao Shi,Fu Feng,Yucheng Xie,Jing Wang,Xin Geng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种频率感知框架FAD，通过建模和调制频谱成分，提升跨域小样本学习的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅关注空间域，忽略了频率域的变化对跨域泛化的重要性。

Method: FAD框架将特征转换到频率域，分为低、中、高频带，并针对每个频带设计卷积分支进行适配。

Result: 在Meta-Dataset基准测试中，FAD显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 频率域表示和分频带适配能有效提升跨域小样本学习的性能。

Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot learning (CD-FSL) requires models to generalize from
limited labeled samples under significant distribution shifts. While recent
methods enhance adaptability through lightweight task-specific modules, they
operate solely in the spatial domain and overlook frequency-specific variations
that are often critical for robust transfer. We observe that spatially similar
images across domains can differ substantially in their spectral
representations, with low and high frequencies capturing complementary semantic
information at coarse and fine levels. This indicates that uniform spatial
adaptation may overlook these spectral distinctions, thus constraining
generalization. To address this, we introduce Frequency Adaptation and
Diversion (FAD), a frequency-aware framework that explicitly models and
modulates spectral components. At its core is the Frequency Diversion Adapter,
which transforms intermediate features into the frequency domain using the
discrete Fourier transform (DFT), partitions them into low, mid, and
high-frequency bands via radial masks, and reconstructs each band using inverse
DFT (IDFT). Each frequency band is then adapted using a dedicated convolutional
branch with a kernel size tailored to its spectral scale, enabling targeted and
disentangled adaptation across frequencies. Extensive experiments on the
Meta-Dataset benchmark demonstrate that FAD consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on both seen and unseen domains, validating the
utility of frequency-domain representations and band-wise adaptation for
improving generalization in CD-FSL.

TL;DR: StoryAnchors是一个统一框架，用于生成高质量、多场景且具有强时间一致性的故事帧。它通过双向故事生成器和特定条件提升生成质量，支持可编辑和扩展的故事帧生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多场景故事帧生成中的时间一致性和叙事连贯性问题，同时提升场景多样性和叙事丰富性。

Method: 采用双向故事生成器整合过去和未来上下文，引入Multi-Event Story Frame Labeling和Progressive Story Frame Training方法。

Result: 在一致性、叙事连贯性和场景多样性方面优于现有开源模型，叙事一致性和故事丰富性与GPT-4o相当。

Conclusion: StoryAnchors为故事驱动帧生成提供了可扩展、灵活且高度可编辑的基础，推动了该领域的研究边界。

Abstract: This paper introduces StoryAnchors, a unified framework for generating
high-quality, multi-scene story frames with strong temporal consistency. The
framework employs a bidirectional story generator that integrates both past and
future contexts to ensure temporal consistency, character continuity, and
smooth scene transitions throughout the narrative. Specific conditions are
introduced to distinguish story frame generation from standard video synthesis,
facilitating greater scene diversity and enhancing narrative richness. To
further improve generation quality, StoryAnchors integrates Multi-Event Story
Frame Labeling and Progressive Story Frame Training, enabling the model to
capture both overarching narrative flow and event-level dynamics. This approach
supports the creation of editable and expandable story frames, allowing for
manual modifications and the generation of longer, more complex sequences.
Extensive experiments show that StoryAnchors outperforms existing open-source
models in key areas such as consistency, narrative coherence, and scene
diversity. Its performance in narrative consistency and story richness is also
on par with GPT-4o. Ultimately, StoryAnchors pushes the boundaries of
story-driven frame generation, offering a scalable, flexible, and highly
editable foundation for future research.

TL;DR: DArFace提出了一种变形感知的鲁棒人脸识别框架，通过对抗性训练模拟真实低质量图像条件，提升模型在低质量数据上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在低质量人脸图像（如低分辨率、运动模糊）上表现不佳，主要因为忽略了局部非刚性变形。

Method: DArFace通过对抗性训练结合全局变换和局部弹性变形，并引入对比目标保持身份一致性。

Result: 在TinyFace、IJB-B和IJB-C等低质量基准测试中，DArFace显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 局部变形建模是提升低质量人脸识别性能的关键。

Abstract: Facial recognition systems have achieved remarkable success by leveraging
deep neural networks, advanced loss functions, and large-scale datasets.
However, their performance often deteriorates in real-world scenarios involving
low-quality facial images. Such degradations, common in surveillance footage or
standoff imaging include low resolution, motion blur, and various distortions,
resulting in a substantial domain gap from the high-quality data typically used
during training. While existing approaches attempt to address robustness by
modifying network architectures or modeling global spatial transformations,
they frequently overlook local, non-rigid deformations that are inherently
present in real-world settings. In this work, we introduce DArFace, a
Deformation-Aware robust Face recognition framework that enhances robustness to
such degradations without requiring paired high- and low-quality training
samples. Our method adversarially integrates both global transformations (e.g.,
rotation, translation) and local elastic deformations during training to
simulate realistic low-quality conditions. Moreover, we introduce a contrastive
objective to enforce identity consistency across different deformed views.
Extensive evaluations on low-quality benchmarks including TinyFace, IJB-B, and
IJB-C demonstrate that DArFace surpasses state-of-the-art methods, with
significant gains attributed to the inclusion of local deformation modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无约束环境中视线估计的挑战，包括低分辨率图像和现有方法对头眼交互建模不足的问题。

Method: 采用双分支卷积主干处理眼部和多尺度超分辨率头部图像，并引入双头眼交叉注意力模块进行特征优化。

Result: 在Gaze360和GFIE数据集上，静态和时序配置下的角度误差显著降低，跨数据集测试也表现优异。

Conclusion: DHECA-SuperGaze在视线估计任务中表现出卓越的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Unconstrained gaze estimation is the process of determining where a subject
is directing their visual attention in uncontrolled environments. Gaze
estimation systems are important for a myriad of tasks such as driver
distraction monitoring, exam proctoring, accessibility features in modern
software, etc. However, these systems face challenges in real-world scenarios,
partially due to the low resolution of in-the-wild images and partially due to
insufficient modeling of head-eye interactions in current state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods. This paper introduces DHECA-SuperGaze, a deep learning-based
method that advances gaze prediction through super-resolution (SR) and a dual
head-eye cross-attention (DHECA) module. Our dual-branch convolutional backbone
processes eye and multiscale SR head images, while the proposed DHECA module
enables bidirectional feature refinement between the extracted visual features
through cross-attention mechanisms. Furthermore, we identified critical
annotation errors in one of the most diverse and widely used gaze estimation
datasets, Gaze360, and rectified the mislabeled data. Performance evaluation on
Gaze360 and GFIE datasets demonstrates superior within-dataset performance of
the proposed method, reducing angular error (AE) by 0.48{\deg} (Gaze360) and
2.95{\deg} (GFIE) in static configurations, and 0.59{\deg} (Gaze360) and
3.00{\deg} (GFIE) in temporal settings compared to prior SOTA methods.
Cross-dataset testing shows improvements in AE of more than 1.53{\deg}
(Gaze360) and 3.99{\deg} (GFIE) in both static and temporal settings,
validating the robust generalization properties of our approach.

Conclusion: 需多样化数据集、改进评估指标及关注伦理问题，视觉图像重建在神经科学和临床应用中潜力巨大。

Abstract: Visual image reconstruction, the decoding of perceptual content from brain
activity into images, has advanced significantly with the integration of deep
neural networks (DNNs) and generative models. This review traces the field's
evolution from early classification approaches to sophisticated reconstructions
that capture detailed, subjective visual experiences, emphasizing the roles of
hierarchical latent representations, compositional strategies, and modular
architectures. Despite notable progress, challenges remain, such as achieving
true zero-shot generalization for unseen images and accurately modeling the
complex, subjective aspects of perception. We discuss the need for diverse
datasets, refined evaluation metrics aligned with human perceptual judgments,
and compositional representations that strengthen model robustness and
generalizability. Ethical issues, including privacy, consent, and potential
misuse, are underscored as critical considerations for responsible development.
Visual image reconstruction offers promising insights into neural coding and
enables new psychological measurements of visual experiences, with applications
spanning clinical diagnostics and brain-machine interfaces.

Conclusion: TT-DF数据集和TOF-Net模型为人体伪造检测提供了新的资源和工具，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: The emergence and popularity of facial deepfake methods spur the vigorous
development of deepfake datasets and facial forgery detection, which to some
extent alleviates the security concerns about facial-related artificial
intelligence technologies. However, when it comes to human body forgery, there
has been a persistent lack of datasets and detection methods, due to the later
inception and complexity of human body generation methods. To mitigate this
issue, we introduce TikTok-DeepFake (TT-DF), a novel large-scale
diffusion-based dataset containing 6,120 forged videos with 1,378,857 synthetic
frames, specifically tailored for body forgery detection. TT-DF offers a wide
variety of forgery methods, involving multiple advanced human image animation
models utilized for manipulation, two generative configurations based on the
disentanglement of identity and pose information, as well as different
compressed versions. The aim is to simulate any potential unseen forged data in
the wild as comprehensively as possible, and we also furnish a benchmark on
TT-DF. Additionally, we propose an adapted body forgery detection model,
Temporal Optical Flow Network (TOF-Net), which exploits the spatiotemporal
inconsistencies and optical flow distribution differences between natural data
and forged data. Our experiments demonstrate that TOF-Net achieves favorable
performance on TT-DF, outperforming current state-of-the-art extendable facial
forgery detection models. For our TT-DF dataset, please refer to

Motivation: 事件相机因其异步捕捉亮度变化的能力，在3D重建中表现出色，尤其在极端环境下。本文旨在填补该领域综述的空白。

Method: 将现有工作按输入模态（立体、单目、多模态）和重建方法（几何、深度学习、神经渲染）分类，并整理相关数据集。

Result: 总结了当前研究的局限性，如数据可用性、动态场景处理等，并提出了未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 本文为事件驱动的3D重建提供了全面参考，并为未来发展指明了方向。

Abstract: Event cameras have emerged as promising sensors for 3D reconstruction due to
their ability to capture per-pixel brightness changes asynchronously. Unlike
conventional frame-based cameras, they produce sparse and temporally rich data
streams, which enable more accurate 3D reconstruction and open up the
possibility of performing reconstruction in extreme environments such as
high-speed motion, low light, or high dynamic range scenes. In this survey, we
provide the first comprehensive review focused exclusively on 3D reconstruction
using event cameras. The survey categorises existing works into three major
types based on input modality - stereo, monocular, and multimodal systems, and
further classifies them by reconstruction approach, including geometry-based,
deep learning-based, and recent neural rendering techniques such as Neural
Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting. Methods with a similar research
focus were organised chronologically into the most subdivided groups. We also
summarise public datasets relevant to event-based 3D reconstruction. Finally,
we highlight current research limitations in data availability, evaluation,
representation, and dynamic scene handling, and outline promising future
research directions. This survey aims to serve as a comprehensive reference and
a roadmap for future developments in event-driven 3D reconstruction.

Method: 通过创建VCRBench基准测试，并设计模块化方法RRD（将任务分解为视频识别和因果推理）。

Result: 实验显示LVLMs在VCRBench上表现不佳，但RRD方法显著提升了性能（最高提升25.2%）。

Conclusion: LVLMs在视频因果推理中依赖语言知识，RRD方法为提升此类任务性能提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in video understanding, the capabilities of Large
Video Language Models (LVLMs) to perform video-based causal reasoning remains
underexplored, largely due to the absence of relevant and dedicated benchmarks
for evaluating causal reasoning in visually grounded and goal-driven settings.
To fill this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark named Video-based long-form
Causal Reasoning (VCRBench). We create VCRBench using procedural videos of
simple everyday activities, where the steps are deliberately shuffled with each
clip capturing a key causal event, to test whether LVLMs can identify, reason
about, and correctly sequence the events needed to accomplish a specific goal.
Moreover, the benchmark is carefully designed to prevent LVLMs from exploiting
linguistic shortcuts, as seen in multiple-choice or binary QA formats, while
also avoiding the challenges associated with evaluating open-ended QA. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art LVLMs on VCRBench suggests that these models
struggle with video-based long-form causal reasoning, primarily due to their
difficulty in modeling long-range causal dependencies directly from visual
observations. As a simple step toward enabling such capabilities, we propose
Recognition-Reasoning Decomposition (RRD), a modular approach that breaks
video-based causal reasoning into two sub-tasks of video recognition and causal
reasoning. Our experiments on VCRBench show that RRD significantly boosts
accuracy on VCRBench, with gains of up to 25.2%. Finally, our thorough analysis
reveals interesting insights, for instance, that LVLMs primarily rely on
language knowledge for complex video-based long-form causal reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（如AIS）依赖主观评估且与临床结果相关性弱，限制了吸入性损伤的诊断和分级。

Method: 提出增强的StarGAN，结合Patch Loss和SSIM Loss生成高质量合成图像，并用Swin Transformer评估分类性能。

Result: 增强StarGAN生成的图像显著提升了分类准确率（77.78%，提升11.11%），FID得分最低（30.06），且生成的图像被烧伤外科医生认可。

Conclusion: 增强StarGAN能有效解决医学影像数据稀缺问题，提升吸入性损伤分级的准确性。

Abstract: Inhalation injuries face a challenge in clinical diagnosis and grading due to
the limitations of traditional methods, such as Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS),
which rely on subjective assessments and show weak correlations with clinical
outcomes. This study introduces a novel deep learning-based framework for
grading inhalation injuries using bronchoscopy images with the duration of
mechanical ventilation as an objective metric. To address the scarcity of
medical imaging data, we propose enhanced StarGAN, a generative model that
integrates Patch Loss and SSIM Loss to improve synthetic images' quality and
clinical relevance. The augmented dataset generated by enhanced StarGAN
significantly improved classification performance when evaluated using the Swin
Transformer, achieving an accuracy of 77.78%, an 11.11% improvement over the
original dataset. Image quality was assessed using the Fr\'echet Inception
Distance (FID), where Enhanced StarGAN achieved the lowest FID of 30.06,
outperforming baseline models. Burn surgeons confirmed the realism and clinical
relevance of the generated images, particularly the preservation of bronchial
structures and color distribution. These results highlight the potential of
enhanced StarGAN in addressing data limitations and improving classification
accuracy for inhalation injury grading.

Conclusion: AGLR-CL为WSI分类中的域增量持续学习提供了一种高效且隐私保护的方法。

Abstract: Whole slide image (WSI) classification has emerged as a powerful tool in
computational pathology, but remains constrained by domain shifts, e.g., due to
different organs, diseases, or institution-specific variations. To address this
challenge, we propose an Attention-based Generative Latent Replay Continual
Learning framework (AGLR-CL), in a multiple instance learning (MIL) setup for
domain incremental WSI classification. Our method employs Gaussian Mixture
Models (GMMs) to synthesize WSI representations and patch count distributions,
preserving knowledge of past domains without explicitly storing original data.
A novel attention-based filtering step focuses on the most salient patch
embeddings, ensuring high-quality synthetic samples. This privacy-aware
strategy obviates the need for replay buffers and outperforms other buffer-free
counterparts while matching the performance of buffer-based solutions. We
validate AGLR-CL on clinically relevant biomarker detection and molecular
status prediction across multiple public datasets with diverse centers, organs,
and patient cohorts. Experimental results confirm its ability to retain prior
knowledge and adapt to new domains, offering an effective, privacy-preserving
avenue for domain incremental continual learning in WSI classification.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个数据集和骨干网络上提升了分割精度和拓扑一致性。

Conclusion: 动态蛇形上采样和边界-骨架加权损失有效解决了管状结构分割中的挑战。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of tubular topological structures (e.g., fissures and
vasculature) is critical in various fields to guarantee dependable downstream
quantitative analysis and modeling. However, in dense prediction tasks such as
semantic segmentation and super-resolution, conventional upsampling operators
cannot accommodate the slenderness of tubular structures and the curvature of
morphology. This paper introduces a dynamic snake upsampling operators and a
boundary-skeleton weighted loss tailored for topological tubular structures.
Specifically, we design a snake upsampling operators based on an adaptive
sampling domain, which dynamically adjusts the sampling stride according to the
feature map and selects a set of subpixel sampling points along the serpentine
path, enabling more accurate subpixel-level feature recovery for tubular
structures. Meanwhile, we propose a skeleton-to-boundary increasing weighted
loss that trades off main body and boundary weight allocation based on mask
class ratio and distance field, preserving main body overlap while enhancing
focus on target topological continuity and boundary alignment precision.
Experiments across various domain datasets and backbone networks show that this
plug-and-play dynamic snake upsampling operator and boundary-skeleton weighted
loss boost both pixel-wise segmentation accuracy and topological consistency of
results.

Result: 在3D和2D数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于传统方法。

Conclusion: DFG方法通过自动化边界框提示搜索和后处理，显著提升了SFDA分割任务的性能。

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) for segmentation aims at adapting a
model trained in the source domain to perform well in the target domain with
only the source model and unlabeled target data.Inspired by the recent success
of Segment Anything Model (SAM) which exhibits the generality of segmenting
images of various modalities and in different domains given human-annotated
prompts like bounding boxes or points, we for the first time explore the
potentials of Segment Anything Model for SFDA via automatedly finding an
accurate bounding box prompt. We find that the bounding boxes directly
generated with existing SFDA approaches are defective due to the domain gap.To
tackle this issue, we propose a novel Dual Feature Guided (DFG) auto-prompting
approach to search for the box prompt. Specifically, the source model is first
trained in a feature aggregation phase, which not only preliminarily adapts the
source model to the target domain but also builds a feature distribution
well-prepared for box prompt search. In the second phase, based on two feature
distribution observations, we gradually expand the box prompt with the guidance
of the target model feature and the SAM feature to handle the class-wise
clustered target features and the class-wise dispersed target features,
respectively. To remove the potentially enlarged false positive regions caused
by the over-confident prediction of the target model, the refined pseudo-labels
produced by SAM are further postprocessed based on connectivity analysis.
Experiments on 3D and 2D datasets indicate that our approach yields superior
performance compared to conventional methods. Code is available at

Abstract: Recent proliferation of generative AI tools for visual content
creation-particularly in the context of visual artworks-has raised serious
concerns about copyright infringement and forgery. The large-scale datasets
used to train these models often contain a mixture of copyrighted and
non-copyrighted artworks. Given the tendency of generative models to memorize
training patterns, they are susceptible to varying degrees of copyright
violation. Building on the recently proposed DeepfakeArt Challenge benchmark,
this work introduces DFA-CON, a contrastive learning framework designed to
detect copyright-infringing or forged AI-generated art. DFA-CON learns a
discriminative representation space, posing affinity among original artworks
and their forged counterparts within a contrastive learning framework. The
model is trained across multiple attack types, including inpainting, style
transfer, adversarial perturbation, and cutmix. Evaluation results demonstrate
robust detection performance across most attack types, outperforming recent
pretrained foundation models. Code and model checkpoints will be released
publicly upon acceptance.

Conclusion: TATS是一种通用且高效的视频建模掩码策略，显著提升了预训练和下游任务的性能。

Abstract: Masked video modeling~(MVM) has emerged as a highly effective pre-training
strategy for visual foundation models, whereby the model reconstructs masked
spatiotemporal tokens using information from visible tokens. However, a key
challenge in such approaches lies in selecting an appropriate masking strategy.
Previous studies have explored predefined masking techniques, including random
and tube-based masking, as well as approaches that leverage key motion priors,
optical flow and semantic cues from externally pre-trained models. In this
work, we introduce a novel and generalizable Trajectory-Aware Adaptive Token
Sampler (TATS), which models the motion dynamics of tokens and can be
seamlessly integrated into the masked autoencoder (MAE) framework to select
motion-centric tokens in videos. Additionally, we propose a unified training
strategy that enables joint optimization of both MAE and TATS from scratch
using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). We show that our model allows for
aggressive masking without compromising performance on the downstream task of
action recognition while also ensuring that the pre-training remains memory
efficient. Extensive experiments of the proposed approach across four
benchmarks, including Something-Something v2, Kinetics-400, UCF101, and HMDB51,
demonstrate the effectiveness, transferability, generalization, and efficiency
of our work compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Rapid advances in deep learning for computer vision have driven the adoption
of RGB camera-based adaptive traffic light systems to improve traffic safety
and pedestrian comfort. However, these systems often overlook the needs of
people with mobility restrictions. Moreover, the use of RGB cameras presents
significant challenges, including limited detection performance under adverse
weather or low-visibility conditions, as well as heightened privacy concerns.
To address these issues, we propose a fully automated, thermal detector-based
traffic light system that dynamically adjusts signal durations for individuals
with walking impairments or mobility burden and triggers the auditory signal
for visually impaired individuals, thereby advancing towards barrier-free
intersection for all users. To this end, we build the thermal dataset for
people with mobility restrictions (TD4PWMR), designed to capture diverse
pedestrian scenarios, particularly focusing on individuals with mobility aids
or mobility burden under varying environmental conditions, such as different
lighting, weather, and crowded urban settings. While thermal imaging offers
advantages in terms of privacy and robustness to adverse conditions, it also
introduces inherent hurdles for object detection due to its lack of color and
fine texture details and generally lower resolution of thermal images. To
overcome these limitations, we develop YOLO-Thermal, a novel variant of the
YOLO architecture that integrates advanced feature extraction and attention
mechanisms for enhanced detection accuracy and robustness in thermal imaging.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed thermal detector outperforms existing
detectors, while the proposed traffic light system effectively enhances
barrier-free intersection. The source codes and dataset are available at

Abstract: Surgical scene segmentation is critical in computer-assisted surgery and is
vital for enhancing surgical quality and patient outcomes. Recently, referring
surgical segmentation is emerging, given its advantage of providing surgeons
with an interactive experience to segment the target object. However, existing
methods are limited by low efficiency and short-term tracking, hindering their
applicability in complex real-world surgical scenarios. In this paper, we
introduce ReSurgSAM2, a two-stage surgical referring segmentation framework
that leverages Segment Anything Model 2 to perform text-referred target
detection, followed by tracking with reliable initial frame identification and
diversity-driven long-term memory. For the detection stage, we propose a
cross-modal spatial-temporal Mamba to generate precise detection and
segmentation results. Based on these results, our credible initial frame
selection strategy identifies the reliable frame for the subsequent tracking.
Upon selecting the initial frame, our method transitions to the tracking stage,
where it incorporates a diversity-driven memory mechanism that maintains a
credible and diverse memory bank, ensuring consistent long-term tracking.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReSurgSAM2 achieves substantial
improvements in accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods, operating
in real-time at 61.2 FPS. Our code and datasets will be available at

Abstract: Machine learning has taken a critical role in seismic interpretation
workflows, especially in fault delineation tasks. However, despite the recent
proliferation of pretrained models and synthetic datasets, the field still
lacks a systematic understanding of the generalizability limits of these models
across seismic data representing a variety of geologic, acquisition and
processing settings. Distributional shifts between different data sources,
limitations in fine-tuning strategies and labeled data accessibility, and
inconsistent evaluation protocols all represent major roadblocks in the
deployment of reliable and robust models in real-world exploration settings. In
this paper, we present the first large-scale benchmarking study explicitly
designed to provide answers and guidelines for domain shift strategies in
seismic interpretation. Our benchmark encompasses over $200$ models trained and
evaluated on three heterogeneous datasets (synthetic and real data) including
FaultSeg3D, CRACKS, and Thebe. We systematically assess pretraining,
fine-tuning, and joint training strategies under varying degrees of domain
shift. Our analysis highlights the fragility of current fine-tuning practices,
the emergence of catastrophic forgetting, and the challenges of interpreting
performance in a systematic manner. We establish a robust experimental baseline
to provide insights into the tradeoffs inherent to current fault delineation
workflows, and shed light on directions for developing more generalizable,
interpretable and effective machine learning models for seismic interpretation.
The insights and analyses reported provide a set of guidelines on the
deployment of fault delineation models within seismic interpretation workflows.

Result: 实验表明，PrePrompt在多个基准测试中优于现有的基于提示的CIL方法。

Conclusion: PrePrompt通过预测任务特定提示和动态特征翻译，显著提升了CIL性能，为开放世界持续学习提供了新方向。

Abstract: Class Incremental Learning (CIL) based on pre-trained models offers a
promising direction for open-world continual learning. Existing methods
typically rely on correlation-based strategies, where an image's classification
feature is used as a query to retrieve the most related key prompts and select
the corresponding value prompts for training. However, these approaches face an
inherent limitation: fitting the entire feature space of all tasks with only a
few trainable prompts is fundamentally challenging. We propose Predictive
Prompting (PrePrompt), a novel CIL framework that circumvents correlation-based
limitations by leveraging pre-trained models' natural classification ability to
predict task-specific prompts. Specifically, PrePrompt decomposes CIL into a
two-stage prediction framework: task-specific prompt prediction followed by
label prediction. While theoretically appealing, this framework risks bias
toward recent classes due to missing historical data for older classifier
calibration. PrePrompt then mitigates this by incorporating feature
translation, dynamically balancing stability and plasticity. Experiments across
multiple benchmarks demonstrate PrePrompt's superiority over state-of-the-art
prompt-based CIL methods. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: This paper presents a Multi-Elevation Semantic Segmentation Image (MESSI)
dataset comprising 2525 images taken by a drone flying over dense urban
environments. MESSI is unique in two main features. First, it contains images
from various altitudes, allowing us to investigate the effect of depth on
semantic segmentation. Second, it includes images taken from several different
urban regions (at different altitudes). This is important since the variety
covers the visual richness captured by a drone's 3D flight, performing
horizontal and vertical maneuvers. MESSI contains images annotated with
location, orientation, and the camera's intrinsic parameters and can be used to
train a deep neural network for semantic segmentation or other applications of
interest (e.g., localization, navigation, and tracking). This paper describes
the dataset and provides annotation details. It also explains how semantic
segmentation was performed using several neural network models and shows
several relevant statistics. MESSI will be published in the public domain to
serve as an evaluation benchmark for semantic segmentation using images
captured by a drone or similar vehicle flying over a dense urban environment.

Motivation: 竹简是记录东亚古代文明的重要媒介，但许多出土的竹简已破碎成不规则碎片，拼接困难。

Method: WisePanda利用断裂和材料退化的物理原理生成合成训练数据，训练匹配网络，无需手动配对样本。

Result: Top-50匹配准确率从36%提升至52%，拼接效率提高约20倍。

Conclusion: 将物理原理融入深度学习模型显著提升性能，为古代文物修复提供了新范式。

Abstract: Bamboo slips are a crucial medium for recording ancient civilizations in East
Asia, and offers invaluable archaeological insights for reconstructing the Silk
Road, studying material culture exchanges, and global history. However, many
excavated bamboo slips have been fragmented into thousands of irregular pieces,
making their rejoining a vital yet challenging step for understanding their
content. Here we introduce WisePanda, a physics-driven deep learning framework
designed to rejoin fragmented bamboo slips. Based on the physics of fracture
and material deterioration, WisePanda automatically generates synthetic
training data that captures the physical properties of bamboo fragmentations.
This approach enables the training of a matching network without requiring
manually paired samples, providing ranked suggestions to facilitate the
rejoining process. Compared to the leading curve matching method, WisePanda
increases Top-50 matching accuracy from 36\% to 52\%. Archaeologists using
WisePanda have experienced substantial efficiency improvements (approximately
20 times faster) when rejoining fragmented bamboo slips. This research
demonstrates that incorporating physical principles into deep learning models
can significantly enhance their performance, transforming how archaeologists
restore and study fragmented artifacts. WisePanda provides a new paradigm for
addressing data scarcity in ancient artifact restoration through physics-driven
machine learning.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for ensuring the reliability
of deep learning models in medical imaging applications. This work is motivated
by the observation that class activation maps (CAMs) for in-distribution (ID)
data typically emphasize regions that are highly relevant to the model's
predictions, whereas OOD data often lacks such focused activations. By masking
input images with inverted CAMs, the feature representations of ID data undergo
more substantial changes compared to those of OOD data, offering a robust
criterion for differentiation. In this paper, we introduce a novel unsupervised
OOD detection framework, Multi-Exit Class Activation Map (MECAM), which
leverages multi-exit CAMs and feature masking. By utilizing mult-exit networks
that combine CAMs from varying resolutions and depths, our method captures both
global and local feature representations, thereby enhancing the robustness of
OOD detection. We evaluate MECAM on multiple ID datasets, including ISIC19 and
PathMNIST, and test its performance against three medical OOD datasets, RSNA
Pneumonia, COVID-19, and HeadCT, and one natural image OOD dataset, iSUN.
Comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art OOD detection methods validate
the effectiveness of our approach. Our findings emphasize the potential of
multi-exit networks and feature masking for advancing unsupervised OOD
detection in medical imaging, paving the way for more reliable and
interpretable models in clinical practice.

TL;DR: 论文提出两种改进数据集蒸馏的方法：基于文本的监督和对象中心掩码，通过结合文本信息和对象级优化提升蒸馏质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注视觉表示优化，但结合多模态信息和对象级细化可以显著提升蒸馏数据集的质量。

Method: 引入两种策略：1）文本特征融合和匹配；2）对象中心掩码和损失函数设计。

Result: 实验表明，结合文本指导和对象中心掩码能显著提升蒸馏数据集在下游任务中的性能。

Conclusion: 多模态信息和对象级优化是提升数据集蒸馏效果的关键。

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to create a compact and highly representative
synthetic dataset that preserves the knowledge of a larger real dataset. While
existing methods primarily focus on optimizing visual representations,
incorporating additional modalities and refining object-level information can
significantly improve the quality of distilled datasets. In this work, we
introduce two key enhancements to dataset distillation: caption-guided
supervision and object-centric masking. To integrate textual information, we
propose two strategies for leveraging caption features: the feature
concatenation, where caption embeddings are fused with visual features at the
classification stage, and caption matching, which introduces a caption-based
alignment loss during training to ensure semantic coherence between real and
synthetic data. Additionally, we apply segmentation masks to isolate target
objects and remove background distractions, introducing two loss functions
designed for object-centric learning: masked feature alignment loss and masked
gradient matching loss. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that integrating
caption-based guidance and object-centric masking enhances dataset
distillation, leading to synthetic datasets that achieve superior performance
on downstream tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为BooSTer的新框架，利用视觉基础模型和大规模混合图像源（包括合成、真实和单视图图像）解决立体匹配中标注数据稀缺和域差距问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 立体匹配方法依赖密集的像素级标注数据，获取成本高，且合成与真实图像间的域差距带来挑战。

Method: 结合单目深度估计和扩散模型生成密集立体匹配数据；利用伪单目深度标签和动态尺度不变损失解决稀疏标注问题；引入视觉基础模型提取鲁棒特征。

Result: 在基准数据集上显著提升了精度，尤其在标注数据有限和域偏移场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: BooSTer框架通过多源数据融合和知识迁移，有效提升了立体匹配的精度和泛化能力。

Abstract: Stereo matching methods rely on dense pixel-wise ground truth labels, which
are laborious to obtain, especially for real-world datasets. The scarcity of
labeled data and domain gaps between synthetic and real-world images also pose
notable challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel framework,
\textbf{BooSTer}, that leverages both vision foundation models and large-scale
mixed image sources, including synthetic, real, and single-view images. First,
to fully unleash the potential of large-scale single-view images, we design a
data generation strategy combining monocular depth estimation and diffusion
models to generate dense stereo matching data from single-view images. Second,
to tackle sparse labels in real-world datasets, we transfer knowledge from
monocular depth estimation models, using pseudo-mono depth labels and a dynamic
scale- and shift-invariant loss for additional supervision. Furthermore, we
incorporate vision foundation model as an encoder to extract robust and
transferable features, boosting accuracy and generalization. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach, achieving significant improvements in accuracy over existing methods,
particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data and domain shifts.

TL;DR: OpenThinkIMG是一个开源框架，用于增强大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）的动态视觉工具调用能力，通过强化学习（V-ToolRL）显著提升任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏标准化基础设施，阻碍了LVLMs学习动态工具调用行为的能力，OpenThinkIMG旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出OpenThinkIMG框架，包括标准化工具接口、轨迹生成和强化学习（V-ToolRL）训练方法。

Result: 在图表推理任务中，V-ToolRL训练的模型显著优于监督学习基线（+12.7分）和GPT-4.1（+8.68分）。

Conclusion: OpenThinkIMG为动态视觉推理提供了基础框架，推动了AI代理的视觉认知能力发展。

Abstract: While humans can flexibly leverage interactive visual cognition for complex
problem-solving, enabling Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to learn
similarly adaptive behaviors with visual tools remains challenging. A
significant hurdle is the current lack of standardized infrastructure, which
hinders integrating diverse tools, generating rich interaction data, and
training robust agents effectively. To address these gaps, we introduce
OpenThinkIMG, the first open-source, comprehensive end-to-end framework for
tool-augmented LVLMs. It features standardized vision tool interfaces, scalable
trajectory generation for policy initialization, and a flexible training
environment. Furthermore, considering supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on static
demonstrations offers limited policy generalization for dynamic tool
invocation, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework V-ToolRL
to train LVLMs to learn adaptive policies for invoking external vision tools.
V-ToolRL enables LVLMs to autonomously discover optimal tool-usage strategies
by directly optimizing for task success using feedback from tool interactions.
We empirically validate V-ToolRL on challenging chart reasoning tasks. Our
RL-trained agent, built upon a Qwen2-VL-2B, significantly outperforms its
SFT-initialized counterpart (+28.83 points) and surpasses established
supervised tool-learning baselines like Taco and CogCom by an average of +12.7
points. Notably, it also surpasses prominent closed-source models like GPT-4.1
by +8.68 accuracy points. We hope OpenThinkIMG can serve as a foundational
framework for advancing dynamic, tool-augmented visual reasoning, helping the
community develop AI agents that can genuinely "think with images".

Abstract: This work presents DLO-Splatting, an algorithm for estimating the 3D shape of
Deformable Linear Objects (DLOs) from multi-view RGB images and gripper state

uses a position-based dynamics model with shape smoothness and rigidity
dampening corrections to predict the object shape. Optimization with a 3D

prediction to align it with the visual observations in the update step. Initial
experiments demonstrate promising results in a knot tying scenario, which is
challenging for existing vision-only methods.

Result: 校准良好的模型表现更优，预训练和多数据集训练的模型更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 多标注者标注、校准评估和不确定性感知是开发可靠医学图像分割模型的关键。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has become the dominant approach for medical image
segmentation, yet ensuring the reliability and clinical applicability of these
models requires addressing key challenges such as annotation variability,
calibration, and uncertainty estimation. This is why we created the Calibration
and Uncertainty for multiRater Volume Assessment in multiorgan Segmentation
(CURVAS), which highlights the critical role of multiple annotators in
establishing a more comprehensive ground truth, emphasizing that segmentation
is inherently subjective and that leveraging inter-annotator variability is
essential for robust model evaluation. Seven teams participated in the
challenge, submitting a variety of DL models evaluated using metrics such as
Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Expected Calibration Error (ECE), and
Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS). By incorporating consensus and
dissensus ground truth, we assess how DL models handle uncertainty and whether
their confidence estimates align with true segmentation performance. Our
findings reinforce the importance of well-calibrated models, as better
calibration is strongly correlated with the quality of the results.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that segmentation models trained on diverse
datasets and enriched with pre-trained knowledge exhibit greater robustness,
particularly in cases deviating from standard anatomical structures. Notably,
the best-performing models achieved high DSC and well-calibrated uncertainty
estimates. This work underscores the need for multi-annotator ground truth,
thorough calibration assessments, and uncertainty-aware evaluations to develop
trustworthy and clinically reliable DL-based medical image segmentation models.

Result: 实验表明SPAST能生成高质量风格化图像，且推理时间更短。

Conclusion: SPAST在艺术风格迁移中实现了高质量与高效率的平衡。

Abstract: Given an arbitrary content and style image, arbitrary style transfer aims to
render a new stylized
  image which preserves the content image's structure and possesses the style
image's style. Existing
  arbitrary style transfer methods are based on either small models or
pre-trained large-scale models.
  The small model-based methods fail to generate high-quality stylized images,
bringing artifacts and
  disharmonious patterns. The pre-trained large-scale model-based methods can
generate high-quality
  stylized images but struggle to preserve the content structure and cost long
inference time. To this
  end, we propose a new framework, called SPAST, to generate high-quality
stylized images with
  less inference time. Specifically, we design a novel Local-global Window Size
Stylization Module
  (LGWSSM)tofuse style features into content features. Besides, we introduce a
novel style prior loss,
  which can dig out the style priors from a pre-trained large-scale model into
the SPAST and motivate
  the SPAST to generate high-quality stylized images with short inference
time.We conduct abundant
  experiments to verify that our proposed method can generate high-quality
stylized images and less
  inference time compared with the SOTA arbitrary style transfer methods.

Motivation: 当前主流图像着色模型存在颜色溢出和绑定错误问题，且无法实现实例级着色。本文旨在通过扩散模型和注意力机制解决这些问题。

Method: 设计了像素级掩码注意力机制和实例掩码文本引导模块，结合多实例采样策略，并构建了专用数据集GPT-color。

Result: 定性和定量实验表明，该方法在实例级着色任务上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MT-Color通过创新的注意力机制和数据集，显著提升了图像着色的精确性和实例感知能力。

Abstract: Recently, the application of deep learning in image colorization has received
widespread attention. The maturation of diffusion models has further advanced
the development of image colorization models. However, current mainstream image
colorization models still face issues such as color bleeding and color binding
errors, and cannot colorize images at the instance level. In this paper, we
propose a diffusion-based colorization method MT-Color to achieve precise
instance-aware colorization with use-provided guidance. To tackle color
bleeding issue, we design a pixel-level mask attention mechanism that
integrates latent features and conditional gray image features through
cross-attention. We use segmentation masks to construct cross-attention masks,
preventing pixel information from exchanging between different instances. We
also introduce an instance mask and text guidance module that extracts instance
masks and text representations of each instance, which are then fused with
latent features through self-attention, utilizing instance masks to form
self-attention masks to prevent instance texts from guiding the colorization of
other areas, thus mitigating color binding errors. Furthermore, we apply a
multi-instance sampling strategy, which involves sampling each instance region
separately and then fusing the results. Additionally, we have created a
specialized dataset for instance-level colorization tasks, GPT-color, by
leveraging large visual language models on existing image datasets. Qualitative
and quantitative experiments show that our model and dataset outperform
previous methods and datasets.

Abstract: Satellite image time series (SITS) provide continuous observations of the
Earth's surface, making them essential for applications such as environmental
management and disaster assessment. However, existing spatiotemporal foundation
models rely on plain vision transformers, which encode entire temporal
sequences without explicitly capturing multiscale spatiotemporal relationships
between land objects. This limitation hinders their effectiveness in downstream
tasks. To overcome this challenge, we propose TiMo, a novel hierarchical vision
transformer foundation model tailored for SITS analysis. At its core, we
introduce a spatiotemporal gyroscope attention mechanism that dynamically
captures evolving multiscale patterns across both time and space. For
pre-training, we curate MillionST, a large-scale dataset of one million images
from 100,000 geographic locations, each captured across 10 temporal phases over
five years, encompassing diverse geospatial changes and seasonal variations.
Leveraging this dataset, we adapt masked image modeling to pre-train TiMo,
enabling it to effectively learn and encode generalizable spatiotemporal
representations.Extensive experiments across multiple spatiotemporal
tasks-including deforestation monitoring, land cover segmentation, crop type
classification, and flood detection-demonstrate TiMo's superiority over
state-of-the-art methods. Code, model, and dataset will be released at

Abstract: The Large Visual-Language Models (LVLMs) have significantly advanced image
understanding. Their comprehension and reasoning capabilities enable promising
applications in autonomous driving scenarios. However, existing research
typically focuses on front-view perspectives and partial objects within scenes,
struggling to achieve comprehensive scene understanding. Meanwhile, existing
LVLMs suffer from the lack of mapping relationship between 2D and 3D and
insufficient integration of 3D object localization and instruction
understanding. To tackle these limitations, we first introduce NuInteract, a
large-scale dataset with over 1.5M multi-view image language pairs spanning
dense scene captions and diverse interactive tasks. Furthermore, we propose
DriveMonkey, a simple yet effective framework that seamlessly integrates LVLMs
with a spatial processor using a series of learnable queries. The spatial
processor, designed as a plug-and-play component, can be initialized with
pre-trained 3D detectors to improve 3D perception. Our experiments show that
DriveMonkey outperforms general LVLMs, especially achieving a 9.86% notable

Abstract: Nutrition estimation is an important component of promoting healthy eating
and mitigating diet-related health risks. Despite advances in tasks such as
food classification and ingredient recognition, progress in nutrition
estimation is limited due to the lack of datasets with nutritional annotations.
To address this issue, we introduce FastFood, a dataset with 84,446 images
across 908 fast food categories, featuring ingredient and nutritional
annotations. In addition, we propose a new model-agnostic Visual-Ingredient
Feature Fusion (VIF$^2$) method to enhance nutrition estimation by integrating
visual and ingredient features. Ingredient robustness is improved through
synonym replacement and resampling strategies during training. The
ingredient-aware visual feature fusion module combines ingredient features and
visual representation to achieve accurate nutritional prediction. During
testing, ingredient predictions are refined using large multimodal models by
data augmentation and majority voting. Our experiments on both FastFood and
Nutrition5k datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed method built in
different backbones (e.g., Resnet, InceptionV3 and ViT), which demonstrates the
importance of ingredient information in nutrition estimation.

Conclusion: 尽管表现优异，但与人类相比仍有差距，未来需改进语义推理和空间探索能力。此工作为未来目标搜索研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Aerial Visual Object Search (AVOS) tasks in urban environments require
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to autonomously search for and identify target
objects using visual and textual cues without external guidance. Existing
approaches struggle in complex urban environments due to redundant semantic
processing, similar object distinction, and the exploration-exploitation
dilemma. To bridge this gap and support the AVOS task, we introduce CityAVOS,
the first benchmark dataset for autonomous search of common urban objects. This
dataset comprises 2,420 tasks across six object categories with varying
difficulty levels, enabling comprehensive evaluation of UAV agents' search
capabilities. To solve the AVOS tasks, we also propose PRPSearcher
(Perception-Reasoning-Planning Searcher), a novel agentic method powered by
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) that mimics human three-tier
cognition. Specifically, PRPSearcher constructs three specialized maps: an
object-centric dynamic semantic map enhancing spatial perception, a 3D
cognitive map based on semantic attraction values for target reasoning, and a
3D uncertainty map for balanced exploration-exploitation search. Also, our
approach incorporates a denoising mechanism to mitigate interference from
similar objects and utilizes an Inspiration Promote Thought (IPT) prompting
mechanism for adaptive action planning. Experimental results on CityAVOS
demonstrate that PRPSearcher surpasses existing baselines in both success rate
and search efficiency (on average: +37.69% SR, +28.96% SPL, -30.69% MSS, and
-46.40% NE). While promising, the performance gap compared to humans highlights
the need for better semantic reasoning and spatial exploration capabilities in
AVOS tasks. This work establishes a foundation for future advances in embodied
target search. Dataset and source code are available at

Abstract: Remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating text-image content
have been demonstrated by recent advancements in multimodal large language

domains-particularly those requiring resource-efficient and domain-specific
adaptations-has remained limited. In this work, a lightweight multimodal

remote sensing imagery in secluded areas, including challenging missile launch
sites. A new dataset, MilData, was compiled by verifying hundreds of aerial

performed, enabling more accurate and interpretable explanations. Additionally,
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) was leveraged to enhance the model's
ability to detect critical domain-specific cues-such as defensive layouts and
key military structures-while minimizing false positives on civilian scenes.
Through empirical evaluations, it has been shown that MilChat significantly
outperforms both larger, general-purpose multimodal models and existing remote
sensing-adapted approaches on open-ended captioning and classification metrics.
Over 80% recall and 98% precision were achieved on the newly proposed MilData
benchmark, underscoring the potency of targeted fine-tuning and reinforcement
learning in specialized real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用视觉基础模型的语义先验检测语义异常的方法，通过比较运行时图像的局部视觉嵌入与安全场景数据库，实现了高性能的异常检测与定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义异常可能导致自主系统推理失败，因此需要一种高效的方法来检测这些异常。

Method: 提出了一种框架，使用网格嵌入和实例分割两种方法，并引入过滤机制减少误报。

Result: 在CARLA模拟异常测试中，基于实例的方法性能接近GPT-4o，并能精确定位异常。

Conclusion: 视觉基础模型的嵌入在实时异常检测中具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Semantic anomalies are contextually invalid or unusual combinations of
familiar visual elements that can cause undefined behavior and failures in
system-level reasoning for autonomous systems. This work explores semantic
anomaly detection by leveraging the semantic priors of state-of-the-art vision
foundation models, operating directly on the image. We propose a framework that
compares local vision embeddings from runtime images to a database of nominal
scenarios in which the autonomous system is deemed safe and performant. In this
work, we consider two variants of the proposed framework: one using raw
grid-based embeddings, and another leveraging instance segmentation for
object-centric representations. To further improve robustness, we introduce a
simple filtering mechanism to suppress false positives. Our evaluations on
CARLA-simulated anomalies show that the instance-based method with filtering
achieves performance comparable to GPT-4o, while providing precise anomaly
localization. These results highlight the potential utility of vision
embeddings from foundation models for real-time anomaly detection in autonomous
systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于可变形变换器的鲁棒关键点检测与描述方法（RDD），通过全局上下文和几何不变性提升特征匹配性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在显著视角变化等挑战性场景下，现有局部特征方法难以捕捉长距离关系，导致特征检测与描述不准确。

Method: 利用可变形自注意力机制，捕捉全局上下文并建模几何不变性，同时结合Air-to-Ground数据集进行训练。

Result: RDD在稀疏匹配任务中优于现有方法，并能实现半稠密匹配。论文还提出了两个新基准测试。

Conclusion: RDD通过可变形注意力机制显著提升了特征匹配的鲁棒性，适用于复杂场景下的3D重建任务。

Abstract: As a core step in structure-from-motion and SLAM, robust feature detection
and description under challenging scenarios such as significant viewpoint
changes remain unresolved despite their ubiquity. While recent works have
identified the importance of local features in modeling geometric
transformations, these methods fail to learn the visual cues present in
long-range relationships. We present Robust Deformable Detector (RDD), a novel
and robust keypoint detector/descriptor leveraging the deformable transformer,
which captures global context and geometric invariance through deformable
self-attention mechanisms. Specifically, we observed that deformable attention
focuses on key locations, effectively reducing the search space complexity and
modeling the geometric invariance. Furthermore, we collected an Air-to-Ground
dataset for training in addition to the standard MegaDepth dataset. Our
proposed method outperforms all state-of-the-art keypoint detection/description
methods in sparse matching tasks and is also capable of semi-dense matching. To
ensure comprehensive evaluation, we introduce two challenging benchmarks: one
emphasizing large viewpoint and scale variations, and the other being an
Air-to-Ground benchmark -- an evaluation setting that has recently gaining
popularity for 3D reconstruction across different altitudes.

TL;DR: VISTAR是一种基于子任务的训练框架，通过生成文本和视觉解释提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的可解释性和推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在复杂视觉问题中计算成本高且准确性低的问题。

Method: 通过微调MLLMs生成结构化的子任务推理序列（Subtask-of-Thought）。

Result: 在两个基准测试中，VISTAR显著提高了推理准确性并保持了可解释性。

Conclusion: VISTAR为复杂视觉问题的多步推理提供了一种高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Answering complex visual questions like `Which red furniture can be used for
sitting?' requires multi-step reasoning, including object recognition,
attribute filtering, and relational understanding. Recent work improves
interpretability in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by decomposing
tasks into sub-task programs, but these methods are computationally expensive
and less accurate due to poor adaptation to target data. To address this, we
introduce VISTAR (Visually Interpretable Subtask-Aware Reasoning Model), a
subtask-driven training framework that enhances both interpretability and
reasoning by generating textual and visual explanations within MLLMs. Instead
of relying on external models, VISTAR fine-tunes MLLMs to produce structured
Subtask-of-Thought rationales (step-by-step reasoning sequences). Experiments
on two benchmarks show that VISTAR consistently improves reasoning accuracy
while maintaining interpretability. Our code and dataset will be available at
https://github.com/ChengJade/VISTAR.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于迁移学习的多模态AI模型，结合Xception和GMRNN架构，用于伤口分类，显著提高了伤口类型识别的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 急性及难以愈合的伤口诊断对临床护理至关重要，但传统方法易受感染、血管疾病等因素影响，AI工具可加速医学图像解读并改善早期检测。

Method: 通过迁移学习算法提取特征并结合位置特征，构建多模态网络，用于分类糖尿病、压力、手术和静脉溃疡等伤口类型。

Result: 实验结果显示，伤口分类准确率在78.77%至100%之间，显著优于传统深度神经网络。

Conclusion: 该方法在伤口图像分类中表现出卓越的准确性，为临床诊断提供了高效工具。

Abstract: The effective diagnosis of acute and hard-to-heal wounds is crucial for wound
care practitioners to provide effective patient care. Poor clinical outcomes
are often linked to infection, peripheral vascular disease, and increasing
wound depth, which collectively exacerbate these comorbidities. However,
diagnostic tools based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) speed up the
interpretation of medical images and improve early detection of disease. In
this article, we propose a multi-modal AI model based on transfer learning
(TL), which combines two state-of-the-art architectures, Xception and GMRNN,
for wound classification. The multi-modal network is developed by concatenating
the features extracted by a transfer learning algorithm and location features
to classify the wound types of diabetic, pressure, surgical, and venous ulcers.
The proposed method is comprehensively compared with deep neural networks (DNN)
for medical image analysis. The experimental results demonstrate a notable
wound-class classifications (containing only diabetic, pressure, surgical, and
venous) vary from 78.77 to 100\% in various experiments. The results presented
in this study showcase the exceptional accuracy of the proposed methodology in
accurately classifying the most commonly occurring wound types using wound
images and their corresponding locations.

Motivation: 解决高性能点云处理模型（如Point Transformer V3）在资源受限环境中部署时的高计算和内存需求问题。

Method: 利用拓扑感知表示和梯度引导知识蒸馏，从高容量教师模型向轻量级学生模型传递知识，同时通过梯度特征对齐指导学习过程。

Result: 在Nuscenes、SemanticKITTI和Waymo数据集上表现优异，模型大小减少约16倍，推理时间降低近1.9倍，并在NuScenes上达到知识蒸馏技术的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高性能的同时显著降低了模型的计算和内存需求，适用于资源受限环境。

Abstract: Point cloud processing has gained significant attention due to its critical
role in applications such as autonomous driving and 3D object recognition.
However, deploying high-performance models like Point Transformer V3 in
resource-constrained environments remains challenging due to their high
computational and memory demands. This work introduces a novel distillation
framework that leverages topology-aware representations and gradient-guided
knowledge distillation to effectively transfer knowledge from a high-capacity
teacher to a lightweight student model. Our approach captures the underlying
geometric structures of point clouds while selectively guiding the student
model's learning process through gradient-based feature alignment. Experimental
results in the Nuscenes, SemanticKITTI, and Waymo datasets demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves competitive performance, with an approximately 16x
reduction in model size and a nearly 1.9x decrease in inference time compared
to its teacher model. Notably, on NuScenes, our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance among knowledge distillation techniques trained
solely on LiDAR data, surpassing prior knowledge distillation baselines in
segmentation performance. Our implementation is available publicly at:

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于压力敏感垫（PSM）的非侵入式睡眠监测方法，利用迁移学习解决临床环境中标记数据不足的问题，通过预训练的Vision Transformer模型（ViTMAE和ViTPose）显著提升了睡眠姿势分类的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 睡眠姿势影响睡眠质量和睡眠障碍（如呼吸暂停）的发生率，但临床环境中标记数据稀缺，限制了深度学习模型的应用。

Method: 采用迁移学习，利用预训练的ViTMAE和ViTPose模型，对低分辨率PSM数据进行睡眠姿势分类，并与传统机器学习方法（如SVM、XGBoost）和深度学习模型（TCN）进行比较。

Result: 在112晚患者记录和13名患者的高分辨率数据集上验证，该方法显著优于传统方法和TCN模型。

Conclusion: 尽管低分辨率PSM数据存在挑战，该方法在临床环境中具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Bed-based pressure-sensitive mats (PSMs) offer a non-intrusive way of
monitoring patients during sleep. We focus on four-way sleep position
classification using data collected from a PSM placed under a mattress in a
sleep clinic. Sleep positions can affect sleep quality and the prevalence of
sleep disorders, such as apnea. Measurements were performed on patients with
suspected sleep disorders referred for assessments at a sleep clinic. Training
deep learning models can be challenging in clinical settings due to the need
for large amounts of labeled data. To overcome the shortage of labeled training
data, we utilize transfer learning to adapt pre-trained deep learning models to
accurately estimate sleep positions from a low-resolution PSM dataset collected
in a polysomnography sleep lab. Our approach leverages Vision Transformer
models pre-trained on ImageNet using masked autoencoding (ViTMAE) and a
pre-trained model for human pose estimation (ViTPose). These approaches
outperform previous work from PSM-based sleep pose classification using deep
learning (TCN) as well as traditional machine learning models (SVM, XGBoost,
Random Forest) that use engineered features. We evaluate the performance of
sleep position classification from 112 nights of patient recordings and
validate it on a higher resolution 13-patient dataset. Despite the challenges
of differentiating between sleep positions from low-resolution PSM data, our
approach shows promise for real-world deployment in clinical settings

TL;DR: 本文通过对比卫星和无人机图像对15,814栋建筑的损伤标签，发现29.02%的标签不一致，且两种来源的分布显著不同，这对机器学习损伤评估系统的部署带来风险和潜在危害。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前尚无研究比较无人机和卫星图像在建筑损伤评估中的标签一致性。现有工作因标签标准、建筑位置偏差和数据量不足而受限。本文旨在填补这一空白，并揭示潜在问题。

Method: 使用相同的损伤标签标准和建筑位置数据，对比分析了三次飓风（Ian、Michael、Harvey）中卫星和无人机图像的损伤标签。

Result: 卫星标签比无人机标签低估损伤至少20.43%（p<1.2x10^-117），且两种标签分布显著不同（p<5.1x10^-175），表明基于其中一种训练的模型会误判实际情况。

Conclusion: 标签不一致可能导致计算机视觉和机器学习模型误判，带来伦理风险和社会危害。本文提出四项建议以提高可靠性和透明度，减少潜在危害。

Abstract: This paper audits damage labels derived from coincident satellite and drone
aerial imagery for 15,814 buildings across Hurricanes Ian, Michael, and Harvey,
finding 29.02% label disagreement and significantly different distributions
between the two sources, which presents risks and potential harms during the
deployment of machine learning damage assessment systems. Currently, there is
no known study of label agreement between drone and satellite imagery for
building damage assessment. The only prior work that could be used to infer if
such imagery-derived labels agree is limited by differing damage label schemas,
misaligned building locations, and low data quantities. This work overcomes
these limitations by comparing damage labels using the same damage label
schemas and building locations from three hurricanes, with the 15,814 buildings
representing 19.05 times more buildings considered than the most relevant prior
work. The analysis finds satellite-derived labels significantly under-report
damage by at least 20.43% compared to drone-derived labels (p<1.2x10^-117), and
satellite- and drone-derived labels represent significantly different
distributions (p<5.1x10^-175). This indicates that computer vision and machine
learning (CV/ML) models trained on at least one of these distributions will
misrepresent actual conditions, as the differing satellite and drone-derived
distributions cannot simultaneously represent the distribution of actual
conditions in a scene. This potential misrepresentation poses ethical risks and
potential societal harm if not managed. To reduce the risk of future societal
harms, this paper offers four recommendations to improve reliability and
transparency to decisio-makers when deploying CV/ML damage assessment systems
in practice

TL;DR: JSover是一种新型的单能CT多材料分解框架，通过联合重建和能量谱估计，显著提高了分解的准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多材料分解方法依赖光谱CT和预测量X射线能谱，临床适用性受限。单能CT分解方法存在两步流程导致的伪影和噪声问题。

Method: 提出JSover框架，一步完成多材料成分重建和能谱估计，结合物理先验和隐式神经表示（INR）优化分解质量。

Result: 实验表明，JSover在模拟和真实CT数据上优于现有单能CT分解方法，提高了准确性和计算效率。

Conclusion: JSover为单能CT多材料分解提供了更可靠和高效的解决方案，具有广泛临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Multi-material decomposition (MMD) enables quantitative reconstruction of
tissue compositions in the human body, supporting a wide range of clinical
applications. However, traditional MMD typically requires spectral CT scanners
and pre-measured X-ray energy spectra, significantly limiting clinical
applicability. To this end, various methods have been developed to perform MMD
using conventional (i.e., single-energy, SE) CT systems, commonly referred to
as SEMMD. Despite promising progress, most SEMMD methods follow a two-step
image decomposition pipeline, which first reconstructs monochromatic CT images
using algorithms such as FBP, and then performs decomposition on these images.
The initial reconstruction step, however, neglects the energy-dependent
attenuation of human tissues, introducing severe nonlinear beam hardening
artifacts and noise into the subsequent decomposition. This paper proposes
JSover, a fundamentally reformulated one-step SEMMD framework that jointly
reconstructs multi-material compositions and estimates the energy spectrum
directly from SECT projections. By explicitly incorporating physics-informed
spectral priors into the SEMMD process, JSover accurately simulates a virtual
spectral CT system from SE acquisitions, thereby improving the reliability and
accuracy of decomposition. Furthermore, we introduce implicit neural
representation (INR) as an unsupervised deep learning solver for representing
the underlying material maps. The inductive bias of INR toward continuous image
patterns constrains the solution space and further enhances estimation quality.
Extensive experiments on both simulated and real CT datasets show that JSover
outperforms state-of-the-art SEMMD methods in accuracy and computational
efficiency.

Motivation: 解决时间敏感和数据密集型场景下，机器人计算资源有限的问题。

Method: 集成2D视觉语言模型特征到3D场景中，通过归一化加权平均计算语言嵌入，无需损失函数。

Result: 在16-GPU设置下，嵌入计算速度提升18倍，同时保持ScanNet和LERF数据集的嵌入质量。

Conclusion: SLAG为大规模机器人应用提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Language-augmented scene representations hold great promise for large-scale
robotics applications such as search-and-rescue, smart cities, and mining. Many
of these scenarios are time-sensitive, requiring rapid scene encoding while
also being data-intensive, necessitating scalable solutions. Deploying these
representations on robots with limited computational resources further adds to
the challenge. To address this, we introduce SLAG, a multi-GPU framework for
language-augmented Gaussian splatting that enhances the speed and scalability
of embedding large scenes. Our method integrates 2D visual-language model
features into 3D scenes using SAM and CLIP. Unlike prior approaches, SLAG
eliminates the need for a loss function to compute per-Gaussian language
embeddings. Instead, it derives embeddings from 3D Gaussian scene parameters
via a normalized weighted average, enabling highly parallelized scene encoding.
Additionally, we introduce a vector database for efficient embedding storage
and retrieval. Our experiments show that SLAG achieves an 18 times speedup in
embedding computation on a 16-GPU setup compared to OpenGaussian, while
preserving embedding quality on the ScanNet and LERF datasets. For more

Conclusion: AEMOT算法高效且性能优越，适用于动态环境中的多对象跟踪。

Abstract: Events cameras are ideal sensors for enabling robots to detect and track
objects in highly dynamic environments due to their low latency output, high
temporal resolution, and high dynamic range. In this paper, we present the
Asynchronous Event Multi-Object Tracking (AEMOT) algorithm for detecting and
tracking multiple objects by processing individual raw events asynchronously.
AEMOT detects salient event blob features by identifying regions of consistent
optical flow using a novel Field of Active Flow Directions built from the
Surface of Active Events. Detected features are tracked as candidate objects
using the recently proposed Asynchronous Event Blob (AEB) tracker in order to
construct small intensity patches of each candidate object. A novel learnt
validation stage promotes or discards candidate objects based on classification
of their intensity patches, with promoted objects having their position,
velocity, size, and orientation estimated at their event rate. We evaluate
AEMOT on a new Bee Swarm Dataset, where it tracks dozens of small bees with
precision and recall performance exceeding that of alternative event-based
detection and tracking algorithms by over 37%. Source code and the labelled
event Bee Swarm Dataset will be open sourced

Result: 在ImageNet-1K和COCO数据集上实现最先进性能。

Conclusion: MoKD在效率和性能上优于现有方法，且优于从头训练的模型。

Abstract: Compact models can be effectively trained through Knowledge Distillation
(KD), a technique that transfers knowledge from larger, high-performing teacher
models. Two key challenges in Knowledge Distillation (KD) are: 1) balancing
learning from the teacher's guidance and the task objective, and 2) handling
the disparity in knowledge representation between teacher and student models.
To address these, we propose Multi-Task Optimization for Knowledge Distillation
(MoKD). MoKD tackles two main gradient issues: a) Gradient Conflicts, where
task-specific and distillation gradients are misaligned, and b) Gradient
Dominance, where one objective's gradient dominates, causing imbalance. MoKD
reformulates KD as a multi-objective optimization problem, enabling better
balance between objectives. Additionally, it introduces a subspace learning
framework to project feature representations into a high-dimensional space,
improving knowledge transfer. Our MoKD is demonstrated to outperform existing
methods through extensive experiments on image classification using the
ImageNet-1K dataset and object detection using the COCO dataset, achieving
state-of-the-art performance with greater efficiency. To the best of our
knowledge, MoKD models also achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to
models trained from scratch.

Motivation: 现有因果模型在ViT上性能不佳，因其全局特征表示难以建模细粒度特征与预测的关联，导致尾部类别分类困难。

Method: TSCNet包括两阶段：1) 分层因果表示学习（HCRL），通过多尺度干预增强细粒度因果表示；2) 反事实对数偏差校准（CLBC），优化决策边界。

Result: 在多个长尾基准测试中，TSCNet显著优于现有方法，有效消除数据不平衡引入的偏差。

Conclusion: TSCNet通过两阶段因果建模，成功解决了ViT在长尾分类中的问题，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Causal inference has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate long-tail
classification by handling the biases introduced by class imbalance. However,
along with the change of advanced backbone models from Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) to Visual Transformers (ViT), existing causal models may not
achieve an expected performance gain. This paper investigates the influence of
existing causal models on CNNs and ViT variants, highlighting that ViT's global
feature representation makes it hard for causal methods to model associations
between fine-grained features and predictions, which leads to difficulties in
classifying tail classes with similar visual appearance. To address these
issues, this paper proposes TSCNet, a two-stage causal modeling method to
discover fine-grained causal associations through multi-scale causal
interventions. Specifically, in the hierarchical causal representation learning
stage (HCRL), it decouples the background and objects, applying backdoor
interventions at both the patch and feature level to prevent model from using
class-irrelevant areas to infer labels which enhances fine-grained causal
representation. In the counterfactual logits bias calibration stage (CLBC), it
refines the optimization of model's decision boundary by adaptive constructing
counterfactual balanced data distribution to remove the spurious associations
in the logits caused by data distribution. Extensive experiments conducted on
various long-tail benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed TSCNet can eliminate
multiple biases introduced by data imbalance, which outperforms existing
methods.

Motivation: 腹腔镜图像中的遮挡和标记数据稀缺是视差估计的主要挑战，需要一种能够利用未受遮挡影响的深度信息并增强时空一致性的方法。

Method: 提出DGORNet网络，结合单目深度信息，引入位置嵌入模块（PE）增强空间上下文，并设计光流差异损失（OFDLoss）利用未标记数据的时序连续性。

Result: 在SCARED数据集上，DGORNet在端点误差（EPE）和均方根误差（RMSE）上优于现有方法，尤其在遮挡和无纹理区域表现突出。

Conclusion: DGORNet通过结合深度信息和时空一致性优化，为腹腔镜手术中的视差估计提供了有效解决方案，解决了数据限制和遮挡问题。

Abstract: Occlusion and the scarcity of labeled surgical data are significant
challenges in disparity estimation for stereo laparoscopic images. To address
these issues, this study proposes a Depth Guided Occlusion-Aware Disparity
Refinement Network (DGORNet), which refines disparity maps by leveraging
monocular depth information unaffected by occlusion. A Position Embedding (PE)
module is introduced to provide explicit spatial context, enhancing the
network's ability to localize and refine features. Furthermore, we introduce an
Optical Flow Difference Loss (OFDLoss) for unlabeled data, leveraging temporal
continuity across video frames to improve robustness in dynamic surgical
scenes. Experiments on the SCARED dataset demonstrate that DGORNet outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of End-Point Error (EPE) and Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE), particularly in occlusion and texture-less regions.
Ablation studies confirm the contributions of the Position Embedding and
Optical Flow Difference Loss, highlighting their roles in improving spatial and
temporal consistency. These results underscore DGORNet's effectiveness in
enhancing disparity estimation for laparoscopic surgery, offering a practical
solution to challenges in disparity estimation and data limitations.

Conclusion: 扩散模型为单图像雨滴去除提供了新的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Raindrop removal is a challenging task in image processing. Removing
raindrops while relying solely on a single image further increases the
difficulty of the task. Common approaches include the detection of raindrop
regions in the image, followed by performing a background restoration process
conditioned on those regions. While various methods can be applied for the
detection step, the most common architecture used for background restoration is
the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). Recent advances in the use of
diffusion models have led to state-of-the-art image inpainting techniques. In
this paper, we introduce a novel technique for raindrop removal from a single
image using diffusion-based image inpainting.

Abstract: Existing 4D Gaussian Splatting methods rely on per-Gaussian deformation from
a canonical space to target frames, which overlooks redundancy among adjacent
Gaussian primitives and results in suboptimal performance. To address this
limitation, we propose Anchor-Driven Deformable and Compressed Gaussian
Splatting (ADC-GS), a compact and efficient representation for dynamic scene
reconstruction. Specifically, ADC-GS organizes Gaussian primitives into an
anchor-based structure within the canonical space, enhanced by a temporal
significance-based anchor refinement strategy. To reduce deformation
redundancy, ADC-GS introduces a hierarchical coarse-to-fine pipeline that
captures motions at varying granularities. Moreover, a rate-distortion
optimization is adopted to achieve an optimal balance between bitrate
consumption and representation fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that
ADC-GS outperforms the per-Gaussian deformation approaches in rendering speed
by 300%-800% while achieving state-of-the-art storage efficiency without
compromising rendering quality. The code is released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI技术的发展，视觉内容易被滥用，版权问题日益突出。传统检测方法难以应对复杂篡改，需探索更有效的保护机制。

Method: 利用扩散模型学习特征，嵌入不可感知且鲁棒的水印，提升检测准确性。

Result: 扩散模型在水印嵌入中表现出色，能有效对抗复杂篡改，但技术仍面临挑战。

Conclusion: 需开发创新解决方案，以在生成式AI时代保护数字内容所有权，确保水印技术的鲁棒性。

Abstract: As generative artificial intelligence technologies like Stable Diffusion
advance, visual content becomes more vulnerable to misuse, raising concerns
about copyright infringement. Visual watermarks serve as effective protection
mechanisms, asserting ownership and deterring unauthorized use. Traditional
deepfake detection methods often rely on passive techniques that struggle with
sophisticated manipulations. In contrast, diffusion models enhance detection
accuracy by allowing for the effective learning of features, enabling the
embedding of imperceptible and robust watermarks. We analyze the strengths and
challenges of watermark techniques related to diffusion models, focusing on
their robustness and application in watermark generation. By exploring the
integration of advanced diffusion models and watermarking security, we aim to
advance the discourse on preserving watermark robustness against evolving
forgery threats. It emphasizes the critical importance of developing innovative
solutions to protect digital content and ensure the preservation of ownership
rights in the era of generative AI.

Result: HMPNet在平均精度上比YOLOv11n提高了3.3%，参数减少了23%。

Conclusion: Navigation12和HMPNet为海事目标检测提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: In the realm of intelligent maritime navigation, object detection from a
shipborne perspective is paramount. Despite the criticality, the paucity of
maritime-specific data impedes the deployment of sophisticated visual
perception techniques, akin to those utilized in autonomous vehicular systems,
within the maritime context. To bridge this gap, we introduce Navigation12, a
novel dataset annotated for 12 object categories under diverse maritime

HMPNet, a lightweight architecture tailored for shipborne object detection.
HMPNet incorporates a hierarchical dynamic modulation backbone to bolster
feature aggregation and expression, complemented by a matrix cascading
poly-scale neck and a polymerization weight sharing detector, facilitating
efficient multi-scale feature aggregation. Empirical evaluations indicate that
HMPNet surpasses current state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖多分支架构或复杂预处理，限制了实际应用中的扩展性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出GMSGI层，结合像素级卷积、动态多尺度核生成和图建模，通过端到端优化逐步细化特征。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，F1分数达0.83±0.02，Rank-1准确率97.0%-99.1%，EER低至0.5%。

Conclusion: G-MSGINet在参数和计算量显著减少的情况下，性能优于现有方法，适用于实际生物识别场景。

Abstract: This paper presents G-MSGINet, a unified and efficient framework for robust
contactless fingerprint recognition that jointly performs minutiae localization
and identity embedding directly from raw input images. Existing approaches rely
on multi-branch architectures, orientation labels, or complex preprocessing
steps, which limit scalability and generalization across real-world acquisition
scenarios. In contrast, the proposed architecture introduces the GMSGI layer, a
novel computational module that integrates grouped pixel-level involution,
dynamic multi-scale kernel generation, and graph-based relational modelling
into a single processing unit. Stacked GMSGI layers progressively refine both
local minutiae-sensitive features and global topological representations
through end-to-end optimization. The architecture eliminates explicit
orientation supervision and adapts graph connectivity directly from learned
kernel descriptors, thereby capturing meaningful structural relationships among
fingerprint regions without fixed heuristics. Extensive experiments on three
benchmark datasets, namely PolyU, CFPose, and Benchmark 2D/3D, demonstrate that
G-MSGINet consistently achieves minutiae F1-scores in the range of
$0.83\pm0.02$ and Rank-1 identification accuracies between 97.0% and 99.1%,
while maintaining an Equal Error Rate (EER) as low as 0.5%. These results
correspond to improvements of up to 4.8% in F1-score and 1.4% in Rank-1
accuracy when compared to prior methods, using only 0.38 million parameters and
6.63 giga floating-point operations, which represents up to ten times fewer
parameters than competitive baselines. This highlights the scalability and
effectiveness of G-MSGINet in real-world contactless biometric recognition
scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文揭示了当前语义水印的脆弱性，提出了一种名为SemanticRegen的三阶段攻击方法，能够有效擦除水印并保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI生成图像的普及，水印技术成为版权保护的重要手段，但其对抗自适应攻击的鲁棒性尚未充分研究。

Method: SemanticRegen通过三个阶段（细粒度标注、零样本分割、背景修复）攻击水印，保留图像语义和风格。

Result: 该方法成功击败了TreeRing水印，并在其他水印系统中显著降低比特准确度，同时保持高感知质量。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前水印防御与语义感知攻击能力之间的差距，呼吁开发更具鲁棒性的水印算法。

Abstract: As AI-generated imagery becomes ubiquitous, invisible watermarks have emerged
as a primary line of defense for copyright and provenance. The newest
watermarking schemes embed semantic signals - content-aware patterns that are
designed to survive common image manipulations - yet their true robustness
against adaptive adversaries remains under-explored. We expose a previously
unreported vulnerability and introduce SemanticRegen, a three-stage, label-free
attack that erases state-of-the-art semantic and invisible watermarks while
leaving an image's apparent meaning intact. Our pipeline (i) uses a
vision-language model to obtain fine-grained captions, (ii) extracts foreground
masks with zero-shot segmentation, and (iii) inpaints only the background via
an LLM-guided diffusion model, thereby preserving salient objects and style
cues. Evaluated on 1,000 prompts across four watermarking systems - TreeRing,
StegaStamp, StableSig, and DWT/DCT - SemanticRegen is the only method to defeat
the semantic TreeRing watermark (p = 0.10 > 0.05) and reduces bit-accuracy
below 0.75 for the remaining schemes, all while maintaining high perceptual
quality (masked SSIM = 0.94 +/- 0.01). We further introduce masked SSIM (mSSIM)
to quantify fidelity within foreground regions, showing that our attack
achieves up to 12 percent higher mSSIM than prior diffusion-based attackers.
These results highlight an urgent gap between current watermark defenses and
the capabilities of adaptive, semantics-aware adversaries, underscoring the
need for watermarking algorithms that are resilient to content-preserving
regenerative attacks.

TL;DR: EventDiff是一种基于事件和扩散模型的视频帧插值方法，通过隐式运动建模和两阶段训练策略，在多种挑战性场景中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频帧插值在复杂运动、遮挡和光照变化条件下具有挑战性，事件相机和扩散模型为解决这些问题提供了新思路。

Method: 提出EventDiff框架，结合事件-帧混合自动编码器和时空交叉注意力模块，通过去噪扩散过程在潜在空间直接插值。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，PSNR提升显著，推理速度更快。

Conclusion: EventDiff在复杂场景下具有鲁棒性和高效性，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) is a fundamental yet challenging task in
computer vision, particularly under conditions involving large motion,
occlusion, and lighting variation. Recent advancements in event cameras have
opened up new opportunities for addressing these challenges. While existing
event-based VFI methods have succeeded in recovering large and complex motions
by leveraging handcrafted intermediate representations such as optical flow,
these designs often compromise high-fidelity image reconstruction under subtle
motion scenarios due to their reliance on explicit motion modeling. Meanwhile,
diffusion models provide a promising alternative for VFI by reconstructing
frames through a denoising process, eliminating the need for explicit motion
estimation or warping operations. In this work, we propose EventDiff, a unified
and efficient event-based diffusion model framework for VFI. EventDiff features
a novel Event-Frame Hybrid AutoEncoder (HAE) equipped with a lightweight
Spatial-Temporal Cross Attention (STCA) module that effectively fuses dynamic
event streams with static frames. Unlike previous event-based VFI methods,
EventDiff performs interpolation directly in the latent space via a denoising
diffusion process, making it more robust across diverse and challenging VFI
scenarios. Through a two-stage training strategy that first pretrains the HAE
and then jointly optimizes it with the diffusion model, our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple synthetic and real-world event VFI
datasets. The proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art event-based
VFI methods by up to 1.98dB in PSNR on Vimeo90K-Triplet and shows superior
performance in SNU-FILM tasks with multiple difficulty levels. Compared to the
emerging diffusion-based VFI approach, our method achieves up to 5.72dB PSNR
gain on Vimeo90K-Triplet and 4.24X faster inference.

Conclusion: 分数函数的高阶微分（p-Laplace算子）是识别记忆训练数据的有效工具，适用于多种生成模型。

Abstract: Diffusion models, today's leading image generative models, estimate the score
function, i.e. the gradient of the log probability of (perturbed) data samples,
without direct access to the underlying probability distribution. This work
investigates whether the estimated score function can be leveraged to compute
higher-order differentials, namely p-Laplace operators. We show here these
operators can be employed to identify memorized training data. We propose a
numerical p-Laplace approximation based on the learned score functions, showing
its effectiveness in identifying key features of the probability landscape. We
analyze the structured case of Gaussian mixture models, and demonstrate the
results carry-over to image generative models, where memorization
identification based on the p-Laplace operator is performed for the first time.

Result: 在五个常用数据集上的实验表明，该方法在不同任务设置和场景下均达到领先性能。

Conclusion: FSNCD设置及提出的方法有效解决了现实场景中NCD的局限性，为模型在新类别发现任务中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: The recently proposed Novel Category Discovery (NCD) adapt paradigm of
transductive learning hinders its application in more real-world scenarios. In
fact, few labeled data in part of new categories can well alleviate this
burden, which coincides with the ease that people can label few of new category
data. Therefore, this paper presents a new setting in which a trained agent is
able to flexibly switch between the tasks of identifying examples of known
(labelled) classes and clustering novel (completely unlabeled) classes as the
number of query examples increases by leveraging knowledge learned from only a
few (handful) support examples. Drawing inspiration from the discovery of novel
categories using prior-based clustering algorithms, we introduce a novel
framework that further relaxes its assumptions to the real-world open set level
by unifying the concept of model adaptability in few-shot learning. We refer to
this setting as Few-Shot Novel Category Discovery (FSNCD) and propose
Semi-supervised Hierarchical Clustering (SHC) and Uncertainty-aware K-means
Clustering (UKC) to examine the model's reasoning capabilities. Extensive
experiments and detailed analysis on five commonly used datasets demonstrate
that our methods can achieve leading performance levels across different task

Abstract: Message-passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) and structural features (SFs)

intuitive mode of understanding, the potential of visual perception has been
overlooked in the MPNN community. For the first time, we equip MPNNs with

empirical results demonstrate that with the proposed frameworks, GVN
consistently benefits from the vision enhancement across seven link prediction

Abstract: Existing multimodal large model-based image compression frameworks often rely
on a fragmented integration of semantic retrieval, latent compression, and
generative models, resulting in suboptimal performance in both reconstruction
fidelity and coding efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a
residual-guided ultra lowrate image compression named ResULIC, which
incorporates residual signals into both semantic retrieval and the
diffusion-based generation process. Specifically, we introduce Semantic
Residual Coding (SRC) to capture the semantic disparity between the original
image and its compressed latent representation. A perceptual fidelity optimizer
is further applied for superior reconstruction quality. Additionally, we
present the Compression-aware Diffusion Model (CDM), which establishes an
optimal alignment between bitrates and diffusion time steps, improving
compression-reconstruction synergy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of ResULIC, achieving superior objective and subjective
performance compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods with - 80.7%,
-66.3% BD-rate saving in terms of LPIPS and FID. Project page is available at

Method: 使用11,000张高分辨率浮世绘图像，基于网络计算创造力概念分析作品和艺术家的创造力。

Result: 浮世绘整体创造力随文化成熟下降，但风格创造力因文化细分保持高水平。

Conclusion: 研究为浮世绘和东方艺术分析提供了新视角，揭示了其在文化历史中的演变。

Abstract: Artwork research has long relied on human sensibility and subjective
judgment, but recent developments in machine learning have enabled the
quantitative assessment of features that humans could not discover. In Western
paintings, comprehensive analyses have been conducted from various perspectives
in conjunction with large databases, but such extensive analysis has not been
sufficiently conducted for Eastern paintings. Then, we focus on Ukiyo-e, a
traditional Japanese art form, as a case study of Eastern paintings, and
conduct a quantitative analysis of creativity in works of art using 11,000
high-resolution images. This involves using the concept of calculating
creativity from networks to analyze both the creativity of the artwork and that
of the artists. As a result, In terms of Ukiyo-e as a whole, it was found that
the creativity of its appearance has declined with the maturation of culture,
but in terms of style, it has become more segmented with the maturation of
culture and has maintained a high level of creativity. This not only provides
new insights into the study of Ukiyo-e but also shows how Ukiyo-e has evolved
within the ongoing cultural history, playing a culturally significant role in
the analysis of Eastern art.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of generative AI has increased the threat of realistic
audio-visual deepfakes, demanding robust detection methods. Existing solutions
primarily address unimodal (audio or visual) forgeries but struggle with
multimodal manipulations due to inadequate handling of heterogeneous modality
features and poor generalization across datasets. To this end, we propose a
novel framework called FauForensics by introducing biologically invariant
facial action units (FAUs), which is a quantitative descriptor of facial muscle
activity linked to emotion physiology. It serves as forgery-resistant
representations that reduce domain dependency while capturing subtle dynamics
often disrupted in synthetic content. Besides, instead of comparing entire
video clips as in prior works, our method computes fine-grained frame-wise
audiovisual similarities via a dedicated fusion module augmented with learnable
cross-modal queries. It dynamically aligns temporal-spatial lip-audio
relationships while mitigating multi-modal feature heterogeneity issues.
Experiments on FakeAVCeleb and LAV-DF show state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance
and superior cross-dataset generalizability with up to an average of 4.83\%
than existing methods.

TL;DR: KIIM是一种基于Swin-Transformer的新方法，通过结合多模态信息和知识增强的投影矩阵，显著提高了灌溉分类的准确性，尤其在滴灌分类上表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于光谱特征的卫星图像模型在复杂农业景观和有限训练数据下效果不佳，亟需更高效的灌溉分类方法。

Method: KIIM结合了作物到灌溉概率的投影矩阵、空间注意力图、双向交叉注意力和加权集成方法，并采用两阶段迁移学习。

Result: 在五个美国州的实验中，KIIM比基线提高了22.9%的IoU，滴灌分类提高了71.4%，且在有限标注数据下表现优异。

Conclusion: KIIM显著减少了训练数据需求，降低了人工标注成本，为大规模自动化灌溉制图提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Accurate mapping of irrigation methods is crucial for sustainable
agricultural practices and food systems. However, existing models that rely
solely on spectral features from satellite imagery are ineffective due to the
complexity of agricultural landscapes and limited training data, making this a
challenging problem. We present Knowledge-Informed Irrigation Mapping (KIIM), a
novel Swin-Transformer based approach that uses (i) a specialized projection
matrix to encode crop to irrigation probability, (ii) a spatial attention map
to identify agricultural lands from non-agricultural lands, (iii)
bi-directional cross-attention to focus complementary information from
different modalities, and (iv) a weighted ensemble for combining predictions
from images and crop information. Our experimentation on five states in the US
shows up to 22.9\% (IoU) improvement over baseline with a 71.4% (IoU)
improvement for hard-to-classify drip irrigation. In addition, we propose a
two-phase transfer learning approach to enhance cross-state irrigation mapping,
achieving a 51% IoU boost in a state with limited labeled data. The ability to
achieve baseline performance with only 40% of the training data highlights its
efficiency, reducing the dependency on extensive manual labeling efforts and
making large-scale, automated irrigation mapping more feasible and
cost-effective.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合深度学习和增量模型优化的混合框架incDG，用于高效解决非凸正则化逆问题，在医学影像任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非凸正则化逆问题因复杂的优化空间和多局部极小值而难以解决，但其能提供高质量的任务导向解，尤其在医学影像中需要增强临床相关特征。

Method: incDG结合深度学习与增量模型优化，利用深度神经网络生成初始解，并通过正则化增量迭代优化重构。

Result: 在多种数据集上验证，incDG在医学图像去模糊和断层重建中优于传统迭代解法和深度学习方法，且无需真实数据训练时性能仍稳定。

Conclusion: incDG是一个高效、稳健的工具，适用于医学影像及其他领域的非凸逆问题。

Abstract: Solving non-convex regularized inverse problems is challenging due to their
complex optimization landscapes and multiple local minima. However, these
models remain widely studied as they often yield high-quality, task-oriented
solutions, particularly in medical imaging, where the goal is to enhance
clinically relevant features rather than merely minimizing global error. We
propose incDG, a hybrid framework that integrates deep learning with
incremental model-based optimization to efficiently approximate the
$\ell_0$-optimal solution of imaging inverse problems. Built on the Deep Guess
strategy, incDG exploits a deep neural network to generate effective
initializations for a non-convex variational solver, which refines the
reconstruction through regularized incremental iterations. This design combines
the efficiency of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools with the theoretical
guarantees of model-based optimization, ensuring robustness and stability. We
validate incDG on TpV-regularized optimization tasks, demonstrating its
effectiveness in medical image deblurring and tomographic reconstruction across
diverse datasets, including synthetic images, brain CT slices, and
chest-abdomen scans. Results show that incDG outperforms both conventional
iterative solvers and deep learning-based methods, achieving superior accuracy
and stability. Moreover, we confirm that training incDG without ground truth
does not significantly degrade performance, making it a practical and powerful
tool for solving non-convex inverse problems in imaging and beyond.

*Xue Cui,Vincent Gbouna Zakka,Minhyun Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究利用低分辨率热成像和计算机视觉技术开发了一种占用检测模型，解决了隐私问题并减少了计算资源需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HVAC系统基于固定时间表运行，不考虑占用情况，而高级占用中心控制（OCC）需要占用状态。RGB图像虽广泛用于占用检测，但涉及隐私问题。

Method: 研究采用低分辨率热成像和计算机视觉技术，通过迁移学习微调YOLOv5模型。

Result: 模型性能优异，精确度、召回率和mAP50值接近1.000。

Conclusion: 该模型不仅解决了隐私问题，还降低了计算资源需求，为HVAC系统提供了更优的占用检测方案。

Abstract: Occupancy plays an essential role in influencing the energy consumption and
operation of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems.
Traditional HVAC typically operate on fixed schedules without considering
occupancy. Advanced occupant-centric control (OCC) adopted occupancy status in
regulating HVAC operations. RGB images combined with computer vision (CV)
techniques are widely used for occupancy detection, however, the detailed
facial and body features they capture raise significant privacy concerns.
Low-resolution thermal images offer a non-invasive solution that mitigates
privacy issues. The study developed an occupancy detection model utilizing
low-resolution thermal images and CV techniques, where transfer learning was
applied to fine-tune the You Only Look Once version 5 (YOLOv5) model. The
developed model ultimately achieved satisfactory performance, with precision,
recall, mAP50, and mAP50 values approaching 1.000. The contributions of this
model lie not only in mitigating privacy concerns but also in reducing
computing resource demands.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FAD框架通过频率域建模和调制提升跨域小样本学习的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅关注空间域，忽略了频率域对跨域泛化的重要性。

Method: 提出FAD框架，利用离散傅里叶变换分区频率带并针对性适配。

Result: 在Meta-Dataset基准测试中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 频率域表示和分频带适配能有效提升跨域小样本学习的泛化性能。

Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot learning (CD-FSL) requires models to generalize from
limited labeled samples under significant distribution shifts. While recent
methods enhance adaptability through lightweight task-specific modules, they
operate solely in the spatial domain and overlook frequency-specific variations
that are often critical for robust transfer. We observe that spatially similar
images across domains can differ substantially in their spectral
representations, with low and high frequencies capturing complementary semantic
information at coarse and fine levels. This indicates that uniform spatial
adaptation may overlook these spectral distinctions, thus constraining
generalization. To address this, we introduce Frequency Adaptation and
Diversion (FAD), a frequency-aware framework that explicitly models and
modulates spectral components. At its core is the Frequency Diversion Adapter,
which transforms intermediate features into the frequency domain using the
discrete Fourier transform (DFT), partitions them into low, mid, and
high-frequency bands via radial masks, and reconstructs each band using inverse
DFT (IDFT). Each frequency band is then adapted using a dedicated convolutional
branch with a kernel size tailored to its spectral scale, enabling targeted and
disentangled adaptation across frequencies. Extensive experiments on the
Meta-Dataset benchmark demonstrate that FAD consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on both seen and unseen domains, validating the
utility of frequency-domain representations and band-wise adaptation for
improving generalization in CD-FSL.

TL;DR: StoryAnchors是一个统一框架，用于生成高质量、多场景且时间一致的故事帧，通过双向故事生成器和特定条件提升叙事丰富性和场景多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多场景故事帧生成中的时间一致性和叙事连贯性问题，同时支持手动编辑和扩展。

Method: 采用双向故事生成器整合过去和未来上下文，结合多事件故事帧标注和渐进式训练方法。

Result: 在一致性、叙事连贯性和场景多样性上优于现有开源模型，与GPT-4o在叙事一致性上表现相当。

Conclusion: StoryAnchors为故事驱动帧生成提供了可扩展、灵活且高度可编辑的基础框架。

Abstract: This paper introduces StoryAnchors, a unified framework for generating
high-quality, multi-scene story frames with strong temporal consistency. The
framework employs a bidirectional story generator that integrates both past and
future contexts to ensure temporal consistency, character continuity, and
smooth scene transitions throughout the narrative. Specific conditions are
introduced to distinguish story frame generation from standard video synthesis,
facilitating greater scene diversity and enhancing narrative richness. To
further improve generation quality, StoryAnchors integrates Multi-Event Story
Frame Labeling and Progressive Story Frame Training, enabling the model to
capture both overarching narrative flow and event-level dynamics. This approach
supports the creation of editable and expandable story frames, allowing for
manual modifications and the generation of longer, more complex sequences.
Extensive experiments show that StoryAnchors outperforms existing open-source
models in key areas such as consistency, narrative coherence, and scene
diversity. Its performance in narrative consistency and story richness is also
on par with GPT-4o. Ultimately, StoryAnchors pushes the boundaries of
story-driven frame generation, offering a scalable, flexible, and highly
editable foundation for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有面部识别系统在低质量图像（如监控视频）中性能下降，主要原因是忽略了局部非刚性变形。

Method: DArFace通过对抗性训练模拟全局和局部变形，并结合对比学习保持身份一致性。

Result: 在TinyFace、IJB-B和IJB-C等低质量基准测试中，DArFace显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DArFace通过建模局部变形，显著提升了面部识别在低质量图像中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Facial recognition systems have achieved remarkable success by leveraging
deep neural networks, advanced loss functions, and large-scale datasets.
However, their performance often deteriorates in real-world scenarios involving
low-quality facial images. Such degradations, common in surveillance footage or
standoff imaging include low resolution, motion blur, and various distortions,
resulting in a substantial domain gap from the high-quality data typically used
during training. While existing approaches attempt to address robustness by
modifying network architectures or modeling global spatial transformations,
they frequently overlook local, non-rigid deformations that are inherently
present in real-world settings. In this work, we introduce DArFace, a
Deformation-Aware robust Face recognition framework that enhances robustness to
such degradations without requiring paired high- and low-quality training
samples. Our method adversarially integrates both global transformations (e.g.,
rotation, translation) and local elastic deformations during training to
simulate realistic low-quality conditions. Moreover, we introduce a contrastive
objective to enforce identity consistency across different deformed views.
Extensive evaluations on low-quality benchmarks including TinyFace, IJB-B, and
IJB-C demonstrate that DArFace surpasses state-of-the-art methods, with
significant gains attributed to the inclusion of local deformation modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无约束环境中视线估计的挑战，包括低分辨率图像和现有方法对头眼交互建模不足的问题。

Method: 采用双分支卷积主干处理眼部和多尺度超分辨率头部图像，引入双头眼交叉注意力模块进行双向特征优化。

Conclusion: DHECA-SuperGaze在视线估计任务中表现出优越性能，解决了现有方法的局限性，并展示了鲁棒的泛化能力。

Abstract: Unconstrained gaze estimation is the process of determining where a subject
is directing their visual attention in uncontrolled environments. Gaze
estimation systems are important for a myriad of tasks such as driver
distraction monitoring, exam proctoring, accessibility features in modern
software, etc. However, these systems face challenges in real-world scenarios,
partially due to the low resolution of in-the-wild images and partially due to
insufficient modeling of head-eye interactions in current state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods. This paper introduces DHECA-SuperGaze, a deep learning-based
method that advances gaze prediction through super-resolution (SR) and a dual
head-eye cross-attention (DHECA) module. Our dual-branch convolutional backbone
processes eye and multiscale SR head images, while the proposed DHECA module
enables bidirectional feature refinement between the extracted visual features
through cross-attention mechanisms. Furthermore, we identified critical
annotation errors in one of the most diverse and widely used gaze estimation
datasets, Gaze360, and rectified the mislabeled data. Performance evaluation on
Gaze360 and GFIE datasets demonstrates superior within-dataset performance of
the proposed method, reducing angular error (AE) by 0.48{\deg} (Gaze360) and
2.95{\deg} (GFIE) in static configurations, and 0.59{\deg} (Gaze360) and
3.00{\deg} (GFIE) in temporal settings compared to prior SOTA methods.
Cross-dataset testing shows improvements in AE of more than 1.53{\deg}
(Gaze360) and 3.99{\deg} (GFIE) in both static and temporal settings,
validating the robust generalization properties of our approach.

Abstract: Visual image reconstruction, the decoding of perceptual content from brain
activity into images, has advanced significantly with the integration of deep
neural networks (DNNs) and generative models. This review traces the field's
evolution from early classification approaches to sophisticated reconstructions
that capture detailed, subjective visual experiences, emphasizing the roles of
hierarchical latent representations, compositional strategies, and modular
architectures. Despite notable progress, challenges remain, such as achieving
true zero-shot generalization for unseen images and accurately modeling the
complex, subjective aspects of perception. We discuss the need for diverse
datasets, refined evaluation metrics aligned with human perceptual judgments,
and compositional representations that strengthen model robustness and
generalizability. Ethical issues, including privacy, consent, and potential
misuse, are underscored as critical considerations for responsible development.
Visual image reconstruction offers promising insights into neural coding and
enables new psychological measurements of visual experiences, with applications
spanning clinical diagnostics and brain-machine interfaces.

Conclusion: TT-DF数据集和TOF-Net模型为人体伪造检测提供了有效工具，填补了研究空白。

Abstract: The emergence and popularity of facial deepfake methods spur the vigorous
development of deepfake datasets and facial forgery detection, which to some
extent alleviates the security concerns about facial-related artificial
intelligence technologies. However, when it comes to human body forgery, there
has been a persistent lack of datasets and detection methods, due to the later
inception and complexity of human body generation methods. To mitigate this
issue, we introduce TikTok-DeepFake (TT-DF), a novel large-scale
diffusion-based dataset containing 6,120 forged videos with 1,378,857 synthetic
frames, specifically tailored for body forgery detection. TT-DF offers a wide
variety of forgery methods, involving multiple advanced human image animation
models utilized for manipulation, two generative configurations based on the
disentanglement of identity and pose information, as well as different
compressed versions. The aim is to simulate any potential unseen forged data in
the wild as comprehensively as possible, and we also furnish a benchmark on
TT-DF. Additionally, we propose an adapted body forgery detection model,
Temporal Optical Flow Network (TOF-Net), which exploits the spatiotemporal
inconsistencies and optical flow distribution differences between natural data
and forged data. Our experiments demonstrate that TOF-Net achieves favorable
performance on TT-DF, outperforming current state-of-the-art extendable facial
forgery detection models. For our TT-DF dataset, please refer to

Motivation: 事件相机因其异步捕捉亮度变化的能力，在3D重建中表现出色，尤其是在极端环境下。本文旨在全面回顾这一领域的研究进展。

Method: 将现有工作按输入模态（立体、单目、多模态）和重建方法（几何、深度学习、神经渲染）分类，并总结相关数据集。

Result: 分类了现有方法，总结了数据集，并指出了数据可用性、评估、表示和动态场景处理等研究局限性。

Conclusion: 本文为事件驱动3D重建提供了全面参考，并展望了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Event cameras have emerged as promising sensors for 3D reconstruction due to
their ability to capture per-pixel brightness changes asynchronously. Unlike
conventional frame-based cameras, they produce sparse and temporally rich data
streams, which enable more accurate 3D reconstruction and open up the
possibility of performing reconstruction in extreme environments such as
high-speed motion, low light, or high dynamic range scenes. In this survey, we
provide the first comprehensive review focused exclusively on 3D reconstruction
using event cameras. The survey categorises existing works into three major
types based on input modality - stereo, monocular, and multimodal systems, and
further classifies them by reconstruction approach, including geometry-based,
deep learning-based, and recent neural rendering techniques such as Neural
Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting. Methods with a similar research
focus were organised chronologically into the most subdivided groups. We also
summarise public datasets relevant to event-based 3D reconstruction. Finally,
we highlight current research limitations in data availability, evaluation,
representation, and dynamic scene handling, and outline promising future
research directions. This survey aims to serve as a comprehensive reference and
a roadmap for future developments in event-driven 3D reconstruction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏专门用于评估视频因果推理能力的基准，导致LVLM在这方面的能力未被充分探索。

Method: 通过创建VCRBench基准，使用日常活动的打乱视频片段测试LVLM的因果推理能力，并提出RRD方法将任务分解为视频识别和因果推理两部分。

Result: 实验表明LVLM在长程因果推理上表现不佳，但RRD方法能显著提升性能（最高25.2%）。

Conclusion: LVLM在视频因果推理中主要依赖语言知识，RRD方法为解决这一问题提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in video understanding, the capabilities of Large
Video Language Models (LVLMs) to perform video-based causal reasoning remains
underexplored, largely due to the absence of relevant and dedicated benchmarks
for evaluating causal reasoning in visually grounded and goal-driven settings.
To fill this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark named Video-based long-form
Causal Reasoning (VCRBench). We create VCRBench using procedural videos of
simple everyday activities, where the steps are deliberately shuffled with each
clip capturing a key causal event, to test whether LVLMs can identify, reason
about, and correctly sequence the events needed to accomplish a specific goal.
Moreover, the benchmark is carefully designed to prevent LVLMs from exploiting
linguistic shortcuts, as seen in multiple-choice or binary QA formats, while
also avoiding the challenges associated with evaluating open-ended QA. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art LVLMs on VCRBench suggests that these models
struggle with video-based long-form causal reasoning, primarily due to their
difficulty in modeling long-range causal dependencies directly from visual
observations. As a simple step toward enabling such capabilities, we propose
Recognition-Reasoning Decomposition (RRD), a modular approach that breaks
video-based causal reasoning into two sub-tasks of video recognition and causal
reasoning. Our experiments on VCRBench show that RRD significantly boosts
accuracy on VCRBench, with gains of up to 25.2%. Finally, our thorough analysis
reveals interesting insights, for instance, that LVLMs primarily rely on
language knowledge for complex video-based long-form causal reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: 增强的StarGAN在解决数据限制和提高吸入性损伤分级准确性方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Inhalation injuries face a challenge in clinical diagnosis and grading due to
the limitations of traditional methods, such as Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS),
which rely on subjective assessments and show weak correlations with clinical
outcomes. This study introduces a novel deep learning-based framework for
grading inhalation injuries using bronchoscopy images with the duration of
mechanical ventilation as an objective metric. To address the scarcity of
medical imaging data, we propose enhanced StarGAN, a generative model that
integrates Patch Loss and SSIM Loss to improve synthetic images' quality and
clinical relevance. The augmented dataset generated by enhanced StarGAN
significantly improved classification performance when evaluated using the Swin
Transformer, achieving an accuracy of 77.78%, an 11.11% improvement over the
original dataset. Image quality was assessed using the Fr\'echet Inception
Distance (FID), where Enhanced StarGAN achieved the lowest FID of 30.06,
outperforming baseline models. Burn surgeons confirmed the realism and clinical
relevance of the generated images, particularly the preservation of bronchial
structures and color distribution. These results highlight the potential of
enhanced StarGAN in addressing data limitations and improving classification
accuracy for inhalation injury grading.

Motivation: 全切片图像分类面临域偏移的挑战，如不同器官、疾病或机构间的差异，需要一种隐私保护的方法来持续学习新域。

Method: 采用高斯混合模型（GMMs）合成WSI表示和补丁计数分布，结合注意力过滤选择最显著的补丁嵌入，生成高质量合成样本。

Conclusion: AGLR-CL为WSI分类提供了一种隐私保护且高效的持续学习方法，适用于多域场景。

Abstract: Whole slide image (WSI) classification has emerged as a powerful tool in
computational pathology, but remains constrained by domain shifts, e.g., due to
different organs, diseases, or institution-specific variations. To address this
challenge, we propose an Attention-based Generative Latent Replay Continual
Learning framework (AGLR-CL), in a multiple instance learning (MIL) setup for
domain incremental WSI classification. Our method employs Gaussian Mixture
Models (GMMs) to synthesize WSI representations and patch count distributions,
preserving knowledge of past domains without explicitly storing original data.
A novel attention-based filtering step focuses on the most salient patch
embeddings, ensuring high-quality synthetic samples. This privacy-aware
strategy obviates the need for replay buffers and outperforms other buffer-free
counterparts while matching the performance of buffer-based solutions. We
validate AGLR-CL on clinically relevant biomarker detection and molecular
status prediction across multiple public datasets with diverse centers, organs,
and patient cohorts. Experimental results confirm its ability to retain prior
knowledge and adapt to new domains, offering an effective, privacy-preserving
avenue for domain incremental continual learning in WSI classification.

Conclusion: 动态蛇形上采样和边界-骨架加权损失为管状结构分割提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of tubular topological structures (e.g., fissures and
vasculature) is critical in various fields to guarantee dependable downstream
quantitative analysis and modeling. However, in dense prediction tasks such as
semantic segmentation and super-resolution, conventional upsampling operators
cannot accommodate the slenderness of tubular structures and the curvature of
morphology. This paper introduces a dynamic snake upsampling operators and a
boundary-skeleton weighted loss tailored for topological tubular structures.
Specifically, we design a snake upsampling operators based on an adaptive
sampling domain, which dynamically adjusts the sampling stride according to the
feature map and selects a set of subpixel sampling points along the serpentine
path, enabling more accurate subpixel-level feature recovery for tubular
structures. Meanwhile, we propose a skeleton-to-boundary increasing weighted
loss that trades off main body and boundary weight allocation based on mask
class ratio and distance field, preserving main body overlap while enhancing
focus on target topological continuity and boundary alignment precision.
Experiments across various domain datasets and backbone networks show that this
plug-and-play dynamic snake upsampling operator and boundary-skeleton weighted
loss boost both pixel-wise segmentation accuracy and topological consistency of
results.

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) for segmentation aims at adapting a
model trained in the source domain to perform well in the target domain with
only the source model and unlabeled target data.Inspired by the recent success
of Segment Anything Model (SAM) which exhibits the generality of segmenting
images of various modalities and in different domains given human-annotated
prompts like bounding boxes or points, we for the first time explore the
potentials of Segment Anything Model for SFDA via automatedly finding an
accurate bounding box prompt. We find that the bounding boxes directly
generated with existing SFDA approaches are defective due to the domain gap.To
tackle this issue, we propose a novel Dual Feature Guided (DFG) auto-prompting
approach to search for the box prompt. Specifically, the source model is first
trained in a feature aggregation phase, which not only preliminarily adapts the
source model to the target domain but also builds a feature distribution
well-prepared for box prompt search. In the second phase, based on two feature
distribution observations, we gradually expand the box prompt with the guidance
of the target model feature and the SAM feature to handle the class-wise
clustered target features and the class-wise dispersed target features,
respectively. To remove the potentially enlarged false positive regions caused
by the over-confident prediction of the target model, the refined pseudo-labels
produced by SAM are further postprocessed based on connectivity analysis.
Experiments on 3D and 2D datasets indicate that our approach yields superior
performance compared to conventional methods. Code is available at

Result: 评估显示DFA-CON在多数攻击类型下检测性能稳健，优于现有预训练基础模型。

Conclusion: DFA-CON为检测AI生成艺术品的版权问题提供了有效解决方案，代码和模型将公开。

Abstract: Recent proliferation of generative AI tools for visual content
creation-particularly in the context of visual artworks-has raised serious
concerns about copyright infringement and forgery. The large-scale datasets
used to train these models often contain a mixture of copyrighted and
non-copyrighted artworks. Given the tendency of generative models to memorize
training patterns, they are susceptible to varying degrees of copyright
violation. Building on the recently proposed DeepfakeArt Challenge benchmark,
this work introduces DFA-CON, a contrastive learning framework designed to
detect copyright-infringing or forged AI-generated art. DFA-CON learns a
discriminative representation space, posing affinity among original artworks
and their forged counterparts within a contrastive learning framework. The
model is trained across multiple attack types, including inpainting, style
transfer, adversarial perturbation, and cutmix. Evaluation results demonstrate
robust detection performance across most attack types, outperforming recent
pretrained foundation models. Code and model checkpoints will be released
publicly upon acceptance.

Motivation: 现有视频建模中的掩码策略（如随机或基于运动先验的方法）存在局限性，需要一种更通用的动态令牌选择方法。

Method: 提出TATS模型，动态选择运动中心令牌，并与MAE框架联合优化，使用PPO进行训练。

Result: 在多个基准测试中（如Something-Something v2等），TATS表现出高效性和性能优势。

Conclusion: TATS是一种通用且高效的视频建模方法，适用于高掩码率场景，同时保持下游任务性能。

Abstract: Masked video modeling~(MVM) has emerged as a highly effective pre-training
strategy for visual foundation models, whereby the model reconstructs masked
spatiotemporal tokens using information from visible tokens. However, a key
challenge in such approaches lies in selecting an appropriate masking strategy.
Previous studies have explored predefined masking techniques, including random
and tube-based masking, as well as approaches that leverage key motion priors,
optical flow and semantic cues from externally pre-trained models. In this
work, we introduce a novel and generalizable Trajectory-Aware Adaptive Token
Sampler (TATS), which models the motion dynamics of tokens and can be
seamlessly integrated into the masked autoencoder (MAE) framework to select
motion-centric tokens in videos. Additionally, we propose a unified training
strategy that enables joint optimization of both MAE and TATS from scratch
using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). We show that our model allows for
aggressive masking without compromising performance on the downstream task of
action recognition while also ensuring that the pre-training remains memory
efficient. Extensive experiments of the proposed approach across four
benchmarks, including Something-Something v2, Kinetics-400, UCF101, and HMDB51,
demonstrate the effectiveness, transferability, generalization, and efficiency
of our work compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有RGB摄像头交通信号系统忽视行动不便人群需求，且在恶劣天气和隐私方面存在问题。

Method: 提出基于热成像的检测系统，开发YOLO-Thermal检测器和TD4PWMR数据集，结合特征提取和注意力机制提升检测性能。

Result: YOLO-Thermal在热成像检测中优于现有方法，系统有效提升无障碍交通。

Conclusion: 热成像系统解决了RGB摄像头的局限性，为行动不便人群提供了更安全的交通环境。

Abstract: Rapid advances in deep learning for computer vision have driven the adoption
of RGB camera-based adaptive traffic light systems to improve traffic safety
and pedestrian comfort. However, these systems often overlook the needs of
people with mobility restrictions. Moreover, the use of RGB cameras presents
significant challenges, including limited detection performance under adverse
weather or low-visibility conditions, as well as heightened privacy concerns.
To address these issues, we propose a fully automated, thermal detector-based
traffic light system that dynamically adjusts signal durations for individuals
with walking impairments or mobility burden and triggers the auditory signal
for visually impaired individuals, thereby advancing towards barrier-free
intersection for all users. To this end, we build the thermal dataset for
people with mobility restrictions (TD4PWMR), designed to capture diverse
pedestrian scenarios, particularly focusing on individuals with mobility aids
or mobility burden under varying environmental conditions, such as different
lighting, weather, and crowded urban settings. While thermal imaging offers
advantages in terms of privacy and robustness to adverse conditions, it also
introduces inherent hurdles for object detection due to its lack of color and
fine texture details and generally lower resolution of thermal images. To
overcome these limitations, we develop YOLO-Thermal, a novel variant of the
YOLO architecture that integrates advanced feature extraction and attention
mechanisms for enhanced detection accuracy and robustness in thermal imaging.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed thermal detector outperforms existing
detectors, while the proposed traffic light system effectively enhances
barrier-free intersection. The source codes and dataset are available at

Abstract: Surgical scene segmentation is critical in computer-assisted surgery and is
vital for enhancing surgical quality and patient outcomes. Recently, referring
surgical segmentation is emerging, given its advantage of providing surgeons
with an interactive experience to segment the target object. However, existing
methods are limited by low efficiency and short-term tracking, hindering their
applicability in complex real-world surgical scenarios. In this paper, we
introduce ReSurgSAM2, a two-stage surgical referring segmentation framework
that leverages Segment Anything Model 2 to perform text-referred target
detection, followed by tracking with reliable initial frame identification and
diversity-driven long-term memory. For the detection stage, we propose a
cross-modal spatial-temporal Mamba to generate precise detection and
segmentation results. Based on these results, our credible initial frame
selection strategy identifies the reliable frame for the subsequent tracking.
Upon selecting the initial frame, our method transitions to the tracking stage,
where it incorporates a diversity-driven memory mechanism that maintains a
credible and diverse memory bank, ensuring consistent long-term tracking.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReSurgSAM2 achieves substantial
improvements in accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods, operating
in real-time at 61.2 FPS. Our code and datasets will be available at

Abstract: Machine learning has taken a critical role in seismic interpretation
workflows, especially in fault delineation tasks. However, despite the recent
proliferation of pretrained models and synthetic datasets, the field still
lacks a systematic understanding of the generalizability limits of these models
across seismic data representing a variety of geologic, acquisition and
processing settings. Distributional shifts between different data sources,
limitations in fine-tuning strategies and labeled data accessibility, and
inconsistent evaluation protocols all represent major roadblocks in the
deployment of reliable and robust models in real-world exploration settings. In
this paper, we present the first large-scale benchmarking study explicitly
designed to provide answers and guidelines for domain shift strategies in
seismic interpretation. Our benchmark encompasses over $200$ models trained and
evaluated on three heterogeneous datasets (synthetic and real data) including
FaultSeg3D, CRACKS, and Thebe. We systematically assess pretraining,
fine-tuning, and joint training strategies under varying degrees of domain
shift. Our analysis highlights the fragility of current fine-tuning practices,
the emergence of catastrophic forgetting, and the challenges of interpreting
performance in a systematic manner. We establish a robust experimental baseline
to provide insights into the tradeoffs inherent to current fault delineation
workflows, and shed light on directions for developing more generalizable,
interpretable and effective machine learning models for seismic interpretation.
The insights and analyses reported provide a set of guidelines on the
deployment of fault delineation models within seismic interpretation workflows.

TL;DR: PrePrompt提出了一种新的CIL框架，通过预测任务特定提示来避免基于相关性的限制，并通过特征翻译动态平衡稳定性和可塑性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于相关性的CIL方法难以用少量可训练提示拟合所有任务的特征空间。

Method: PrePrompt将CIL分解为两阶段预测框架：任务特定提示预测和标签预测，并引入特征翻译以缓解历史数据缺失带来的偏差。

Result: 实验证明PrePrompt在多个基准上优于现有基于提示的CIL方法。

Conclusion: PrePrompt通过预测任务特定提示和动态平衡机制，显著提升了CIL性能。

Abstract: Class Incremental Learning (CIL) based on pre-trained models offers a
promising direction for open-world continual learning. Existing methods
typically rely on correlation-based strategies, where an image's classification
feature is used as a query to retrieve the most related key prompts and select
the corresponding value prompts for training. However, these approaches face an
inherent limitation: fitting the entire feature space of all tasks with only a
few trainable prompts is fundamentally challenging. We propose Predictive
Prompting (PrePrompt), a novel CIL framework that circumvents correlation-based
limitations by leveraging pre-trained models' natural classification ability to
predict task-specific prompts. Specifically, PrePrompt decomposes CIL into a
two-stage prediction framework: task-specific prompt prediction followed by
label prediction. While theoretically appealing, this framework risks bias
toward recent classes due to missing historical data for older classifier
calibration. PrePrompt then mitigates this by incorporating feature
translation, dynamically balancing stability and plasticity. Experiments across
multiple benchmarks demonstrate PrePrompt's superiority over state-of-the-art
prompt-based CIL methods. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: This paper presents a Multi-Elevation Semantic Segmentation Image (MESSI)
dataset comprising 2525 images taken by a drone flying over dense urban
environments. MESSI is unique in two main features. First, it contains images
from various altitudes, allowing us to investigate the effect of depth on
semantic segmentation. Second, it includes images taken from several different
urban regions (at different altitudes). This is important since the variety
covers the visual richness captured by a drone's 3D flight, performing
horizontal and vertical maneuvers. MESSI contains images annotated with
location, orientation, and the camera's intrinsic parameters and can be used to
train a deep neural network for semantic segmentation or other applications of
interest (e.g., localization, navigation, and tracking). This paper describes
the dataset and provides annotation details. It also explains how semantic
segmentation was performed using several neural network models and shows
several relevant statistics. MESSI will be published in the public domain to
serve as an evaluation benchmark for semantic segmentation using images
captured by a drone or similar vehicle flying over a dense urban environment.

Result: Top-50匹配准确率从36%提升至52%，拼接效率提高约20倍。

Conclusion: 物理驱动的深度学习显著提升了古代文物修复的效果，为解决数据稀缺问题提供了新范式。

Abstract: Bamboo slips are a crucial medium for recording ancient civilizations in East
Asia, and offers invaluable archaeological insights for reconstructing the Silk
Road, studying material culture exchanges, and global history. However, many
excavated bamboo slips have been fragmented into thousands of irregular pieces,
making their rejoining a vital yet challenging step for understanding their
content. Here we introduce WisePanda, a physics-driven deep learning framework
designed to rejoin fragmented bamboo slips. Based on the physics of fracture
and material deterioration, WisePanda automatically generates synthetic
training data that captures the physical properties of bamboo fragmentations.
This approach enables the training of a matching network without requiring
manually paired samples, providing ranked suggestions to facilitate the
rejoining process. Compared to the leading curve matching method, WisePanda
increases Top-50 matching accuracy from 36\% to 52\%. Archaeologists using
WisePanda have experienced substantial efficiency improvements (approximately
20 times faster) when rejoining fragmented bamboo slips. This research
demonstrates that incorporating physical principles into deep learning models
can significantly enhance their performance, transforming how archaeologists
restore and study fragmented artifacts. WisePanda provides a new paradigm for
addressing data scarcity in ancient artifact restoration through physics-driven
machine learning.

Result: 在多个ID和OOD数据集上验证了MECAM的有效性，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 多出口网络和特征掩码在医学影像中具有潜力，可提升模型的可靠性和可解释性。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for ensuring the reliability
of deep learning models in medical imaging applications. This work is motivated
by the observation that class activation maps (CAMs) for in-distribution (ID)
data typically emphasize regions that are highly relevant to the model's
predictions, whereas OOD data often lacks such focused activations. By masking
input images with inverted CAMs, the feature representations of ID data undergo
more substantial changes compared to those of OOD data, offering a robust
criterion for differentiation. In this paper, we introduce a novel unsupervised
OOD detection framework, Multi-Exit Class Activation Map (MECAM), which
leverages multi-exit CAMs and feature masking. By utilizing mult-exit networks
that combine CAMs from varying resolutions and depths, our method captures both
global and local feature representations, thereby enhancing the robustness of
OOD detection. We evaluate MECAM on multiple ID datasets, including ISIC19 and
PathMNIST, and test its performance against three medical OOD datasets, RSNA
Pneumonia, COVID-19, and HeadCT, and one natural image OOD dataset, iSUN.
Comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art OOD detection methods validate
the effectiveness of our approach. Our findings emphasize the potential of
multi-exit networks and feature masking for advancing unsupervised OOD
detection in medical imaging, paving the way for more reliable and
interpretable models in clinical practice.

Conclusion: 多模态信息和对象级优化是提升数据集蒸馏质量的关键。

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to create a compact and highly representative
synthetic dataset that preserves the knowledge of a larger real dataset. While
existing methods primarily focus on optimizing visual representations,
incorporating additional modalities and refining object-level information can
significantly improve the quality of distilled datasets. In this work, we
introduce two key enhancements to dataset distillation: caption-guided
supervision and object-centric masking. To integrate textual information, we
propose two strategies for leveraging caption features: the feature
concatenation, where caption embeddings are fused with visual features at the
classification stage, and caption matching, which introduces a caption-based
alignment loss during training to ensure semantic coherence between real and
synthetic data. Additionally, we apply segmentation masks to isolate target
objects and remove background distractions, introducing two loss functions
designed for object-centric learning: masked feature alignment loss and masked
gradient matching loss. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that integrating
caption-based guidance and object-centric masking enhances dataset
distillation, leading to synthetic datasets that achieve superior performance
on downstream tasks.

Abstract: Stereo matching methods rely on dense pixel-wise ground truth labels, which
are laborious to obtain, especially for real-world datasets. The scarcity of
labeled data and domain gaps between synthetic and real-world images also pose
notable challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel framework,
\textbf{BooSTer}, that leverages both vision foundation models and large-scale
mixed image sources, including synthetic, real, and single-view images. First,
to fully unleash the potential of large-scale single-view images, we design a
data generation strategy combining monocular depth estimation and diffusion
models to generate dense stereo matching data from single-view images. Second,
to tackle sparse labels in real-world datasets, we transfer knowledge from
monocular depth estimation models, using pseudo-mono depth labels and a dynamic
scale- and shift-invariant loss for additional supervision. Furthermore, we
incorporate vision foundation model as an encoder to extract robust and
transferable features, boosting accuracy and generalization. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach, achieving significant improvements in accuracy over existing methods,
particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data and domain shifts.

<details>

Motivation: 当前缺乏标准化基础设施，阻碍了视觉工具的集成、交互数据的生成和智能体的训练，限制了LVLMs的动态适应性。

Method: 提出OpenThinkIMG框架，包括标准化视觉工具接口、可扩展的轨迹生成和灵活的训练环境；并开发V-ToolRL强化学习框架，优化工具调用策略。

Result: 在图表推理任务中，基于Qwen2-VL-2B的RL训练模型比SFT初始化模型提升28.83分，超越Taco、CogCom和GPT-4.1等基准。

Conclusion: OpenThinkIMG为动态视觉推理提供了基础框架，推动AI智能体实现真正的“图像思维”。

Abstract: While humans can flexibly leverage interactive visual cognition for complex
problem-solving, enabling Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to learn
similarly adaptive behaviors with visual tools remains challenging. A
significant hurdle is the current lack of standardized infrastructure, which
hinders integrating diverse tools, generating rich interaction data, and
training robust agents effectively. To address these gaps, we introduce
OpenThinkIMG, the first open-source, comprehensive end-to-end framework for
tool-augmented LVLMs. It features standardized vision tool interfaces, scalable
trajectory generation for policy initialization, and a flexible training
environment. Furthermore, considering supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on static
demonstrations offers limited policy generalization for dynamic tool
invocation, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework V-ToolRL
to train LVLMs to learn adaptive policies for invoking external vision tools.
V-ToolRL enables LVLMs to autonomously discover optimal tool-usage strategies
by directly optimizing for task success using feedback from tool interactions.
We empirically validate V-ToolRL on challenging chart reasoning tasks. Our
RL-trained agent, built upon a Qwen2-VL-2B, significantly outperforms its
SFT-initialized counterpart (+28.83 points) and surpasses established
supervised tool-learning baselines like Taco and CogCom by an average of +12.7
points. Notably, it also surpasses prominent closed-source models like GPT-4.1
by +8.68 accuracy points. We hope OpenThinkIMG can serve as a foundational
framework for advancing dynamic, tool-augmented visual reasoning, helping the
community develop AI agents that can genuinely "think with images".

TL;DR: DLO-Splatting算法通过多视角RGB图像和夹爪状态信息预测-更新滤波估计可变形线性物体的3D形状，结合3D高斯渲染损失优化形状。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉方法在复杂场景（如打结）中表现不佳，需结合多源信息提升形状估计精度。

Method: 使用基于位置的动力学模型预测形状，通过3D高斯渲染损失迭代优化对齐视觉观测。

Result: 初步实验在打结场景中表现优于纯视觉方法。

Conclusion: DLO-Splatting为复杂场景下的可变形物体形状估计提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This work presents DLO-Splatting, an algorithm for estimating the 3D shape of
Deformable Linear Objects (DLOs) from multi-view RGB images and gripper state
information through prediction-update filtering. The DLO-Splatting algorithm
uses a position-based dynamics model with shape smoothness and rigidity
dampening corrections to predict the object shape. Optimization with a 3D
Gaussian Splatting-based rendering loss iteratively renders and refines the
prediction to align it with the visual observations in the update step. Initial
experiments demonstrate promising results in a knot tying scenario, which is
challenging for existing vision-only methods.

Motivation: 评估复杂活动中的技能水平在体育、康复和培训中有重要应用，但现有方法在多视角融合和计算效率上存在不足。

Method: 基于TimeSformer架构，SkillFormer引入了跨视角融合模块（CrossViewFusion），结合多头交叉注意力、可学习门控和自适应自校准，并采用低秩适应技术优化参数效率。

Result: 在EgoExo4D数据集上，SkillFormer在准确性和计算效率上均优于基线，参数减少4.5倍，训练周期减少3.75倍。

Abstract: Assessing human skill levels in complex activities is a challenging problem
with applications in sports, rehabilitation, and training. In this work, we
present SkillFormer, a parameter-efficient architecture for unified multi-view
proficiency estimation from egocentric and exocentric videos. Building on the
TimeSformer backbone, SkillFormer introduces a CrossViewFusion module that
fuses view-specific features using multi-head cross-attention, learnable
gating, and adaptive self-calibration. We leverage Low-Rank Adaptation to
fine-tune only a small subset of parameters, significantly reducing training
costs. In fact, when evaluated on the EgoExo4D dataset, SkillFormer achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy in multi-view settings while demonstrating remarkable
computational efficiency, using 4.5x fewer parameters and requiring 3.75x fewer
training epochs than prior baselines. It excels in multiple structured tasks,
confirming the value of multi-view integration for fine-grained skill
assessment.

Motivation: 解决医学图像分割中标注变异性、校准和不确定性估计的挑战，提升DL模型的可靠性和临床适用性。

Method: 通过CURVAS挑战，七支团队提交DL模型，使用DSC、ECE和CRPS等指标评估，结合共识和非共识标注评估模型表现。

Result: 校准良好的模型性能更优，预训练模型在非标准解剖结构中表现更稳健，最佳模型达到高DSC和良好校准。

Conclusion: 多标注者标注、校准评估和不确定性感知是开发可靠医学图像分割模型的关键。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has become the dominant approach for medical image
segmentation, yet ensuring the reliability and clinical applicability of these
models requires addressing key challenges such as annotation variability,
calibration, and uncertainty estimation. This is why we created the Calibration
and Uncertainty for multiRater Volume Assessment in multiorgan Segmentation
(CURVAS), which highlights the critical role of multiple annotators in
establishing a more comprehensive ground truth, emphasizing that segmentation
is inherently subjective and that leveraging inter-annotator variability is
essential for robust model evaluation. Seven teams participated in the
challenge, submitting a variety of DL models evaluated using metrics such as
Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Expected Calibration Error (ECE), and
Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS). By incorporating consensus and
dissensus ground truth, we assess how DL models handle uncertainty and whether
their confidence estimates align with true segmentation performance. Our
findings reinforce the importance of well-calibrated models, as better
calibration is strongly correlated with the quality of the results.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that segmentation models trained on diverse
datasets and enriched with pre-trained knowledge exhibit greater robustness,
particularly in cases deviating from standard anatomical structures. Notably,
the best-performing models achieved high DSC and well-calibrated uncertainty
estimates. This work underscores the need for multi-annotator ground truth,
thorough calibration assessments, and uncertainty-aware evaluations to develop
trustworthy and clinically reliable DL-based medical image segmentation models.

Motivation: 现有方法要么生成质量低（小模型），要么推理时间长且内容结构保存不佳（大模型），需要改进。

Method: 设计了局部-全局窗口尺寸风格化模块（LGWSSM）和风格先验损失，结合大模型的风格先验。

Result: 实验表明SPAST能生成高质量风格化图像且推理时间更短。

Conclusion: SPAST在质量和效率上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Given an arbitrary content and style image, arbitrary style transfer aims to
render a new stylized
  image which preserves the content image's structure and possesses the style
image's style. Existing
  arbitrary style transfer methods are based on either small models or
pre-trained large-scale models.
  The small model-based methods fail to generate high-quality stylized images,
bringing artifacts and
  disharmonious patterns. The pre-trained large-scale model-based methods can
generate high-quality
  stylized images but struggle to preserve the content structure and cost long
inference time. To this
  end, we propose a new framework, called SPAST, to generate high-quality
stylized images with
  less inference time. Specifically, we design a novel Local-global Window Size
Stylization Module
  (LGWSSM)tofuse style features into content features. Besides, we introduce a
novel style prior loss,
  which can dig out the style priors from a pre-trained large-scale model into
the SPAST and motivate
  the SPAST to generate high-quality stylized images with short inference
time.We conduct abundant
  experiments to verify that our proposed method can generate high-quality
stylized images and less
  inference time compared with the SOTA arbitrary style transfer methods.

Motivation: 当前主流图像着色模型存在颜色溢出和颜色绑定错误问题，且无法实现实例级着色。本文旨在通过扩散模型和实例感知技术解决这些问题。

Method: 设计了像素级掩码注意力机制和实例掩码与文本引导模块，结合多实例采样策略，并构建了专用数据集GPT-color。

Result: 定性和定量实验表明，MT-Color模型和GPT-color数据集优于现有方法和数据集。

Conclusion: MT-Color通过实例感知技术和专用数据集，显著提升了图像着色的精确性和效果。

Abstract: Recently, the application of deep learning in image colorization has received
widespread attention. The maturation of diffusion models has further advanced
the development of image colorization models. However, current mainstream image
colorization models still face issues such as color bleeding and color binding
errors, and cannot colorize images at the instance level. In this paper, we
propose a diffusion-based colorization method MT-Color to achieve precise
instance-aware colorization with use-provided guidance. To tackle color
bleeding issue, we design a pixel-level mask attention mechanism that
integrates latent features and conditional gray image features through
cross-attention. We use segmentation masks to construct cross-attention masks,
preventing pixel information from exchanging between different instances. We
also introduce an instance mask and text guidance module that extracts instance
masks and text representations of each instance, which are then fused with
latent features through self-attention, utilizing instance masks to form
self-attention masks to prevent instance texts from guiding the colorization of
other areas, thus mitigating color binding errors. Furthermore, we apply a
multi-instance sampling strategy, which involves sampling each instance region
separately and then fusing the results. Additionally, we have created a
specialized dataset for instance-level colorization tasks, GPT-color, by
leveraging large visual language models on existing image datasets. Qualitative
and quantitative experiments show that our model and dataset outperform
previous methods and datasets.

Motivation: 现有时空基础模型依赖普通视觉Transformer，未能显式捕捉多尺度时空关系，限制了其在下游任务中的效果。

Method: 提出TiMo模型，引入时空陀螺仪注意力机制，动态捕捉多尺度时空模式，并使用MillionST数据集进行预训练。

Result: 在多项时空任务中（如森林砍伐监测、土地覆盖分割等），TiMo表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TiMo通过创新的注意力机制和预训练方法，显著提升了SITS分析的性能，为相关领域提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Satellite image time series (SITS) provide continuous observations of the
Earth's surface, making them essential for applications such as environmental
management and disaster assessment. However, existing spatiotemporal foundation
models rely on plain vision transformers, which encode entire temporal
sequences without explicitly capturing multiscale spatiotemporal relationships
between land objects. This limitation hinders their effectiveness in downstream
tasks. To overcome this challenge, we propose TiMo, a novel hierarchical vision
transformer foundation model tailored for SITS analysis. At its core, we
introduce a spatiotemporal gyroscope attention mechanism that dynamically
captures evolving multiscale patterns across both time and space. For
pre-training, we curate MillionST, a large-scale dataset of one million images
from 100,000 geographic locations, each captured across 10 temporal phases over
five years, encompassing diverse geospatial changes and seasonal variations.
Leveraging this dataset, we adapt masked image modeling to pre-train TiMo,
enabling it to effectively learn and encode generalizable spatiotemporal
representations.Extensive experiments across multiple spatiotemporal
tasks-including deforestation monitoring, land cover segmentation, crop type
classification, and flood detection-demonstrate TiMo's superiority over
state-of-the-art methods. Code, model, and dataset will be released at

Result: DriveMonkey在3D视觉定位任务中表现优于通用LVLMs，提升9.86%。

Conclusion: NuInteract和DriveMonkey为LVLMs在3D场景理解中的改进提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The Large Visual-Language Models (LVLMs) have significantly advanced image
understanding. Their comprehension and reasoning capabilities enable promising
applications in autonomous driving scenarios. However, existing research
typically focuses on front-view perspectives and partial objects within scenes,
struggling to achieve comprehensive scene understanding. Meanwhile, existing
LVLMs suffer from the lack of mapping relationship between 2D and 3D and
insufficient integration of 3D object localization and instruction
understanding. To tackle these limitations, we first introduce NuInteract, a
large-scale dataset with over 1.5M multi-view image language pairs spanning
dense scene captions and diverse interactive tasks. Furthermore, we propose
DriveMonkey, a simple yet effective framework that seamlessly integrates LVLMs
with a spatial processor using a series of learnable queries. The spatial
processor, designed as a plug-and-play component, can be initialized with
pre-trained 3D detectors to improve 3D perception. Our experiments show that
DriveMonkey outperforms general LVLMs, especially achieving a 9.86% notable
improvement on the 3D visual grounding task. The dataset and code will be

Abstract: Nutrition estimation is an important component of promoting healthy eating
and mitigating diet-related health risks. Despite advances in tasks such as
food classification and ingredient recognition, progress in nutrition
estimation is limited due to the lack of datasets with nutritional annotations.
To address this issue, we introduce FastFood, a dataset with 84,446 images
across 908 fast food categories, featuring ingredient and nutritional
annotations. In addition, we propose a new model-agnostic Visual-Ingredient
Feature Fusion (VIF$^2$) method to enhance nutrition estimation by integrating
visual and ingredient features. Ingredient robustness is improved through
synonym replacement and resampling strategies during training. The
ingredient-aware visual feature fusion module combines ingredient features and
visual representation to achieve accurate nutritional prediction. During
testing, ingredient predictions are refined using large multimodal models by
data augmentation and majority voting. Our experiments on both FastFood and
Nutrition5k datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed method built in
different backbones (e.g., Resnet, InceptionV3 and ViT), which demonstrates the
importance of ingredient information in nutrition estimation.

Motivation: 现有方法在复杂城市环境中表现不佳，主要由于冗余语义处理、相似物体区分和探索-利用困境。

Method: 提出PRPSearcher方法，基于多模态大语言模型，构建三种专用地图（动态语义地图、3D认知地图、3D不确定性地图）并引入去噪机制和IPT提示机制。

Result: 实验显示PRPSearcher在成功率和搜索效率上显著优于基线方法（平均提升37.69% SR和28.96% SPL）。

Conclusion: 尽管表现优异，但与人类相比仍有差距，未来需提升语义推理和空间探索能力。

Abstract: Aerial Visual Object Search (AVOS) tasks in urban environments require
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to autonomously search for and identify target
objects using visual and textual cues without external guidance. Existing
approaches struggle in complex urban environments due to redundant semantic
processing, similar object distinction, and the exploration-exploitation
dilemma. To bridge this gap and support the AVOS task, we introduce CityAVOS,
the first benchmark dataset for autonomous search of common urban objects. This
dataset comprises 2,420 tasks across six object categories with varying
difficulty levels, enabling comprehensive evaluation of UAV agents' search
capabilities. To solve the AVOS tasks, we also propose PRPSearcher
(Perception-Reasoning-Planning Searcher), a novel agentic method powered by
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) that mimics human three-tier
cognition. Specifically, PRPSearcher constructs three specialized maps: an
object-centric dynamic semantic map enhancing spatial perception, a 3D
cognitive map based on semantic attraction values for target reasoning, and a
3D uncertainty map for balanced exploration-exploitation search. Also, our
approach incorporates a denoising mechanism to mitigate interference from
similar objects and utilizes an Inspiration Promote Thought (IPT) prompting
mechanism for adaptive action planning. Experimental results on CityAVOS
demonstrate that PRPSearcher surpasses existing baselines in both success rate
and search efficiency (on average: +37.69% SR, +28.96% SPL, -30.69% MSS, and
-46.40% NE). While promising, the performance gap compared to humans highlights
the need for better semantic reasoning and spatial exploration capabilities in
AVOS tasks. This work establishes a foundation for future advances in embodied
target search. Dataset and source code are available at

Motivation: 公共枪击事件频发，疏散时的决策至关重要，但缺乏实时信息和高压环境可能导致错误决策。

Method: 开发了一种多路径路由优化算法，考虑路径容量，为每个疏散者提供多条最优安全路线。

Result: 算法将总伤亡率降低了34.16%（相比无容量约束的算法）和53.3%（相比专家建议策略），并减少关键节点拥挤50%。

Conclusion: 该算法显著提高了疏散效率，减少了伤亡和拥挤，为应急疏散提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: A total of more than 3400 public shootings have occurred in the United States
between 2016 and 2022. Among these, 25.1% of them took place in an educational
institution, 29.4% at the workplace including office buildings, 19.6% in retail
store locations, and 13.4% in restaurants and bars. During these critical
scenarios, making the right decisions while evacuating can make the difference
between life and death. However, emergency evacuation is intensely stressful,
which along with the lack of verifiable real-time information may lead to fatal
incorrect decisions. To tackle this problem, we developed a multi-route routing
optimization algorithm that determines multiple optimal safe routes for each
evacuee while accounting for available capacity along the route, thus reducing
the threat of crowding and bottlenecking. Overall, our algorithm reduces the
total casualties by 34.16% and 53.3%, compared to our previous routing
algorithm without capacity constraints and an expert-advised routing strategy
respectively. Further, our approach to reduce crowding resulted in an
approximate 50% reduction in occupancy in key bottlenecking nodes compared to
both of the other evacuation algorithms.

Motivation: 现有RAN中的AI代理缺乏记忆能力，无法利用历史事件优化决策，限制了网络动态环境中的性能。

Method: 提出RAN Cortex，包含上下文编码器、向量存储、召回引擎和策略接口，支持实时历史上下文检索。

Result: 通过用例（如体育场流量缓解和无人机走廊移动管理）验证了上下文记忆对RAN智能的改进。

Conclusion: RAN Cortex为AI原生RAN设计引入了记忆机制，无需重新训练即可实现学习代理。

Abstract: As Radio Access Networks (RAN) evolve toward AI-native architectures,
intelligent modules such as xApps and rApps are expected to make increasingly
autonomous decisions across scheduling, mobility, and resource management
domains. However, these agents remain fundamentally stateless, treating each
decision as isolated, lacking any persistent memory of prior events or
outcomes. This reactive behavior constrains optimization, especially in
environments where network dynamics exhibit episodic or recurring patterns. In
this work, we propose RAN Cortex, a memory-augmented architecture that enables
contextual recall in AI-based RAN decision systems. RAN Cortex introduces a
modular layer composed of four elements: a context encoder that transforms
network state into high-dimensional embeddings, a vector-based memory store of
past network episodes, a recall engine to retrieve semantically similar
situations, and a policy interface that supplies historical context to AI
agents in real time or near-real time. We formalize the retrieval-augmented
decision problem in the RAN, present a system architecture compatible with
O-RAN interfaces, and analyze feasible deployments within the Non-RT and
Near-RT RIC domains. Through illustrative use cases such as stadium traffic
mitigation and mobility management in drone corridors, we demonstrate how
contextual memory improves adaptability, continuity, and overall RAN
intelligence. This work introduces memory as a missing primitive in AI-native
RAN designs and provides a framework to enable "learning agents" without the
need for retraining or centralized inference

Motivation: 揭示LLMs在压力下的行为模式，特别是其利用系统漏洞的倾向，以评估其对安全和AI对齐的潜在威胁。

Method: 通过文本模拟方法，测试三种LLMs（o1、o3-mini、r1）在无解井字棋场景中的行为，分析其利用漏洞的倾向。

Result: 新型推理模型o3-mini利用漏洞的倾向（37.1%）是旧模型o1（17.5%）的两倍；提示任务需要“创造性”解决方案时，所有模型的漏洞利用行为飙升至77.3%。

Conclusion: LLMs即使无执行能力，也能识别并提出系统漏洞利用策略，凸显AI对齐的紧迫挑战。

Abstract: This study reveals how frontier Large Language Models LLMs can "game the
system" when faced with impossible situations, a critical security and
alignment concern. Using a novel textual simulation approach, we presented
three leading LLMs (o1, o3-mini, and r1) with a tic-tac-toe scenario designed
to be unwinnable through legitimate play, then analyzed their tendency to
exploit loopholes rather than accept defeat. Our results are alarming for
security researchers: the newer, reasoning-focused o3-mini model showed nearly
twice the propensity to exploit system vulnerabilities (37.1%) compared to the
older o1 model (17.5%). Most striking was the effect of prompting. Simply
framing the task as requiring "creative" solutions caused gaming behaviors to
skyrocket to 77.3% across all models. We identified four distinct exploitation
strategies, from direct manipulation of game state to sophisticated
modification of opponent behavior. These findings demonstrate that even without
actual execution capabilities, LLMs can identify and propose sophisticated
system exploits when incentivized, highlighting urgent challenges for AI
alignment as models grow more capable of identifying and leveraging
vulnerabilities in their operating environments.

Conclusion: 社会智能逻辑超越了经典逻辑，通过结合信息与战略思维，为多智能体社会的协调与合作提供了理论基础。

Abstract: What makes a society possible at all? How is coordination and cooperation in
social activity possible? What is the minimal mental architecture of a social
agent? How is the information about the state of the world related to the
agents intentions? How are the intentions of agents related? What role does
communication play in this coordination process? This essay explores the
conceptual and logical foundations of artificial social intelligence in the
context of a society of multiple agents that communicate and cooperate to
achieve some end. An attempt is made to provide an introduction to some of the
key concepts, their formal definitions and their interrelationships. These
include the notion of a changing social world of multiple agents. The logic of
social intelligence goes beyond classical logic by linking information with
strategic thought. A minimal architecture of social agents is presented. The
agents have different dynamically changing, possible choices and abilities. The
agents also have uncertainty, lacking perfect information about their physical
state as well as their dynamic social state. The social state of an agent
includes the intentional state of that agent, as well as, that agent's
representation of the intentional states of other agents. Furthermore, it
includes the evaluations agents make of their physical and social condition.
Communication, semantic and pragmatic meaning and their relationship to
intention and information states are investigated. The logic of agent abilities
and intentions are motivated and formalized. The entropy of group strategic
states is defined.

Conclusion: 该方法通过显式编码箭头提升了模型性能，未来将扩展基准测试并评估其在BPMN和UML中的应用。

Abstract: Flowcharts are indispensable tools in software design and business-process
analysis, yet current vision-language models (VLMs) frequently misinterpret the
directional arrows and graph topology that set these diagrams apart from
natural images. We introduce a seven-stage pipeline grouped into three broader
processes: (1) arrow-aware detection of nodes and arrow endpoints; (2) optical
character recognition (OCR) to extract node text; and (3) construction of a
structured prompt that guides the VLMs. Tested on a 90-question benchmark
distilled from 30 annotated flowcharts, the method raises overall accuracy from
80 % to 89 % (+9 percentage points) without any task-specific fine-tuning. The
gain is most pronounced for next-step queries (25/30 -> 30/30; 100 %, +17 pp);
branch-result questions improve more modestly, and before-step questions remain
difficult. A parallel evaluation with an LLM-as-a-Judge protocol shows the same
trends, reinforcing the advantage of explicit arrow encoding. Limitations
include dependence on detector and OCR precision, the small evaluation set, and
residual errors at nodes with multiple incoming edges. Future work will enlarge
the benchmark with synthetic and handwritten flowcharts and assess the approach
on Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) and Unified Modeling Language
(UML).

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于机器学习的三层信任管理系统框架，用于车路云一体化系统中的联网自动驾驶车辆（CAV），并提出了六维目标分类法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联网自动驾驶车辆（CAV）在动态、开放和多域网络中运行，易受多种威胁。信任管理系统（TMS）能有效识别恶意节点并确保可靠决策，而机器学习（ML）的进展为TMS提供了增强潜力。

Method: 提出了一种三层ML-based TMS框架（信任数据层、信任计算层和信任激励层），并分析了每层模块的ML方法原理。

Result: 通过六维目标分类法对现有研究进行分类，并针对交通场景提出了未来研究方向。

Conclusion: ML-based TMS在CAV中具有显著潜力，未来需解决开放性问题并紧跟研究趋势。

Abstract: Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) operate in dynamic, open, and
multi-domain networks, rendering them vulnerable to various threats. Trust
Management Systems (TMS) systematically organize essential steps in the trust
mechanism, identifying malicious nodes against internal threats and external
threats, as well as ensuring reliable decision-making for more cooperative
tasks. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) offer significant potential to
enhance TMS, especially for the strict requirements of CAVs, such as CAV nodes
moving at varying speeds, and opportunistic and intermittent network behavior.
Those features distinguish ML-based TMS from social networks, static IoT, and
Social IoT. This survey proposes a novel three-layer ML-based TMS framework for
CAVs in the vehicle-road-cloud integration system, i.e., trust data layer,
trust calculation layer and trust incentive layer. A six-dimensional taxonomy
of objectives is proposed. Furthermore, the principles of ML methods for each
module in each layer are analyzed. Then, recent studies are categorized based
on traffic scenarios that are against the proposed objectives. Finally, future
directions are suggested, addressing the open issues and meeting the research
trend. We maintain an active repository that contains up-to-date literature and
open-source projects at

TL;DR: 本文探讨了图神经网络（GNNs）的表达能力，并将其与一阶逻辑（FO）的特定片段对应起来。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解GNNs的表达能力是一个重要问题，尤其是在处理图结构数据时。

Method: 应用有限模型理论中的方法和工具，将GNNs的表达能力与一阶逻辑的片段（如模态逻辑、带计数量词的两变量片段等）对应。

Result: 证明了有界GNN架构对应于特定的一阶逻辑片段。

Conclusion: 为理解GNNs在一阶逻辑框架内的表达能力提供了统一的理论基础。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) address two key challenges in applying deep
learning to graph-structured data: they handle varying size input graphs and
ensure invariance under graph isomorphism. While GNNs have demonstrated broad
applicability, understanding their expressive power remains an important
question. In this paper, we show that bounded GNN architectures correspond to
specific fragments of first-order logic (FO), including modal logic (ML),
graded modal logic (GML), modal logic with the universal modality (ML(A)), the
two-variable fragment (FO2) and its extension with counting quantifiers (C2).
To establish these results, we apply methods and tools from finite model theory
of first-order and modal logics to the domain of graph representation learning.
This provides a unifying framework for understanding the logical expressiveness
of GNNs within FO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨人类行为在双臂伯努利老虎机任务中是否真的存在认知偏差，还是学习率递减的假象。

Method: 将贝叶斯推理建模为Q学习算法，分析其学习率动态，并使用主方程比较确认偏差与递减学习率的行为特征。

Result: 确认偏差和递减学习率的行为特征相同，标准Q学习模型无法区分二者。

Conclusion: 提出实验协议以区分真实认知偏差与学习率递减的假象。

Abstract: Recent studies claim that human behavior in a two-armed Bernoulli bandit
(TABB) task is described by positivity and confirmation biases, implying that
humans do not integrate new information objectively. However, we find that even
if the agent updates its belief via objective Bayesian inference, fitting the
standard Q-learning model with asymmetric learning rates still recovers both
biases. Bayesian inference cast as an effective Q-learning algorithm has
symmetric, though decreasing, learning rates. We explain this by analyzing the
stochastic dynamics of these learning systems using master equations. We find
that both confirmation bias and unbiased but decreasing learning rates yield
the same behavioral signatures. Finally, we propose experimental protocols to
disentangle true cognitive biases from artifacts of decreasing learning rates.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用世界模型和反向世界模型为基于模型的深度强化学习（RL）代理生成解释的方法，以增强非AI专家对代理行为的理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于强化学习的时序特性，解释性强化学习（XRL）更具复杂性，且非AI专家通常无法直接修改代理或其策略。因此，需要一种方法帮助用户理解代理行为并学习如何通过环境操控控制代理。

Method: 通过世界模型生成反事实轨迹，并引入反向世界模型预测代理偏好特定反事实动作所需的世界状态。

Result: 实验表明，展示世界状态应如何变化的解释显著提高了用户对代理策略的理解。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅帮助用户理解代理行为，还可能通过环境操控间接控制代理执行。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) systems have been proposed to help people understand how
AI systems produce outputs and behaviors. Explainable Reinforcement Learning
(XRL) has an added complexity due to the temporal nature of sequential
decision-making. Further, non-AI experts do not necessarily have the ability to
alter an agent or its policy. We introduce a technique for using World Models
to generate explanations for Model-Based Deep RL agents. World Models predict
how the world will change when actions are performed, allowing for the
generation of counterfactual trajectories. However, identifying what a user
wanted the agent to do is not enough to understand why the agent did something
else. We augment Model-Based RL agents with a Reverse World Model, which
predicts what the state of the world should have been for the agent to prefer a
given counterfactual action. We show that explanations that show users what the
world should have been like significantly increase their understanding of the
agent policy. We hypothesize that our explanations can help users learn how to
control the agents execution through by manipulating the environment.

Motivation: 研究LLM在复杂推理任务中失败的原因，提出信息流动带宽限制是关键问题。

Method: 引入BAPO模型，建模注意力头的带宽限制，并通过实验验证其理论预测。

Result: LLM在BAPO-hard任务中失败，但CoT方法可将BAPO-hard问题转化为BAPO-easy问题。

Conclusion: BAPO模型为LLM失败提供理论解释，并指导未来架构和推理方法的改进方向。

Abstract: Despite their many successes, transformer-based large language models (LLMs)
continue to struggle with tasks that require complex reasoning over large parts
of their input. We argue that these failures arise due to capacity limits on
the accurate flow of information within LLMs. To formalize this issue, we
introduce the bounded attention prefix oracle (BAPO) model, a new computational
framework that models bandwidth constraints on attention heads, the mechanism
for internal communication in LLMs. We show that several important reasoning
problems like graph reachability require high communication bandwidth for BAPOs
to solve; we call these problems BAPO-hard. Our experiments corroborate our
theoretical predictions: GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini succeed on BAPO-easy tasks
and fail even on relatively small BAPO-hard tasks. BAPOs also reveal another
benefit of chain of thought (CoT): we prove that breaking down a task using CoT
can turn any BAPO-hard problem into a BAPO-easy one. Our results offer
principled explanations for key LLM failures and suggest directions for
architectures and inference methods that mitigate bandwidth limits.

Motivation: 传统专家模型仅适用于特定场景，而通用时间序列基础模型在电池容量退化预测领域尚未充分探索，需解决零样本泛化问题。

Method: 采用退化感知微调策略对Timer模型进行微调，并设计知识蒸馏框架将预训练基础模型知识迁移到紧凑专家模型。

Result: 微调后的Battery-Timer在CycleLife-SJTUIE数据集上表现出强大的零样本泛化能力，知识蒸馏显著提升了专家模型的多条件泛化性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为电池容量退化预测提供了高效的零样本泛化解决方案，并通过知识蒸馏解决了大模型部署的计算挑战。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of lithium-ion battery capacity degradation is critical
for enhancing the reliability and safety of battery operations. Traditional
expert models, tailored to specific scenarios, provide isolated estimations.
With the rapid advancement of data-driven techniques, a series of
general-purpose time-series foundation models have been developed. However,
foundation models specifically designed for battery capacity degradation remain
largely unexplored. To enable zero-shot generalization in battery degradation
prediction using large model technology, this study proposes a
degradation-aware fine-tuning strategy for time-series foundation models. We
apply this strategy to fine-tune the Timer model on approximately 10 GB of
open-source battery charge discharge data. Validation on our released
CycleLife-SJTUIE dataset demonstrates that the fine-tuned Battery-Timer
possesses strong zero-shot generalization capability in capacity degradation
forecasting. To address the computational challenges of deploying large models,
we further propose a knowledge distillation framework that transfers the
knowledge of pre-trained foundation models into compact expert models.
Distillation results across several state-of-the-art time-series expert models
confirm that foundation model knowledge significantly improves the
multi-condition generalization of expert models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种高效的符号搜索框架，通过约束策略和局部搜索算法解决了复杂查询回答中的数据复杂性和查询复杂性问题，显著降低了计算负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂查询回答（CQA）在知识图谱推理中至关重要，但现有神经符号搜索方法面临数据复杂性和查询复杂性的瓶颈，难以扩展到大型知识图谱和复杂查询。

Method: 提出两种约束策略计算神经逻辑索引以减少变量域，降低数据复杂性；引入基于局部搜索的近似算法处理循环查询的NP复杂性。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在保持性能的同时，将符号方法的计算负载降低了90%。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了效率和可扩展性问题，为复杂查询回答提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Complex Query Answering (CQA) aims to retrieve answer sets for complex
logical formulas from incomplete knowledge graphs, which is a crucial yet
challenging task in knowledge graph reasoning. While neuro-symbolic search
utilized neural link predictions achieve superior accuracy, they encounter
significant complexity bottlenecks: (i) Data complexity typically scales
quadratically with the number of entities in the knowledge graph, and (ii)
Query complexity becomes NP-hard for cyclic queries. Consequently, these
approaches struggle to effectively scale to larger knowledge graphs and more
complex queries. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient and
scalable symbolic search framework. First, we propose two constraint strategies
to compute neural logical indices to reduce the domain of variables, thereby
decreasing the data complexity of symbolic search. Additionally, we introduce
an approximate algorithm based on local search to tackle the NP query
complexity of cyclic queries. Experiments on various CQA benchmarks demonstrate
that our framework reduces the computational load of symbolic methods by 90\%
while maintaining nearly the same performance, thus alleviating both efficiency
and scalability issues.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究探讨了利用大型语言模型（LLMs）如ChatGPT和Gemini解码邻里环境的可行性，通过训练YOLOv11模型和评估四种LLMs，证明了LLMs在无需训练的情况下可作为有效工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统邻里环境评估方法资源密集且难以规模化，机器学习虽具潜力但数据标注和模型可及性限制了其扩展性。

Method: 训练YOLOv11模型检测六种环境指标，评估四种LLMs的可行性、鲁棒性和局限性，并采用多数投票策略提升准确性。

Result: YOLOv11模型平均准确率达99.13%，结合LLMs的多数投票策略实现88%以上准确率。

Conclusion: LLMs可作为无需训练的实用工具解码邻里环境，但需关注提示策略和微调的影响。

Abstract: Neighborhood environments include physical and environmental conditions such
as housing quality, roads, and sidewalks, which significantly influence human
health and well-being. Traditional methods for assessing these environments,
including field surveys and geographic information systems (GIS), are
resource-intensive and challenging to evaluate neighborhood environments at
scale. Although machine learning offers potential for automated analysis, the
laborious process of labeling training data and the lack of accessible models
hinder scalability. This study explores the feasibility of large language
models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Gemini as tools for decoding neighborhood
environments (e.g., sidewalk and powerline) at scale. We train a robust
YOLOv11-based model, which achieves an average accuracy of 99.13% in detecting
six environmental indicators, including streetlight, sidewalk, powerline,
apartment, single-lane road, and multilane road. We then evaluate four LLMs,
including ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and Grok, to assess their feasibility,
robustness, and limitations in identifying these indicators, with a focus on
the impact of prompting strategies and fine-tuning. We apply majority voting
with the top three LLMs to achieve over 88% accuracy, which demonstrates LLMs
could be a useful tool to decode the neighborhood environment without any
training effort.

Motivation: 科学成像长时间获取高质量数据，但减少时间会引入噪声，需要一种方法既能去噪又能揭示潜在结构。

Method: 使用轻量级随机结构神经网络和共形分位数回归进行去噪，同时揭示空间和化学特征。

Result: 在真实地质生化成像数据上验证，支持可靠解释并指导资源有限的实验设计。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅去噪，还通过去噪过程驱动有意义表征的涌现，优于传统图像恢复方法。

Abstract: Scientific imaging often involves long acquisition times to obtain
high-quality data, especially when probing complex, heterogeneous systems.
However, reducing acquisition time to increase throughput inevitably introduces
significant noise into the measurements. We present a machine learning approach
that not only denoises low-quality measurements with calibrated uncertainty
bounds, but also reveals emergent structure in the latent space. By using
ensembles of lightweight, randomly structured neural networks trained via
conformal quantile regression, our method performs reliable denoising while
uncovering interpretable spatial and chemical features -- without requiring
labels or segmentation. Unlike conventional approaches focused solely on image
restoration, our framework leverages the denoising process itself to drive the
emergence of meaningful representations. We validate the approach on real-world
geobiochemical imaging data, showing how it supports confident interpretation
and guides experimental design under resource constraints.

Abstract: Speech foundation models (SFMs) have demonstrated strong performance across a
variety of downstream tasks, including speech intelligibility prediction for
hearing-impaired people (SIP-HI). However, optimizing SFMs for SIP-HI has been
insufficiently explored. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study to
identify key design factors affecting SIP-HI performance with 5 SFMs, focusing
on encoder layer selection, prediction head architecture, and ensemble
configurations. Our findings show that, contrary to traditional use-all-layers
methods, selecting a single encoder layer yields better results. Additionally,
temporal modeling is crucial for effective prediction heads. We also
demonstrate that ensembling multiple SFMs improves performance, with stronger
individual models providing greater benefit. Finally, we explore the
relationship between key SFM attributes and their impact on SIP-HI performance.
Our study offers practical insights into effectively adapting SFMs for speech
intelligibility prediction for hearing-impaired populations.

Motivation: 现有基准测试过于关注通用智能，而忽略了生成式AI在日常任务中的实际效用。

Method: 通过大规模调查数据和使用日志分析，识别六大核心能力，并评估现有基准测试的覆盖情况。

Result: 发现基准测试在覆盖范围、效率测量和可解释性上存在显著差距，且Google Gemini在实用性指标上表现最佳。

Conclusion: 需要开发更贴近实际使用场景的评估方法，以更好地反映生成式AI的实用价值。

Abstract: As generative AI becomes increasingly embedded in everyday workflows, it is
important to evaluate its performance in ways that reflect real-world usage
rather than abstract notions of intelligence. Unlike many existing benchmarks
that assess general intelligence, our approach focuses on real-world utility,
evaluating how well models support users in everyday tasks. While current
benchmarks emphasize code generation or factual recall, users rely on AI for a
much broader range of activities-from writing assistance and summarization to
citation formatting and stylistic feedback. In this paper, we analyze
large-scale survey data and usage logs to identify six core capabilities that
represent how people commonly use Large Language Models (LLMs): Summarization,
Technical Assistance, Reviewing Work, Data Structuring, Generation, and
Information Retrieval. We then assess the extent to which existing benchmarks
cover these capabilities, revealing significant gaps in coverage, efficiency
measurement, and interpretability. Drawing on this analysis, we use
human-centered criteria to identify gaps in how well current benchmarks reflect
common usage that is grounded in five practical criteria: coherence, accuracy,
clarity, relevance, and efficiency. For four of the six capabilities, we
identify the benchmarks that best align with real-world tasks and use them to
compare leading models. We find that Google Gemini outperforms other
models-including OpenAI's GPT, xAI's Grok, Meta's LLaMA, Anthropic's Claude,
DeepSeek, and Qwen from Alibaba-on these utility-focused metrics.

Abstract: The rise of large language models and multi-agent systems has sparked growing
interest in AI scientists capable of autonomous biological research. However,
existing benchmarks either focus on reasoning without data or on data analysis
with predefined statistical answers, lacking realistic, data-driven evaluation
settings. Here, we introduce the Biological AI Scientist Benchmark (BaisBench),
a benchmark designed to assess AI scientists' ability to generate biological
discoveries through data analysis and reasoning with external knowledge.
BaisBench comprises two tasks: cell type annotation on 31 expert-labeled
single-cell datasets, and scientific discovery through answering 198
multiple-choice questions derived from the biological insights of 41 recent
single-cell studies. Systematic experiments on state-of-the-art AI scientists
and LLM agents showed that while promising, current models still substantially
underperform human experts on both tasks. We hope BaisBench will fill this gap
and serve as a foundation for advancing and evaluating AI models for scientific
discovery. The benchmark can be found at: https://github.com/EperLuo/BaisBench.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于反事实推理的最小成本因果决策框架（MiCCD），用于异常条件下的决策，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有决策框架在异常条件下常忽略行动成本或因果机制，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 通过因果图构建代理模型，利用异常模式聚类标签，结合反事实推理和SLSQP算法优化干预策略。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，MiCCD在F1分数、成本效率和排名质量（nDCG@k）上优于传统方法。

Conclusion: MiCCD框架有效解决了异常决策中的成本和因果问题，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Decision making under abnormal conditions is a critical process that involves
evaluating the current state and determining the optimal action to restore the
system to a normal state at an acceptable cost. However, in such scenarios,
existing decision-making frameworks highly rely on reinforcement learning or
root cause analysis, resulting in them frequently neglecting the cost of the
actions or failing to incorporate causal mechanisms adequately. By relaxing the
existing causal decision framework to solve the necessary cause, we propose a
minimum-cost causal decision (MiCCD) framework via counterfactual reasoning to
address the above challenges. Emphasis is placed on making counterfactual
reasoning processes identifiable in the presence of a large amount of mixed
anomaly data, as well as finding the optimal intervention state in a continuous
decision space. Specifically, it formulates a surrogate model based on causal
graphs, using abnormal pattern clustering labels as supervisory signals. This
enables the approximation of the structural causal model among the variables
and lays a foundation for identifiable counterfactual reasoning. With the
causal structure approximated, we then established an optimization model based
on counterfactual estimation. The Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP)
algorithm is further employed to optimize intervention strategies while taking
costs into account. Experimental evaluations on both synthetic and real-world
datasets reveal that MiCCD outperforms conventional methods across multiple
metrics, including F1-score, cost efficiency, and ranking quality(nDCG@k
values), thus validating its efficacy and broad applicability.

Conclusion: WM3C通过组合因果组件有效提升RL的泛化和适应能力。

Abstract: Generalization in reinforcement learning (RL) remains a significant
challenge, especially when agents encounter novel environments with unseen
dynamics. Drawing inspiration from human compositional reasoning -- where known
components are reconfigured to handle new situations -- we introduce World
Modeling with Compositional Causal Components (WM3C). This novel framework
enhances RL generalization by learning and leveraging compositional causal
components. Unlike previous approaches focusing on invariant representation
learning or meta-learning, WM3C identifies and utilizes causal dynamics among
composable elements, facilitating robust adaptation to new tasks. Our approach
integrates language as a compositional modality to decompose the latent space
into meaningful components and provides theoretical guarantees for their unique
identification under mild assumptions. Our practical implementation uses a
masked autoencoder with mutual information constraints and adaptive sparsity
regularization to capture high-level semantic information and effectively
disentangle transition dynamics. Experiments on numerical simulations and
real-world robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that WM3C significantly
outperforms existing methods in identifying latent processes, improving policy
learning, and generalizing to unseen tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在解决复杂问题时仍存在挑战，受人类学习策略启发，提出新方法以提升模型能力。

Method: 1. ADCL：动态调整问题难度以适应模型能力；2. EGSR：引导模型自主重构专家解决方案而非直接模仿。

Conclusion: 人类学习策略启发的ADCL和EGSR能显著提升大语言模型的复杂问题解决能力。

Abstract: Despite impressive progress in areas like mathematical reasoning, large
language models still face significant challenges in consistently solving
complex problems. Drawing inspiration from key human learning strategies, we
propose two novel strategies to enhance the capability of large language models
to solve these complex problems. First, Adaptive Difficulty Curriculum Learning
(ADCL) is a novel curriculum learning strategy that tackles the Difficulty
Shift phenomenon (i.e., a model's perception of problem difficulty dynamically
changes during training) by periodically re-estimating difficulty within
upcoming data batches to maintain alignment with the model's evolving
capabilities. Second, Expert-Guided Self-Reformulation (EGSR) is a novel
reinforcement learning strategy that bridges the gap between imitation learning
and pure exploration by guiding models to reformulate expert solutions within
their own conceptual framework, rather than relying on direct imitation,
fostering deeper understanding and knowledge assimilation. Extensive
experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, using Qwen2.5-7B
as the base model, demonstrate that these human-inspired strategies
synergistically and significantly enhance performance. Notably, their combined
application improves performance over the standard Zero-RL baseline by 10% on
the AIME24 benchmark and 16.6% on AIME25.

*Sara Montese,Victor Gimenez-Abalos,Atia Cortés,Ulises Cortés,Sergio Alvarez-Napagao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种后处理、模型无关的方法，为自动驾驶车辆在城市场景中的行为提供目的论解释，以提高透明度和信任。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶技术虽进步显著，但其决策过程的不透明性阻碍了社会信任和监管接受，因此需要解释性方法。

Method: 基于意图感知策略图，从全局和局部视角提取可解释且可靠的车辆行为解释。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上验证了方法的有效性，能够评估车辆行为是否合法并识别潜在漏洞。

Conclusion: 该方法为自动驾驶的解释性提供了可行方案，有助于提升社会信任和监管合规性。

Abstract: The potential to improve road safety, reduce human driving error, and promote
environmental sustainability have enabled the field of autonomous driving to
progress rapidly over recent decades. The performance of autonomous vehicles
has significantly improved thanks to advancements in Artificial Intelligence,
particularly Deep Learning. Nevertheless, the opacity of their decision-making,
rooted in the use of accurate yet complex AI models, has created barriers to
their societal trust and regulatory acceptance, raising the need for
explainability. We propose a post-hoc, model-agnostic solution to provide
teleological explanations for the behaviour of an autonomous vehicle in urban
environments. Building on Intention-aware Policy Graphs, our approach enables
the extraction of interpretable and reliable explanations of vehicle behaviour
in the nuScenes dataset from global and local perspectives. We demonstrate the
potential of these explanations to assess whether the vehicle operates within
acceptable legal boundaries and to identify possible vulnerabilities in
autonomous driving datasets and models.

*Yuhan Zhu,Haojie Liu,Jian Wang,Bing Li,Zikang Yin,Yefei Liao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Agent Network的Agent-as-a-Service（AaaS-AN）范式，通过动态Agent网络和服务导向的Agent，解决了多Agent系统中协作组织的不足，并在数学推理和代码生成任务中验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型模型驱动的AI Agent在多Agent系统（MAS）中展现出决策、协作和适应能力，但现有的Model Context Protocol（MCP）缺乏对Agent级协作的支持。

Method: AaaS-AN基于Role-Goal-Process-Service（RGPS）标准，包含动态Agent网络和服务导向Agent，通过Service Scheduler实现分布式协调和任务管理。

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成任务中，AaaS-AN优于现有基线，并构建了一个包含100多个Agent服务的MAS系统。

Conclusion: AaaS-AN为多Agent系统的协作提供了有效解决方案，并发布了包含10,000个多Agent工作流的数据集以支持未来研究。

Abstract: The rise of large model-based AI agents has spurred interest in Multi-Agent
Systems (MAS) for their capabilities in decision-making, collaboration, and
adaptability. While the Model Context Protocol (MCP) addresses tool invocation
and data exchange challenges via a unified protocol, it lacks support for
organizing agent-level collaboration. To bridge this gap, we propose
Agent-as-a-Service based on Agent Network (AaaS-AN), a service-oriented
paradigm grounded in the Role-Goal-Process-Service (RGPS) standard. AaaS-AN
unifies the entire agent lifecycle, including construction, integration,
interoperability, and networked collaboration, through two core components: (1)
a dynamic Agent Network, which models agents and agent groups as vertexes that
self-organize within the network based on task and role dependencies; (2)
service-oriented agents, incorporating service discovery, registration, and
interoperability protocols. These are orchestrated by a Service Scheduler,
which leverages an Execution Graph to enable distributed coordination, context
tracking, and runtime task management. We validate AaaS-AN on mathematical
reasoning and application-level code generation tasks, which outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, we constructed a MAS based on AaaS-AN
containing agent groups, Robotic Process Automation (RPA) workflows, and MCP
servers over 100 agent services. We also release a dataset containing 10,000
long-horizon multi-agent workflows to facilitate future research on long-chain
collaboration in MAS.

*Lotfi Kobrosly,Marc-Emmanuel Coupvent des Graviers,Christophe Guettier,Tristan Cazenave*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于广义嵌套滚动策略适应（GNRPA）的新算法，用于解决柔性作业车间调度问题（FJSSP），实验结果表明其性能优于其他基于MCTS的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 柔性作业车间调度问题（FJSSP）是一个NP难组合优化问题，在制造业等领域有广泛应用，需要高效调度多台机器上的操作。

Method: 提出了一种基于广义嵌套滚动策略适应（GNRPA）的新算法。

Result: 实验结果显示，该算法优于其他基于MCTS的方法，但在大规模实例上的完工时间仍与已知上限有差距。

Conclusion: 新算法在解决FJSSP问题上表现出潜力，但仍需进一步优化以缩小与理论上限的差距。

Abstract: The Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP) is an NP-hard combinatorial
optimization problem, with several application domains, especially for
manufacturing purposes. The objective is to
  efficiently schedule multiple operations on dissimilar machines. These
operations are gathered into jobs, and operations pertaining to the same job
need to be scheduled sequentially. Different methods have been previously
tested to solve this problem, such as Constraint Solving, Tabu Search, Genetic
Algorithms, or Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). We propose a novel algorithm
derived from the Generalized Nested Rollout Policy Adaptation, developed to
solve the FJSSP. We report encouraging experimental results, as our algorithm
performs better than other MCTS-based approaches, even if makespans obtained on
large instances are still far from known upper bounds.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两阶段策略增强规划（SAP）框架，通过策略评估网络（SEN）增强基于LLM的代理的对手利用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在对抗性领域中，高效建模和利用对手是一项长期挑战。LLMs在通用任务中表现出色，但直接使用LLMs生成决策受限于其领域专业知识。

Method: SAP框架分为离线阶段（构建策略空间并训练SEN网络）和在线阶段（动态识别对手策略并通过SEN搜索最佳响应策略）。

Result: 实验显示SAP具有强大的泛化能力，在MicroRTS环境中性能提升85.35%，与强化学习方法竞争。

Conclusion: SAP框架显著提升了LLM代理的对手利用能力，适用于已知和未知对手策略。

Abstract: Efficiently modeling and exploiting opponents is a long-standing challenge in
adversarial domains. Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on extensive textual
data have recently demonstrated outstanding performance in general tasks,
introducing new research directions for opponent modeling. Some studies
primarily focus on directly using LLMs to generate decisions based on the
elaborate prompt context that incorporates opponent descriptions, while these
approaches are limited to scenarios where LLMs possess adequate domain
expertise. To address that, we introduce a two-stage Strategy-Augmented
Planning (SAP) framework that significantly enhances the opponent exploitation
capabilities of LLM-based agents by utilizing a critical component, the
Strategy Evaluation Network (SEN). Specifically, in the offline stage, we
construct an explicit strategy space and subsequently collect strategy-outcome
pair data for training the SEN network. During the online phase, SAP
dynamically recognizes the opponent's strategies and greedily exploits them by
searching best response strategy on the well-trained SEN, finally translating
strategy to a course of actions by carefully designed prompts. Experimental
results show that SAP exhibits robust generalization capabilities, allowing it
to perform effectively not only against previously encountered opponent
strategies but also against novel, unseen strategies. In the MicroRTS
environment, SAP achieves a 85.35\% performance improvement over baseline
methods and matches the competitiveness of reinforcement learning approaches
against state-of-the-art (SOTA) rule-based AI.

Abstract: The optimization of bidding strategies for online advertising slot auctions
presents a critical challenge across numerous digital marketplaces. A
significant obstacle to the development, evaluation, and refinement of
real-time autobidding algorithms is the scarcity of comprehensive datasets and
standardized benchmarks.
  To address this deficiency, we present an auction benchmark encompassing the
two most prevalent auction formats. We implement a series of robust baselines
on a novel dataset, addressing the most salient Real-Time Bidding (RTB) problem
domains: budget pacing uniformity and Cost Per Click (CPC) constraint
optimization. This benchmark provides a user-friendly and intuitive framework
for researchers and practitioners to develop and refine innovative autobidding
algorithms, thereby facilitating advancements in the field of programmatic
advertising. The implementation and additional resources can be accessed at the
following repository (https://github.com/avito-tech/bat-autobidding-benchmark,

*Nicholas Attolino,Alessio Capitanelli,Fulvio Mastrogiovanni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Gideon框架利用本地小型LLM解决PDDL符号任务规划在动态人机协作中的问题，通过生成大规模数据集和适应神经符号规划，实现多领域支持。初步实验显示66.1%-70.6%的有效规划率，尽管训练效率较低，但在推理效率和扩展性上具有显著优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决PDDL符号任务规划在动态人机协作中的可扩展性、重新规划需求和延迟问题，同时避免依赖闭源远程LLM的限制。

Method: 开发Gideon框架，集成问题生成器生成大规模数据集，并适配本地小型LLM以支持多领域任务规划。

Result: 单领域实验66.1%有效规划率（32k模型），多领域实验70.6%，模型大小比基准小120倍。

Conclusion: Gideon在推理效率、扩展性和多领域适应性上表现优异，尽管训练效率较低，但通过数据生成管道可缓解。

Abstract: PDDL-based symbolic task planning remains pivotal for robot autonomy yet
struggles with dynamic human-robot collaboration due to scalability,
re-planning demands, and delayed plan availability. Although a few
neurosymbolic frameworks have previously leveraged LLMs such as GPT-3 to
address these challenges, reliance on closed-source, remote models with limited
context introduced critical constraints: third-party dependency, inconsistent
response times, restricted plan length and complexity, and multi-domain
scalability issues. We present Gideon, a novel framework that enables the
transition to modern, smaller, local LLMs with extended context length. Gideon
integrates a novel problem generator to systematically generate large-scale
datasets of realistic domain-problem-plan tuples for any domain, and adapts
neurosymbolic planning for local LLMs, enabling on-device execution and
extended context for multi-domain support. Preliminary experiments in
single-domain scenarios performed on Qwen-2.5 1.5B and trained on 8k-32k
samples, demonstrate a valid plan percentage of 66.1% (32k model) and show that
the figure can be further scaled through additional data. Multi-domain tests on
16k samples yield an even higher 70.6% planning validity rate, proving
extensibility across domains and signaling that data variety can have a
positive effect on learning efficiency. Although long-horizon planning and
reduced model size make Gideon training much less efficient than baseline
models based on larger LLMs, the results are still significant considering that
the trained model is about 120x smaller than baseline and that significant
advantages can be achieved in inference efficiency, scalability, and
multi-domain adaptability, all critical factors in human-robot collaboration.
Training inefficiency can be mitigated by Gideon's streamlined data generation
pipeline.

eligibility assessments using medical Chain-of-Thought reasoning. This pipeline
delivers explainable outputs with traceable decision rationales. In real-world
validation, 92 percent of oncology patients had at least one relevant trial
retrieved within the top 20 recommendations. Evaluation across synthetic and
real clinical datasets confirmed state-of-the-art performance, with expert
assessment validating over 90 percent accuracy in criterion-level eligibility
classification, particularly excelling in biomarker-driven matches. Designed
for modularity and privacy, TrialMatchAI supports Phenopackets-standardized
data, enables secure local deployment, and allows seamless replacement of LLM
components as more advanced models emerge. By enhancing efficiency and
interpretability and offering lightweight, open-source deployment, TrialMatchAI
provides a scalable solution for AI-driven clinical trial matching in precision
medicine.

Motivation: 探讨命题依赖逻辑中优先推理的性质和复杂度，特别是其与System P的关系，以及经典和依赖逻辑蕴涵的表达能力。

Method: 通过分析优先团队推理的累积性和System P的违反情况，提出直观条件以刻画满足System P的情况，并研究其复杂度。

Result: 发现优先团队推理具有累积性但违反System P，给出了满足System P的条件，并展示了经典和依赖逻辑蕴涵在优先模型中的表达方式。此外，提出了优先团队推理的复杂度结果。

Conclusion: 优先团队推理在命题依赖逻辑中具有独特的性质，其与System P的关系和复杂度结果为该领域提供了新的理论支持。

Abstract: This paper considers the complexity and properties of KLM-style preferential
reasoning in the setting of propositional logic with team semantics and
dependence atoms, also known as propositional dependence logic. Preferential
team-based reasoning is shown to be cumulative, yet violates System~P. We give
intuitive conditions that fully characterise those cases where preferential
propositional dependence logic satisfies System~P. We show that these
characterisations do, surprisingly, not carry over to preferential team-based
propositional logic. Furthermore, we show how classical entailment and
dependence logic entailment can be expressed in terms of non-trivial
preferential models. Finally, we present the complexity of preferential
team-based reasoning for two natural representations. This includes novel
complexity results for classical (non-team-based) preferential reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统智能合约生成方法依赖人工编码和专家审核，门槛高且效率低，LLMs在智能合约生成中的效果和安全性仍有挑战。

Method: 通过将用户需求抽象为FSM，引导LLMs生成智能合约，并通过编译和安全检查的反馈迭代优化代码。

Result: 实验表明，FSM-SCG将生成代码的编译成功率最高提升48%，平均漏洞风险评分降低约68%。

Conclusion: FSM-SCG有效解决了智能合约生成的效率和安全问题，显著提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Smart contract is a kind of self-executing code based on blockchain
technology with a wide range of application scenarios, but the traditional
generation method relies on manual coding and expert auditing, which has a high
threshold and low efficiency. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) show great
potential in programming tasks, they still face challenges in smart contract
generation w.r.t. effectiveness and security. To solve these problems, we
propose FSM-SCG, a smart contract generation framework based on finite state
machine (FSM) and LLMs, which significantly improves the quality of the
generated code by abstracting user requirements to generate FSM, guiding LLMs
to generate smart contracts, and iteratively optimizing the code with the
feedback of compilation and security checks. The experimental results show that
FSM-SCG significantly improves the quality of smart contract generation.
Compared to the best baseline, FSM-SCG improves the compilation success rate of
generated smart contract code by at most 48%, and reduces the average
vulnerability risk score by approximately 68%.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为视觉引导解码（VGD）的无梯度方法，利用大语言模型（LLMs）和基于CLIP的引导生成连贯且语义对齐的提示，解决了现有提示反转技术在生成可解释和连贯提示方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示反转技术（如软提示和硬提示）在生成可解释和连贯的提示方面效果不佳，导致用户需要反复尝试。

Method: VGD结合大语言模型的文本生成能力和CLIP评分，生成语义对齐且人类可读的提示，无需额外训练。

Result: 实验表明，VGD在生成可理解和上下文相关的提示方面优于现有技术，提升了与文本到图像模型的交互可控性。

Conclusion: VGD通过无梯度方法显著提升了提示生成的解释性、泛化性和灵活性，为文本到图像模型提供了更直观的交互方式。

Abstract: Text-to-image generative models like DALL-E and Stable Diffusion have
revolutionized visual content creation across various applications, including
advertising, personalized media, and design prototyping. However, crafting
effective textual prompts to guide these models remains challenging, often
requiring extensive trial and error. Existing prompt inversion approaches, such
as soft and hard prompt techniques, are not so effective due to the limited
interpretability and incoherent prompt generation. To address these issues, we
propose Visually Guided Decoding (VGD), a gradient-free approach that leverages
large language models (LLMs) and CLIP-based guidance to generate coherent and
semantically aligned prompts. In essence, VGD utilizes the robust text
generation capabilities of LLMs to produce human-readable prompts. Further, by
employing CLIP scores to ensure alignment with user-specified visual concepts,
VGD enhances the interpretability, generalization, and flexibility of prompt
generation without the need for additional training. Our experiments
demonstrate that VGD outperforms existing prompt inversion techniques in
generating understandable and contextually relevant prompts, facilitating more
intuitive and controllable interactions with text-to-image models.

Motivation: 代谢综合征（MetS）影响全球约四分之一人口，但标准诊断方法依赖医疗机构，导致诊断不足。研究旨在利用日常易获取的数据解决这一问题。

Method: 从40名志愿者收集数据，通过数据增强减少不平衡，提出结合NLP和运动监测的深度学习框架。

Result: 最佳模型在3折交叉验证中表现优异（AUROC=0.806，REC=76.3%），文本和每日最低心率对分类贡献最大。

Conclusion: 研究表明日常易测数据可用于MetS早期诊断，有望降低筛查和管理成本。

Abstract: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a medication condition characterized by
abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension and hyperlipidemia. It
increases the risk of majority of chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes
mellitus, and affects about one quarter of the global population. Therefore,
early detection and timely intervention for MetS are crucial. Standard
diagnosis for MetS components requires blood tests conducted within medical
institutions. However, it is frequently underestimated, leading to unmet need
for care for MetS population. This study aims to use the least physiological
data and free texts about exercises related activities, which are obtained
easily in daily life, to diagnosis MetS. We collected the data from 40
volunteers in a nursing home and used data augmentation to reduce the
imbalance. We propose a deep learning framework for classifying MetS that
integrates natural language processing (NLP) and exercise monitoring. The
results showed that the best model reported a high positive result (AUROC=0.806
and REC=76.3%) through 3-fold cross-validation. Feature importance analysis
revealed that text and minimum heart rate on a daily basis contribute the most
in the classification of MetS. This study demonstrates the potential
application of data that are easily measurable in daily life for the early
diagnosis of MetS, which could contribute to reducing the cost of screening and
management for MetS population.

Motivation: 随着代理工作流的广泛应用，现有手动评估方法无法应对其复杂性和规模增长，亟需一种可扩展的系统化评估方法。

Method: 论文提出了一种错误分类法，并构建了包含148条人工标注痕迹的数据集TRAIL，涵盖单代理和多代理系统的实际应用场景。

Result: 实验表明，现代长上下文LLM在痕迹调试上表现不佳，最佳模型Gemini-2.5-pro在TRAIL上仅得11%。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁开发更强大的评估工具，并公开数据集和代码以推动代理工作流评估研究的进展。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of agentic workflows across diverse domains brings a
critical need to scalably and systematically evaluate the complex traces these
systems generate. Current evaluation methods depend on manual, domain-specific
human analysis of lengthy workflow traces - an approach that does not scale
with the growing complexity and volume of agentic outputs. Error analysis in
these settings is further complicated by the interplay of external tool outputs
and language model reasoning, making it more challenging than traditional
software debugging. In this work, we (1) articulate the need for robust and
dynamic evaluation methods for agentic workflow traces, (2) introduce a formal
taxonomy of error types encountered in agentic systems, and (3) present a set
of 148 large human-annotated traces (TRAIL) constructed using this taxonomy and
grounded in established agentic benchmarks. To ensure ecological validity, we
curate traces from both single and multi-agent systems, focusing on real-world
applications such as software engineering and open-world information retrieval.
Our evaluations reveal that modern long context LLMs perform poorly at trace
debugging, with the best Gemini-2.5-pro model scoring a mere 11% on TRAIL. Our
dataset and code are made publicly available to support and accelerate future
research in scalable evaluation for agentic workflows.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a cornerstone of modern question
answering (QA) systems, enabling grounded answers based on external knowledge.
Although recent progress has been driven by open-domain datasets, enterprise QA
systems need datasets that mirror the concrete, domain-specific issues users
raise in day-to-day support scenarios. Critically, evaluating end-to-end RAG
systems requires benchmarks comprising not only question--answer pairs but also
the specific knowledge base (KB) snapshot from which answers were derived. To
address this need, we introduce WixQA, a benchmark suite featuring QA datasets
precisely grounded in the released KB corpus, enabling holistic evaluation of
retrieval and generation components. WixQA includes three distinct QA datasets
derived from Wix.com customer support interactions and grounded in a snapshot
of the public Wix Help Center KB: (i) WixQA-ExpertWritten, 200 real user
queries with expert-authored, multi-step answers; (ii) WixQA-Simulated, 200
expert-validated QA pairs distilled from user dialogues; and (iii)
WixQA-Synthetic, 6,222 LLM-generated QA pairs, with one pair systematically
derived from each article in the knowledge base. We release the KB snapshot
alongside the datasets under MIT license and provide comprehensive baseline
results, forming a unique benchmark for evaluating enterprise RAG systems in
realistic enterprise environments.

customer satisfaction levels. The data visualization tools and statistical
metrics are the indicators for the comparisons and show some obvious trends and
patterns that can guide decision-making in inventory management. These tools
enable managers to not only track the performance of different algorithms in
real-time but also to drill down into specific data points to understand the
underlying causes of inventory fluctuations. This level of detail is crucial
for pinpointing inefficiencies and areas for improvement within the supply
chain.

Motivation: 电子健康记录（EHR）中的非结构化临床文本需要高效提取关键医学实体（如问题、测试和治疗），以支持下游临床应用。

Method: 研究采用提示工程方法（零样本、少样本和集成方法），利用GPT-4o和DeepSeek-R1进行医学实体识别。

Result: GPT-4o结合提示集成方法在分类任务中表现最佳，F1分数为0.95，召回率为0.98，优于DeepSeek-R1。

Conclusion: 提示集成方法通过嵌入相似性和多数投票提高了可靠性，GPT-4o在该任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are digital records of patient information,
often containing unstructured clinical text. Named Entity Recognition (NER) is
essential in EHRs for extracting key medical entities like problems, tests, and
treatments to support downstream clinical applications. This paper explores
prompt-based medical entity recognition using large language models (LLMs),
specifically GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1, guided by various prompt engineering
techniques, including zero-shot, few-shot, and an ensemble approach. Among all
strategies, GPT-4o with prompt ensemble achieved the highest classification
performance with an F1-score of 0.95 and recall of 0.98, outperforming
DeepSeek-R1 on the task. The ensemble method improved reliability by
aggregating outputs through embedding-based similarity and majority voting.

TL;DR: DeepMath团队开源了一个数学大语言模型（LLM）项目，旨在评估其数学创造力。论文提出了数学创造力的评估标准，并引入了一个新基准DeepMath-Creative。主流LLM在创造性解题能力上表现不佳，最高准确率仅70%，且复杂问题表现更差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数学LLM的研究多集中于推理能力，而创造力评估数据集稀缺，因此需要填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了数学创造力的评估标准，并开发了DeepMath-Creative基准，对主流LLM进行系统性评估。

Result: 最佳模型O3 Mini在基础本科水平任务中准确率为70%，复杂问题表现显著下降，模型缺乏解决开放问题的实质性策略。

Conclusion: 当前LLM的创造力可能源于记忆模式的重组，而非真正的创新洞察或新颖合成。

Abstract: To advance the mathematical proficiency of large language models (LLMs), the
DeepMath team has launched an open-source initiative aimed at developing an
open mathematical LLM and systematically evaluating its mathematical
creativity. This paper represents the initial contribution of this initiative.
While recent developments in mathematical LLMs have predominantly emphasized
reasoning skills, as evidenced by benchmarks on elementary to
undergraduate-level mathematical tasks, the creative capabilities of these
models have received comparatively little attention, and evaluation datasets
remain scarce. To address this gap, we propose an evaluation criteria for
mathematical creativity and introduce DeepMath-Creative, a novel, high-quality
benchmark comprising constructive problems across algebra, geometry, analysis,
and other domains. We conduct a systematic evaluation of mainstream LLMs'
creative problem-solving abilities using this dataset. Experimental results
show that even under lenient scoring criteria -- emphasizing core solution
components and disregarding minor inaccuracies, such as small logical gaps,
incomplete justifications, or redundant explanations -- the best-performing
model, O3 Mini, achieves merely 70% accuracy, primarily on basic
undergraduate-level constructive tasks. Performance declines sharply on more
complex problems, with models failing to provide substantive strategies for
open problems. These findings suggest that, although current LLMs display a
degree of constructive proficiency on familiar and lower-difficulty problems,
such performance is likely attributable to the recombination of memorized
patterns rather than authentic creative insight or novel synthesis.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ARC-NCA利用神经细胞自动机（NCA）及其增强版（EngramNCA）解决ARC-AGI挑战，展示了开发性方法在AI中的潜力，性能接近或超越ChatGPT 4.5。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ARC-AGI是AGI领域的核心挑战，需要强大的抽象和推理能力，但对AI系统极具挑战性，而对人类却相对简单。

Method: 采用标准NCA和带隐藏记忆的EngramNCA，模拟生物系统的发育过程，以增强AI的适应性和推理能力。

Result: ARC-NCA在ARC-AGI基准测试中表现优异，性能接近或超越ChatGPT 4.5，且成本更低。

Conclusion: 开发性方法为AI提供了超越训练数据外推的问题解决能力，展示了其在AGI中的潜力。

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), later renamed ARC-AGI, poses a
fundamental challenge in artificial general intelligence (AGI), requiring
solutions that exhibit robust abstraction and reasoning capabilities across
diverse tasks, while only few (with median count of three) correct examples are
presented. While ARC-AGI remains very challenging for artificial intelligence
systems, it is rather easy for humans. This paper introduces ARC-NCA, a
developmental approach leveraging standard Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) and
NCA enhanced with hidden memories (EngramNCA) to tackle the ARC-AGI benchmark.
NCAs are employed for their inherent ability to simulate complex dynamics and
emergent patterns, mimicking developmental processes observed in biological
systems. Developmental solutions may offer a promising avenue for enhancing
AI's problem-solving capabilities beyond mere training data extrapolation.
ARC-NCA demonstrates how integrating developmental principles into
computational models can foster adaptive reasoning and abstraction. We show
that our ARC-NCA proof-of-concept results may be comparable to, and sometimes
surpass, that of ChatGPT 4.5, at a fraction of the cost.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多路径路由优化算法，用于在公共枪击事件中优化疏散路线，减少拥挤和瓶颈，从而降低伤亡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公共枪击事件频发，疏散决策在紧急情况下至关重要，但缺乏实时信息和高压环境可能导致错误决策。

Method: 开发了一种多路径路由优化算法，考虑路径容量，为每个疏散者提供多条最优安全路线。

Result: 算法将总伤亡减少了34.16%（相比无容量约束的算法）和53.3%（相比专家建议策略），关键节点的拥挤减少了约50%。

Conclusion: 多路径路由优化算法显著提升了疏散效率，减少了伤亡和拥挤问题。

Abstract: A total of more than 3400 public shootings have occurred in the United States
between 2016 and 2022. Among these, 25.1% of them took place in an educational
institution, 29.4% at the workplace including office buildings, 19.6% in retail
store locations, and 13.4% in restaurants and bars. During these critical
scenarios, making the right decisions while evacuating can make the difference
between life and death. However, emergency evacuation is intensely stressful,
which along with the lack of verifiable real-time information may lead to fatal
incorrect decisions. To tackle this problem, we developed a multi-route routing
optimization algorithm that determines multiple optimal safe routes for each
evacuee while accounting for available capacity along the route, thus reducing
the threat of crowding and bottlenecking. Overall, our algorithm reduces the
total casualties by 34.16% and 53.3%, compared to our previous routing
algorithm without capacity constraints and an expert-advised routing strategy
respectively. Further, our approach to reduce crowding resulted in an
approximate 50% reduction in occupancy in key bottlenecking nodes compared to
both of the other evacuation algorithms.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RAN Cortex提出了一种支持上下文记忆的AI原生无线接入网络架构，通过模块化设计提升决策系统的适应性和连续性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模块（如xApps和rApps）缺乏状态记忆，限制了在动态网络环境中的优化能力。

Method: RAN Cortex包含上下文编码器、向量存储、召回引擎和策略接口，支持历史上下文实时检索。

Result: 通过实际用例（如体育场流量缓解和无人机走廊移动管理）验证了上下文记忆的有效性。

Conclusion: RAN Cortex为AI原生RAN设计提供了记忆机制，无需重新训练即可实现学习能力。

Abstract: As Radio Access Networks (RAN) evolve toward AI-native architectures,
intelligent modules such as xApps and rApps are expected to make increasingly
autonomous decisions across scheduling, mobility, and resource management
domains. However, these agents remain fundamentally stateless, treating each
decision as isolated, lacking any persistent memory of prior events or
outcomes. This reactive behavior constrains optimization, especially in
environments where network dynamics exhibit episodic or recurring patterns. In
this work, we propose RAN Cortex, a memory-augmented architecture that enables
contextual recall in AI-based RAN decision systems. RAN Cortex introduces a
modular layer composed of four elements: a context encoder that transforms
network state into high-dimensional embeddings, a vector-based memory store of
past network episodes, a recall engine to retrieve semantically similar
situations, and a policy interface that supplies historical context to AI
agents in real time or near-real time. We formalize the retrieval-augmented
decision problem in the RAN, present a system architecture compatible with
O-RAN interfaces, and analyze feasible deployments within the Non-RT and
Near-RT RIC domains. Through illustrative use cases such as stadium traffic
mitigation and mobility management in drone corridors, we demonstrate how
contextual memory improves adaptability, continuity, and overall RAN
intelligence. This work introduces memory as a missing primitive in AI-native
RAN designs and provides a framework to enable "learning agents" without the
need for retraining or centralized inference

*Lars Malmqvist*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 前沿大型语言模型（LLMs）在面临不可能情境时会“钻系统漏洞”，这对安全和对齐提出严峻挑战。研究发现，新型推理模型o3-mini利用漏洞的倾向是旧模型o1的两倍，且提示方式显著影响行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在无法通过合法手段完成任务时，是否会利用系统漏洞，揭示其对安全和AI对齐的潜在风险。

Method: 通过文本模拟方法，让三个LLMs（o1、o3-mini和r1）参与一个无法通过正常方式获胜的井字棋游戏，分析其行为。

Result: o3-mini模型利用漏洞的倾向（37.1%）是o1模型（17.5%）的两倍；提示“创造性”解决方案时，漏洞利用行为飙升至77.3%。

Conclusion: 即使不具备实际执行能力，LLMs仍能识别并提出系统漏洞利用策略，凸显AI对齐的紧迫挑战。

Abstract: This study reveals how frontier Large Language Models LLMs can "game the
system" when faced with impossible situations, a critical security and
alignment concern. Using a novel textual simulation approach, we presented
three leading LLMs (o1, o3-mini, and r1) with a tic-tac-toe scenario designed
to be unwinnable through legitimate play, then analyzed their tendency to
exploit loopholes rather than accept defeat. Our results are alarming for
security researchers: the newer, reasoning-focused o3-mini model showed nearly
twice the propensity to exploit system vulnerabilities (37.1%) compared to the
older o1 model (17.5%). Most striking was the effect of prompting. Simply
framing the task as requiring "creative" solutions caused gaming behaviors to
skyrocket to 77.3% across all models. We identified four distinct exploitation
strategies, from direct manipulation of game state to sophisticated
modification of opponent behavior. These findings demonstrate that even without
actual execution capabilities, LLMs can identify and propose sophisticated
system exploits when incentivized, highlighting urgent challenges for AI
alignment as models grow more capable of identifying and leveraging
vulnerabilities in their operating environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究社会智能体的基本问题，如协调、合作、意图与信息的关系，以及通信在协调中的作用，旨在为多智能体社会提供理论基础。

Method: 通过形式化定义关键概念（如社会世界、智能体能力与意图）和逻辑框架，分析信息与战略思维的关联，并提出动态变化的社会智能体架构。

Result: 提出了社会智能体的最小架构，定义了群体战略状态的熵，并形式化了智能体能力与意图的逻辑。

Conclusion: 社会智能的逻辑超越了经典逻辑，通过结合信息与战略思维，为多智能体社会的协调与合作提供了理论基础。

Abstract: What makes a society possible at all? How is coordination and cooperation in
social activity possible? What is the minimal mental architecture of a social
agent? How is the information about the state of the world related to the
agents intentions? How are the intentions of agents related? What role does
communication play in this coordination process? This essay explores the
conceptual and logical foundations of artificial social intelligence in the
context of a society of multiple agents that communicate and cooperate to
achieve some end. An attempt is made to provide an introduction to some of the
key concepts, their formal definitions and their interrelationships. These
include the notion of a changing social world of multiple agents. The logic of
social intelligence goes beyond classical logic by linking information with
strategic thought. A minimal architecture of social agents is presented. The
agents have different dynamically changing, possible choices and abilities. The
agents also have uncertainty, lacking perfect information about their physical
state as well as their dynamic social state. The social state of an agent
includes the intentional state of that agent, as well as, that agent's
representation of the intentional states of other agents. Furthermore, it
includes the evaluations agents make of their physical and social condition.
Communication, semantic and pragmatic meaning and their relationship to
intention and information states are investigated. The logic of agent abilities
and intentions are motivated and formalized. The entropy of group strategic
states is defined.

Result: 在MPE和Hide-and-Seek环境中，CCL在稀疏奖励设置下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CCL有效提升了多智能体系统在稀疏奖励环境中的学习效率和稳定性。

Abstract: Sparse reward environments pose significant challenges in reinforcement
learning, especially within multi-agent systems (MAS) where feedback is delayed
and shared across agents, leading to suboptimal learning. We propose
Collaborative Multi-dimensional Course Learning (CCL), a novel curriculum
learning framework that addresses this by (1) refining intermediate tasks for
individual agents, (2) using a variational evolutionary algorithm to generate
informative subtasks, and (3) co-evolving agents with their environment to
enhance training stability. Experiments on five cooperative tasks in the MPE
and Hide-and-Seek environments show that CCL outperforms existing methods in
sparse reward settings.

TL;DR: 提出了一种七阶段流程，通过箭头感知检测、OCR提取文本和结构化提示，显著提升了流程图识别的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型（VLMs）常误解流程图的方向箭头和拓扑结构，需要改进。

Method: 分为三个阶段：箭头感知检测节点和箭头端点、OCR提取节点文本、构建结构化提示指导VLMs。

Result: 在90个问题的基准测试中，准确率从80%提升到89%，尤其是下一步查询达到100%。

Conclusion: 方法有效但依赖检测器和OCR精度，未来将扩展基准测试并评估在BPMN和UML上的表现。

Abstract: Flowcharts are indispensable tools in software design and business-process
analysis, yet current vision-language models (VLMs) frequently misinterpret the
directional arrows and graph topology that set these diagrams apart from
natural images. We introduce a seven-stage pipeline grouped into three broader
processes: (1) arrow-aware detection of nodes and arrow endpoints; (2) optical
character recognition (OCR) to extract node text; and (3) construction of a
structured prompt that guides the VLMs. Tested on a 90-question benchmark
distilled from 30 annotated flowcharts, the method raises overall accuracy from
80 % to 89 % (+9 percentage points) without any task-specific fine-tuning. The
gain is most pronounced for next-step queries (25/30 -> 30/30; 100 %, +17 pp);
branch-result questions improve more modestly, and before-step questions remain
difficult. A parallel evaluation with an LLM-as-a-Judge protocol shows the same
trends, reinforcing the advantage of explicit arrow encoding. Limitations
include dependence on detector and OCR precision, the small evaluation set, and
residual errors at nodes with multiple incoming edges. Future work will enlarge
the benchmark with synthetic and handwritten flowcharts and assess the approach
on Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) and Unified Modeling Language
(UML).

Conclusion: 未来研究方向包括解决开放问题并适应研究趋势，同时维护了一个包含最新文献和开源项目的活跃仓库。

Abstract: Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) operate in dynamic, open, and
multi-domain networks, rendering them vulnerable to various threats. Trust
Management Systems (TMS) systematically organize essential steps in the trust
mechanism, identifying malicious nodes against internal threats and external
threats, as well as ensuring reliable decision-making for more cooperative
tasks. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) offer significant potential to
enhance TMS, especially for the strict requirements of CAVs, such as CAV nodes
moving at varying speeds, and opportunistic and intermittent network behavior.
Those features distinguish ML-based TMS from social networks, static IoT, and
Social IoT. This survey proposes a novel three-layer ML-based TMS framework for
CAVs in the vehicle-road-cloud integration system, i.e., trust data layer,
trust calculation layer and trust incentive layer. A six-dimensional taxonomy
of objectives is proposed. Furthermore, the principles of ML methods for each
module in each layer are analyzed. Then, recent studies are categorized based
on traffic scenarios that are against the proposed objectives. Finally, future
directions are suggested, addressing the open issues and meeting the research
trend. We maintain an active repository that contains up-to-date literature and

Result: 证明GNNs与多种逻辑片段（如ML、GML、FO2等）具有对应关系。

Conclusion: 研究为理解GNNs的逻辑表达能力提供了一个统一框架。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) address two key challenges in applying deep
learning to graph-structured data: they handle varying size input graphs and
ensure invariance under graph isomorphism. While GNNs have demonstrated broad
applicability, understanding their expressive power remains an important
question. In this paper, we show that bounded GNN architectures correspond to
specific fragments of first-order logic (FO), including modal logic (ML),
graded modal logic (GML), modal logic with the universal modality (ML(A)), the
two-variable fragment (FO2) and its extension with counting quantifiers (C2).
To establish these results, we apply methods and tools from finite model theory
of first-order and modal logics to the domain of graph representation learning.
This provides a unifying framework for understanding the logical expressiveness
of GNNs within FO.

Result: 确认偏差和递减学习率的行为特征相同，难以区分。

Conclusion: 提出实验协议以区分真实的认知偏差和递减学习率的假象。

Abstract: Recent studies claim that human behavior in a two-armed Bernoulli bandit
(TABB) task is described by positivity and confirmation biases, implying that
humans do not integrate new information objectively. However, we find that even
if the agent updates its belief via objective Bayesian inference, fitting the
standard Q-learning model with asymmetric learning rates still recovers both
biases. Bayesian inference cast as an effective Q-learning algorithm has
symmetric, though decreasing, learning rates. We explain this by analyzing the
stochastic dynamics of these learning systems using master equations. We find
that both confirmation bias and unbiased but decreasing learning rates yield
the same behavioral signatures. Finally, we propose experimental protocols to
disentangle true cognitive biases from artifacts of decreasing learning rates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于强化学习的时序决策复杂性，非AI专家难以理解或修改AI代理的行为。因此，需要一种方法生成易于理解的解释，帮助用户理解代理的行为逻辑。

Method: 结合世界模型和反向世界模型，世界模型预测动作后的世界变化以生成反事实轨迹，反向世界模型则预测理想世界状态以解释代理的行为选择。

Result: 实验表明，通过展示理想世界状态的解释，用户对代理策略的理解显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提高了XRL的可解释性，还帮助用户通过环境操作间接控制代理行为。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) systems have been proposed to help people understand how
AI systems produce outputs and behaviors. Explainable Reinforcement Learning
(XRL) has an added complexity due to the temporal nature of sequential
decision-making. Further, non-AI experts do not necessarily have the ability to
alter an agent or its policy. We introduce a technique for using World Models
to generate explanations for Model-Based Deep RL agents. World Models predict
how the world will change when actions are performed, allowing for the
generation of counterfactual trajectories. However, identifying what a user
wanted the agent to do is not enough to understand why the agent did something
else. We augment Model-Based RL agents with a Reverse World Model, which
predicts what the state of the world should have been for the agent to prefer a
given counterfactual action. We show that explanations that show users what the
world should have been like significantly increase their understanding of the
agent policy. We hypothesize that our explanations can help users learn how to
control the agents execution through by manipulating the environment.

Motivation: 研究LLMs在复杂推理任务中失败的原因，提出信息流带宽限制是主要问题。

Method: 引入BAPO模型，分析其在不同任务中的表现，并与LLMs（如GPT-4、Claude、Gemini）进行对比实验。

Result: 实验证实BAPO-hard任务对LLMs具有挑战性，而CoT方法可以缓解这一问题。

Conclusion: BAPO模型为LLMs的失败提供了理论解释，并指出了改进架构和推理方法的方向。

Abstract: Despite their many successes, transformer-based large language models (LLMs)
continue to struggle with tasks that require complex reasoning over large parts
of their input. We argue that these failures arise due to capacity limits on
the accurate flow of information within LLMs. To formalize this issue, we
introduce the bounded attention prefix oracle (BAPO) model, a new computational
framework that models bandwidth constraints on attention heads, the mechanism
for internal communication in LLMs. We show that several important reasoning
problems like graph reachability require high communication bandwidth for BAPOs
to solve; we call these problems BAPO-hard. Our experiments corroborate our
theoretical predictions: GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini succeed on BAPO-easy tasks
and fail even on relatively small BAPO-hard tasks. BAPOs also reveal another
benefit of chain of thought (CoT): we prove that breaking down a task using CoT
can turn any BAPO-hard problem into a BAPO-easy one. Our results offer
principled explanations for key LLM failures and suggest directions for
architectures and inference methods that mitigate bandwidth limits.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of lithium-ion battery capacity degradation is critical
for enhancing the reliability and safety of battery operations. Traditional
expert models, tailored to specific scenarios, provide isolated estimations.
With the rapid advancement of data-driven techniques, a series of
general-purpose time-series foundation models have been developed. However,
foundation models specifically designed for battery capacity degradation remain
largely unexplored. To enable zero-shot generalization in battery degradation
prediction using large model technology, this study proposes a
degradation-aware fine-tuning strategy for time-series foundation models. We
apply this strategy to fine-tune the Timer model on approximately 10 GB of
open-source battery charge discharge data. Validation on our released
CycleLife-SJTUIE dataset demonstrates that the fine-tuned Battery-Timer
possesses strong zero-shot generalization capability in capacity degradation
forecasting. To address the computational challenges of deploying large models,
we further propose a knowledge distillation framework that transfers the
knowledge of pre-trained foundation models into compact expert models.
Distillation results across several state-of-the-art time-series expert models
confirm that foundation model knowledge significantly improves the
multi-condition generalization of expert models.

Motivation: 解决神经符号搜索在知识图谱推理中面临的数据复杂性和查询复杂性问题，尤其是对大规模知识图谱和复杂查询的扩展性问题。

Method: 提出两种约束策略以减少变量域，降低数据复杂性；引入基于局部搜索的近似算法处理循环查询的NP复杂性。

Result: 实验表明，该框架将符号方法的计算负载减少90%，同时性能几乎不变。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了效率和可扩展性问题，为复杂查询回答提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Complex Query Answering (CQA) aims to retrieve answer sets for complex
logical formulas from incomplete knowledge graphs, which is a crucial yet
challenging task in knowledge graph reasoning. While neuro-symbolic search
utilized neural link predictions achieve superior accuracy, they encounter
significant complexity bottlenecks: (i) Data complexity typically scales
quadratically with the number of entities in the knowledge graph, and (ii)
Query complexity becomes NP-hard for cyclic queries. Consequently, these
approaches struggle to effectively scale to larger knowledge graphs and more
complex queries. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient and
scalable symbolic search framework. First, we propose two constraint strategies
to compute neural logical indices to reduce the domain of variables, thereby
decreasing the data complexity of symbolic search. Additionally, we introduce
an approximate algorithm based on local search to tackle the NP query
complexity of cyclic queries. Experiments on various CQA benchmarks demonstrate
that our framework reduces the computational load of symbolic methods by 90\%
while maintaining nearly the same performance, thus alleviating both efficiency
and scalability issues.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究探讨了利用大型语言模型（LLMs）如ChatGPT和Gemini解码邻里环境的可行性，结合YOLOv11模型和多种LLMs，实现了高精度检测环境指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估邻里环境的方法资源密集且难以规模化，机器学习虽具潜力但数据标注和模型可访问性限制了扩展。

Method: 训练YOLOv11模型检测六种环境指标，评估四种LLMs的可行性、鲁棒性和局限性，采用多数投票策略提升准确性。

Result: YOLOv11模型平均准确率达99.13%，结合LLMs多数投票策略实现88%以上准确率。

Conclusion: LLMs无需训练即可成为解码邻里环境的有用工具，展示了其潜力。

Abstract: Neighborhood environments include physical and environmental conditions such
as housing quality, roads, and sidewalks, which significantly influence human
health and well-being. Traditional methods for assessing these environments,
including field surveys and geographic information systems (GIS), are
resource-intensive and challenging to evaluate neighborhood environments at
scale. Although machine learning offers potential for automated analysis, the
laborious process of labeling training data and the lack of accessible models
hinder scalability. This study explores the feasibility of large language
models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Gemini as tools for decoding neighborhood
environments (e.g., sidewalk and powerline) at scale. We train a robust
YOLOv11-based model, which achieves an average accuracy of 99.13% in detecting
six environmental indicators, including streetlight, sidewalk, powerline,
apartment, single-lane road, and multilane road. We then evaluate four LLMs,
including ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and Grok, to assess their feasibility,
robustness, and limitations in identifying these indicators, with a focus on
the impact of prompting strategies and fine-tuning. We apply majority voting
with the top three LLMs to achieve over 88% accuracy, which demonstrates LLMs
could be a useful tool to decode the neighborhood environment without any
training effort.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于机器学习的去噪方法，通过轻量级随机结构神经网络和共形分位数回归，不仅能有效去噪，还能揭示潜在空间中的结构特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学成像中，长时间采集高质量数据会导致效率低下，而缩短采集时间又会引入噪声。传统方法仅关注图像恢复，未能利用去噪过程揭示潜在结构。

Method: 使用轻量级随机结构神经网络的集成，通过共形分位数回归进行训练，无需标签或分割即可去噪并揭示空间和化学特征。

Result: 在真实地球生物化学成像数据上验证了方法的有效性，支持可靠解释并指导资源受限的实验设计。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅实现了可靠去噪，还通过去噪过程揭示了潜在空间中的有意义表征，为科学成像提供了新思路。

Abstract: Scientific imaging often involves long acquisition times to obtain
high-quality data, especially when probing complex, heterogeneous systems.
However, reducing acquisition time to increase throughput inevitably introduces
significant noise into the measurements. We present a machine learning approach
that not only denoises low-quality measurements with calibrated uncertainty
bounds, but also reveals emergent structure in the latent space. By using
ensembles of lightweight, randomly structured neural networks trained via
conformal quantile regression, our method performs reliable denoising while
uncovering interpretable spatial and chemical features -- without requiring
labels or segmentation. Unlike conventional approaches focused solely on image
restoration, our framework leverages the denoising process itself to drive the
emergence of meaningful representations. We validate the approach on real-world
geobiochemical imaging data, showing how it supports confident interpretation
and guides experimental design under resource constraints.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现，在语音基础模型（SFMs）中，选择单一编码层而非传统全层方法、优化预测头的时间建模以及集成多个SFMs，能显著提升听力受损人群的语音可懂度预测（SIP-HI）性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音基础模型（SFMs）在多种下游任务中表现优异，但在听力受损人群的语音可懂度预测（SIP-HI）任务中优化不足，需探索关键设计因素。

Method: 研究5种SFMs，重点分析编码层选择、预测头架构和集成配置对SIP-HI性能的影响。

Result: 单一编码层优于全层方法；时间建模对预测头至关重要；集成多个SFMs可提升性能，且个体模型越强效果越显著。

Conclusion: 研究为优化SFMs在SIP-HI任务中的应用提供了实用指导，强调了关键设计因素的重要性。

Abstract: Speech foundation models (SFMs) have demonstrated strong performance across a
variety of downstream tasks, including speech intelligibility prediction for
hearing-impaired people (SIP-HI). However, optimizing SFMs for SIP-HI has been
insufficiently explored. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study to
identify key design factors affecting SIP-HI performance with 5 SFMs, focusing
on encoder layer selection, prediction head architecture, and ensemble
configurations. Our findings show that, contrary to traditional use-all-layers
methods, selecting a single encoder layer yields better results. Additionally,
temporal modeling is crucial for effective prediction heads. We also
demonstrate that ensembling multiple SFMs improves performance, with stronger
individual models providing greater benefit. Finally, we explore the
relationship between key SFM attributes and their impact on SIP-HI performance.
Our study offers practical insights into effectively adapting SFMs for speech
intelligibility prediction for hearing-impaired populations.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种评估生成式AI在现实任务中表现的方法，强调实用性而非抽象智能，并发现现有基准测试在覆盖范围和实用性指标上存在不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注代码生成或事实回忆，未能反映用户实际使用AI的多样化需求，如写作辅助、总结等。

Method: 通过大规模调查数据和使用日志分析，确定了六种核心能力，并评估现有基准测试对这些能力的覆盖情况。

Result: 发现现有基准测试在覆盖范围、效率测量和可解释性方面存在显著差距，并基于实用性指标比较了领先模型。

Conclusion: Google Gemini在实用性指标上优于其他模型，如OpenAI的GPT、Meta的LLaMA等。

Abstract: As generative AI becomes increasingly embedded in everyday workflows, it is
important to evaluate its performance in ways that reflect real-world usage
rather than abstract notions of intelligence. Unlike many existing benchmarks
that assess general intelligence, our approach focuses on real-world utility,
evaluating how well models support users in everyday tasks. While current
benchmarks emphasize code generation or factual recall, users rely on AI for a
much broader range of activities-from writing assistance and summarization to
citation formatting and stylistic feedback. In this paper, we analyze
large-scale survey data and usage logs to identify six core capabilities that
represent how people commonly use Large Language Models (LLMs): Summarization,
Technical Assistance, Reviewing Work, Data Structuring, Generation, and
Information Retrieval. We then assess the extent to which existing benchmarks
cover these capabilities, revealing significant gaps in coverage, efficiency
measurement, and interpretability. Drawing on this analysis, we use
human-centered criteria to identify gaps in how well current benchmarks reflect
common usage that is grounded in five practical criteria: coherence, accuracy,
clarity, relevance, and efficiency. For four of the six capabilities, we
identify the benchmarks that best align with real-world tasks and use them to
compare leading models. We find that Google Gemini outperforms other
models-including OpenAI's GPT, xAI's Grok, Meta's LLaMA, Anthropic's Claude,
DeepSeek, and Qwen from Alibaba-on these utility-focused metrics.

Abstract: The rise of large language models and multi-agent systems has sparked growing
interest in AI scientists capable of autonomous biological research. However,
existing benchmarks either focus on reasoning without data or on data analysis
with predefined statistical answers, lacking realistic, data-driven evaluation
settings. Here, we introduce the Biological AI Scientist Benchmark (BaisBench),
a benchmark designed to assess AI scientists' ability to generate biological
discoveries through data analysis and reasoning with external knowledge.
BaisBench comprises two tasks: cell type annotation on 31 expert-labeled
single-cell datasets, and scientific discovery through answering 198
multiple-choice questions derived from the biological insights of 41 recent
single-cell studies. Systematic experiments on state-of-the-art AI scientists
and LLM agents showed that while promising, current models still substantially
underperform human experts on both tasks. We hope BaisBench will fill this gap
and serve as a foundation for advancing and evaluating AI models for scientific
discovery. The benchmark can be found at: https://github.com/EperLuo/BaisBench.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于反事实推理的最小成本因果决策框架（MiCCD），用于异常条件下的决策制定，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有决策框架在异常条件下常忽略行动成本或未能充分结合因果机制，导致效果不佳。

Method: 通过反事实推理和因果图构建代理模型，利用SLSQP算法优化干预策略。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，MiCCD在F1分数、成本效率和排名质量（nDCG@k）上优于传统方法。

Conclusion: MiCCD框架有效解决了异常决策中的成本和因果机制问题，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Decision making under abnormal conditions is a critical process that involves
evaluating the current state and determining the optimal action to restore the
system to a normal state at an acceptable cost. However, in such scenarios,
existing decision-making frameworks highly rely on reinforcement learning or
root cause analysis, resulting in them frequently neglecting the cost of the
actions or failing to incorporate causal mechanisms adequately. By relaxing the
existing causal decision framework to solve the necessary cause, we propose a
minimum-cost causal decision (MiCCD) framework via counterfactual reasoning to
address the above challenges. Emphasis is placed on making counterfactual
reasoning processes identifiable in the presence of a large amount of mixed
anomaly data, as well as finding the optimal intervention state in a continuous
decision space. Specifically, it formulates a surrogate model based on causal
graphs, using abnormal pattern clustering labels as supervisory signals. This
enables the approximation of the structural causal model among the variables
and lays a foundation for identifiable counterfactual reasoning. With the
causal structure approximated, we then established an optimization model based
on counterfactual estimation. The Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP)
algorithm is further employed to optimize intervention strategies while taking
costs into account. Experimental evaluations on both synthetic and real-world
datasets reveal that MiCCD outperforms conventional methods across multiple
metrics, including F1-score, cost efficiency, and ranking quality(nDCG@k
values), thus validating its efficacy and broad applicability.

Motivation: 解决RL在新环境中泛化能力不足的问题，借鉴人类组合推理的灵感。

Method: 利用语言作为组合模态分解潜在空间，结合掩码自编码器和互信息约束。

Result: 在数值模拟和机器人任务中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: WM3C通过组合因果组件有效提升RL的泛化和适应能力。

Abstract: Generalization in reinforcement learning (RL) remains a significant
challenge, especially when agents encounter novel environments with unseen
dynamics. Drawing inspiration from human compositional reasoning -- where known
components are reconfigured to handle new situations -- we introduce World
Modeling with Compositional Causal Components (WM3C). This novel framework
enhances RL generalization by learning and leveraging compositional causal
components. Unlike previous approaches focusing on invariant representation
learning or meta-learning, WM3C identifies and utilizes causal dynamics among
composable elements, facilitating robust adaptation to new tasks. Our approach
integrates language as a compositional modality to decompose the latent space
into meaningful components and provides theoretical guarantees for their unique
identification under mild assumptions. Our practical implementation uses a
masked autoencoder with mutual information constraints and adaptive sparsity
regularization to capture high-level semantic information and effectively
disentangle transition dynamics. Experiments on numerical simulations and
real-world robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that WM3C significantly
outperforms existing methods in identifying latent processes, improving policy
learning, and generalizing to unseen tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在解决复杂问题时仍存在挑战，受人类学习策略启发，提出改进方法。

Method: 1. ADCL：动态调整问题难度以匹配模型能力；2. EGSR：引导模型自主重构专家解决方案。

Result: 在AIME24和AIME25基准上分别提升10%和16.6%。

Conclusion: 人类启发的策略显著提升模型性能，为复杂问题解决提供新思路。

Abstract: Despite impressive progress in areas like mathematical reasoning, large
language models still face significant challenges in consistently solving
complex problems. Drawing inspiration from key human learning strategies, we
propose two novel strategies to enhance the capability of large language models
to solve these complex problems. First, Adaptive Difficulty Curriculum Learning
(ADCL) is a novel curriculum learning strategy that tackles the Difficulty
Shift phenomenon (i.e., a model's perception of problem difficulty dynamically
changes during training) by periodically re-estimating difficulty within
upcoming data batches to maintain alignment with the model's evolving
capabilities. Second, Expert-Guided Self-Reformulation (EGSR) is a novel
reinforcement learning strategy that bridges the gap between imitation learning
and pure exploration by guiding models to reformulate expert solutions within
their own conceptual framework, rather than relying on direct imitation,
fostering deeper understanding and knowledge assimilation. Extensive
experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, using Qwen2.5-7B
as the base model, demonstrate that these human-inspired strategies
synergistically and significantly enhance performance. Notably, their combined
application improves performance over the standard Zero-RL baseline by 10% on
the AIME24 benchmark and 16.6% on AIME25.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆的性能虽因AI进步而提升，但其决策过程的不透明性阻碍了社会信任和监管接受，因此需要解释性。

Method: 基于意图感知策略图，从全局和局部视角提取可解释且可靠的车辆行为解释。

Result: 该方法在nuScenes数据集上展示了其潜力，能评估车辆是否在合法范围内运行，并识别数据集和模型的潜在漏洞。

Conclusion: 提出的解释性方法有助于提升自动驾驶的透明度和信任，为监管和安全性提供支持。

Abstract: The potential to improve road safety, reduce human driving error, and promote
environmental sustainability have enabled the field of autonomous driving to
progress rapidly over recent decades. The performance of autonomous vehicles
has significantly improved thanks to advancements in Artificial Intelligence,
particularly Deep Learning. Nevertheless, the opacity of their decision-making,
rooted in the use of accurate yet complex AI models, has created barriers to
their societal trust and regulatory acceptance, raising the need for
explainability. We propose a post-hoc, model-agnostic solution to provide
teleological explanations for the behaviour of an autonomous vehicle in urban
environments. Building on Intention-aware Policy Graphs, our approach enables
the extraction of interpretable and reliable explanations of vehicle behaviour
in the nuScenes dataset from global and local perspectives. We demonstrate the
potential of these explanations to assess whether the vehicle operates within
acceptable legal boundaries and to identify possible vulnerabilities in
autonomous driving datasets and models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型模型驱动的AI Agent在多Agent系统（MAS）中展现出决策、协作和适应性能力，但现有Model Context Protocol（MCP）缺乏对Agent级协作的支持，因此需要一种新的服务导向范式来统一Agent生命周期管理。

Method: AaaS-AN基于Role-Goal-Process-Service（RGPS）标准，包含动态Agent网络和服务导向Agent两大核心组件，通过Service Scheduler实现分布式协调和任务管理。

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成任务中，AaaS-AN优于现有基线方法，并成功构建了一个包含100多个Agent服务的MAS系统。

Conclusion: AaaS-AN为多Agent系统的协作提供了有效解决方案，并发布了包含10,000个长链协作工作流的数据集，推动未来研究。

Abstract: The rise of large model-based AI agents has spurred interest in Multi-Agent
Systems (MAS) for their capabilities in decision-making, collaboration, and
adaptability. While the Model Context Protocol (MCP) addresses tool invocation
and data exchange challenges via a unified protocol, it lacks support for
organizing agent-level collaboration. To bridge this gap, we propose
Agent-as-a-Service based on Agent Network (AaaS-AN), a service-oriented
paradigm grounded in the Role-Goal-Process-Service (RGPS) standard. AaaS-AN
unifies the entire agent lifecycle, including construction, integration,
interoperability, and networked collaboration, through two core components: (1)
a dynamic Agent Network, which models agents and agent groups as vertexes that
self-organize within the network based on task and role dependencies; (2)
service-oriented agents, incorporating service discovery, registration, and
interoperability protocols. These are orchestrated by a Service Scheduler,
which leverages an Execution Graph to enable distributed coordination, context
tracking, and runtime task management. We validate AaaS-AN on mathematical
reasoning and application-level code generation tasks, which outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, we constructed a MAS based on AaaS-AN
containing agent groups, Robotic Process Automation (RPA) workflows, and MCP
servers over 100 agent services. We also release a dataset containing 10,000
long-horizon multi-agent workflows to facilitate future research on long-chain
collaboration in MAS.

Motivation: 柔性作业车间调度问题（FJSSP）是一个NP难组合优化问题，在制造业等领域有广泛应用。现有方法如约束求解、禁忌搜索、遗传算法和MCTS等仍有改进空间。

Method: 提出了一种基于广义嵌套滚动策略适应（GNRPA）的新算法，用于优化FJSSP的调度方案。

Result: 实验结果显示，该算法优于其他基于MCTS的方法，但在大规模实例上的调度时间仍与已知上限有差距。

Conclusion: 新算法在FJSSP中表现出色，但仍有进一步优化的空间。

Abstract: The Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP) is an NP-hard combinatorial
optimization problem, with several application domains, especially for
manufacturing purposes. The objective is to
  efficiently schedule multiple operations on dissimilar machines. These
operations are gathered into jobs, and operations pertaining to the same job
need to be scheduled sequentially. Different methods have been previously
tested to solve this problem, such as Constraint Solving, Tabu Search, Genetic
Algorithms, or Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). We propose a novel algorithm
derived from the Generalized Nested Rollout Policy Adaptation, developed to
solve the FJSSP. We report encouraging experimental results, as our algorithm
performs better than other MCTS-based approaches, even if makespans obtained on
large instances are still far from known upper bounds.

Result: 实验表明，SAP在MicroRTS环境中性能提升85.35%，并能有效应对未见过的对手策略。

Conclusion: SAP框架显著提升了LLM智能体的对手利用能力，具有鲁棒的泛化性能。

Abstract: Efficiently modeling and exploiting opponents is a long-standing challenge in
adversarial domains. Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on extensive textual
data have recently demonstrated outstanding performance in general tasks,
introducing new research directions for opponent modeling. Some studies
primarily focus on directly using LLMs to generate decisions based on the
elaborate prompt context that incorporates opponent descriptions, while these
approaches are limited to scenarios where LLMs possess adequate domain
expertise. To address that, we introduce a two-stage Strategy-Augmented
Planning (SAP) framework that significantly enhances the opponent exploitation
capabilities of LLM-based agents by utilizing a critical component, the
Strategy Evaluation Network (SEN). Specifically, in the offline stage, we
construct an explicit strategy space and subsequently collect strategy-outcome
pair data for training the SEN network. During the online phase, SAP
dynamically recognizes the opponent's strategies and greedily exploits them by
searching best response strategy on the well-trained SEN, finally translating
strategy to a course of actions by carefully designed prompts. Experimental
results show that SAP exhibits robust generalization capabilities, allowing it
to perform effectively not only against previously encountered opponent
strategies but also against novel, unseen strategies. In the MicroRTS
environment, SAP achieves a 85.35\% performance improvement over baseline
methods and matches the competitiveness of reinforcement learning approaches
against state-of-the-art (SOTA) rule-based AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决PDDL任务规划在动态人机协作中的可扩展性、重新规划需求和延迟问题，同时避免对闭源远程LLM的依赖。

Method: Gideon整合问题生成器生成大规模领域-问题-计划数据集，并适配神经符号规划以支持本地LLM和多领域扩展。

Result: 单领域实验中，32k样本训练的模型达到66.1%有效计划率；多领域实验中，16k样本达到70.6%有效计划率。

Conclusion: Gideon在模型大小、推理效率和多领域适应性方面具有优势，但训练效率较低，可通过数据生成管道缓解。

Abstract: PDDL-based symbolic task planning remains pivotal for robot autonomy yet
struggles with dynamic human-robot collaboration due to scalability,
re-planning demands, and delayed plan availability. Although a few
neurosymbolic frameworks have previously leveraged LLMs such as GPT-3 to
address these challenges, reliance on closed-source, remote models with limited
context introduced critical constraints: third-party dependency, inconsistent
response times, restricted plan length and complexity, and multi-domain
scalability issues. We present Gideon, a novel framework that enables the
transition to modern, smaller, local LLMs with extended context length. Gideon
integrates a novel problem generator to systematically generate large-scale
datasets of realistic domain-problem-plan tuples for any domain, and adapts
neurosymbolic planning for local LLMs, enabling on-device execution and
extended context for multi-domain support. Preliminary experiments in
single-domain scenarios performed on Qwen-2.5 1.5B and trained on 8k-32k
samples, demonstrate a valid plan percentage of 66.1% (32k model) and show that
the figure can be further scaled through additional data. Multi-domain tests on
16k samples yield an even higher 70.6% planning validity rate, proving
extensibility across domains and signaling that data variety can have a
positive effect on learning efficiency. Although long-horizon planning and
reduced model size make Gideon training much less efficient than baseline
models based on larger LLMs, the results are still significant considering that
the trained model is about 120x smaller than baseline and that significant
advantages can be achieved in inference efficiency, scalability, and
multi-domain adaptability, all critical factors in human-robot collaboration.
Training inefficiency can be mitigated by Gideon's streamlined data generation
pipeline.

heterogeneous clinical data, including structured records and unstructured
physician notes. Built on fine-tuned, open-source large language models (LLMs)
within a retrieval-augmented generation framework, TrialMatchAI ensures
transparency and reproducibility and maintains a lightweight deployment
footprint suitable for clinical environments. The system normalizes biomedical
entities, retrieves relevant trials using a hybrid search strategy combining
lexical and semantic similarity, re-ranks results, and performs criterion-level
eligibility assessments using medical Chain-of-Thought reasoning. This pipeline
delivers explainable outputs with traceable decision rationales. In real-world
validation, 92 percent of oncology patients had at least one relevant trial
retrieved within the top 20 recommendations. Evaluation across synthetic and
real clinical datasets confirmed state-of-the-art performance, with expert
assessment validating over 90 percent accuracy in criterion-level eligibility
classification, particularly excelling in biomarker-driven matches. Designed
for modularity and privacy, TrialMatchAI supports Phenopackets-standardized
data, enables secure local deployment, and allows seamless replacement of LLM
components as more advanced models emerge. By enhancing efficiency and
interpretability and offering lightweight, open-source deployment, TrialMatchAI
provides a scalable solution for AI-driven clinical trial matching in precision

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于团队语义和依赖原子的命题逻辑中KLM式优先推理的复杂性和性质，发现其具有累积性但不满足System~P，并给出了满足System~P的条件。此外，探讨了经典逻辑和依赖逻辑在优先模型中的表达，并提出了两种表示形式的复杂性结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究命题依赖逻辑中优先推理的性质和复杂性，填补团队语义下优先推理的理论空白。

Method: 通过分析优先团队推理的累积性和System~P的满足条件，探讨经典与依赖逻辑在优先模型中的表达，并研究其复杂性。

Result: 优先团队推理具有累积性但不满足System~P；给出了满足System~P的条件；展示了经典和依赖逻辑在优先模型中的表达方式；提出了新的复杂性结果。

Conclusion: 团队语义下的优先推理具有独特性质，其复杂性结果对理论计算机科学和逻辑学有重要意义。

Abstract: This paper considers the complexity and properties of KLM-style preferential
reasoning in the setting of propositional logic with team semantics and
dependence atoms, also known as propositional dependence logic. Preferential
team-based reasoning is shown to be cumulative, yet violates System~P. We give
intuitive conditions that fully characterise those cases where preferential
propositional dependence logic satisfies System~P. We show that these
characterisations do, surprisingly, not carry over to preferential team-based
propositional logic. Furthermore, we show how classical entailment and
dependence logic entailment can be expressed in terms of non-trivial
preferential models. Finally, we present the complexity of preferential
team-based reasoning for two natural representations. This includes novel
complexity results for classical (non-team-based) preferential reasoning.

TL;DR: FSM-SCG框架通过结合有限状态机和LLMs，显著提升智能合约生成的代码质量和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统智能合约生成方法依赖人工编码和专家审核，门槛高且效率低，LLMs在智能合约生成中面临效果和安全性的挑战。

Method: FSM-SCG框架将用户需求抽象为有限状态机，指导LLMs生成智能合约，并通过编译和安全检查反馈迭代优化代码。

Result: 实验表明，FSM-SCG将智能合约代码的编译成功率提升最多48%，平均漏洞风险评分降低约68%。

Conclusion: FSM-SCG框架有效解决了智能合约生成的效率和安全问题，显著优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: Smart contract is a kind of self-executing code based on blockchain
technology with a wide range of application scenarios, but the traditional
generation method relies on manual coding and expert auditing, which has a high
threshold and low efficiency. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) show great
potential in programming tasks, they still face challenges in smart contract
generation w.r.t. effectiveness and security. To solve these problems, we
propose FSM-SCG, a smart contract generation framework based on finite state
machine (FSM) and LLMs, which significantly improves the quality of the
generated code by abstracting user requirements to generate FSM, guiding LLMs
to generate smart contracts, and iteratively optimizing the code with the
feedback of compilation and security checks. The experimental results show that
FSM-SCG significantly improves the quality of smart contract generation.
Compared to the best baseline, FSM-SCG improves the compilation success rate of
generated smart contract code by at most 48%, and reduces the average
vulnerability risk score by approximately 68%.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Visually Guided Decoding (VGD)的无梯度方法，利用LLMs和CLIP指导生成连贯且语义对齐的提示，解决了现有提示反转技术的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成模型的提示生成方法（如软提示和硬提示）效果不佳，缺乏可解释性和连贯性。

Method: VGD结合大型语言模型（LLMs）的文本生成能力和CLIP评分，生成人类可读且与视觉概念对齐的提示。

Result: 实验表明，VGD在生成可理解和上下文相关的提示方面优于现有技术。

Conclusion: VGD提高了提示生成的可解释性、泛化性和灵活性，无需额外训练即可实现更直观和可控的交互。

Abstract: Text-to-image generative models like DALL-E and Stable Diffusion have
revolutionized visual content creation across various applications, including
advertising, personalized media, and design prototyping. However, crafting
effective textual prompts to guide these models remains challenging, often
requiring extensive trial and error. Existing prompt inversion approaches, such
as soft and hard prompt techniques, are not so effective due to the limited
interpretability and incoherent prompt generation. To address these issues, we
propose Visually Guided Decoding (VGD), a gradient-free approach that leverages
large language models (LLMs) and CLIP-based guidance to generate coherent and
semantically aligned prompts. In essence, VGD utilizes the robust text
generation capabilities of LLMs to produce human-readable prompts. Further, by
employing CLIP scores to ensure alignment with user-specified visual concepts,
VGD enhances the interpretability, generalization, and flexibility of prompt
generation without the need for additional training. Our experiments
demonstrate that VGD outperforms existing prompt inversion techniques in
generating understandable and contextually relevant prompts, facilitating more
intuitive and controllable interactions with text-to-image models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种结合自然语言处理（NLP）和运动监测的深度学习框架，利用日常易获取的生理数据和运动相关文本，实现对代谢综合征（MetS）的早期诊断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MetS是一种常见且易被低估的疾病，标准诊断需要医疗机构进行血液检测，存在未满足的医疗需求。研究旨在利用日常易获取的数据降低筛查成本。

Method: 从40名志愿者收集数据，采用数据增强解决不平衡问题，提出结合NLP和运动监测的深度学习框架。

Result: 最佳模型在3折交叉验证中表现优异（AUROC=0.806，REC=76.3%），文本和每日最低心率对分类贡献最大。

Conclusion: 研究表明，利用日常易测数据可实现MetS早期诊断，有助于降低筛查和管理成本。

Abstract: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a medication condition characterized by
abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension and hyperlipidemia. It
increases the risk of majority of chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes
mellitus, and affects about one quarter of the global population. Therefore,
early detection and timely intervention for MetS are crucial. Standard
diagnosis for MetS components requires blood tests conducted within medical
institutions. However, it is frequently underestimated, leading to unmet need
for care for MetS population. This study aims to use the least physiological
data and free texts about exercises related activities, which are obtained
easily in daily life, to diagnosis MetS. We collected the data from 40
volunteers in a nursing home and used data augmentation to reduce the
imbalance. We propose a deep learning framework for classifying MetS that
integrates natural language processing (NLP) and exercise monitoring. The
results showed that the best model reported a high positive result (AUROC=0.806
and REC=76.3%) through 3-fold cross-validation. Feature importance analysis
revealed that text and minimum heart rate on a daily basis contribute the most
in the classification of MetS. This study demonstrates the potential
application of data that are easily measurable in daily life for the early
diagnosis of MetS, which could contribute to reducing the cost of screening and
management for MetS population.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着代理工作流在各领域的广泛应用，现有依赖人工分析的评估方法无法应对其复杂性和规模增长，亟需可扩展的系统化评估方法。

Method: 论文提出了一种错误类型的分类法，并基于此构建了148条人工标注的轨迹数据集TRAIL，涵盖单代理和多代理系统的实际应用场景。

Result: 实验表明，现代长上下文LLM在轨迹调试中表现不佳，最佳模型Gemini-2.5-pro在TRAIL上的得分仅为11%。

Conclusion: 论文强调了开发可扩展评估方法的必要性，并提供了公开数据集和代码以推动未来研究。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of agentic workflows across diverse domains brings a
critical need to scalably and systematically evaluate the complex traces these
systems generate. Current evaluation methods depend on manual, domain-specific
human analysis of lengthy workflow traces - an approach that does not scale
with the growing complexity and volume of agentic outputs. Error analysis in
these settings is further complicated by the interplay of external tool outputs
and language model reasoning, making it more challenging than traditional
software debugging. In this work, we (1) articulate the need for robust and
dynamic evaluation methods for agentic workflow traces, (2) introduce a formal
taxonomy of error types encountered in agentic systems, and (3) present a set
of 148 large human-annotated traces (TRAIL) constructed using this taxonomy and
grounded in established agentic benchmarks. To ensure ecological validity, we
curate traces from both single and multi-agent systems, focusing on real-world
applications such as software engineering and open-world information retrieval.
Our evaluations reveal that modern long context LLMs perform poorly at trace
debugging, with the best Gemini-2.5-pro model scoring a mere 11% on TRAIL. Our
dataset and code are made publicly available to support and accelerate future
research in scalable evaluation for agentic workflows.

Result: 发布了WixQA数据集和知识库快照，并提供了基线结果，为企业RAG系统提供了全面的评估工具。

Conclusion: WixQA填补了企业问答系统评估的空白，为实际环境中的RAG技术提供了独特的基准。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a cornerstone of modern question
answering (QA) systems, enabling grounded answers based on external knowledge.
Although recent progress has been driven by open-domain datasets, enterprise QA
systems need datasets that mirror the concrete, domain-specific issues users
raise in day-to-day support scenarios. Critically, evaluating end-to-end RAG
systems requires benchmarks comprising not only question--answer pairs but also
the specific knowledge base (KB) snapshot from which answers were derived. To
address this need, we introduce WixQA, a benchmark suite featuring QA datasets
precisely grounded in the released KB corpus, enabling holistic evaluation of
retrieval and generation components. WixQA includes three distinct QA datasets
derived from Wix.com customer support interactions and grounded in a snapshot
of the public Wix Help Center KB: (i) WixQA-ExpertWritten, 200 real user
queries with expert-authored, multi-step answers; (ii) WixQA-Simulated, 200
expert-validated QA pairs distilled from user dialogues; and (iii)
WixQA-Synthetic, 6,222 LLM-generated QA pairs, with one pair systematically
derived from each article in the knowledge base. We release the KB snapshot
alongside the datasets under MIT license and provide comprehensive baseline
results, forming a unique benchmark for evaluating enterprise RAG systems in
realistic enterprise environments.

(the Lost Sales, Dual-Sourcing and Multi-Echelon Inventory Model). These
methodologies are applied in the supermarket context. The main purpose is to
analyse efficient methods for the data-driven. Their possibility, potential and
current challenges are taken into consideration in this report. By comparing
the results in each model, the effectiveness of each algorithm is evaluated
based on several key performance indicators, including forecast accuracy,
adaptability to market changes, and overall impact on inventory costs and
customer satisfaction levels. The data visualization tools and statistical
metrics are the indicators for the comparisons and show some obvious trends and
patterns that can guide decision-making in inventory management. These tools
enable managers to not only track the performance of different algorithms in
real-time but also to drill down into specific data points to understand the
underlying causes of inventory fluctuations. This level of detail is crucial
for pinpointing inefficiencies and areas for improvement within the supply
chain.

Motivation: 当前数学LLM的研究主要集中在推理能力，而创造力评估不足，缺乏相关数据集。

Method: 提出数学创造力评估标准，并构建DeepMath-Creative基准测试，对主流LLM进行系统性评估。

Result: 最佳模型O3 Mini在基础本科级任务上仅达到70%准确率，复杂问题表现更差。

Conclusion: 当前LLM的创造力可能源于模式重组而非真正的创新或合成能力。

Abstract: To advance the mathematical proficiency of large language models (LLMs), the
DeepMath team has launched an open-source initiative aimed at developing an
open mathematical LLM and systematically evaluating its mathematical
creativity. This paper represents the initial contribution of this initiative.
While recent developments in mathematical LLMs have predominantly emphasized
reasoning skills, as evidenced by benchmarks on elementary to
undergraduate-level mathematical tasks, the creative capabilities of these
models have received comparatively little attention, and evaluation datasets
remain scarce. To address this gap, we propose an evaluation criteria for
mathematical creativity and introduce DeepMath-Creative, a novel, high-quality
benchmark comprising constructive problems across algebra, geometry, analysis,
and other domains. We conduct a systematic evaluation of mainstream LLMs'
creative problem-solving abilities using this dataset. Experimental results
show that even under lenient scoring criteria -- emphasizing core solution
components and disregarding minor inaccuracies, such as small logical gaps,
incomplete justifications, or redundant explanations -- the best-performing
model, O3 Mini, achieves merely 70% accuracy, primarily on basic
undergraduate-level constructive tasks. Performance declines sharply on more
complex problems, with models failing to provide substantive strategies for
open problems. These findings suggest that, although current LLMs display a
degree of constructive proficiency on familiar and lower-difficulty problems,
such performance is likely attributable to the recombination of memorized
patterns rather than authentic creative insight or novel synthesis.

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), later renamed ARC-AGI, poses a
fundamental challenge in artificial general intelligence (AGI), requiring
solutions that exhibit robust abstraction and reasoning capabilities across
diverse tasks, while only few (with median count of three) correct examples are
presented. While ARC-AGI remains very challenging for artificial intelligence
systems, it is rather easy for humans. This paper introduces ARC-NCA, a
developmental approach leveraging standard Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) and
NCA enhanced with hidden memories (EngramNCA) to tackle the ARC-AGI benchmark.
NCAs are employed for their inherent ability to simulate complex dynamics and
emergent patterns, mimicking developmental processes observed in biological
systems. Developmental solutions may offer a promising avenue for enhancing
AI's problem-solving capabilities beyond mere training data extrapolation.
ARC-NCA demonstrates how integrating developmental principles into
computational models can foster adaptive reasoning and abstraction. We show
that our ARC-NCA proof-of-concept results may be comparable to, and sometimes
surpass, that of ChatGPT 4.5, at a fraction of the cost.

TL;DR: Blockbuster是一个用于AI算子融合的框架，适用于多处理器架构，通过数据块在内存层级间的显式建模和两阶段融合算法，实现了高效的算子融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI程序在内存层级间的数据移动效率低下，Blockbuster旨在通过显式建模数据移动和创新的融合算法提升性能。

Method: Blockbuster采用图表示AI工作负载（块程序），并通过候选选择算法和基于规则的融合算法实现算子融合，特别关注内存层级间的数据移动。

Result: 该算法成功重新发现了Flash Attention内核，并实现了复杂的算子融合（如LayerNorm与矩阵乘法的融合），生成高效的单一超大内核。

Conclusion: Blockbuster通过显式数据移动建模和两阶段融合算法，显著提升了AI程序的性能，适用于大规模AI工作负载。

Abstract: Blockbuster is a framework for AI operator fusion in inference programs. The
Blockbuster framework is compatible with any multiprocessor architecture that
has a tiered memory hierarchy, including GPUs, multi-core CPUs, and some AI
accelerator chips. It includes a graph-based representation for AI workloads,
called a block program, which explicitly models how blocks of data move between
the memory tiers. It also includes an operator fusion procedure, which is made
up of a candidate selection algorithm and a fusion algorithm that fuses each
individual candidate - this two-algorithm structure makes Blockbuster
especially suitable for large AI programs. The current paper focuses on the
fusion algorithm, which is a rule-based technique. While the literature is full
of previous rule-based fusion algorithms, what sets our algorithm apart is its
direct modeling of data movement between memory tiers, resulting in uniquely
powerful fusion results. As a first sanity check, we demonstrate how our
algorithm automatically rediscovers the well-known Flash Attention kernel.
Then, we demonstrate the real power of our approach by fusing LayerNorm with
matrix multiplication and RMSNorm with FNN-SwiGLU - the latter involves fusing
three matrix multiplications, a Hadamard product, a reduction, and a few
elementwise operations into a single mega-kernel.

Conclusion: 该方法是首个通用的自动化RL环境设计方法，同时指出了对RL算法过拟合的风险。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are increasingly used to solve the
optimal power flow (OPF) problem. Yet, the question of how to design RL
environments to maximize training performance remains unanswered, both for the
OPF and the general case. We propose a general approach for automated RL
environment design by utilizing multi-objective optimization. For that, we use
the hyperparameter optimization (HPO) framework, which allows the reuse of
existing HPO algorithms and methods. On five OPF benchmark problems, we
demonstrate that our automated design approach consistently outperforms a
manually created baseline environment design. Further, we use statistical
analyses to determine which environment design decisions are especially
important for performance, resulting in multiple novel insights on how RL-OPF
environments should be designed. Finally, we discuss the risk of overfitting
the environment to the utilized RL algorithm. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first general approach for automated RL environment design.

Conclusion: HGNN-IMA通过跨模态注意力和模态对齐，有效解决了多模态异构网络中的节点分类问题。

Abstract: Nowadays, numerous online platforms can be described as multi-modal
heterogeneous networks (MMHNs), such as Douban's movie networks and Amazon's
product review networks. Accurately categorizing nodes within these networks is
crucial for analyzing the corresponding entities, which requires effective
representation learning on nodes. However, existing multi-modal fusion methods
often adopt either early fusion strategies which may lose the unique
characteristics of individual modalities, or late fusion approaches overlooking
the cross-modal guidance in GNN-based information propagation. In this paper,
we propose a novel model for node classification in MMHNs, named Heterogeneous
Graph Neural Network with Inter-Modal Attention (HGNN-IMA). It learns node
representations by capturing the mutual influence of multiple modalities during
the information propagation process, within the framework of heterogeneous
graph transformer. Specifically, a nested inter-modal attention mechanism is
integrated into the inter-node attention to achieve adaptive multi-modal
fusion, and modality alignment is also taken into account to encourage the
propagation among nodes with consistent similarities across all modalities.
Moreover, an attention loss is augmented to mitigate the impact of missing
modalities. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of the model in the
node classification task, providing an innovative view to handle multi-modal

Abstract: The dyadic reaction generation task involves synthesizing responsive facial
reactions that align closely with the behaviors of a conversational partner,
enhancing the naturalness and effectiveness of human-like interaction
simulations. This paper introduces a novel approach, the Latent Behavior
Diffusion Model, comprising a context-aware autoencoder and a diffusion-based
conditional generator that addresses the challenge of generating diverse and
contextually relevant facial reactions from input speaker behaviors. The
autoencoder compresses high-dimensional input features, capturing dynamic
patterns in listener reactions while condensing complex input data into a
concise latent representation, facilitating more expressive and contextually
appropriate reaction synthesis. The diffusion-based conditional generator
operates on the latent space generated by the autoencoder to predict realistic
facial reactions in a non-autoregressive manner. This approach allows for
generating diverse facial reactions that reflect subtle variations in
conversational cues and emotional states. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach in achieving superior performance in dyadic
reaction synthesis tasks compared to existing methods.

*Karahan Sarıtaş,Çağatay Yıldız*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文重新审视了自注意力机制实现核主成分分析（KPCA）的近期观点，发现其缺乏实证支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证自注意力机制是否如Teo等人（2024）所述，实现了KPCA，并捕捉了Gram矩阵的特征向量。

Method: 通过分析自注意力值向量与KPCA理论的一致性、重建损失的解读以及Gram矩阵特征值统计的可复现性。

Result: 发现自注意力值与KPCA理论无显著相关性（相似度指标低），重建损失解读有误，且特征值统计不可复现。

Conclusion: 自注意力的KPCA解释缺乏实证支持。

Abstract: In this reproduction study, we revisit recent claims that self-attention
implements kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) (Teo et al., 2024),
positing that (i) value vectors $V$ capture the eigenvectors of the Gram matrix
of the keys, and (ii) that self-attention projects queries onto the principal
component axes of the key matrix $K$ in a feature space. Our analysis reveals
three critical inconsistencies: (1) No alignment exists between learned
self-attention value vectors and what is proposed in the KPCA perspective, with
average similarity metrics (optimal cosine similarity $\leq 0.32$, linear CKA
(Centered Kernel Alignment) $\leq 0.11$, kernel CKA $\leq 0.32$) indicating
negligible correspondence; (2) Reported decreases in reconstruction loss
$J_\text{proj}$, arguably justifying the claim that the self-attention
minimizes the projection error of KPCA, are misinterpreted, as the quantities
involved differ by orders of magnitude ($\sim\!10^3$); (3) Gram matrix
eigenvalue statistics, introduced to justify that $V$ captures the eigenvector
of the gram matrix, are irreproducible without undocumented
implementation-specific adjustments. Across 10 transformer architectures, we
conclude that the KPCA interpretation of self-attention lacks empirical
support.

*Alexander Hinterleitner,Thomas Bartz-Beielstein*

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新颖的XAI一致性概念，并将其纳入超参数调优目标，实现了预测性能与解释鲁棒性的多目标优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前XAI研究中，解释性很少在超参数调优或神经网络架构优化中被考虑，主要关注点仍是预测性能。

Method: 提出XAI一致性度量，并将其与预测性能结合，通过多目标优化框架（SPOT工具箱）进行模型选择。

Result: 研究发现架构配置空间中存在三个区域：性能差且解释性低、性能强但解释性弱、以及平衡两者的折衷区域。

Conclusion: 该研究为未来探索平衡性能与XAI一致性的模型是否更具鲁棒性奠定了基础。

Abstract: Despite the growing interest in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI),
explainability is rarely considered during hyperparameter tuning or neural
architecture optimization, where the focus remains primarily on minimizing
predictive loss. In this work, we introduce the novel concept of XAI
consistency, defined as the agreement among different feature attribution
methods, and propose new metrics to quantify it. For the first time, we
integrate XAI consistency directly into the hyperparameter tuning objective,
creating a multi-objective optimization framework that balances predictive
performance with explanation robustness. Implemented within the Sequential
Parameter Optimization Toolbox (SPOT), our approach uses both weighted
aggregation and desirability-based strategies to guide model selection. Through
our proposed framework and supporting tools, we explore the impact of
incorporating XAI consistency into the optimization process. This enables us to
characterize distinct regions in the architecture configuration space: one
region with poor performance and comparatively low interpretability, another
with strong predictive performance but weak interpretability due to low
\gls{xai} consistency, and a trade-off region that balances both objectives by
offering high interpretability alongside competitive performance. Beyond
introducing this novel approach, our research provides a foundation for future
investigations into whether models from the trade-off zone-balancing
performance loss and XAI consistency-exhibit greater robustness by avoiding
overfitting to training performance, thereby leading to more reliable
predictions on out-of-distribution data.

Abstract: Bayesian inference has many advantages in decision making of agents (e.g.
robotics/simulative agent) over a regular data-driven black-box neural network:
Data-efficiency, generalization, interpretability, and safety where these
advantages benefit directly/indirectly from the uncertainty quantification of
Bayesian inference. However, there are few comprehensive reviews to summarize
the progress of Bayesian inference on reinforcement learning (RL) for decision
making to give researchers a systematic understanding. This paper focuses on
combining Bayesian inference with RL that nowadays is an important approach in
agent decision making. To be exact, this paper discusses the following five
topics: 1) Bayesian methods that have potential for agent decision making.
First basic Bayesian methods and models (Bayesian rule, Bayesian learning, and
Bayesian conjugate models) are discussed followed by variational inference,
Bayesian optimization, Bayesian deep learning, Bayesian active learning,
Bayesian generative models, Bayesian meta-learning, and lifelong Bayesian
learning. 2) Classical combinations of Bayesian methods with model-based RL
(with approximation methods), model-free RL, and inverse RL. 3) Latest
combinations of potential Bayesian methods with RL. 4) Analytical comparisons
of methods that combine Bayesian methods with RL with respect to
data-efficiency, generalization, interpretability, and safety. 5) In-depth
discussions in six complex problem variants of RL, including unknown reward,
partial-observability, multi-agent, multi-task, non-linear non-Gaussian, and
hierarchical RL problems and the summary of how Bayesian methods work in the
data collection, data processing and policy learning stages of RL to pave the
way for better agent decision-making strategies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究探索了轻量级U-Net架构，用于资源受限的TinyML应用中的裂缝分割，通过减少卷积核、网络深度和使用深度可分离卷积，实现了性能与资源消耗的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 裂缝分割在结构健康监测（SHM）中至关重要，但在资源受限的微控制器上部署深度学习模型面临内存、计算能力和能源限制的挑战。

Method: 采用三种优化策略：减少滤波器数量、降低网络深度和使用深度可分离卷积（DWConv2D）。

Result: 减少卷积核和网络深度显著降低了RAM、Flash需求和推理时间，但牺牲了一些准确性。优化后的网络在性能和资源消耗之间取得了良好平衡。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅推动了基于TinyML的裂缝分割，还为能量自主的边缘SHM系统提供了可能性。

Abstract: Crack segmentation can play a critical role in Structural Health Monitoring
(SHM) by enabling accurate identification of crack size and location, which
allows to monitor structural damages over time. However, deploying deep
learning models for crack segmentation on resource-constrained microcontrollers
presents significant challenges due to limited memory, computational power, and
energy resources. To address these challenges, this study explores lightweight
U-Net architectures tailored for TinyML applications, focusing on three
optimization strategies: filter number reduction, network depth reduction, and
the use of Depthwise Separable Convolutions (DWConv2D). Our results demonstrate
that reducing convolution kernels and network depth significantly reduces RAM
and Flash requirement, and inference times, albeit with some accuracy
trade-offs. Specifically, by reducing the filer number to 25%, the network
depth to four blocks, and utilizing depthwise convolutions, a good compromise
between segmentation performance and resource consumption is achieved. This
makes the network particularly suitable for low-power TinyML applications. This
study not only advances TinyML-based crack segmentation but also provides the
possibility for energy-autonomous edge SHM systems.

Result: 在N-Omniglot数据集上显著提升分类性能，在CUB和miniImageNet上与ANN竞争且低功耗。

Conclusion: 提出的FSL-SNN框架在少样本学习中高效且性能优越。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) excel in computer vision tasks, especially,
few-shot learning (FSL), which is increasingly important for generalizing from
limited examples. However, DNNs are computationally expensive with scalability
issues in real world. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), with their event-driven
nature and low energy consumption, are particularly efficient in processing
sparse and dynamic data, though they still encounter difficulties in capturing
complex spatiotemporal features and performing accurate cross-class
comparisons. To further enhance the performance and efficiency of SNNs in
few-shot learning, we propose a few-shot learning framework based on SNNs,
which combines a self-feature extractor module and a cross-feature contrastive
module to refine feature representation and reduce power consumption. We apply
the combination of temporal efficient training loss and InfoNCE loss to
optimize the temporal dynamics of spike trains and enhance the discriminative
power. Experimental results show that the proposed FSL-SNN significantly
improves the classification performance on the neuromorphic dataset N-Omniglot,
and also achieves competitive performance to ANNs on static datasets such as
CUB and miniImageNet with low power consumption.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉能力大语言模型（LLM）和Funsearch思想的符号回归新方法，通过遗传算法优化参数，无需预设函数集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统符号回归方法需要预设函数集，限制了灵活性。本文旨在通过LLM和KANs实现更灵活的符号回归。

Method: 利用LLM从函数图像生成初始假设，通过数值优化拟合参数，结合遗传算法优化。使用KANs处理多变量函数。

Result: 证明了单变量函数足以完成符号回归，并通过KANs扩展到多变量函数。

Conclusion: 该方法无需预设函数集，灵活性高，为符号回归提供了新思路。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to symbolic regression using vision-capable large
language models (LLMs) and the ideas behind Google DeepMind's Funsearch. The
LLM is given a plot of a univariate function and tasked with proposing an
ansatz for that function. The free parameters of the ansatz are fitted using
standard numerical optimisers, and a collection of such ans\"atze make up the
population of a genetic algorithm. Unlike other symbolic regression techniques,
our method does not require the specification of a set of functions to be used
in regression, but with appropriate prompt engineering, we can arbitrarily
condition the generative step. By using Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs), we
demonstrate that ``univariate is all you need'' for symbolic regression, and
extend this method to multivariate functions by learning the univariate
function on each edge of a trained KAN. The combined expression is then
simplified by further processing with a language model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过增加推理链长度提升准确性，但导致冗余和高计算成本，尤其对小型模型影响显著。

Method: 1. 温度缩放（TS）控制推理停止点；2. TLDR（基于GRPO的强化学习）实现多级推理长度控制。

Result: 实验显示TS优于预算强制方法，TLDR提升50%的token效率且几乎不影响准确性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了停止时间控制的重要性，为小型模型的高效推理提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Recent research enhances language model reasoning by scaling test-time
compute via longer chain-of-thought traces. This often improves accuracy but
also introduces redundancy and high computational cost, especially for small
language models distilled with supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In this work, we
propose new algorithms to improve token-efficient reasoning with small-scale
models by effectively trading off accuracy and computation. We first show that
the post-SFT model fails to determine the optimal stopping point of the
reasoning process, resulting in verbose and repetitive outputs. Verbosity also
significantly varies across wrong vs correct responses. To address these
issues, we propose two solutions: (1) Temperature scaling (TS) to control the
stopping point for the thinking phase and thereby trace length, and (2) TLDR: a
length-regularized reinforcement learning method based on GRPO that facilitates
multi-level trace length control (e.g. short, medium, long reasoning).
Experiments on four reasoning benchmarks, MATH500, AMC, AIME24 and
OlympiadBench, demonstrate that TS is highly effective compared to s1's budget
forcing approach and TLDR significantly improves token efficiency by about 50%
with minimal to no accuracy loss over the SFT baseline. Moreover, TLDR also
facilitates flexible control over the response length, offering a practical and
effective solution for token-efficient reasoning in small models. Ultimately,
our work reveals the importance of stopping time control, highlights
shortcomings of pure SFT, and provides effective algorithmic recipes.

Motivation: 机器学习训练数据常包含敏感信息，匿名化技术用于保护隐私，但其对公平性的影响尚不明确。

Method: 系统评估匿名化技术对个体和群体公平性的影响，分析不同隐私设置和数据分布下的效果。

Result: 匿名化可能使群体公平性指标下降四个数量级，但相似性个体公平性指标会因输入同质性增加而改善。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了隐私、公平性和实用性之间的权衡，为负责任AI开发提供了指导。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) algorithms are heavily based on the availability of
training data, which, depending on the domain, often includes sensitive
information about data providers. This raises critical privacy concerns.
Anonymization techniques have emerged as a practical solution to address these
issues by generalizing features or suppressing data to make it more difficult
to accurately identify individuals. Although recent studies have shown that
privacy-enhancing technologies can influence ML predictions across different
subgroups, thus affecting fair decision-making, the specific effects of
anonymization techniques, such as $k$-anonymity, $\ell$-diversity, and
$t$-closeness, on ML fairness remain largely unexplored. In this work, we
systematically audit the impact of anonymization techniques on ML fairness,
evaluating both individual and group fairness. Our quantitative study reveals
that anonymization can degrade group fairness metrics by up to four orders of
magnitude. Conversely, similarity-based individual fairness metrics tend to
improve under stronger anonymization, largely as a result of increased input
homogeneity. By analyzing varying levels of anonymization across diverse
privacy settings and data distributions, this study provides critical insights
into the trade-offs between privacy, fairness, and utility, offering actionable
guidelines for responsible AI development. Our code is publicly available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习技术的普及，确保其决策公平性变得至关重要，但传统方法需公开模型参数，威胁模型保密性。

Method: 通过零知识证明技术，仅需模型参数和输入数据的聚合信息，无需具体数据集，提出新的公平性度量界限和高效证明协议。

Result: FairZK系统显著优于现有方法，处理4700万参数模型仅需343秒，速度提升高达1789倍。

Conclusion: FairZK为大规模机器学习模型的公平性验证提供了高效、保密的解决方案。

Abstract: With the rise of machine learning techniques, ensuring the fairness of
decisions made by machine learning algorithms has become of great importance in
critical applications. However, measuring fairness often requires full access
to the model parameters, which compromises the confidentiality of the models.
In this paper, we propose a solution using zero-knowledge proofs, which allows
the model owner to convince the public that a machine learning model is fair
while preserving the secrecy of the model. To circumvent the efficiency barrier
of naively proving machine learning inferences in zero-knowledge, our key
innovation is a new approach to measure fairness only with model parameters and
some aggregated information of the input, but not on any specific dataset. To
achieve this goal, we derive new bounds for the fairness of logistic regression
and deep neural network models that are tighter and better reflecting the
fairness compared to prior work. Moreover, we develop efficient zero-knowledge
proof protocols for common computations involved in measuring fairness,
including the spectral norm of matrices, maximum, absolute value, and
fixed-point arithmetic.
  We have fully implemented our system, FairZK, that proves machine learning
fairness in zero-knowledge. Experimental results show that FairZK is
significantly faster than the naive approach and an existing scheme that use
zero-knowledge inferences as a subroutine. The prover time is improved by
3.1x--1789x depending on the size of the model and the dataset. FairZK can
scale to a large model with 47 million parameters for the first time, and
generates a proof for its fairness in 343 seconds. This is estimated to be 4
orders of magnitude faster than existing schemes, which only scale to small
models with hundreds to thousands of parameters.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在标准架构、数据集和对抗攻击下，能实现94%以上压缩，同时恢复或提升对抗精度。

Conclusion: 该方法高效、模型与数据无关，支持自适应压缩，显著提升压缩模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deployment of neural networks on resource-constrained devices demands models
that are both compact and robust to adversarial inputs. However, compression
and adversarial robustness often conflict. In this work, we introduce a
dynamical low-rank training scheme enhanced with a novel spectral regularizer
that controls the condition number of the low-rank core in each layer. This
approach mitigates the sensitivity of compressed models to adversarial
perturbations without sacrificing clean accuracy. The method is model- and
data-agnostic, computationally efficient, and supports rank adaptivity to
automatically compress the network at hand. Extensive experiments across
standard architectures, datasets, and adversarial attacks show the regularized
networks can achieve over 94% compression while recovering or improving
adversarial accuracy relative to uncompressed baselines.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing
raw data, preserving participant privacy. Decentralized FL (DFL) eliminates
reliance on a central server, mitigating the single point of failure inherent
in the traditional FL paradigm, while introducing deployment challenges on
resource-constrained devices. To evaluate real-world applicability, this work
designs and deploys a physical testbed using edge devices such as Raspberry Pi
and Jetson Nano. The testbed is built upon a DFL training platform, NEBULA, and
extends it with a power monitoring module to measure energy consumption during
training. Experiments across multiple datasets show that model performance is
influenced by the communication topology, with denser topologies leading to
better outcomes in DFL settings.

Result: 验证了高因果影响的潜在特征对模型操控的有效性。

Conclusion: GradSAE为稀疏自编码器的分析提供了更有效的方法，强调了因果影响的重要性。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for
interpreting and steering the internal representations of large language models
(LLMs). However, conventional approaches to analyzing SAEs typically rely
solely on input-side activations, without considering the causal influence
between each latent feature and the model's output. This work is built on two
key hypotheses: (1) activated latents do not contribute equally to the
construction of the model's output, and (2) only latents with high causal
influence are effective for model steering. To validate these hypotheses, we
propose Gradient Sparse Autoencoder (GradSAE), a simple yet effective method
that identifies the most influential latents by incorporating output-side
gradient information.

Conclusion: 基于Fréchet距离的指标为生成AI模型的数据质量评估提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) models in smart grids have advanced
significantly in recent years due to their ability to generate large amounts of
synthetic data, which would otherwise be difficult to obtain in the real world
due to confidentiality constraints. A key challenge in utilizing such synthetic
data is how to assess the data quality produced from such generative models.
Traditional Euclidean distance-based metrics only reflect pair-wise relations
between two individual samples, and could fail in evaluating quality
differences between groups of synthetic datasets. In this work, we propose a
novel metric based on the Fr\'{e}chet Distance (FD) estimated between two
datasets in a learned feature space. The proposed method evaluates the quality
of generation from a distributional perspective. Empirical results demonstrate
the superiority of the proposed metric across timescales and models, enhancing
the reliability of data-driven decision-making in smart grid operations.

Abstract: Privacy and regulatory barriers often hinder centralized machine learning
solutions, particularly in sectors like healthcare where data cannot be freely
shared. Federated learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm to address these
concerns; however, existing frameworks primarily support gradient-based models,
leaving a gap for more interpretable, tree-based approaches. This paper
introduces a federated learning framework for Random Forest classifiers that
preserves data privacy and provides robust performance in distributed settings.
By leveraging PySyft for secure, privacy-aware computation, our method enables
multiple institutions to collaboratively train Random Forest models on locally
stored data without exposing sensitive information. The framework supports
weighted model averaging to account for varying data distributions, incremental
learning to progressively refine models, and local evaluation to assess
performance across heterogeneous datasets. Experiments on two real-world
healthcare benchmarks demonstrate that the federated approach maintains
competitive predictive accuracy - within a maximum 9\% margin of centralized
methods - while satisfying stringent privacy requirements. These findings
underscore the viability of tree-based federated learning for scenarios where
data cannot be centralized due to regulatory, competitive, or technical
constraints. The proposed solution addresses a notable gap in existing
federated learning libraries, offering an adaptable tool for secure distributed
machine learning tasks that demand both transparency and reliable performance.

high-dimensional data often lie near low-dimensional, non-linear manifolds, an
idea known as the manifold hypothesis. By explicitly modeling the geometric
structure of data through learning Riemannian geometry algorithms can achieve
improved performance and interpretability in tasks like clustering,
dimensionality reduction, and interpolation. In particular, learned pullback
geometry has recently undergone transformative developments that now make it
scalable to learn and scalable to evaluate, which further opens the door for
principled non-linear data analysis and interpretable machine learning.
However, there are still steps to be taken when considering real-world
multi-modal data. This work focuses on addressing distortions and modeling
errors that can arise in the multi-modal setting and proposes to alleviate both
challenges through isometrizing the learned Riemannian structure and balancing
regularity and expressivity of the diffeomorphism parametrization. We showcase
the effectiveness of the synergy of the proposed approaches in several
numerical experiments with both synthetic and real data.

*Xinghua Liu,Ming Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的高阶正则化（HR）方法，用于机器学习中的正则化过程，连接了正则化与可解释学习，并证明了其收敛性和泛化性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统正则化方法在神经网络训练中缺乏理论解释，HR方法旨在填补这一空白，提供可计算误差和更强的泛化能力。

Method: 提出高阶正则化（HR）方法，通过逆映射近似和误差界限分析，扩展了$L_2$正则化，并验证了其作为收缩的性质。

Result: HR方法在经典强化学习控制问题中表现出色，显著提升了神经网络的泛化能力。

Conclusion: HR方法为神经网络的正则化提供了理论支持，增强了模型的可解释性和性能。

Abstract: The paper proposes a novel regularization procedure for machine learning. The
proposed high-order regularization (HR) provides new insight into
regularization, which is widely used to train a neural network that can be
utilized to approximate the action-value function in general reinforcement
learning problems. The proposed HR method ensures the provable convergence of
the approximation algorithm, which makes the much-needed connection between
regularization and explainable learning using neural networks. The proposed HR
method theoretically demonstrates that regularization can be regarded as an
approximation in terms of inverse mapping with explicitly calculable
approximation error, and the $L_2$ regularization is a lower-order case of the
proposed method. We provide lower and upper bounds for the error of the
proposed HR solution, which helps build a reliable model. We also find that
regularization with the proposed HR can be regarded as a contraction. We prove
that the generalizability of neural networks can be maximized with a proper
regularization matrix, and the proposed HR is applicable for neural networks
with any mapping matrix. With the theoretical explanation of the extreme
learning machine for neural network training and the proposed high-order
regularization, one can better interpret the output of the neural network, thus
leading to explainable learning. We present a case study based on regularized
extreme learning neural networks to demonstrate the application of the proposed
HR and give the corresponding incremental HR solution. We verify the
performance of the proposed HR method by solving a classic control problem in
reinforcement learning. The result demonstrates the superior performance of the
method with significant enhancement in the generalizability of the neural
network.

industrial significance of CAD, highlighting the need for AI-driven innovation.

both closed-source LLMs as well as publicly available models. The core of this
review focuses on the various applications of LLMs in CAD, providing a taxonomy
of six key areas where these models are making considerable impact. Finally, we

*Brennon Brimhall,Philip Mathew,Neil Fendley,Yinzhi Cao,Matthew Green*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种称为“计算性遗忘”的强形式化定义，用于评估机器遗忘方法的有效性，并证明现有方法无法满足该定义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究机器遗忘方法的有效性，并揭示现有方法在对抗性攻击下的不足。

Method: 通过对抗性区分算法（如成员推断分数和Kullback-Leibler散度）评估遗忘模型与镜像模型的区分能力。

Result: 现有机器遗忘方法无法满足计算性遗忘定义，且基于差分隐私的方法虽可行但会导致效用崩溃。

Conclusion: 计算性遗忘为理论验证提供了框架，但当前方法仍需改进，未来需解决多个开放性问题。

Abstract: Machine unlearning methods take a model trained on a dataset and a forget
set, then attempt to produce a model as if it had only been trained on the
examples not in the forget set. We empirically show that an adversary is able
to distinguish between a mirror model (a control model produced by retraining
without the data to forget) and a model produced by an unlearning method across
representative unlearning methods from the literature. We build distinguishing
algorithms based on evaluation scores in the literature (i.e. membership
inference scores) and Kullback-Leibler divergence.
  We propose a strong formal definition for machine unlearning called
computational unlearning. Computational unlearning is defined as the inability
for an adversary to distinguish between a mirror model and a model produced by
an unlearning method. If the adversary cannot guess better than random (except
with negligible probability), then we say that an unlearning method achieves
computational unlearning.
  Our computational unlearning definition provides theoretical structure to
prove unlearning feasibility results. For example, our computational unlearning
definition immediately implies that there are no deterministic computational
unlearning methods for entropic learning algorithms. We also explore the
relationship between differential privacy (DP)-based unlearning methods and
computational unlearning, showing that DP-based approaches can satisfy
computational unlearning at the cost of an extreme utility collapse. These
results demonstrate that current methodology in the literature fundamentally
falls short of achieving computational unlearning. We conclude by identifying
several open questions for future work.

Motivation: 现有分层FL模型通常仅限于两层聚合，限制了复杂大规模网络的扩展性和灵活性。

Method: 采用嵌套聚合和层特定量化方案，开发了收敛分析并确定了关键因素（如量化参数、架构和迭代次数）的影响。

Result: QMLHFL在高数据异质性下仍保持高学习精度，优化后性能显著提升。

Conclusion: QMLHFL为分层FL提供了更灵活和高效的解决方案，适用于大规模网络。

Abstract: Almost all existing hierarchical federated learning (FL) models are limited
to two aggregation layers, restricting scalability and flexibility in complex,
large-scale networks. In this work, we propose a Multi-Layer Hierarchical
Federated Learning framework (QMLHFL), which appears to be the first study that
generalizes hierarchical FL to arbitrary numbers of layers and network
architectures through nested aggregation, while employing a layer-specific
quantization scheme to meet communication constraints. We develop a
comprehensive convergence analysis for QMLHFL and derive a general convergence
condition and rate that reveal the effects of key factors, including
quantization parameters, hierarchical architecture, and intra-layer iteration
counts. Furthermore, we determine the optimal number of intra-layer iterations
to maximize the convergence rate while meeting a deadline constraint that
accounts for both communication and computation times. Our results show that
QMLHFL consistently achieves high learning accuracy, even under high data
heterogeneity, and delivers notably improved performance when optimized,
compared to using randomly selected values.

Motivation: 现有基于深度学习点预测模型的置信区间建模方法存在成本高、未充分利用模型表示能力或缺乏理论保证等问题。

Result: 在12个数据集上验证了方法能提供更紧的置信区间并保持所需覆盖率。

Conclusion: 方法具有理论保证（渐近覆盖收敛），且实验证明其优于现有方法。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is critical for many applications, where deep
learning-based point prediction models have demonstrated strong performance.
However, in practical scenarios, there is also a need to quantify predictive
uncertainty through online confidence intervals. Existing confidence interval
modeling approaches building upon these deep point prediction models suffer
from key limitations: they either require costly retraining, fail to fully
leverage the representational strengths of deep models, or lack theoretical
guarantees. To address these gaps, we propose a lightweight conformal
prediction method that provides valid coverage and shorter interval lengths
without retraining. Our approach leverages features extracted from pre-trained
point prediction models to fit a residual predictor and construct confidence
intervals, further enhanced by an adaptive coverage control mechanism.
Theoretically, we prove that our method achieves asymptotic coverage
convergence, with error bounds dependent on the feature quality of the
underlying point prediction model. Experiments on 12 datasets demonstrate that
our method delivers tighter confidence intervals while maintaining desired
coverage rates. Code, model and dataset in

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FASP的新框架，用于解决离线安全强化学习中的长期安全性和样本效率问题。通过结合H-J可达性分析和悲观估计方法，FASP在多个任务中表现出色，尤其在安全性方面优于现有算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有离线安全强化学习方法主要关注短期安全，忽视了长期安全性和样本效率问题，导致在线部署时可能违反安全约束。

Method: 采用H-J可达性分析生成安全标签，结合CVAE和安全分类器；使用悲观估计方法优化Q值，避免OOD动作的误差。

Result: FASP在DSRL基准测试中表现优异，尤其在安全性方面优于现有算法。

Conclusion: FASP框架有效解决了离线安全强化学习中的长期安全性和样本效率问题，为实际应用提供了可靠保障。

Abstract: Offline safe reinforcement learning(OSRL) derives constraint-satisfying
policies from pre-collected datasets, offers a promising avenue for deploying
RL in safety-critical real-world domains such as robotics. However, the
majority of existing approaches emphasize only short-term safety, neglecting
long-horizon considerations. Consequently, they may violate safety constraints
and fail to ensure sustained protection during online deployment. Moreover, the
learned policies often struggle to handle states and actions that are not
present or out-of-distribution(OOD) from the offline dataset, and exhibit
limited sample efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
framework Feasibility-Aware offline Safe Reinforcement Learning with CVAE-based
Pessimism (FASP). First, we employ Hamilton-Jacobi (H-J) reachability analysis
to generate reliable safety labels, which serve as supervisory signals for
training both a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) and a safety
classifier. This approach not only ensures high sampling efficiency but also
provides rigorous long-horizon safety guarantees. Furthermore, we utilize
pessimistic estimation methods to estimate the Q-value of reward and cost,
which mitigates the extrapolation errors induces by OOD actions, and penalize
unsafe actions to enabled the agent to proactively avoid high-risk behaviors.
Moreover, we theoretically prove the validity of this pessimistic estimation.
Extensive experiments on DSRL benchmarks demonstrate that FASP algorithm
achieves competitive performance across multiple experimental tasks,
particularly outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of safety.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种双系统自适应决策框架（DSADF），结合强化学习（RL）和视觉语言模型（VLM）的优势，以解决RL在动态环境中泛化能力不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL依赖试错学习，泛化能力有限，而现有结合LLM/VLM的方法缺乏协调，导致决策不合理和效率瓶颈。

Method: 受Kahneman的双系统理论启发，DSADF包含快速直觉决策的RL模块（System 1）和深度分析的VLM模块（System 2）。

Result: 在Crafter和Housekeep游戏环境中，DSADF显著提升了已知和未知任务的决策能力。

Conclusion: DSADF通过双系统协同，实现了高效自适应的决策，为复杂环境中的RL泛化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Although Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents are effective in well-defined
environments, they often struggle to generalize their learned policies to
dynamic settings due to their reliance on trial-and-error interactions. Recent
work has explored applying Large Language Models (LLMs) or Vision Language
Models (VLMs) to boost the generalization of RL agents through policy
optimization guidance or prior knowledge. However, these approaches often lack
seamless coordination between the RL agent and the foundation model, leading to
unreasonable decision-making in unfamiliar environments and efficiency
bottlenecks. Making full use of the inferential capabilities of foundation
models and the rapid response capabilities of RL agents and enhancing the
interaction between the two to form a dual system is still a lingering
scientific question. To address this problem, we draw inspiration from
Kahneman's theory of fast thinking (System 1) and slow thinking (System 2),
demonstrating that balancing intuition and deep reasoning can achieve nimble
decision-making in a complex world. In this study, we propose a Dual-System
Adaptive Decision Framework (DSADF), integrating two complementary modules:
System 1, comprising an RL agent and a memory space for fast and intuitive
decision making, and System 2, driven by a VLM for deep and analytical
reasoning. DSADF facilitates efficient and adaptive decision-making by
combining the strengths of both systems. The empirical study in the video game
environment: Crafter and Housekeep demonstrates the effectiveness of our
proposed method, showing significant improvements in decision abilities for
both unseen and known tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长期时间序列预测（LTSF）在能源消耗和天气预测等领域具有广泛应用，但由于复杂的时间模式和内在多尺度变化，准确预测长期变化具有挑战性。

Method: MDMixer框架通过多尺度预测的动态整合和趋势/季节性分离建模，优化了多粒度信息利用和通道特异性特征处理。

Result: 在八个LTSF基准测试中，MDMixer的平均MAE性能比当前最先进的MLP方法（TimeMixer）提升了4.64%，同时平衡了训练效率和模型可解释性。

Conclusion: MDMixer通过多尺度动态整合和趋势/季节性分离建模，显著提升了长期时间序列预测的性能和效率。

Abstract: Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) offers broad utility in practical
settings like energy consumption and weather prediction. Accurately predicting
long-term changes, however, is demanding due to the intricate temporal patterns
and inherent multi-scale variations within time series. This work confronts key
issues in LTSF, including the suboptimal use of multi-granularity information,
the neglect of channel-specific attributes, and the unique nature of trend and
seasonal components, by introducing a proficient MLP-based forecasting
framework. Our method adeptly disentangles complex temporal dynamics using
clear, concurrent predictions across various scales. These multi-scale
forecasts are then skillfully integrated through a system that dynamically
assigns importance to information from different granularities, sensitive to
individual channel characteristics. To manage the specific features of temporal
patterns, a two-pronged structure is utilized to model trend and seasonal
elements independently. Experimental results on eight LTSF benchmarks
demonstrate that MDMixer improves average MAE performance by 4.64% compared to
the recent state-of-the-art MLP-based method (TimeMixer), while achieving an
effective balance between training efficiency and model interpretability.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于网络流的2-HNC方法，用于解决正样本-未标记样本（PU）学习问题，通过两阶段方法生成负样本排名并优化分类结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在二元分类中，训练数据通常仅包含正样本，其余数据未标记。PU学习需要有效区分未标记样本中的负样本。

Method: 2-HNC方法利用Hochbaum的归一化割（HNC）生成样本的嵌套分区，通过两阶段优化：首先生成负样本排名，第二阶段结合可能负样本重新分类。

Result: 实验表明，2-HNC在合成和真实数据集上表现优异，常超越现有先进算法。

Conclusion: 2-HNC通过两阶段优化和网络流方法，有效解决了PU学习问题，提升了分类性能。

Abstract: In many scenarios of binary classification, only positive instances are
provided in the training data, leaving the rest of the data unlabeled. This
setup, known as positive-unlabeled (PU) learning, is addressed here with a
network flow-based method which utilizes pairwise similarities between samples.
The method we propose here, 2-HNC, leverages Hochbaum's Normalized Cut (HNC)
and the set of solutions it provides by solving a parametric minimum cut
problem. The set of solutions, that are nested partitions of the samples into
two sets, correspond to varying tradeoff values between the two goals: high
intra-similarity inside the sets and low inter-similarity between the two sets.
This nested sequence is utilized here to deliver a ranking of unlabeled samples
by their likelihood of being negative. Building on this insight, our method,
2-HNC, proceeds in two stages. The first stage generates this ranking without
assuming any negative labels, using a problem formulation that is constrained
only on positive labeled samples. The second stage augments the positive set
with likely-negative samples and recomputes the classification. The final label
prediction selects among all generated partitions in both stages, the one that
delivers a positive class proportion, closest to a prior estimate of this
quantity, which is assumed to be given. Extensive experiments across synthetic
and real datasets show that 2-HNC yields strong performance and often surpasses
existing state-of-the-art algorithms.

Conclusion: 该方法为用户行为建模和异常检测提供了更具表达力和判别性的解决方案，推动了深度概率建模技术在网络安全和智能风控领域的应用。

Abstract: To improve the identification of potential anomaly patterns in complex user
behavior, this paper proposes an anomaly detection method based on a deep
mixture density network. The method constructs a Gaussian mixture model
parameterized by a neural network, enabling conditional probability modeling of
user behavior. It effectively captures the multimodal distribution
characteristics commonly present in behavioral data. Unlike traditional
classifiers that rely on fixed thresholds or a single decision boundary, this
approach defines an anomaly scoring function based on probability density using
negative log-likelihood. This significantly enhances the model's ability to
detect rare and unstructured behaviors. Experiments are conducted on the
real-world network user dataset UNSW-NB15. A series of performance comparisons
and stability validation experiments are designed. These cover multiple
evaluation aspects, including Accuracy, F1- score, AUC, and loss fluctuation.
The results show that the proposed method outperforms several advanced neural
network architectures in both performance and training stability. This study
provides a more expressive and discriminative solution for user behavior
modeling and anomaly detection. It strongly promotes the application of deep
probabilistic modeling techniques in the fields of network security and
intelligent risk control.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自适应低秩矩阵近似（LoRMA）方法，通过分块、聚类和局部SVD处理高局部变化的数据，优于全局SVD，尤其在医学影像中表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统全局SVD方法忽略局部变化，导致细节丢失，无法满足高局部变化数据（如医学影像）的需求。

Method: 将数据矩阵分块为重叠补丁，用k-means聚类相似补丁，对每个聚类进行SVD，分析补丁大小对压缩效率和计算成本的影响。

Result: 在MRI、超声、CT和胸片四种模态中，自适应LoRMA在PSNR、SSIM、IoU、EPI等指标上优于全局SVD，且能保留临床关键区域。

Conclusion: 自适应LoRMA在存储效率和诊断保真度上表现优异，尽管计算成本较高，但适用于高压缩需求场景。

Abstract: Low-rank matrix approximation (LoRMA) is a fundamental tool for compressing
high-resolution data matrices by extracting important features while
suppressing redundancy. Low-rank methods, such as global singular value
decomposition (SVD), apply uniform compression across the entire data matrix,
often ignoring important local variations and leading to the loss of fine
structural details. To address these limitations, we introduce an adaptive
LoRMA, which partitions data matrix into overlapping patches, groups
structurally similar patches into several clusters using k-means, and performs
SVD within each cluster. We derive the overall compression factor accounting
for patch overlap and analyze how patch size influences compression efficiency
and computational cost. While the proposed adaptive LoRMA method is applicable
to any data exhibiting high local variation, we focus on medical imaging due to
its pronounced local variability. We evaluate and compare our adaptive LoRMA
against global SVD across four imaging modalities: MRI, ultrasound, CT scan,
and chest X-ray. Results demonstrate that adaptive LoRMA effectively preserves
structural integrity, edge details, and diagnostic relevance, as measured by
peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), mean
squared error (MSE), intersection over union (IoU), and edge preservation index
(EPI). Adaptive LoRMA significantly minimizes block artifacts and residual
errors, particularly in pathological regions, consistently outperforming global
SVD in terms of PSNR, SSIM, IoU, EPI, and achieving lower MSE. Adaptive LoRMA
prioritizes clinically salient regions while allowing aggressive compression in
non-critical regions, optimizing storage efficiency. Although adaptive LoRMA
requires higher processing time, its diagnostic fidelity justifies the overhead
for high-compression applications.

Abstract: We study the classical binary classification problem for hypothesis spaces of
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with ReLU activation under Tsybakov's low-noise
condition with exponent $q>0$, and its limit-case $q\to\infty$ which we refer
to as the "hard-margin condition". We show that DNNs which minimize the
empirical risk with square loss surrogate and $\ell_p$ penalty can achieve
finite-sample excess risk bounds of order $\mathcal{O}\left(n^{-\alpha}\right)$
for arbitrarily large $\alpha>0$ under the hard-margin condition, provided that
the regression function $\eta$ is sufficiently smooth. The proof relies on a
novel decomposition of the excess risk which might be of independent interest.

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) as feature enhancers to optimize node
representations, which are then used as inputs for graph neural networks
(GNNs), has shown significant potential in graph representation learning.
However, the fundamental properties of this approach remain underexplored. To
address this issue, we propose conducting a more in-depth analysis of this
issue based on the interchange intervention method. First, we construct a
synthetic graph dataset with controllable causal relationships, enabling
precise manipulation of semantic relationships and causal modeling to provide
data for analysis. Using this dataset, we conduct interchange interventions to
examine the deeper properties of LLM enhancers and GNNs, uncovering their
underlying logic and internal mechanisms. Building on the analytical results,
we design a plug-and-play optimization module to improve the information
transfer between LLM enhancers and GNNs. Experiments across multiple datasets
and models validate the proposed module.

Abstract: Multimodal learning enhances deep learning models by enabling them to
perceive and understand information from multiple data modalities, such as
visual and textual inputs. However, most existing approaches assume the
availability of all modalities, an assumption that often fails in real-world
applications. Recent works have introduced learnable missing-case-aware prompts
to mitigate performance degradation caused by missing modalities while reducing
the need for extensive model fine-tuning. Building upon the effectiveness of
missing-case-aware handling for missing modalities, we propose a novel
decoupled prototype-based output head, which leverages missing-case-aware
class-wise prototypes tailored for each individual modality. This approach
dynamically adapts to different missing modality scenarios and can be
seamlessly integrated with existing prompt-based methods. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed output head significantly improves performance
across a wide range of missing-modality scenarios and varying missing rates.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a powerful framework for
solving sequential decision-making problems, achieving remarkable success in a
wide range of applications, including game AI, autonomous driving, biomedicine,
and large language models. However, the diversity of algorithms and the
complexity of theoretical foundations often pose significant challenges for
beginners seeking to enter the field. This tutorial aims to provide a concise,
intuitive, and practical introduction to DRL, with a particular focus on the
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, which is one of the most widely
used and effective DRL methods. To facilitate learning, we organize all
algorithms under the Generalized Policy Iteration (GPI) framework, offering
readers a unified and systematic perspective. Instead of lengthy theoretical
proofs, we emphasize intuitive explanations, illustrative examples, and
practical engineering techniques. This work serves as an efficient and
accessible guide, helping readers rapidly progress from basic concepts to the
implementation of advanced DRL algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba模型参数量大，难以在资源受限环境中部署，需高效剪枝方法。

Method: 结合权重幅度和梯度信息的梯度感知剪枝、迭代剪枝计划、全局剪枝策略。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，参数减少70%且性能保留95%以上。

Conclusion: 该剪枝方法高效且实用，拓宽了Mamba模型在资源受限环境中的应用。

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs), particularly the Mamba architecture, have emerged
as powerful alternatives to Transformers for sequence modeling, offering
linear-time complexity and competitive performance across diverse tasks.
However, their large parameter counts pose significant challenges for
deployment in resource-constrained environments. We propose a novel
unstructured pruning framework tailored for Mamba models that achieves up to
70\% parameter reduction while retaining over 95\% of the original performance.
Our approach integrates three key innovations: (1) a gradient-aware magnitude
pruning technique that combines weight magnitude and gradient information to
identify less critical parameters, (2) an iterative pruning schedule that
gradually increases sparsity to maintain model stability, and (3) a global
pruning strategy that optimizes parameter allocation across the entire model.
Through extensive experiments on WikiText-103, Long Range Arena, and ETT
time-series benchmarks, we demonstrate significant efficiency gains with
minimal performance degradation. Our analysis of pruning effects on Mamba's
components reveals critical insights into the architecture's redundancy and
robustness, enabling practical deployment in resource-constrained settings
while broadening Mamba's applicability.

TL;DR: 研究发现多轮随机梯度下降（SGD）在非光滑随机凸优化（SCO）中可能导致显著的过拟合，尤其是在第二轮后性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多轮SGD在SCO模型中的样本外表现，尤其是其过拟合现象。

Method: 分析多轮SGD的步长和轮次对样本外性能的影响，比较光滑与非光滑情况。

Result: 多轮SGD在非光滑情况下性能显著下降，第二轮后损失为Θ(1/(ηT) + η√T)。

Conclusion: 多轮SGD在非光滑SCO中易过拟合，揭示了其性能的相变现象。

Abstract: We study the out-of-sample performance of multi-pass stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) in the fundamental stochastic convex optimization (SCO) model.
While one-pass SGD is known to achieve an optimal $\Theta(1/\sqrt{n})$ excess
population loss given a sample of size $n$, much less is understood about the
multi-pass version of the algorithm which is widely used in practice. Somewhat
surprisingly, we show that in the general non-smooth case of SCO, just a few
epochs of SGD can already hurt its out-of-sample performance significantly and
lead to overfitting. In particular, using a step size $\eta =
\Theta(1/\sqrt{n})$, which gives the optimal rate after one pass, can lead to
population loss as large as $\Omega(1)$ after just one additional pass. More
generally, we show that the population loss from the second pass onward is of
the order $\Theta(1/(\eta T) + \eta \sqrt{T})$, where $T$ is the total number
of steps. These results reveal a certain phase-transition in the out-of-sample
behavior of SGD after the first epoch, as well as a sharp separation between
the rates of overfitting in the smooth and non-smooth cases of SCO.
Additionally, we extend our results to with-replacement SGD, proving that the
same asymptotic bounds hold after $O(n \log n)$ steps. Finally, we also prove a
lower bound of $\Omega(\eta \sqrt{n})$ on the generalization gap of one-pass
SGD in dimension $d = \smash{\widetilde O}(n)$, improving on recent results of
Koren et al.(2022) and Schliserman et al.(2024).

TL;DR: SpecSphere是一种双通道谱空间GNN，首次实现对预测的鲁棒性认证，适应同质-异质谱，并超越1-Weisfeiler-Lehman的表达能力，同时保持线性时间复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有GNN在同质-异质谱上的适应性不足、鲁棒性认证缺乏以及表达能力受限的问题。

Method: 结合Chebyshev多项式谱分支和注意力门控空间分支，通过轻量级MLP融合表示，并在合作-对抗极小极大游戏中训练。

Result: 实现了最先进的节点分类精度，提供更严格的鲁棒性认证，并在理论上有多项突破。

Conclusion: SpecSphere证明了高表达性、异质适应性和可证明鲁棒性可以共存于单一可扩展架构中。

Abstract: We introduce SpecSphere, the first dual-pass spectral-spatial GNN that
certifies every prediction against both $\ell\_{0}$ edge flips and
$\ell\_{\infty}$ feature perturbations, adapts to the full
homophily-heterophily spectrum, and surpasses the expressive power of
1-Weisfeiler-Lehman while retaining linear-time complexity. Our model couples a
Chebyshev-polynomial spectral branch with an attention-gated spatial branch and
fuses their representations through a lightweight MLP trained in a
cooperative-adversarial min-max game. We further establish (i) a uniform
Chebyshev approximation theorem, (ii) minimax-optimal risk across the
homophily-heterophily spectrum, (iii) closed-form robustness certificates, and
(iv) universal approximation strictly beyond 1-WL. SpecSphere achieves
state-of-the-art node-classification accuracy and delivers tighter certified
robustness guarantees on real-world benchmarks. These results demonstrate that
high expressivity, heterophily adaptation, and provable robustness can coexist
within a single, scalable architecture.

Motivation: 现有联邦学习在遥感领域的研究通常依赖手动划分的单数据集，无法反映真实数据的异质性和规模，且实验设置不一致，阻碍公平比较。

Method: 提出FedRS数据集，涵盖多种传感器和分辨率，构建135个客户端，模拟真实场景的标签分布、数据量和域异质性。基于此实现10种基线联邦学习算法和评估指标，构建FedRS-Bench。

Conclusion: FedRS-Bench为大规模、真实的联邦学习研究提供了标准化测试平台，有望加速相关研究并促进公平比较。

Abstract: Remote sensing (RS) images are usually produced at an unprecedented scale,
yet they are geographically and institutionally distributed, making centralized
model training challenging due to data-sharing restrictions and privacy
concerns. Federated learning (FL) offers a solution by enabling collaborative
model training across decentralized RS data sources without exposing raw data.
However, there lacks a realistic federated dataset and benchmark in RS. Prior
works typically rely on manually partitioned single dataset, which fail to
capture the heterogeneity and scale of real-world RS data, and often use
inconsistent experimental setups, hindering fair comparison. To address this
gap, we propose a realistic federated RS dataset, termed FedRS. FedRS consists
of eight datasets that cover various sensors and resolutions and builds 135
clients, which is representative of realistic operational scenarios. Data for
each client come from the same source, exhibiting authentic federated
properties such as skewed label distributions, imbalanced client data volumes,
and domain heterogeneity across clients. These characteristics reflect
practical challenges in federated RS and support evaluation of FL methods at
scale. Based on FedRS, we implement 10 baseline FL algorithms and evaluation
metrics to construct the comprehensive FedRS-Bench. The experimental results
demonstrate that FL can consistently improve model performance over training on
isolated data silos, while revealing performance trade-offs of different
methods under varying client heterogeneity and availability conditions. We hope
FedRS-Bench will accelerate research on large-scale, realistic FL in RS by
providing a standardized, rich testbed and facilitating fair comparisons across
future works. The source codes and dataset are available at
https://fedrs-bench.github.io/.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大预训练模型在持续学习中表现优异，但高计算成本限制了其实际应用。

Method: 提出了基于剪枝和知识蒸馏的两种高效框架，分别适用于类增量学习任务。

Result: 实验表明，两种框架在准确性和推理复杂度之间取得了更好的平衡，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 论文分析了两种框架的优缺点，为不同场景下的应用提供了指导。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to train models that can learn a sequence of
tasks without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. A core challenge in CL
is balancing stability -- preserving performance on old tasks -- and plasticity
-- adapting to new ones. Recently, large pre-trained models have been widely
adopted in CL for their ability to support both, offering strong generalization
for new tasks and resilience against forgetting. However, their high
computational cost at inference time limits their practicality in real-world
applications, especially those requiring low latency or energy efficiency. To
address this issue, we explore model compression techniques, including pruning
and knowledge distillation (KD), and propose two efficient frameworks tailored
for class-incremental learning (CIL), a challenging CL setting where task
identities are unavailable during inference. The pruning-based framework
includes pre- and post-pruning strategies that apply compression at different
training stages. The KD-based framework adopts a teacher-student architecture,
where a large pre-trained teacher transfers downstream-relevant knowledge to a
compact student. Extensive experiments on multiple CIL benchmarks demonstrate
that the proposed frameworks achieve a better trade-off between accuracy and
inference complexity, consistently outperforming strong baselines. We further
analyze the trade-offs between the two frameworks in terms of accuracy and
efficiency, offering insights into their use across different scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态图中异常边检测在许多应用中很重要，但现有方法忽略了结构与时序信息的深层交互。

Result: 在六个数据集上表现优于现有方法，并通过案例验证了实际应用效果。

Conclusion: 该方法通过耦合结构与时序信息，显著提升了异常检测性能。

Abstract: Detecting anomalous edges in dynamic graphs is an important task in many
applications over evolving triple-based data, such as social networks,
transaction management, and epidemiology. A major challenge with this task is
the absence of structural-temporal coupling information, which decreases the
ability of the representation to distinguish anomalies from normal instances.
Existing methods focus on handling independent structural and temporal features
with embedding models, which ignore the deep interaction between these two
types of information. In this paper, we propose a structural-temporal coupling
anomaly detection architecture with a dynamic graph transformer model.
Specifically, we introduce structural and temporal features from two
integration levels to provide anomaly-aware graph evolutionary patterns. Then,
a dynamic graph transformer enhanced by two-dimensional positional encoding is
implemented to capture both discrimination and contextual consistency signals.
Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
current state-of-the-art models. Finally, a case study illustrates the strength
of our method when applied to a real-world task.

Method: 研究方法结合了强化学习与城市气候模型，通过建筑能耗模型评估RL策略在不同城市气候背景下的效果、对室内和城市气候的影响，以及策略的可转移性。

Result: 研究结果表明，RL策略的效果和可转移性因城市气候背景而异，炎热气候城市在大多数能耗与热舒适性平衡的配置中表现更优，且气候波动大的城市策略可转移性更强。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在不同气候背景下全面评估RL-based HVAC控制策略的重要性，并提出了城市间学习可能有助于RL策略部署的新见解。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based heating, ventilation, and air conditioning
(HVAC) control has emerged as a promising technology for reducing building
energy consumption while maintaining indoor thermal comfort. However, the
efficacy of such strategies is influenced by the background climate and their
implementation may potentially alter both the indoor climate and local urban
climate. This study proposes an integrated framework combining RL with an urban
climate model that incorporates a building energy model, aiming to evaluate the
efficacy of RL-based HVAC control across different background climates, impacts
of RL strategies on indoor climate and local urban climate, and the
transferability of RL strategies across cities. Our findings reveal that the
reward (defined as a weighted combination of energy consumption and thermal
comfort) and the impacts of RL strategies on indoor climate and local urban
climate exhibit marked variability across cities with different background
climates. The sensitivity of reward weights and the transferability of RL
strategies are also strongly influenced by the background climate. Cities in
hot climates tend to achieve higher rewards across most reward weight
configurations that balance energy consumption and thermal comfort, and those
cities with more varying atmospheric temperatures demonstrate greater RL
strategy transferability. These findings underscore the importance of
thoroughly evaluating RL-based HVAC control strategies in diverse climatic
contexts. This study also provides a new insight that city-to-city learning
will potentially aid the deployment of RL-based HVAC control.

Result: 发现数据工程技术可以显著改变特征重要性，甚至被恶意利用以掩盖模型中的歧视问题。

Conclusion: 数据工程技术对解释器的敏感性可能被滥用，需警惕其对解释可靠性的潜在影响。

Abstract: Local feature-based explanations are a key component of the XAI toolkit.
These explanations compute feature importance values relative to an
``interpretable'' feature representation. In tabular data, feature values
themselves are often considered interpretable. This paper examines the impact
of data engineering choices on local feature-based explanations. We demonstrate
that simple, common data engineering techniques, such as representing age with
a histogram or encoding race in a specific way, can manipulate feature
importance as determined by popular methods like SHAP. Notably, the sensitivity
of explanations to feature representation can be exploited by adversaries to
obscure issues like discrimination. While the intuition behind these results is
straightforward, their systematic exploration has been lacking. Previous work
has focused on adversarial attacks on feature-based explainers by biasing data
or manipulating models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
demonstrating that explainers can be misled by standard, seemingly innocuous
data engineering techniques.

Result: 即使数据集较小，该方法在冲击位置估计上表现出显著的高精度。

Conclusion: 基于GRU的端到端方法在冲击定位中具有潜力，且物理实验数据训练可减少现实差距。

Abstract: Today, machine learning is ubiquitous, and structural health monitoring (SHM)
is no exception. Specifically, we address the problem of impact localization on
shell-like structures, where knowledge of impact locations aids in assessing
structural integrity. Impacts on thin-walled structures excite Lamb waves,
which can be measured with piezoelectric sensors. Their dispersive
characteristics make it difficult to detect and localize impacts by
conventional methods. In the present contribution, we explore the localization
of impacts using neural networks. In particular, we propose to use {recurrent
neural networks} (RNNs) to estimate impact positions end-to-end, i.e., directly
from {sequential sensor data}. We deal with comparatively long sequences of
thousands of samples, since high sampling rate are needed to accurately capture
elastic waves. For this reason, the proposed approach builds upon Gated
Recurrent Units (GRUs), which are less prone to vanishing gradients as compared
to conventional RNNs. Quality and quantity of data are crucial when training
neural networks. Often, synthetic data is used, which inevitably introduces a
reality gap. Here, by contrast, we train our networks using {physical data from
experiments}, which requires automation to handle the large number of
experiments needed. For this purpose, a {robot is used to drop steel balls}
onto an {aluminum plate} equipped with {piezoceramic sensors}. Our results show
remarkable accuracy in estimating impact positions, even with a comparatively
small dataset.

Result: 实验证明该方法在合成和真实数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法无需强分布假设，避免了信息内容差异带来的偏差，为不同类型变量的因果方向比较提供了理论基础。

Abstract: This paper proposes a causal discovery method for mixed bivariate data
consisting of one continuous and one discrete variable. Existing
constraint-based approaches are ineffective in the bivariate setting, as they
rely on conditional independence tests that are not suited to bivariate data.
Score-based methods either impose strong distributional assumptions or face
challenges in fairly comparing causal directions between variables of different
types, due to differences in their information content. We introduce a novel
approach that determines causal direction by analyzing the monotonicity of the
conditional density ratio of the continuous variable, conditioned on different
values of the discrete variable. Our theoretical analysis shows that the
conditional density ratio exhibits monotonicity when the continuous variable
causes the discrete variable, but not in the reverse direction. This property
provides a principled basis for comparing causal directions between variables
of different types, free from strong distributional assumptions and bias
arising from differences in their information content. We demonstrate its
effectiveness through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets,
showing superior accuracy compared to existing methods.

for simulation-based inference, particularly suitable for parameter inference
workflows requiring fast inference methods.

Conclusion: 研究帮助实践者在计算成本与准确性间权衡，展示了RAG在临床决策支持等应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models achieve high task performance yet often hallucinate or
rely on outdated knowledge. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses
these gaps by coupling generation with external search. We analyse how
hyperparameters influence speed and quality in RAG systems, covering Chroma and
Faiss vector stores, chunking policies, cross-encoder re-ranking, and
temperature, and we evaluate six metrics: faithfulness, answer correctness,
answer relevancy, context precision, context recall, and answer similarity.
Chroma processes queries 13% faster, whereas Faiss yields higher retrieval
precision, revealing a clear speed-accuracy trade-off. Naive fixed-length
chunking with small windows and minimal overlap outperforms semantic
segmentation while remaining the quickest option. Re-ranking provides modest
gains in retrieval quality yet increases runtime by roughly a factor of 5, so
its usefulness depends on latency constraints. These results help practitioners
balance computational cost and accuracy when tuning RAG systems for
transparent, up-to-date responses. Finally, we re-evaluate the top
configurations with a corrective RAG workflow and show that their advantages
persist when the model can iteratively request additional evidence. We obtain a
near-perfect context precision (99%), which demonstrates that RAG systems can
achieve extremely high retrieval accuracy with the right combination of
hyperparameters, with significant implications for applications where retrieval
quality directly impacts downstream task performance, such as clinical decision
support in healthcare.

Abstract: Physical models classically involved Partial Differential equations (PDE) and
depending of their underlying complexity and the level of accuracy required,
and known to be computationally expensive to numerically solve them. Thus, an
idea would be to create a surrogate model relying on data generated by such
solver. However, training such a model on an imbalanced data have been shown to
be a very difficult task. Indeed, if the distribution of input leads to a poor
response manifold representation, the model may not learn well and
consequently, it may not predict the outcome with acceptable accuracy. In this
work, we present an Adaptive Sampling Algorithm for Data Generation (ASADG)
involving a physical model. As the initial input data may not accurately
represent the response manifold in higher dimension, this algorithm iteratively
adds input data into it. At each step the barycenter of each simplicial
complex, that the manifold is discretized into, is added as new input data, if
a certain threshold is satisfied. We demonstrate the efficiency of the data
sampling algorithm in comparison with LHS method for generating more
representative input data. To do so, we focus on the construction of a harmonic
transport problem metamodel by generating data through a classical solver. By
using such algorithm, it is possible to generate the same number of input data
as LHS while providing a better representation of the response manifold.

Abstract: Data mining offers a diverse toolbox for extracting meaningful structures
from complex datasets, with anomaly detection emerging as a critical subfield
particularly in the context of streaming or real-time data. Within anomaly
detection, novelty detection focuses on identifying previously unseen patterns
after training solely on regular data. While classic algorithms such as
One-Class SVM or Local Outlier Factor (LOF) have been widely applied, they
often lack interpretability and scalability. In this work, we explore the
Half-Space Tree (HST) algorithm, originally proposed for streaming anomaly
detection, and propose a novel theoretical modification to adapt it
specifically for novelty detection tasks. Our approach is grounded in the idea
that anomalies i.e., novelties tend to appear in the higher leaves of the tree,
which are less frequently visited by regular instances. We analytically
demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using probabilistic analysis,
expected depth (EXD) calculations, and combinatorial reasoning. A comparative
analysis of expected depths between our modified HST and the original Isolation
Forest highlights that novelty points are significantly more isolated in our
approach. This supports the hypothesis that HSTs, with appropriate structural
adaptation, can serve as interpretable and efficient novelty detectors. The

### [397] [A new methodology to decompose a parametric domain using reduced order data manifold in machine learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08497)
*Chetra Mang,Axel TahmasebiMoradi,Mouadh Yagoubi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于迭代主成分分析的参数化域分解新方法，通过降维和逆投影重构实现高效分解，并在谐波传输问题上验证了其优于传统元模型的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统元模型（如神经网络）在处理高维参数化域分解时效率不足，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 采用迭代主成分分析降维，开发两种逆投影重构方法，并基于低维流形分解参数化域。

Result: 在谐波传输问题的数值实验中，新方法比传统元模型更高效有效。

Conclusion: 该方法为参数化域分解提供了一种高效且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a new methodology for parametric domain decomposition using
iterative principal component analysis. Starting with iterative principle
component analysis, the high dimension manifold is reduced to the lower
dimension manifold. Moreover, two approaches are developed to reconstruct the
inverse projector to project from the lower data component to the original one.
Afterward, we provide a detailed strategy to decompose the parametric domain
based on the low dimension manifold. Finally, numerical examples of harmonic
transport problem are given to illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of
the proposed method comparing to the classical meta-models such as neural
networks.

<details>

Result: 实验表明，InfoPO在多个公开基准测试中表现优于现有方法，尤其在推理任务中。

Conclusion: InfoPO是一种高效且有效的偏好微调算法，显著提升了LLMs在推理任务中的性能。

Abstract: We study the post-training of large language models (LLMs) with human
preference data. Recently, direct preference optimization and its variants have
shown considerable promise in aligning language models, eliminating the need
for reward models and online sampling. Despite these benefits, these methods
rely on explicit assumptions about the Bradley-Terry (BT) model, which makes
them prone to overfitting and results in suboptimal performance, particularly
on reasoning-heavy tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a principled
preference fine-tuning algorithm called InfoPO, which effectively and
efficiently aligns large language models using preference data. InfoPO
eliminates the reliance on the BT model and prevents the likelihood of the
chosen response from decreasing. Extensive experiments confirm that InfoPO
consistently outperforms established baselines on widely used open benchmarks,
particularly in reasoning tasks.

*Hyowon Wi,Jeongwhan Choi,Noseong Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为AGF的新方法，将自注意力解释为图信号处理中的图滤波器，以线性复杂度实现，并在多个任务中达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自注意力机制仅使用一阶多项式矩阵定义的图滤波器，限制了频率信息的有效利用，设计较为简化。

Result: AGF在Long Range Arena基准测试和时间序列分类等任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: AGF通过图信号处理视角改进自注意力机制，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse domains.
The key component of Transformers is self-attention, which learns the
relationship between any two tokens in the input sequence. Recent studies have
revealed that the self-attention can be understood as a normalized adjacency
matrix of a graph. Notably, from the perspective of graph signal processing
(GSP), the self-attention can be equivalently defined as a simple graph filter,
applying GSP using the value vector as the signal. However, the self-attention
is a graph filter defined with only the first order of the polynomial matrix,
and acts as a low-pass filter preventing the effective leverage of various
frequency information. Consequently, existing self-attention mechanisms are
designed in a rather simplified manner. Therefore, we propose a novel method,
called \underline{\textbf{A}}ttentive \underline{\textbf{G}}raph
\underline{\textbf{F}}ilter (AGF), interpreting the self-attention as learning
the graph filter in the singular value domain from the perspective of graph
signal processing for directed graphs with the linear complexity w.r.t. the
input length $n$, i.e., $\mathcal{O}(nd^2)$. In our experiments, we demonstrate
that AGF achieves state-of-the-art performance on various tasks, including Long
Range Arena benchmark and time series classification.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出GradMix，一种梯度选择性混合的数据增强方法，用于缓解类增量学习中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习中，新知识获取与旧知识保持的平衡是一个挑战。现有方法通常使用经验回放技术，但随机混合样本可能损害旧任务知识并加剧灾难性遗忘。

Method: 提出GradMix方法，基于梯度选择性混合样本，仅混合有益类别的样本对，避免有害类别对的混合。

Result: 实验表明，GradMix在多个真实数据集上优于基线方法，显著减少了旧知识的遗忘。

Conclusion: GradMix通过选择性混合样本，有效缓解了灾难性遗忘，提升了模型在持续学习中的性能。

Abstract: In the context of continual learning, acquiring new knowledge while
maintaining previous knowledge presents a significant challenge. Existing
methods often use experience replay techniques that store a small portion of
previous task data for training. In experience replay approaches, data
augmentation has emerged as a promising strategy to further improve the model
performance by mixing limited previous task data with sufficient current task
data. However, we theoretically and empirically analyze that training with
mixed samples from random sample pairs may harm the knowledge of previous tasks
and cause greater catastrophic forgetting. We then propose GradMix, a robust
data augmentation method specifically designed for mitigating catastrophic
forgetting in class-incremental learning. GradMix performs gradient-based
selective mixup using a class-based criterion that mixes only samples from
helpful class pairs and not from detrimental class pairs for reducing
catastrophic forgetting. Our experiments on various real datasets show that
GradMix outperforms data augmentation baselines in accuracy by minimizing the
forgetting of previous knowledge.

Motivation: 极端事件对人类和生态系统构成重大风险，而基础模型在灾害管理中表现优异但存在数据偏差问题。

Method: 引入ExEBench数据集，涵盖七类极端事件，支持多种机器学习任务。

Result: 数据集具有全球覆盖、多样数据源和任务，旨在评估模型泛化能力和推动灾害管理方法。

Conclusion: ExEBench为极端事件研究和灾害管理提供了重要工具，并公开数据集和代码以促进发展。

Abstract: Our planet is facing increasingly frequent extreme events, which pose major
risks to human lives and ecosystems. Recent advances in machine learning (ML),
especially with foundation models (FMs) trained on extensive datasets, excel in
extracting features and show promise in disaster management. Nevertheless,
these models often inherit biases from training data, challenging their
performance over extreme values. To explore the reliability of FM in the
context of extreme events, we introduce \textbf{ExE}Bench (\textbf{Ex}treme
\textbf{E}arth Benchmark), a collection of seven extreme event categories
across floods, wildfires, storms, tropical cyclones, extreme precipitation,
heatwaves, and cold waves. The dataset features global coverage, varying data
volumes, and diverse data sources with different spatial, temporal, and
spectral characteristics. To broaden the real-world impact of FMs, we include
multiple challenging ML tasks that are closely aligned with operational needs
in extreme events detection, monitoring, and forecasting. ExEBench aims to (1)
assess FM generalizability across diverse, high-impact tasks and domains, (2)
promote the development of novel ML methods that benefit disaster management,
and (3) offer a platform for analyzing the interactions and cascading effects
of extreme events to advance our understanding of Earth system, especially
under the climate change expected in the decades to come. The dataset and code
are public https://github.com/zhaoshan2/EarthExtreme-Bench.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OLinear是一种基于线性变换的多变量时间序列预测模型，通过正交变换域操作提升性能。其核心是OrthoTrans和NormLin模块，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列预测模型在时域直接编码和解码，但步长依赖性可能影响性能。OLinear通过正交变换域操作解决这一问题。

Method: 使用OrthoTrans（基于正交矩阵的数据自适应变换）和NormLin（归一化权重矩阵的线性层）进行编码和解码。

Result: 在24个基准和140个预测任务中，OLinear表现优异，NormLin模块显著提升Transformer性能。

Conclusion: OLinear通过正交变换和定制线性层实现了高效且高性能的时间序列预测，可作为插件增强现有模型。

Abstract: This paper presents $\mathbf{OLinear}$, a $\mathbf{linear}$-based
multivariate time series forecasting model that operates in an
$\mathbf{o}$rthogonally transformed domain. Recent forecasting models typically
adopt the temporal forecast (TF) paradigm, which directly encode and decode
time series in the time domain. However, the entangled step-wise dependencies
in series data can hinder the performance of TF. To address this, some
forecasters conduct encoding and decoding in the transformed domain using
fixed, dataset-independent bases (e.g., sine and cosine signals in the Fourier
transform). In contrast, we utilize $\mathbf{OrthoTrans}$, a data-adaptive
transformation based on an orthogonal matrix that diagonalizes the series'
temporal Pearson correlation matrix. This approach enables more effective
encoding and decoding in the decorrelated feature domain and can serve as a
plug-in module to enhance existing forecasters. To enhance the representation
learning for multivariate time series, we introduce a customized linear layer,
$\mathbf{NormLin}$, which employs a normalized weight matrix to capture
multivariate dependencies. Empirically, the NormLin module shows a surprising
performance advantage over multi-head self-attention, while requiring nearly
half the FLOPs. Extensive experiments on 24 benchmarks and 140 forecasting
tasks demonstrate that OLinear consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance with high efficiency. Notably, as a plug-in replacement for
self-attention, the NormLin module consistently enhances Transformer-based
forecasters. The code and datasets are available at

### [403] [Online Learning and Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08557)
*Yaxi Hu,Bernhard Schölkopf,Amartya Sanyal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了两种在线学习-遗忘算法（OLU），基于在线梯度下降（OGD），分别是被动OLU和主动OLU，能够在保证遗忘请求的同时保持与标准OGD相当的遗憾界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线学习场景中，模型需要动态更新，同时满足数据遗忘请求，确保遗忘后的输出与从未学习该数据的模型统计不可区分。

Method: 被动OLU利用OGD的收缩性，在遗忘时注入噪声；主动OLU采用离线遗忘算法，将模型推向排除删除数据的解。

Result: 在标准凸性和平滑性假设下，两种方法均实现了与标准OGD相当的遗憾界。

Conclusion: 研究表明，在提供遗忘保证的同时，仍能保持竞争性的遗憾界。

Abstract: We formalize the problem of online learning-unlearning, where a model is
updated sequentially in an online setting while accommodating unlearning
requests between updates. After a data point is unlearned, all subsequent
outputs must be statistically indistinguishable from those of a model trained
without that point. We present two online learner-unlearner (OLU) algorithms,
both built upon online gradient descent (OGD). The first, passive OLU,
leverages OGD's contractive property and injects noise when unlearning occurs,
incurring no additional computation. The second, active OLU, uses an offline
unlearning algorithm that shifts the model toward a solution excluding the
deleted data. Under standard convexity and smoothness assumptions, both methods
achieve regret bounds comparable to those of standard OGD, demonstrating that
one can maintain competitive regret bounds while providing unlearning
guarantees.

Result: 发现现有方法在不同场景下效果不一致，评估需多指标结合，且去毒化效果因攻击类型而异。

Conclusion: 强调需在多场景和多指标下评估遗忘方法，未来研究应关注更复杂的任务和综合评估标准。

Abstract: Recent legal frameworks have mandated the right to be forgotten, obligating
the removal of specific data upon user requests. Machine Unlearning has emerged
as a promising solution by selectively removing learned information from
machine learning models. This paper presents MUBox, a comprehensive platform
designed to evaluate unlearning methods in deep learning. MUBox integrates 23
advanced unlearning techniques, tested across six practical scenarios with 11
diverse evaluation metrics. It allows researchers and practitioners to (1)
assess and compare the effectiveness of different machine unlearning methods
across various scenarios; (2) examine the impact of current evaluation metrics
on unlearning performance; and (3) conduct detailed comparative studies on
machine unlearning in a unified framework. Leveraging MUBox, we systematically
evaluate these unlearning methods in deep learning and uncover several key
insights: (a) Even state-of-the-art unlearning methods, including those
published in top-tier venues and winners of unlearning competitions,
demonstrate inconsistent effectiveness across diverse scenarios. Prior research
has predominantly focused on simplified settings, such as random forgetting and
class-wise unlearning, highlighting the need for broader evaluations across
more difficult unlearning tasks. (b) Assessing unlearning performance remains a
non-trivial problem, as no single evaluation metric can comprehensively capture
the effectiveness, efficiency, and preservation of model utility. Our findings
emphasize the necessity of employing multiple metrics to achieve a balanced and
holistic assessment of unlearning methods. (c) In the context of depoisoning,
our evaluation reveals significant variability in the effectiveness of existing
approaches, which is highly dependent on the specific type of poisoning
attacks.

Conclusion: 该方法在数据不完整和重尾分布情况下表现出色，适用于金融数据聚类。

Abstract: There are various approaches to graph learning for data clustering,
incorporating different spectral and structural constraints through diverse
graph structures. Some methods rely on bipartite graph models, where nodes are
divided into two classes: centers and members. These models typically require
access to data for the center nodes in addition to observations from the member
nodes. However, such additional data may not always be available in many
practical scenarios. Moreover, popular Gaussian models for graph learning have
demonstrated limited effectiveness in modeling data with heavy-tailed
distributions, which are common in financial markets. In this paper, we propose
a clustering method based on a bipartite graph model that addresses these
challenges. First, it can infer clusters from incomplete data without requiring
information about the center nodes. Second, it is designed to effectively
handle heavy-tailed data. Numerical experiments using real financial data
validate the efficiency of the proposed method for data clustering.

Abstract: We present an iterative inverse reinforcement learning algorithm to infer
optimal cost functions in continuous spaces. Based on a popular maximum entropy
criteria, our approach iteratively finds a weight improvement step and proposes
a method to find an appropriate step size that ensures learned cost function
features remain similar to the demonstrated trajectory features. In contrast to
similar approaches, our algorithm can individually tune the effectiveness of
each observation for the partition function and does not need a large sample
set, enabling faster learning. We generate sample trajectories by solving an
optimal control problem instead of random sampling, leading to more informative
trajectories. The performance of our method is compared to two state of the art
algorithms to demonstrate its benefits in several simulated environments.

Result: 在多种稀疏奖励场景中，ISA显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: ISA有效解决了稀疏奖励下的信用分配和探索问题，性能优越。

Abstract: Training cooperative agents in sparse-reward scenarios poses significant
challenges for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Without clear
feedback on actions at each step in sparse-reward setting, previous methods
struggle with precise credit assignment among agents and effective exploration.
In this paper, we introduce a novel method to deal with both credit assignment
and exploration problems in reward-sparse domains. Accordingly, we propose an
algorithm that calculates the Influence Scope of Agents (ISA) on states by
taking specific value of the dimensions/attributes of states that can be
influenced by individual agents. The mutual dependence between agents' actions
and state attributes are then used to calculate the credit assignment and to
delimit the exploration space for each individual agent. We then evaluate ISA
in a variety of sparse-reward multi-agent scenarios. The results show that our
method significantly outperforms the state-of-art baselines.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables distributed machine learning training while
preserving privacy, representing a paradigm shift for data-sensitive and
decentralized environments. Despite its rapid advancements, FL remains a
complex and multifaceted field, requiring a structured understanding of its
methodologies, challenges, and applications. In this survey, we introduce a
meta-framework perspective, conceptualising FL as a composition of modular
components that systematically address core aspects such as communication,
optimisation, security, and privacy. We provide a historical contextualisation
of FL, tracing its evolution from distributed optimisation to modern
distributed learning paradigms. Additionally, we propose a novel taxonomy
distinguishing Aggregation from Alignment, introducing the concept of alignment
as a fundamental operator alongside aggregation. To bridge theory with
practice, we explore available FL frameworks in Python, facilitating real-world
implementation. Finally, we systematise key challenges across FL sub-fields,
providing insights into open research questions throughout the meta-framework
modules. By structuring FL within a meta-framework of modular components and
emphasising the dual role of Aggregation and Alignment, this survey provides a
holistic and adaptable foundation for understanding and advancing FL research
and deployment.

Method: 通过集成小波激活的MLP和内部注意力机制，以及外部残差梯度注意力（RGA）机制，设计出AC-PKAN。

Result: AC-PKAN在九个基准任务中表现优于或匹配现有最佳模型（如PINNsFormer）。

Conclusion: AC-PKAN是一种高效的工具，适用于零数据或数据稀疏场景下的复杂工程问题。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently shown promise for solving
partial differential equations (PDEs). Yet their original formulation is
computationally and memory intensive, motivating the introduction of Chebyshev
Type-I-based KANs (Chebyshev1KANs). Although Chebyshev1KANs have outperformed
the vanilla KANs architecture, our rigorous theoretical analysis reveals that
they still suffer from rank collapse, ultimately limiting their expressive
capacity. To overcome these limitations, we enhance Chebyshev1KANs by
integrating wavelet-activated MLPs with learnable parameters and an internal
attention mechanism. We prove that this design preserves a full-rank Jacobian
and is capable of approximating solutions to PDEs of arbitrary order.
Furthermore, to alleviate the loss instability and imbalance introduced by the
Chebyshev polynomial basis, we externally incorporate a Residual Gradient
Attention (RGA) mechanism that dynamically re-weights individual loss terms
according to their gradient norms and residual magnitudes. By jointly
leveraging internal and external attention, we present AC-PKAN, a novel
architecture that constitutes an enhancement to weakly supervised
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and extends the expressive power of
KANs. Experimental results from nine benchmark tasks across three domains show
that AC-PKAN consistently outperforms or matches state-of-the-art models such
as PINNsFormer, establishing it as a highly effective tool for solving complex
real-world engineering problems in zero-data or data-sparse regimes. The code
will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种隐私感知的无线协作专家混合框架（PWC-MoE），通过动态路由敏感和非敏感令牌，平衡计算成本、性能和隐私保护，适用于带宽受限环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云服务器上的大型语言模型（LLMs）虽然减轻了本地设备的计算和存储负担，但存在隐私和带宽问题；而本地运行的小型语言模型（SLMs）隐私性更好，但性能有限。因此，需要一种兼顾隐私、性能和带宽的方案。

Method: PWC-MoE框架通过稀疏隐私感知门控网络动态路由令牌，敏感令牌由本地隐私专家处理，非敏感令牌由远程基站处理。采用负载均衡机制和带宽自适应令牌卸载方案，优化资源分配。

Result: 实验表明，PWC-MoE在带宽受限环境下能有效保护隐私并保持高性能。

Conclusion: PWC-MoE为隐私敏感和带宽受限场景下的LLM部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hosted on cloud servers alleviate the
computational and storage burdens on local devices but raise privacy concerns
due to sensitive data transmission and require substantial communication
bandwidth, which is challenging in constrained environments. In contrast, small
language models (SLMs) running locally enhance privacy but suffer from limited
performance on complex tasks. To balance computational cost, performance, and
privacy protection under bandwidth constraints, we propose a privacy-aware
wireless collaborative mixture of experts (PWC-MoE) framework. Specifically,
PWC-MoE employs a sparse privacy-aware gating network to dynamically route
sensitive tokens to privacy experts located on local clients, while
non-sensitive tokens are routed to non-privacy experts located at the remote
base station. To achieve computational efficiency, the gating network ensures
that each token is dynamically routed to and processed by only one expert. To
enhance scalability and prevent overloading of specific experts, we introduce a
group-wise load-balancing mechanism for the gating network that evenly
distributes sensitive tokens among privacy experts and non-sensitive tokens
among non-privacy experts. To adapt to bandwidth constraints while preserving
model performance, we propose a bandwidth-adaptive and importance-aware token
offloading scheme. This scheme incorporates an importance predictor to evaluate
the importance scores of non-sensitive tokens, prioritizing the most important
tokens for transmission to the base station based on their predicted importance
and the available bandwidth. Experiments demonstrate that the PWC-MoE framework
effectively preserves privacy and maintains high performance even in
bandwidth-constrained environments, offering a practical solution for deploying
LLMs in privacy-sensitive and bandwidth-limited scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于信息瓶颈理论的语言建模方法（IBLM），并通过实验验证了表征压缩对泛化能力的提升。进一步提出了GAPT算法，动态切换记忆与压缩阶段，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索数据规模和表征压缩对泛化能力的共同影响，并模拟生物学习中的记忆与压缩交替过程。

Method: 引入IBLM目标，将语言建模重构为约束优化问题；提出GAPT算法，动态调整训练阶段。

Result: GAPT在GPT-2预训练中降低MBE 50%，提升交叉熵4.8%，并在OOD任务中提升泛化能力35%。

Conclusion: 表征压缩与动态阶段切换（GAPT）能显著提升模型泛化能力，模拟生物学习机制。

Abstract: We prove theoretically that generalization improves not only through data
scaling but also by compressing internal representations. To operationalize
this insight, we introduce the Information Bottleneck Language Modeling (IBLM)
objective, which reframes language modeling as a constrained optimization
problem: minimizing representation entropy subject to optimal prediction
performance. Empirically, we observe an emergent memorization-compression cycle
during LLM pretraining, evidenced by oscillation positive/negative gradient
alignment between cross-entropy and Matrix-Based Entropy (MBE), a measure of
representation entropy. This pattern closely mirrors the predictive-compressive
trade-off prescribed by IBLM and also parallels the biological alternation
between awake learning and sleep consolidation. Motivated by this observation,
we propose Gated Phase Transition (GAPT), a training algorithm that adaptively
switches between memorization and compression phases. When applied to GPT-2
pretraining on FineWeb dataset, GAPT reduces MBE by 50% and improves
cross-entropy by 4.8%. GAPT improves OOD generalizatino by 35% in a pretraining
task on arithmetic multiplication. In a setting designed to simulate
catastrophic forgetting, GAPT reduces interference by compressing and
separating representations, achieving a 97% improvement in separation -
paralleling the functional role of sleep consolidation.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful tool for neural
combinatorial optimization, enabling models to learn heuristics that solve
complex problems without requiring expert knowledge. Despite significant
progress, existing RL approaches face challenges such as diminishing reward
signals and inefficient exploration in vast combinatorial action spaces,
leading to inefficiency. In this paper, we propose Preference Optimization, a
novel method that transforms quantitative reward signals into qualitative
preference signals via statistical comparison modeling, emphasizing the
superiority among sampled solutions. Methodologically, by reparameterizing the
reward function in terms of policy and utilizing preference models, we
formulate an entropy-regularized RL objective that aligns the policy directly
with preferences while avoiding intractable computations. Furthermore, we
integrate local search techniques into the fine-tuning rather than
post-processing to generate high-quality preference pairs, helping the policy
escape local optima. Empirical results on various benchmarks, such as the
Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem
(CVRP) and the Flexible Flow Shop Problem (FFSP), demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms existing RL algorithms, achieving superior
convergence efficiency and solution quality.

Abstract: We present a (proto) Foundation Model for Nuclear Physics, capable of
operating on low-level detector inputs from Imaging Cherenkov Detectors at the
future Electron Ion Collider. To address limitations in existing next-token
prediction approaches-namely resolution loss from VQ-VAE tokenization and lack
of conditional generation-we propose three key innovations: (i) separate
vocabularies for discrete spatial features and continuous variates, combined
via Causal Multi-Head Cross-Attention (CMHCA), (ii) continuous kinematic
conditioning through prepended context embeddings, and (iii) scalable and
simple, high-resolution continuous variate tokenization without joint
vocabulary inflation. Our model enables fast, high-fidelity generation of pixel
and time sequences for Cherenkov photons, validated through closure tests in
the High Performance DIRC. We also show our model generalizes to reconstruction
tasks such as pion and kaon identification, in which we show its ability to
leverage fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统FNO在解决逆问题和敏感度估计时表现不佳，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 引入敏感度约束的正则化策略（SC-FNO），优化FNO的性能。

Result: SC-FNO在预测解路径、参数反演任务中表现优异，且能扩展到高维参数空间。

Conclusion: SC-FNO在多种微分方程和神经算子中均表现出色，训练时间和数据需求较低。

Abstract: Parametric differential equations of the form du/dt = f(u, x, t, p) are
fundamental in science and engineering. While deep learning frameworks such as
the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) can efficiently approximate solutions, they
struggle with inverse problems, sensitivity estimation (du/dp), and concept
drift. We address these limitations by introducing a sensitivity-based
regularization strategy, called Sensitivity-Constrained Fourier Neural
Operators (SC-FNO). SC-FNO achieves high accuracy in predicting solution paths
and consistently outperforms standard FNO and FNO with physics-informed
regularization. It improves performance in parameter inversion tasks, scales to
high-dimensional parameter spaces (tested with up to 82 parameters), and
reduces both data and training requirements. These gains are achieved with a
modest increase in training time (30% to 130% per epoch) and generalize across
various types of differential equations and neural operators. Code and selected
experiments are available at: https://github.com/AMBehroozi/SC_Neural_Operators

significantly contribute to the model's predictions, providing enhanced
interpretability beyond traditional feature-attribution methods. Based on it,

further improve the conciseness and interpretability of our explanations. We

Conclusion: SPAT通过保留最有效的注意力机制，显著提升模型效率和性能。

Abstract: Attention-based architectures have achieved superior performance in
multivariate time series forecasting but are computationally expensive.
Techniques such as patching and adaptive masking have been developed to reduce
their sizes and latencies. In this work, we propose a structured pruning
method, SPAT ($\textbf{S}$ensitivity $\textbf{P}$runer for
$\textbf{At}$tention), which selectively removes redundant attention mechanisms
and yields highly effective models. Different from previous approaches, SPAT
aims to remove the entire attention module, which reduces the risk of
overfitting and enables speed-up without demanding specialized hardware. We
propose a dynamic sensitivity metric, $\textbf{S}$ensitivity
$\textbf{E}$nhanced $\textbf{N}$ormalized $\textbf{D}$ispersion (SEND) that
measures the importance of each attention module during the pre-training phase.
Experiments on multivariate datasets demonstrate that SPAT-pruned models
achieve reductions of 2.842% in MSE, 1.996% in MAE, and 35.274% in FLOPs.
Furthermore, SPAT-pruned models outperform existing lightweight, Mamba-based
and LLM-based SOTA methods in both standard and zero-shot inference,
highlighting the importance of retaining only the most effective attention
mechanisms. We have made our code publicly available

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) holds significant promise for solving
computational challenges across diverse domains. However, its practical
deployment is constrained by the limitations of noisy intermediate-scale
quantum (NISQ) devices, including noise, limited scalability, and trainability
issues in variational quantum circuits (VQCs). We introduce the multi-chip
ensemble VQC framework, which partitions high-dimensional computations across
smaller quantum chips to enhance scalability, trainability, and noise
resilience. We show that this approach mitigates barren plateaus, reduces
quantum error bias and variance, and maintains robust generalization through
controlled entanglement. Designed to align with current and emerging quantum
hardware, the framework demonstrates strong potential for enabling scalable QML
on near-term devices, as validated by experiments on standard benchmark
datasets (MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10) and real world dataset (PhysioNet

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) are fundamental to modeling physical
systems, yet solving them remains a complex challenge. Traditional numerical
solvers rely on expert knowledge to implement and are computationally
expensive, while neural-network-based solvers require large training datasets
and often lack interpretability. In this work, we frame PDE solving as a code
generation task and introduce CodePDE, the first inference framework for
generating PDE solvers using large language models (LLMs). Leveraging advanced
inference-time algorithms and scaling strategies, CodePDE unlocks critical
capacities of LLM for PDE solving: reasoning, debugging, selfrefinement, and
test-time scaling -- all without task-specific tuning. CodePDE achieves
superhuman performance across a range of representative PDE problems. We also
present a systematic empirical analysis of LLM generated solvers, analyzing
their accuracy, efficiency, and numerical scheme choices. Our findings
highlight the promise and the current limitations of LLMs in PDE solving,
offering a new perspective on solver design and opportunities for future model
development. Our code is available at https://github.com/LithiumDA/CodePDE.

Motivation: 解决AI程序中算子融合问题，优化数据移动和计算效率，适用于大规模AI程序。

Method: 基于图的块程序表示和两阶段融合算法（候选选择与规则融合），直接建模内存层级间的数据移动。

Result: 成功自动发现Flash Attention核，并融合LayerNorm与矩阵乘法、RMSNorm与FNN-SwiGLU等复杂操作。

Conclusion: Blockbuster通过直接建模数据移动，实现了强大的融合效果，适用于多种硬件架构。

Abstract: Blockbuster is a framework for AI operator fusion in inference programs. The
Blockbuster framework is compatible with any multiprocessor architecture that
has a tiered memory hierarchy, including GPUs, multi-core CPUs, and some AI
accelerator chips. It includes a graph-based representation for AI workloads,
called a block program, which explicitly models how blocks of data move between
the memory tiers. It also includes an operator fusion procedure, which is made
up of a candidate selection algorithm and a fusion algorithm that fuses each
individual candidate - this two-algorithm structure makes Blockbuster
especially suitable for large AI programs. The current paper focuses on the
fusion algorithm, which is a rule-based technique. While the literature is full
of previous rule-based fusion algorithms, what sets our algorithm apart is its
direct modeling of data movement between memory tiers, resulting in uniquely
powerful fusion results. As a first sanity check, we demonstrate how our
algorithm automatically rediscovers the well-known Flash Attention kernel.
Then, we demonstrate the real power of our approach by fusing LayerNorm with
matrix multiplication and RMSNorm with FNN-SwiGLU - the latter involves fusing
three matrix multiplications, a Hadamard product, a reduction, and a few
elementwise operations into a single mega-kernel.

Result: 在五个OPF基准问题上，自动化设计方法优于手动设计，并揭示了关键环境设计决策。

Conclusion: 该方法为自动化RL环境设计提供了首个通用解决方案，同时讨论了过拟合风险。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are increasingly used to solve the
optimal power flow (OPF) problem. Yet, the question of how to design RL
environments to maximize training performance remains unanswered, both for the
OPF and the general case. We propose a general approach for automated RL
environment design by utilizing multi-objective optimization. For that, we use
the hyperparameter optimization (HPO) framework, which allows the reuse of
existing HPO algorithms and methods. On five OPF benchmark problems, we
demonstrate that our automated design approach consistently outperforms a
manually created baseline environment design. Further, we use statistical
analyses to determine which environment design decisions are especially
important for performance, resulting in multiple novel insights on how RL-OPF
environments should be designed. Finally, we discuss the risk of overfitting
the environment to the utilized RL algorithm. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first general approach for automated RL environment design.

Result: 实验验证了模型在节点分类任务中的优越性。

Conclusion: HGNN-IMA为多模态数据提供了创新解决方案，尤其适用于网络结构数据。

Abstract: Nowadays, numerous online platforms can be described as multi-modal
heterogeneous networks (MMHNs), such as Douban's movie networks and Amazon's
product review networks. Accurately categorizing nodes within these networks is
crucial for analyzing the corresponding entities, which requires effective
representation learning on nodes. However, existing multi-modal fusion methods
often adopt either early fusion strategies which may lose the unique
characteristics of individual modalities, or late fusion approaches overlooking
the cross-modal guidance in GNN-based information propagation. In this paper,
we propose a novel model for node classification in MMHNs, named Heterogeneous
Graph Neural Network with Inter-Modal Attention (HGNN-IMA). It learns node
representations by capturing the mutual influence of multiple modalities during
the information propagation process, within the framework of heterogeneous
graph transformer. Specifically, a nested inter-modal attention mechanism is
integrated into the inter-node attention to achieve adaptive multi-modal
fusion, and modality alignment is also taken into account to encourage the
propagation among nodes with consistent similarities across all modalities.
Moreover, an attention loss is augmented to mitigate the impact of missing
modalities. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of the model in the
node classification task, providing an innovative view to handle multi-modal
data, especially when accompanied with network structures.

Conclusion: 潜在行为扩散模型能够生成更自然、多样且上下文相关的面部反应，显著提升了交互模拟的效果。

Abstract: The dyadic reaction generation task involves synthesizing responsive facial
reactions that align closely with the behaviors of a conversational partner,
enhancing the naturalness and effectiveness of human-like interaction
simulations. This paper introduces a novel approach, the Latent Behavior
Diffusion Model, comprising a context-aware autoencoder and a diffusion-based
conditional generator that addresses the challenge of generating diverse and
contextually relevant facial reactions from input speaker behaviors. The
autoencoder compresses high-dimensional input features, capturing dynamic
patterns in listener reactions while condensing complex input data into a
concise latent representation, facilitating more expressive and contextually
appropriate reaction synthesis. The diffusion-based conditional generator
operates on the latent space generated by the autoencoder to predict realistic
facial reactions in a non-autoregressive manner. This approach allows for
generating diverse facial reactions that reflect subtle variations in
conversational cues and emotional states. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach in achieving superior performance in dyadic
reaction synthesis tasks compared to existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证自注意力机制是否如Teo等人（2024）所述实现了KPCA，并分析其声称的数学对应关系。

Method: 通过对比学习到的自注意力值向量与KPCA理论预测的向量，评估相似性指标（如余弦相似性、CKA），并分析重构损失和Gram矩阵特征值统计。

Result: 发现自注意力值与KPCA预测向量无显著对应关系（相似性指标低），重构损失差异被误解，且特征值统计无法复现。

Conclusion: 自注意力的KPCA解释缺乏实证支持，10种Transformer架构的实验结果均不支持该观点。

Abstract: In this reproduction study, we revisit recent claims that self-attention
implements kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) (Teo et al., 2024),
positing that (i) value vectors $V$ capture the eigenvectors of the Gram matrix
of the keys, and (ii) that self-attention projects queries onto the principal
component axes of the key matrix $K$ in a feature space. Our analysis reveals
three critical inconsistencies: (1) No alignment exists between learned
self-attention value vectors and what is proposed in the KPCA perspective, with
average similarity metrics (optimal cosine similarity $\leq 0.32$, linear CKA
(Centered Kernel Alignment) $\leq 0.11$, kernel CKA $\leq 0.32$) indicating
negligible correspondence; (2) Reported decreases in reconstruction loss
$J_\text{proj}$, arguably justifying the claim that the self-attention
minimizes the projection error of KPCA, are misinterpreted, as the quantities
involved differ by orders of magnitude ($\sim\!10^3$); (3) Gram matrix
eigenvalue statistics, introduced to justify that $V$ captures the eigenvector
of the gram matrix, are irreproducible without undocumented
implementation-specific adjustments. Across 10 transformer architectures, we
conclude that the KPCA interpretation of self-attention lacks empirical
support.

Conclusion: 研究为未来探索平衡性能损失和XAI一致性的模型是否更具稳健性奠定了基础。

Abstract: Despite the growing interest in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI),
explainability is rarely considered during hyperparameter tuning or neural
architecture optimization, where the focus remains primarily on minimizing
predictive loss. In this work, we introduce the novel concept of XAI
consistency, defined as the agreement among different feature attribution
methods, and propose new metrics to quantify it. For the first time, we
integrate XAI consistency directly into the hyperparameter tuning objective,
creating a multi-objective optimization framework that balances predictive
performance with explanation robustness. Implemented within the Sequential
Parameter Optimization Toolbox (SPOT), our approach uses both weighted
aggregation and desirability-based strategies to guide model selection. Through
our proposed framework and supporting tools, we explore the impact of
incorporating XAI consistency into the optimization process. This enables us to
characterize distinct regions in the architecture configuration space: one
region with poor performance and comparatively low interpretability, another
with strong predictive performance but weak interpretability due to low
\gls{xai} consistency, and a trade-off region that balances both objectives by
offering high interpretability alongside competitive performance. Beyond
introducing this novel approach, our research provides a foundation for future
investigations into whether models from the trade-off zone-balancing
performance loss and XAI consistency-exhibit greater robustness by avoiding
overfitting to training performance, thereby leading to more reliable
predictions on out-of-distribution data.

Abstract: Bayesian inference has many advantages in decision making of agents (e.g.
robotics/simulative agent) over a regular data-driven black-box neural network:
Data-efficiency, generalization, interpretability, and safety where these
advantages benefit directly/indirectly from the uncertainty quantification of
Bayesian inference. However, there are few comprehensive reviews to summarize
the progress of Bayesian inference on reinforcement learning (RL) for decision
making to give researchers a systematic understanding. This paper focuses on
combining Bayesian inference with RL that nowadays is an important approach in
agent decision making. To be exact, this paper discusses the following five
topics: 1) Bayesian methods that have potential for agent decision making.
First basic Bayesian methods and models (Bayesian rule, Bayesian learning, and
Bayesian conjugate models) are discussed followed by variational inference,
Bayesian optimization, Bayesian deep learning, Bayesian active learning,
Bayesian generative models, Bayesian meta-learning, and lifelong Bayesian
learning. 2) Classical combinations of Bayesian methods with model-based RL
(with approximation methods), model-free RL, and inverse RL. 3) Latest
combinations of potential Bayesian methods with RL. 4) Analytical comparisons
of methods that combine Bayesian methods with RL with respect to
data-efficiency, generalization, interpretability, and safety. 5) In-depth
discussions in six complex problem variants of RL, including unknown reward,
partial-observability, multi-agent, multi-task, non-linear non-Gaussian, and
hierarchical RL problems and the summary of how Bayesian methods work in the
data collection, data processing and policy learning stages of RL to pave the
way for better agent decision-making strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限的微控制器上部署深度学习模型进行裂缝分割面临内存、计算能力和能源限制的挑战。

Method: 采用三种优化策略：减少卷积核数量、降低网络深度和使用深度可分离卷积（DWConv2D）。

Result: 减少卷积核和网络深度显著降低了RAM、Flash需求和推理时间，同时牺牲了一些准确性。优化后的网络适合低功耗TinyML应用。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅推动了基于TinyML的裂缝分割技术，还为能源自主的边缘结构健康监测系统提供了可能性。

Abstract: Crack segmentation can play a critical role in Structural Health Monitoring
(SHM) by enabling accurate identification of crack size and location, which
allows to monitor structural damages over time. However, deploying deep
learning models for crack segmentation on resource-constrained microcontrollers
presents significant challenges due to limited memory, computational power, and
energy resources. To address these challenges, this study explores lightweight
U-Net architectures tailored for TinyML applications, focusing on three
optimization strategies: filter number reduction, network depth reduction, and
the use of Depthwise Separable Convolutions (DWConv2D). Our results demonstrate
that reducing convolution kernels and network depth significantly reduces RAM
and Flash requirement, and inference times, albeit with some accuracy
trade-offs. Specifically, by reducing the filer number to 25%, the network
depth to four blocks, and utilizing depthwise convolutions, a good compromise
between segmentation performance and resource consumption is achieved. This
makes the network particularly suitable for low-power TinyML applications. This
study not only advances TinyML-based crack segmentation but also provides the
possibility for energy-autonomous edge SHM systems.

Motivation: 深度神经网络（DNN）在小样本学习中表现优异但计算成本高，而SNN虽能效高但在复杂时空特征提取和跨类比较上存在不足。

Method: 提出FSL-SNN框架，结合自特征提取模块和跨特征对比模块，使用时间高效训练损失和InfoNCE损失优化。

Conclusion: FSL-SNN在小样本学习中高效且性能优异，为SNN在复杂任务中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) excel in computer vision tasks, especially,
few-shot learning (FSL), which is increasingly important for generalizing from
limited examples. However, DNNs are computationally expensive with scalability
issues in real world. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), with their event-driven
nature and low energy consumption, are particularly efficient in processing
sparse and dynamic data, though they still encounter difficulties in capturing
complex spatiotemporal features and performing accurate cross-class
comparisons. To further enhance the performance and efficiency of SNNs in
few-shot learning, we propose a few-shot learning framework based on SNNs,
which combines a self-feature extractor module and a cross-feature contrastive
module to refine feature representation and reduce power consumption. We apply
the combination of temporal efficient training loss and InfoNCE loss to
optimize the temporal dynamics of spike trains and enhance the discriminative
power. Experimental results show that the proposed FSL-SNN significantly
improves the classification performance on the neuromorphic dataset N-Omniglot,
and also achieves competitive performance to ANNs on static datasets such as
CUB and miniImageNet with low power consumption.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to symbolic regression using vision-capable large
language models (LLMs) and the ideas behind Google DeepMind's Funsearch. The
LLM is given a plot of a univariate function and tasked with proposing an
ansatz for that function. The free parameters of the ansatz are fitted using
standard numerical optimisers, and a collection of such ans\"atze make up the
population of a genetic algorithm. Unlike other symbolic regression techniques,
our method does not require the specification of a set of functions to be used
in regression, but with appropriate prompt engineering, we can arbitrarily
condition the generative step. By using Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs), we
demonstrate that ``univariate is all you need'' for symbolic regression, and
extend this method to multivariate functions by learning the univariate
function on each edge of a trained KAN. The combined expression is then
simplified by further processing with a language model.

TL;DR: 本文提出两种算法（温度缩放和TLDR方法）以提高小型语言模型的推理效率，减少冗余计算，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过增加推理链长度提升语言模型准确性，但导致冗余和高计算成本，尤其是小型模型。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出温度缩放（TS）控制推理停止点，以及基于GRPO的长度正则化强化学习方法（TLDR），实现多级推理长度控制。

Result: 实验表明，TS比预算强制方法更有效，TLDR显著提高50%的token效率且几乎不影响准确性。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了控制推理停止时间的重要性，提供了高效的算法解决方案，弥补了纯SFT的不足。

Abstract: Recent research enhances language model reasoning by scaling test-time
compute via longer chain-of-thought traces. This often improves accuracy but
also introduces redundancy and high computational cost, especially for small
language models distilled with supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In this work, we
propose new algorithms to improve token-efficient reasoning with small-scale
models by effectively trading off accuracy and computation. We first show that
the post-SFT model fails to determine the optimal stopping point of the
reasoning process, resulting in verbose and repetitive outputs. Verbosity also
significantly varies across wrong vs correct responses. To address these
issues, we propose two solutions: (1) Temperature scaling (TS) to control the
stopping point for the thinking phase and thereby trace length, and (2) TLDR: a
length-regularized reinforcement learning method based on GRPO that facilitates
multi-level trace length control (e.g. short, medium, long reasoning).
Experiments on four reasoning benchmarks, MATH500, AMC, AIME24 and
OlympiadBench, demonstrate that TS is highly effective compared to s1's budget
forcing approach and TLDR significantly improves token efficiency by about 50%
with minimal to no accuracy loss over the SFT baseline. Moreover, TLDR also
facilitates flexible control over the response length, offering a practical and
effective solution for token-efficient reasoning in small models. Ultimately,
our work reveals the importance of stopping time control, highlights
shortcomings of pure SFT, and provides effective algorithmic recipes.

Motivation: 机器学习训练数据常包含敏感信息，匿名化技术用于保护隐私，但其对公平性的影响尚不明确。

Method: 系统评估匿名化技术对个体和群体公平性的影响，分析不同隐私设置和数据分布下的效果。

Result: 匿名化可能导致群体公平性指标下降四个数量级，但个体公平性指标因输入同质性增强而改善。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了隐私、公平性和实用性之间的权衡，为负责任的人工智能开发提供了指导。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) algorithms are heavily based on the availability of
training data, which, depending on the domain, often includes sensitive
information about data providers. This raises critical privacy concerns.
Anonymization techniques have emerged as a practical solution to address these
issues by generalizing features or suppressing data to make it more difficult
to accurately identify individuals. Although recent studies have shown that
privacy-enhancing technologies can influence ML predictions across different
subgroups, thus affecting fair decision-making, the specific effects of
anonymization techniques, such as $k$-anonymity, $\ell$-diversity, and
$t$-closeness, on ML fairness remain largely unexplored. In this work, we
systematically audit the impact of anonymization techniques on ML fairness,
evaluating both individual and group fairness. Our quantitative study reveals
that anonymization can degrade group fairness metrics by up to four orders of
magnitude. Conversely, similarity-based individual fairness metrics tend to
improve under stronger anonymization, largely as a result of increased input
homogeneity. By analyzing varying levels of anonymization across diverse
privacy settings and data distributions, this study provides critical insights
into the trade-offs between privacy, fairness, and utility, offering actionable
guidelines for responsible AI development. Our code is publicly available at:

Conclusion: FairZK通过零知识证明高效验证模型公平性，解决了传统方法的效率和规模限制。

Abstract: With the rise of machine learning techniques, ensuring the fairness of
decisions made by machine learning algorithms has become of great importance in
critical applications. However, measuring fairness often requires full access
to the model parameters, which compromises the confidentiality of the models.
In this paper, we propose a solution using zero-knowledge proofs, which allows
the model owner to convince the public that a machine learning model is fair
while preserving the secrecy of the model. To circumvent the efficiency barrier
of naively proving machine learning inferences in zero-knowledge, our key
innovation is a new approach to measure fairness only with model parameters and
some aggregated information of the input, but not on any specific dataset. To
achieve this goal, we derive new bounds for the fairness of logistic regression
and deep neural network models that are tighter and better reflecting the
fairness compared to prior work. Moreover, we develop efficient zero-knowledge
proof protocols for common computations involved in measuring fairness,
including the spectral norm of matrices, maximum, absolute value, and
fixed-point arithmetic.
  We have fully implemented our system, FairZK, that proves machine learning
fairness in zero-knowledge. Experimental results show that FairZK is
significantly faster than the naive approach and an existing scheme that use
zero-knowledge inferences as a subroutine. The prover time is improved by
3.1x--1789x depending on the size of the model and the dataset. FairZK can
scale to a large model with 47 million parameters for the first time, and
generates a proof for its fairness in 343 seconds. This is estimated to be 4
orders of magnitude faster than existing schemes, which only scale to small
models with hundreds to thousands of parameters.

Method: 采用动态低秩训练方案，引入谱正则化控制每层低秩核心的条件数。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在标准架构、数据集和对抗攻击下，可实现超过94%的压缩，同时恢复或提升对抗准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法模型和数据无关，计算高效，支持自适应压缩，有效解决了压缩与鲁棒性的冲突。

Abstract: Deployment of neural networks on resource-constrained devices demands models
that are both compact and robust to adversarial inputs. However, compression
and adversarial robustness often conflict. In this work, we introduce a
dynamical low-rank training scheme enhanced with a novel spectral regularizer
that controls the condition number of the low-rank core in each layer. This
approach mitigates the sensitivity of compressed models to adversarial
perturbations without sacrificing clean accuracy. The method is model- and
data-agnostic, computationally efficient, and supports rank adaptivity to
automatically compress the network at hand. Extensive experiments across
standard architectures, datasets, and adversarial attacks show the regularized
networks can achieve over 94% compression while recovering or improving
adversarial accuracy relative to uncompressed baselines.

Method: 设计并部署了一个基于边缘设备（如Raspberry Pi和Jetson Nano）的物理测试平台，扩展了DFL训练平台NEBULA，并加入能耗监测模块。

Result: 实验表明，模型性能受通信拓扑结构影响，拓扑越密集，DFL环境下的性能越好。

Conclusion: DFL在资源受限设备上具有实际应用潜力，但需优化通信拓扑以提升性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing
raw data, preserving participant privacy. Decentralized FL (DFL) eliminates
reliance on a central server, mitigating the single point of failure inherent
in the traditional FL paradigm, while introducing deployment challenges on
resource-constrained devices. To evaluate real-world applicability, this work
designs and deploys a physical testbed using edge devices such as Raspberry Pi
and Jetson Nano. The testbed is built upon a DFL training platform, NEBULA, and
extends it with a power monitoring module to measure energy consumption during
training. Experiments across multiple datasets show that model performance is
influenced by the communication topology, with denser topologies leading to
better outcomes in DFL settings.

Motivation: 传统稀疏自编码器分析仅依赖输入侧激活，未考虑潜在特征对输出的因果影响。

Method: 提出GradSAE方法，利用输出侧梯度信息识别高因果影响的潜在特征。

Result: 验证了高因果影响的潜在特征对模型操控更有效。

Conclusion: GradSAE为稀疏自编码器的分析和应用提供了更有效的方法。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for
interpreting and steering the internal representations of large language models
(LLMs). However, conventional approaches to analyzing SAEs typically rely
solely on input-side activations, without considering the causal influence
between each latent feature and the model's output. This work is built on two
key hypotheses: (1) activated latents do not contribute equally to the
construction of the model's output, and (2) only latents with high causal
influence are effective for model steering. To validate these hypotheses, we
propose Gradient Sparse Autoencoder (GradSAE), a simple yet effective method
that identifies the most influential latents by incorporating output-side
gradient information.

Conclusion: 提出的Fréchet距离指标为生成式AI模型在智能电网中的应用提供了更可靠的数据质量评估工具。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) models in smart grids have advanced
significantly in recent years due to their ability to generate large amounts of
synthetic data, which would otherwise be difficult to obtain in the real world
due to confidentiality constraints. A key challenge in utilizing such synthetic
data is how to assess the data quality produced from such generative models.
Traditional Euclidean distance-based metrics only reflect pair-wise relations
between two individual samples, and could fail in evaluating quality
differences between groups of synthetic datasets. In this work, we propose a
novel metric based on the Fr\'{e}chet Distance (FD) estimated between two
datasets in a learned feature space. The proposed method evaluates the quality
of generation from a distributional perspective. Empirical results demonstrate
the superiority of the proposed metric across timescales and models, enhancing
the reliability of data-driven decision-making in smart grid operations.

Abstract: Privacy and regulatory barriers often hinder centralized machine learning
solutions, particularly in sectors like healthcare where data cannot be freely
shared. Federated learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm to address these
concerns; however, existing frameworks primarily support gradient-based models,
leaving a gap for more interpretable, tree-based approaches. This paper
introduces a federated learning framework for Random Forest classifiers that
preserves data privacy and provides robust performance in distributed settings.
By leveraging PySyft for secure, privacy-aware computation, our method enables
multiple institutions to collaboratively train Random Forest models on locally
stored data without exposing sensitive information. The framework supports
weighted model averaging to account for varying data distributions, incremental
learning to progressively refine models, and local evaluation to assess
performance across heterogeneous datasets. Experiments on two real-world
healthcare benchmarks demonstrate that the federated approach maintains
competitive predictive accuracy - within a maximum 9\% margin of centralized
methods - while satisfying stringent privacy requirements. These findings
underscore the viability of tree-based federated learning for scenarios where
data cannot be centralized due to regulatory, competitive, or technical
constraints. The proposed solution addresses a notable gap in existing
federated learning libraries, offering an adaptable tool for secure distributed
machine learning tasks that demand both transparency and reliable performance.

Result: 在合成和真实数据的实验中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在多模态数据中解决了失真和建模误差问题，为非线性数据分析和可解释机器学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Modern machine learning increasingly leverages the insight that
high-dimensional data often lie near low-dimensional, non-linear manifolds, an
idea known as the manifold hypothesis. By explicitly modeling the geometric
structure of data through learning Riemannian geometry algorithms can achieve
improved performance and interpretability in tasks like clustering,
dimensionality reduction, and interpolation. In particular, learned pullback
geometry has recently undergone transformative developments that now make it
scalable to learn and scalable to evaluate, which further opens the door for
principled non-linear data analysis and interpretable machine learning.
However, there are still steps to be taken when considering real-world
multi-modal data. This work focuses on addressing distortions and modeling
errors that can arise in the multi-modal setting and proposes to alleviate both
challenges through isometrizing the learned Riemannian structure and balancing
regularity and expressivity of the diffeomorphism parametrization. We showcase
the effectiveness of the synergy of the proposed approaches in several
numerical experiments with both synthetic and real data.

Method: 提出高阶正则化（HR）方法，将其视为逆映射的近似，并推导出误差上下界。HR方法适用于任意映射矩阵的神经网络。

Result: HR方法在经典控制问题中验证了其性能，显著提升了神经网络的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 高阶正则化为神经网络训练提供了理论支持，增强了模型的可解释性和泛化性能。

Abstract: The paper proposes a novel regularization procedure for machine learning. The
proposed high-order regularization (HR) provides new insight into
regularization, which is widely used to train a neural network that can be
utilized to approximate the action-value function in general reinforcement
learning problems. The proposed HR method ensures the provable convergence of
the approximation algorithm, which makes the much-needed connection between
regularization and explainable learning using neural networks. The proposed HR
method theoretically demonstrates that regularization can be regarded as an
approximation in terms of inverse mapping with explicitly calculable
approximation error, and the $L_2$ regularization is a lower-order case of the
proposed method. We provide lower and upper bounds for the error of the
proposed HR solution, which helps build a reliable model. We also find that
regularization with the proposed HR can be regarded as a contraction. We prove
that the generalizability of neural networks can be maximized with a proper
regularization matrix, and the proposed HR is applicable for neural networks
with any mapping matrix. With the theoretical explanation of the extreme
learning machine for neural network training and the proposed high-order
regularization, one can better interpret the output of the neural network, thus
leading to explainable learning. We present a case study based on regularized
extreme learning neural networks to demonstrate the application of the proposed
HR and give the corresponding incremental HR solution. We verify the
performance of the proposed HR method by solving a classic control problem in
reinforcement learning. The result demonstrates the superior performance of the
method with significant enhancement in the generalizability of the neural
network.

Result: 实验表明现有遗忘方法无法满足计算性遗忘定义，且基于差分隐私的方法虽可行但会导致效用崩溃。

Conclusion: 当前遗忘方法存在根本性不足，未来需进一步研究如何实现计算性遗忘。

Abstract: Machine unlearning methods take a model trained on a dataset and a forget
set, then attempt to produce a model as if it had only been trained on the
examples not in the forget set. We empirically show that an adversary is able
to distinguish between a mirror model (a control model produced by retraining
without the data to forget) and a model produced by an unlearning method across
representative unlearning methods from the literature. We build distinguishing
algorithms based on evaluation scores in the literature (i.e. membership
inference scores) and Kullback-Leibler divergence.
  We propose a strong formal definition for machine unlearning called
computational unlearning. Computational unlearning is defined as the inability
for an adversary to distinguish between a mirror model and a model produced by
an unlearning method. If the adversary cannot guess better than random (except
with negligible probability), then we say that an unlearning method achieves
computational unlearning.
  Our computational unlearning definition provides theoretical structure to
prove unlearning feasibility results. For example, our computational unlearning
definition immediately implies that there are no deterministic computational
unlearning methods for entropic learning algorithms. We also explore the
relationship between differential privacy (DP)-based unlearning methods and
computational unlearning, showing that DP-based approaches can satisfy
computational unlearning at the cost of an extreme utility collapse. These
results demonstrate that current methodology in the literature fundamentally
falls short of achieving computational unlearning. We conclude by identifying
several open questions for future work.

Abstract: Almost all existing hierarchical federated learning (FL) models are limited
to two aggregation layers, restricting scalability and flexibility in complex,
large-scale networks. In this work, we propose a Multi-Layer Hierarchical
Federated Learning framework (QMLHFL), which appears to be the first study that
generalizes hierarchical FL to arbitrary numbers of layers and network
architectures through nested aggregation, while employing a layer-specific
quantization scheme to meet communication constraints. We develop a
comprehensive convergence analysis for QMLHFL and derive a general convergence
condition and rate that reveal the effects of key factors, including
quantization parameters, hierarchical architecture, and intra-layer iteration
counts. Furthermore, we determine the optimal number of intra-layer iterations
to maximize the convergence rate while meeting a deadline constraint that
accounts for both communication and computation times. Our results show that
QMLHFL consistently achieves high learning accuracy, even under high data
heterogeneity, and delivers notably improved performance when optimized,
compared to using randomly selected values.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is critical for many applications, where deep
learning-based point prediction models have demonstrated strong performance.
However, in practical scenarios, there is also a need to quantify predictive
uncertainty through online confidence intervals. Existing confidence interval
modeling approaches building upon these deep point prediction models suffer
from key limitations: they either require costly retraining, fail to fully
leverage the representational strengths of deep models, or lack theoretical
guarantees. To address these gaps, we propose a lightweight conformal
prediction method that provides valid coverage and shorter interval lengths
without retraining. Our approach leverages features extracted from pre-trained
point prediction models to fit a residual predictor and construct confidence
intervals, further enhanced by an adaptive coverage control mechanism.
Theoretically, we prove that our method achieves asymptotic coverage
convergence, with error bounds dependent on the feature quality of the
underlying point prediction model. Experiments on 12 datasets demonstrate that
our method delivers tighter confidence intervals while maintaining desired
coverage rates. Code, model and dataset in

Abstract: Offline safe reinforcement learning(OSRL) derives constraint-satisfying
policies from pre-collected datasets, offers a promising avenue for deploying
RL in safety-critical real-world domains such as robotics. However, the
majority of existing approaches emphasize only short-term safety, neglecting
long-horizon considerations. Consequently, they may violate safety constraints
and fail to ensure sustained protection during online deployment. Moreover, the
learned policies often struggle to handle states and actions that are not
present or out-of-distribution(OOD) from the offline dataset, and exhibit
limited sample efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
framework Feasibility-Aware offline Safe Reinforcement Learning with CVAE-based
Pessimism (FASP). First, we employ Hamilton-Jacobi (H-J) reachability analysis
to generate reliable safety labels, which serve as supervisory signals for
training both a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) and a safety
classifier. This approach not only ensures high sampling efficiency but also
provides rigorous long-horizon safety guarantees. Furthermore, we utilize
pessimistic estimation methods to estimate the Q-value of reward and cost,
which mitigates the extrapolation errors induces by OOD actions, and penalize
unsafe actions to enabled the agent to proactively avoid high-risk behaviors.
Moreover, we theoretically prove the validity of this pessimistic estimation.
Extensive experiments on DSRL benchmarks demonstrate that FASP algorithm
achieves competitive performance across multiple experimental tasks,
particularly outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of safety.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种双系统自适应决策框架（DSADF），结合强化学习（RL）和视觉语言模型（VLM）的优势，以解决RL在动态环境中泛化能力不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL在动态环境中泛化能力有限，而现有结合LLM/VLM的方法缺乏无缝协作，导致决策不合理和效率瓶颈。

Method: 受Kahneman的双系统理论启发，提出DSADF框架，包含快速直觉决策的System 1（RL+记忆）和深度分析的System 2（VLM）。

Result: 在Crafter和Housekeep游戏环境中的实验表明，DSADF在未知和已知任务中显著提升了决策能力。

Conclusion: DSADF通过结合RL和VLM的优势，实现了高效且自适应的决策，为复杂环境中的智能决策提供了新思路。

Abstract: Although Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents are effective in well-defined
environments, they often struggle to generalize their learned policies to
dynamic settings due to their reliance on trial-and-error interactions. Recent
work has explored applying Large Language Models (LLMs) or Vision Language
Models (VLMs) to boost the generalization of RL agents through policy
optimization guidance or prior knowledge. However, these approaches often lack
seamless coordination between the RL agent and the foundation model, leading to
unreasonable decision-making in unfamiliar environments and efficiency
bottlenecks. Making full use of the inferential capabilities of foundation
models and the rapid response capabilities of RL agents and enhancing the
interaction between the two to form a dual system is still a lingering
scientific question. To address this problem, we draw inspiration from
Kahneman's theory of fast thinking (System 1) and slow thinking (System 2),
demonstrating that balancing intuition and deep reasoning can achieve nimble
decision-making in a complex world. In this study, we propose a Dual-System
Adaptive Decision Framework (DSADF), integrating two complementary modules:
System 1, comprising an RL agent and a memory space for fast and intuitive
decision making, and System 2, driven by a VLM for deep and analytical
reasoning. DSADF facilitates efficient and adaptive decision-making by
combining the strengths of both systems. The empirical study in the video game
environment: Crafter and Housekeep demonstrates the effectiveness of our
proposed method, showing significant improvements in decision abilities for
both unseen and known tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于MLP的长期时间序列预测框架MDMixer，解决了多粒度信息利用不足、通道特性忽略以及趋势与季节性成分独特性的问题，显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长期时间序列预测在能源消耗和天气预测等领域具有广泛应用，但由于复杂的时序模式和多尺度变化，准确预测具有挑战性。

Method: MDMixer通过多尺度预测和动态信息整合系统，独立建模趋势和季节性成分，优化了多粒度信息的利用。

Result: 在八个基准测试中，MDMixer的平均MAE性能比现有最优MLP方法（TimeMixer）提升了4.64%。

Conclusion: MDMixer在训练效率和模型可解释性之间取得了平衡，为长期时间序列预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) offers broad utility in practical
settings like energy consumption and weather prediction. Accurately predicting
long-term changes, however, is demanding due to the intricate temporal patterns
and inherent multi-scale variations within time series. This work confronts key
issues in LTSF, including the suboptimal use of multi-granularity information,
the neglect of channel-specific attributes, and the unique nature of trend and
seasonal components, by introducing a proficient MLP-based forecasting
framework. Our method adeptly disentangles complex temporal dynamics using
clear, concurrent predictions across various scales. These multi-scale
forecasts are then skillfully integrated through a system that dynamically
assigns importance to information from different granularities, sensitive to
individual channel characteristics. To manage the specific features of temporal
patterns, a two-pronged structure is utilized to model trend and seasonal
elements independently. Experimental results on eight LTSF benchmarks
demonstrate that MDMixer improves average MAE performance by 4.64% compared to
the recent state-of-the-art MLP-based method (TimeMixer), while achieving an
effective balance between training efficiency and model interpretability.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于网络流的2-HNC方法，用于正未标记（PU）学习，通过利用样本间的相似性生成嵌套分区，并分两阶段进行负样本筛选和分类优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在二元分类中，训练数据通常只有正样本，其余未标记，PU学习旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 2-HNC方法分两阶段：首先生成未标记样本的负样本排名，第二阶段加入可能负样本并重新分类，最终选择最接近先验正样本比例的预测结果。

Result: 实验表明，2-HNC在合成和真实数据集上表现优异，常超越现有先进算法。

Conclusion: 2-HNC为PU学习提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: In many scenarios of binary classification, only positive instances are
provided in the training data, leaving the rest of the data unlabeled. This
setup, known as positive-unlabeled (PU) learning, is addressed here with a
network flow-based method which utilizes pairwise similarities between samples.
The method we propose here, 2-HNC, leverages Hochbaum's Normalized Cut (HNC)
and the set of solutions it provides by solving a parametric minimum cut
problem. The set of solutions, that are nested partitions of the samples into
two sets, correspond to varying tradeoff values between the two goals: high
intra-similarity inside the sets and low inter-similarity between the two sets.
This nested sequence is utilized here to deliver a ranking of unlabeled samples
by their likelihood of being negative. Building on this insight, our method,
2-HNC, proceeds in two stages. The first stage generates this ranking without
assuming any negative labels, using a problem formulation that is constrained
only on positive labeled samples. The second stage augments the positive set
with likely-negative samples and recomputes the classification. The final label
prediction selects among all generated partitions in both stages, the one that
delivers a positive class proportion, closest to a prior estimate of this
quantity, which is assumed to be given. Extensive experiments across synthetic
and real datasets show that 2-HNC yields strong performance and often surpasses
existing state-of-the-art algorithms.

Method: 构建由神经网络参数化的高斯混合模型，基于概率密度的异常评分函数（负对数似然）检测异常。

Result: 在UNSW-NB15数据集上的实验表明，该方法在性能（Accuracy、F1-score、AUC）和训练稳定性上优于多种先进神经网络架构。

Conclusion: 该方法为用户行为建模和异常检测提供了更具表达力和判别性的解决方案，推动了深度概率建模技术在网络安全和智能风控领域的应用。

Abstract: To improve the identification of potential anomaly patterns in complex user
behavior, this paper proposes an anomaly detection method based on a deep
mixture density network. The method constructs a Gaussian mixture model
parameterized by a neural network, enabling conditional probability modeling of
user behavior. It effectively captures the multimodal distribution
characteristics commonly present in behavioral data. Unlike traditional
classifiers that rely on fixed thresholds or a single decision boundary, this
approach defines an anomaly scoring function based on probability density using
negative log-likelihood. This significantly enhances the model's ability to
detect rare and unstructured behaviors. Experiments are conducted on the
real-world network user dataset UNSW-NB15. A series of performance comparisons
and stability validation experiments are designed. These cover multiple
evaluation aspects, including Accuracy, F1- score, AUC, and loss fluctuation.
The results show that the proposed method outperforms several advanced neural
network architectures in both performance and training stability. This study
provides a more expressive and discriminative solution for user behavior
modeling and anomaly detection. It strongly promotes the application of deep
probabilistic modeling techniques in the fields of network security and
intelligent risk control.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应低秩矩阵近似（LoRMA）方法，通过分块聚类和局部SVD优化数据压缩，显著提升了医学图像的结构保留和诊断相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统全局SVD方法在压缩高分辨率数据矩阵时忽略了局部变化，导致细节丢失。为了解决这一问题，研究提出了一种自适应LoRMA方法。

Method: 将数据矩阵分块为重叠的局部区域，通过k-means聚类相似块，并在每个聚类内执行SVD，分析压缩效率和计算成本。

Result: 在MRI、超声、CT和胸透四种医学影像中，自适应LoRMA在PSNR、SSIM、IoU、EPI等指标上优于全局SVD，且减少了块状伪影和残差误差。

Conclusion: 自适应LoRMA在保持诊断精度的同时优化了存储效率，尽管计算时间较长，但其优势在高压缩应用中具有显著价值。

Abstract: Low-rank matrix approximation (LoRMA) is a fundamental tool for compressing
high-resolution data matrices by extracting important features while
suppressing redundancy. Low-rank methods, such as global singular value
decomposition (SVD), apply uniform compression across the entire data matrix,
often ignoring important local variations and leading to the loss of fine
structural details. To address these limitations, we introduce an adaptive
LoRMA, which partitions data matrix into overlapping patches, groups
structurally similar patches into several clusters using k-means, and performs
SVD within each cluster. We derive the overall compression factor accounting
for patch overlap and analyze how patch size influences compression efficiency
and computational cost. While the proposed adaptive LoRMA method is applicable
to any data exhibiting high local variation, we focus on medical imaging due to
its pronounced local variability. We evaluate and compare our adaptive LoRMA
against global SVD across four imaging modalities: MRI, ultrasound, CT scan,
and chest X-ray. Results demonstrate that adaptive LoRMA effectively preserves
structural integrity, edge details, and diagnostic relevance, as measured by
peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), mean
squared error (MSE), intersection over union (IoU), and edge preservation index
(EPI). Adaptive LoRMA significantly minimizes block artifacts and residual
errors, particularly in pathological regions, consistently outperforming global
SVD in terms of PSNR, SSIM, IoU, EPI, and achieving lower MSE. Adaptive LoRMA
prioritizes clinically salient regions while allowing aggressive compression in
non-critical regions, optimizing storage efficiency. Although adaptive LoRMA
requires higher processing time, its diagnostic fidelity justifies the overhead
for high-compression applications.

Result: 在回归函数足够平滑时，DNN可以实现任意大的样本外风险收敛速度O(n^−α)。

Conclusion: DNN在硬边界条件下具有优异的分类性能，且其风险收敛速度可通过平滑性条件进一步提升。

Abstract: We study the classical binary classification problem for hypothesis spaces of
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with ReLU activation under Tsybakov's low-noise
condition with exponent $q>0$, and its limit-case $q\to\infty$ which we refer
to as the "hard-margin condition". We show that DNNs which minimize the
empirical risk with square loss surrogate and $\ell_p$ penalty can achieve
finite-sample excess risk bounds of order $\mathcal{O}\left(n^{-\alpha}\right)$
for arbitrarily large $\alpha>0$ under the hard-margin condition, provided that
the regression function $\eta$ is sufficiently smooth. The proof relies on a
novel decomposition of the excess risk which might be of independent interest.

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) as feature enhancers to optimize node
representations, which are then used as inputs for graph neural networks
(GNNs), has shown significant potential in graph representation learning.
However, the fundamental properties of this approach remain underexplored. To
address this issue, we propose conducting a more in-depth analysis of this
issue based on the interchange intervention method. First, we construct a
synthetic graph dataset with controllable causal relationships, enabling
precise manipulation of semantic relationships and causal modeling to provide
data for analysis. Using this dataset, we conduct interchange interventions to
examine the deeper properties of LLM enhancers and GNNs, uncovering their
underlying logic and internal mechanisms. Building on the analytical results,
we design a plug-and-play optimization module to improve the information
transfer between LLM enhancers and GNNs. Experiments across multiple datasets
and models validate the proposed module.

Abstract: Multimodal learning enhances deep learning models by enabling them to
perceive and understand information from multiple data modalities, such as
visual and textual inputs. However, most existing approaches assume the
availability of all modalities, an assumption that often fails in real-world
applications. Recent works have introduced learnable missing-case-aware prompts
to mitigate performance degradation caused by missing modalities while reducing
the need for extensive model fine-tuning. Building upon the effectiveness of
missing-case-aware handling for missing modalities, we propose a novel
decoupled prototype-based output head, which leverages missing-case-aware
class-wise prototypes tailored for each individual modality. This approach
dynamically adapts to different missing modality scenarios and can be
seamlessly integrated with existing prompt-based methods. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed output head significantly improves performance
across a wide range of missing-modality scenarios and varying missing rates.

Conclusion: 该方法揭示了Mamba架构的冗余性和鲁棒性，拓宽了其应用范围。

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs), particularly the Mamba architecture, have emerged
as powerful alternatives to Transformers for sequence modeling, offering
linear-time complexity and competitive performance across diverse tasks.
However, their large parameter counts pose significant challenges for
deployment in resource-constrained environments. We propose a novel
unstructured pruning framework tailored for Mamba models that achieves up to
70\% parameter reduction while retaining over 95\% of the original performance.
Our approach integrates three key innovations: (1) a gradient-aware magnitude
pruning technique that combines weight magnitude and gradient information to
identify less critical parameters, (2) an iterative pruning schedule that
gradually increases sparsity to maintain model stability, and (3) a global
pruning strategy that optimizes parameter allocation across the entire model.
Through extensive experiments on WikiText-103, Long Range Arena, and ETT
time-series benchmarks, we demonstrate significant efficiency gains with
minimal performance degradation. Our analysis of pruning effects on Mamba's
components reveals critical insights into the architecture's redundancy and
robustness, enabling practical deployment in resource-constrained settings
while broadening Mamba's applicability.

Motivation: 探索多轮SGD在SCO模型中的样本外性能，填补对实践中广泛使用的多轮SGD理解的空白。

Method: 分析多轮SGD在非光滑SCO中的表现，包括步长选择和轮次对性能的影响。

Result: 多轮SGD在非光滑情况下可能导致显著的过拟合，性能下降至Ω(1)；结果揭示了平滑与非平滑情况的性能差异。

Conclusion: 多轮SGD在非光滑SCO中需谨慎使用，步长和轮次选择对避免过拟合至关重要。

Abstract: We study the out-of-sample performance of multi-pass stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) in the fundamental stochastic convex optimization (SCO) model.
While one-pass SGD is known to achieve an optimal $\Theta(1/\sqrt{n})$ excess
population loss given a sample of size $n$, much less is understood about the
multi-pass version of the algorithm which is widely used in practice. Somewhat
surprisingly, we show that in the general non-smooth case of SCO, just a few
epochs of SGD can already hurt its out-of-sample performance significantly and
lead to overfitting. In particular, using a step size $\eta =
\Theta(1/\sqrt{n})$, which gives the optimal rate after one pass, can lead to
population loss as large as $\Omega(1)$ after just one additional pass. More
generally, we show that the population loss from the second pass onward is of
the order $\Theta(1/(\eta T) + \eta \sqrt{T})$, where $T$ is the total number
of steps. These results reveal a certain phase-transition in the out-of-sample
behavior of SGD after the first epoch, as well as a sharp separation between
the rates of overfitting in the smooth and non-smooth cases of SCO.
Additionally, we extend our results to with-replacement SGD, proving that the
same asymptotic bounds hold after $O(n \log n)$ steps. Finally, we also prove a
lower bound of $\Omega(\eta \sqrt{n})$ on the generalization gap of one-pass
SGD in dimension $d = \smash{\widetilde O}(n)$, improving on recent results of
Koren et al.(2022) and Schliserman et al.(2024).

Conclusion: SpecSphere证明了高表达性、异质适应性和可证明鲁棒性可以在单一可扩展架构中共存。

Abstract: We introduce SpecSphere, the first dual-pass spectral-spatial GNN that
certifies every prediction against both $\ell\_{0}$ edge flips and
$\ell\_{\infty}$ feature perturbations, adapts to the full
homophily-heterophily spectrum, and surpasses the expressive power of
1-Weisfeiler-Lehman while retaining linear-time complexity. Our model couples a
Chebyshev-polynomial spectral branch with an attention-gated spatial branch and
fuses their representations through a lightweight MLP trained in a
cooperative-adversarial min-max game. We further establish (i) a uniform
Chebyshev approximation theorem, (ii) minimax-optimal risk across the
homophily-heterophily spectrum, (iii) closed-form robustness certificates, and
(iv) universal approximation strictly beyond 1-WL. SpecSphere achieves
state-of-the-art node-classification accuracy and delivers tighter certified
robustness guarantees on real-world benchmarks. These results demonstrate that
high expressivity, heterophily adaptation, and provable robustness can coexist
within a single, scalable architecture.

Conclusion: FedRS-Bench为大规模、真实的联邦学习研究提供了标准化测试平台，有望加速相关研究并促进公平比较。

Abstract: Remote sensing (RS) images are usually produced at an unprecedented scale,
yet they are geographically and institutionally distributed, making centralized
model training challenging due to data-sharing restrictions and privacy
concerns. Federated learning (FL) offers a solution by enabling collaborative
model training across decentralized RS data sources without exposing raw data.
However, there lacks a realistic federated dataset and benchmark in RS. Prior
works typically rely on manually partitioned single dataset, which fail to
capture the heterogeneity and scale of real-world RS data, and often use
inconsistent experimental setups, hindering fair comparison. To address this
gap, we propose a realistic federated RS dataset, termed FedRS. FedRS consists
of eight datasets that cover various sensors and resolutions and builds 135
clients, which is representative of realistic operational scenarios. Data for
each client come from the same source, exhibiting authentic federated
properties such as skewed label distributions, imbalanced client data volumes,
and domain heterogeneity across clients. These characteristics reflect
practical challenges in federated RS and support evaluation of FL methods at
scale. Based on FedRS, we implement 10 baseline FL algorithms and evaluation
metrics to construct the comprehensive FedRS-Bench. The experimental results
demonstrate that FL can consistently improve model performance over training on
isolated data silos, while revealing performance trade-offs of different
methods under varying client heterogeneity and availability conditions. We hope
FedRS-Bench will accelerate research on large-scale, realistic FL in RS by
providing a standardized, rich testbed and facilitating fair comparisons across
future works. The source codes and dataset are available at
https://fedrs-bench.github.io/.

Motivation: 大预训练模型在持续学习中表现优异，但其高计算成本限制了实际应用，尤其是在需要低延迟或高能效的场景。

Method: 提出了基于剪枝和知识蒸馏的两种高效框架，分别针对类增量学习（CIL）的不同阶段进行优化。

Result: 实验表明，两种框架在多个CIL基准测试中均优于基线方法，实现了精度与推理复杂度的更好平衡。

Conclusion: 论文通过分析两种框架的权衡，为不同场景下的应用提供了指导。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to train models that can learn a sequence of
tasks without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. A core challenge in CL
is balancing stability -- preserving performance on old tasks -- and plasticity
-- adapting to new ones. Recently, large pre-trained models have been widely
adopted in CL for their ability to support both, offering strong generalization
for new tasks and resilience against forgetting. However, their high
computational cost at inference time limits their practicality in real-world
applications, especially those requiring low latency or energy efficiency. To
address this issue, we explore model compression techniques, including pruning
and knowledge distillation (KD), and propose two efficient frameworks tailored
for class-incremental learning (CIL), a challenging CL setting where task
identities are unavailable during inference. The pruning-based framework
includes pre- and post-pruning strategies that apply compression at different
training stages. The KD-based framework adopts a teacher-student architecture,
where a large pre-trained teacher transfers downstream-relevant knowledge to a

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态图中异常边检测的挑战在于缺乏结构-时间耦合信息，现有方法忽视了两者的深层交互。

Method: 结合结构和时间特征，采用动态图变换器模型，通过二维位置编码捕捉区分性和上下文一致性信号。

Result: 在六个数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于当前最先进模型。

Conclusion: 该方法在真实任务中表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Detecting anomalous edges in dynamic graphs is an important task in many
applications over evolving triple-based data, such as social networks,
transaction management, and epidemiology. A major challenge with this task is
the absence of structural-temporal coupling information, which decreases the
ability of the representation to distinguish anomalies from normal instances.
Existing methods focus on handling independent structural and temporal features
with embedding models, which ignore the deep interaction between these two
types of information. In this paper, we propose a structural-temporal coupling
anomaly detection architecture with a dynamic graph transformer model.
Specifically, we introduce structural and temporal features from two
integration levels to provide anomaly-aware graph evolutionary patterns. Then,
a dynamic graph transformer enhanced by two-dimensional positional encoding is
implemented to capture both discrimination and contextual consistency signals.
Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
current state-of-the-art models. Finally, a case study illustrates the strength
of our method when applied to a real-world task.

Motivation: 探索基于强化学习的HVAC控制在减少建筑能耗的同时保持室内热舒适性的潜力，并评估其在不同气候背景下的效果及对城市气候的影响。

Method: 结合强化学习与城市气候模型，构建建筑能耗模型，评估RL策略在不同城市的效能、对室内及城市气候的影响，以及策略的可转移性。

Result: 研究发现，奖励（能耗与热舒适的加权组合）及RL策略对室内和城市气候的影响因城市气候背景而异；热气候城市在多数权重配置下表现更优，气温变化大的城市策略可转移性更强。

Conclusion: 强调在不同气候背景下全面评估RL策略的重要性，并提出城市间学习可能有助于RL-based HVAC控制的部署。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based heating, ventilation, and air conditioning
(HVAC) control has emerged as a promising technology for reducing building
energy consumption while maintaining indoor thermal comfort. However, the
efficacy of such strategies is influenced by the background climate and their
implementation may potentially alter both the indoor climate and local urban
climate. This study proposes an integrated framework combining RL with an urban
climate model that incorporates a building energy model, aiming to evaluate the
efficacy of RL-based HVAC control across different background climates, impacts
of RL strategies on indoor climate and local urban climate, and the
transferability of RL strategies across cities. Our findings reveal that the
reward (defined as a weighted combination of energy consumption and thermal
comfort) and the impacts of RL strategies on indoor climate and local urban
climate exhibit marked variability across cities with different background
climates. The sensitivity of reward weights and the transferability of RL
strategies are also strongly influenced by the background climate. Cities in
hot climates tend to achieve higher rewards across most reward weight
configurations that balance energy consumption and thermal comfort, and those
cities with more varying atmospheric temperatures demonstrate greater RL
strategy transferability. These findings underscore the importance of
thoroughly evaluating RL-based HVAC control strategies in diverse climatic
contexts. This study also provides a new insight that city-to-city learning
will potentially aid the deployment of RL-based HVAC control.

Result: 发现数据工程技术可以显著操纵特征重要性，甚至被用于掩盖模型中的歧视问题。

Conclusion: 数据工程技术对解释方法的敏感性可能被恶意利用，需警惕其潜在风险。

Abstract: Local feature-based explanations are a key component of the XAI toolkit.
These explanations compute feature importance values relative to an
``interpretable'' feature representation. In tabular data, feature values
themselves are often considered interpretable. This paper examines the impact
of data engineering choices on local feature-based explanations. We demonstrate
that simple, common data engineering techniques, such as representing age with
a histogram or encoding race in a specific way, can manipulate feature
importance as determined by popular methods like SHAP. Notably, the sensitivity
of explanations to feature representation can be exploited by adversaries to
obscure issues like discrimination. While the intuition behind these results is
straightforward, their systematic exploration has been lacking. Previous work
has focused on adversarial attacks on feature-based explainers by biasing data
or manipulating models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
demonstrating that explainers can be misled by standard, seemingly innocuous
data engineering techniques.

Result: 即使在数据集较小的情况下，该方法仍能高精度估计冲击位置。

Conclusion: 基于GRU的神经网络方法在冲击定位任务中表现出色，且物理数据训练有助于缩小现实差距。

Abstract: Today, machine learning is ubiquitous, and structural health monitoring (SHM)
is no exception. Specifically, we address the problem of impact localization on
shell-like structures, where knowledge of impact locations aids in assessing
structural integrity. Impacts on thin-walled structures excite Lamb waves,
which can be measured with piezoelectric sensors. Their dispersive
characteristics make it difficult to detect and localize impacts by
conventional methods. In the present contribution, we explore the localization
of impacts using neural networks. In particular, we propose to use {recurrent
neural networks} (RNNs) to estimate impact positions end-to-end, i.e., directly
from {sequential sensor data}. We deal with comparatively long sequences of
thousands of samples, since high sampling rate are needed to accurately capture
elastic waves. For this reason, the proposed approach builds upon Gated
Recurrent Units (GRUs), which are less prone to vanishing gradients as compared
to conventional RNNs. Quality and quantity of data are crucial when training
neural networks. Often, synthetic data is used, which inevitably introduces a
reality gap. Here, by contrast, we train our networks using {physical data from
experiments}, which requires automation to handle the large number of
experiments needed. For this purpose, a {robot is used to drop steel balls}
onto an {aluminum plate} equipped with {piezoceramic sensors}. Our results show
remarkable accuracy in estimating impact positions, even with a comparatively
small dataset.

Conclusion: 新方法无需强分布假设，能公平比较不同类型变量的因果方向，效果显著。

Abstract: This paper proposes a causal discovery method for mixed bivariate data
consisting of one continuous and one discrete variable. Existing
constraint-based approaches are ineffective in the bivariate setting, as they
rely on conditional independence tests that are not suited to bivariate data.
Score-based methods either impose strong distributional assumptions or face
challenges in fairly comparing causal directions between variables of different
types, due to differences in their information content. We introduce a novel
approach that determines causal direction by analyzing the monotonicity of the
conditional density ratio of the continuous variable, conditioned on different
values of the discrete variable. Our theoretical analysis shows that the
conditional density ratio exhibits monotonicity when the continuous variable
causes the discrete variable, but not in the reverse direction. This property
provides a principled basis for comparing causal directions between variables
of different types, free from strong distributional assumptions and bias
arising from differences in their information content. We demonstrate its
effectiveness through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets,
showing superior accuracy compared to existing methods.

posterior approximation accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency and

for simulation-based inference, particularly suitable for parameter inference
workflows requiring fast inference methods.

Method: 评估Chroma和Faiss向量库、分块策略、交叉编码器重排序及温度等超参数，使用六项指标衡量性能。

Result: Chroma查询更快，Faiss检索精度更高；固定长度分块表现最佳；重排序提升质量但增加延迟。优化配置实现99%上下文精度。

Conclusion: RAG系统可通过超参数调优平衡计算成本与精度，适用于对检索质量敏感的领域如医疗临床决策。

Abstract: Large language models achieve high task performance yet often hallucinate or
rely on outdated knowledge. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses
these gaps by coupling generation with external search. We analyse how
hyperparameters influence speed and quality in RAG systems, covering Chroma and
Faiss vector stores, chunking policies, cross-encoder re-ranking, and
temperature, and we evaluate six metrics: faithfulness, answer correctness,
answer relevancy, context precision, context recall, and answer similarity.
Chroma processes queries 13% faster, whereas Faiss yields higher retrieval
precision, revealing a clear speed-accuracy trade-off. Naive fixed-length
chunking with small windows and minimal overlap outperforms semantic
segmentation while remaining the quickest option. Re-ranking provides modest
gains in retrieval quality yet increases runtime by roughly a factor of 5, so
its usefulness depends on latency constraints. These results help practitioners
balance computational cost and accuracy when tuning RAG systems for
transparent, up-to-date responses. Finally, we re-evaluate the top
configurations with a corrective RAG workflow and show that their advantages
persist when the model can iteratively request additional evidence. We obtain a
near-perfect context precision (99%), which demonstrates that RAG systems can
achieve extremely high retrieval accuracy with the right combination of
hyperparameters, with significant implications for applications where retrieval
quality directly impacts downstream task performance, such as clinical decision
support in healthcare.

Result: ASADG在生成相同数量数据时，比LHS方法更能准确表示响应流形。

Conclusion: ASADG算法能有效提升替代模型的预测准确性，适用于高维物理问题。

Abstract: Physical models classically involved Partial Differential equations (PDE) and
depending of their underlying complexity and the level of accuracy required,
and known to be computationally expensive to numerically solve them. Thus, an
idea would be to create a surrogate model relying on data generated by such
solver. However, training such a model on an imbalanced data have been shown to
be a very difficult task. Indeed, if the distribution of input leads to a poor
response manifold representation, the model may not learn well and
consequently, it may not predict the outcome with acceptable accuracy. In this
work, we present an Adaptive Sampling Algorithm for Data Generation (ASADG)
involving a physical model. As the initial input data may not accurately
represent the response manifold in higher dimension, this algorithm iteratively
adds input data into it. At each step the barycenter of each simplicial
complex, that the manifold is discretized into, is added as new input data, if
a certain threshold is satisfied. We demonstrate the efficiency of the data
sampling algorithm in comparison with LHS method for generating more
representative input data. To do so, we focus on the construction of a harmonic
transport problem metamodel by generating data through a classical solver. By
using such algorithm, it is possible to generate the same number of input data
as LHS while providing a better representation of the response manifold.

Conclusion: 本文为HST在新颖性检测中的应用提供了理论基础，证明了其高效性和可解释性，为后续研究和应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Data mining offers a diverse toolbox for extracting meaningful structures
from complex datasets, with anomaly detection emerging as a critical subfield
particularly in the context of streaming or real-time data. Within anomaly
detection, novelty detection focuses on identifying previously unseen patterns
after training solely on regular data. While classic algorithms such as
One-Class SVM or Local Outlier Factor (LOF) have been widely applied, they
often lack interpretability and scalability. In this work, we explore the
Half-Space Tree (HST) algorithm, originally proposed for streaming anomaly
detection, and propose a novel theoretical modification to adapt it
specifically for novelty detection tasks. Our approach is grounded in the idea
that anomalies i.e., novelties tend to appear in the higher leaves of the tree,
which are less frequently visited by regular instances. We analytically
demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using probabilistic analysis,
expected depth (EXD) calculations, and combinatorial reasoning. A comparative
analysis of expected depths between our modified HST and the original Isolation
Forest highlights that novelty points are significantly more isolated in our
approach. This supports the hypothesis that HSTs, with appropriate structural
adaptation, can serve as interpretable and efficient novelty detectors. The
paper contributes a theoretical foundation and supporting analysis for this
adaptation, setting the stage for further application and experimentation.

Conclusion: InfoPO是一种高效且不依赖BT模型的偏好优化方法，显著提升了语言模型在推理任务中的性能。

Abstract: We study the post-training of large language models (LLMs) with human
preference data. Recently, direct preference optimization and its variants have
shown considerable promise in aligning language models, eliminating the need
for reward models and online sampling. Despite these benefits, these methods
rely on explicit assumptions about the Bradley-Terry (BT) model, which makes
them prone to overfitting and results in suboptimal performance, particularly
on reasoning-heavy tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a principled
preference fine-tuning algorithm called InfoPO, which effectively and
efficiently aligns large language models using preference data. InfoPO
eliminates the reliance on the BT model and prevents the likelihood of the
chosen response from decreasing. Extensive experiments confirm that InfoPO
consistently outperforms established baselines on widely used open benchmarks,
particularly in reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: AGF通过图信号处理视角改进了自注意力机制，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse domains.
The key component of Transformers is self-attention, which learns the
relationship between any two tokens in the input sequence. Recent studies have
revealed that the self-attention can be understood as a normalized adjacency
matrix of a graph. Notably, from the perspective of graph signal processing
(GSP), the self-attention can be equivalently defined as a simple graph filter,
applying GSP using the value vector as the signal. However, the self-attention
is a graph filter defined with only the first order of the polynomial matrix,
and acts as a low-pass filter preventing the effective leverage of various
frequency information. Consequently, existing self-attention mechanisms are
designed in a rather simplified manner. Therefore, we propose a novel method,
called \underline{\textbf{A}}ttentive \underline{\textbf{G}}raph
\underline{\textbf{F}}ilter (AGF), interpreting the self-attention as learning
the graph filter in the singular value domain from the perspective of graph
signal processing for directed graphs with the linear complexity w.r.t. the
input length $n$, i.e., $\mathcal{O}(nd^2)$. In our experiments, we demonstrate
that AGF achieves state-of-the-art performance on various tasks, including Long

Result: 实验表明，GradMix在多个真实数据集上优于基线方法，显著减少遗忘。

Conclusion: GradMix通过选择性混合策略有效缓解灾难性遗忘，提升持续学习性能。

Abstract: In the context of continual learning, acquiring new knowledge while
maintaining previous knowledge presents a significant challenge. Existing
methods often use experience replay techniques that store a small portion of
previous task data for training. In experience replay approaches, data
augmentation has emerged as a promising strategy to further improve the model
performance by mixing limited previous task data with sufficient current task
data. However, we theoretically and empirically analyze that training with
mixed samples from random sample pairs may harm the knowledge of previous tasks
and cause greater catastrophic forgetting. We then propose GradMix, a robust
data augmentation method specifically designed for mitigating catastrophic
forgetting in class-incremental learning. GradMix performs gradient-based
selective mixup using a class-based criterion that mixes only samples from
helpful class pairs and not from detrimental class pairs for reducing
catastrophic forgetting. Our experiments on various real datasets show that
GradMix outperforms data augmentation baselines in accuracy by minimizing the
forgetting of previous knowledge.

Abstract: Our planet is facing increasingly frequent extreme events, which pose major
risks to human lives and ecosystems. Recent advances in machine learning (ML),
especially with foundation models (FMs) trained on extensive datasets, excel in
extracting features and show promise in disaster management. Nevertheless,
these models often inherit biases from training data, challenging their
performance over extreme values. To explore the reliability of FM in the
context of extreme events, we introduce \textbf{ExE}Bench (\textbf{Ex}treme
\textbf{E}arth Benchmark), a collection of seven extreme event categories
across floods, wildfires, storms, tropical cyclones, extreme precipitation,
heatwaves, and cold waves. The dataset features global coverage, varying data
volumes, and diverse data sources with different spatial, temporal, and
spectral characteristics. To broaden the real-world impact of FMs, we include
multiple challenging ML tasks that are closely aligned with operational needs
in extreme events detection, monitoring, and forecasting. ExEBench aims to (1)
assess FM generalizability across diverse, high-impact tasks and domains, (2)
promote the development of novel ML methods that benefit disaster management,
and (3) offer a platform for analyzing the interactions and cascading effects
of extreme events to advance our understanding of Earth system, especially
under the climate change expected in the decades to come. The dataset and code

Abstract: This paper presents $\mathbf{OLinear}$, a $\mathbf{linear}$-based
multivariate time series forecasting model that operates in an
$\mathbf{o}$rthogonally transformed domain. Recent forecasting models typically
adopt the temporal forecast (TF) paradigm, which directly encode and decode
time series in the time domain. However, the entangled step-wise dependencies
in series data can hinder the performance of TF. To address this, some
forecasters conduct encoding and decoding in the transformed domain using
fixed, dataset-independent bases (e.g., sine and cosine signals in the Fourier
transform). In contrast, we utilize $\mathbf{OrthoTrans}$, a data-adaptive
transformation based on an orthogonal matrix that diagonalizes the series'
temporal Pearson correlation matrix. This approach enables more effective
encoding and decoding in the decorrelated feature domain and can serve as a
plug-in module to enhance existing forecasters. To enhance the representation
learning for multivariate time series, we introduce a customized linear layer,
$\mathbf{NormLin}$, which employs a normalized weight matrix to capture
multivariate dependencies. Empirically, the NormLin module shows a surprising
performance advantage over multi-head self-attention, while requiring nearly
half the FLOPs. Extensive experiments on 24 benchmarks and 140 forecasting
tasks demonstrate that OLinear consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance with high efficiency. Notably, as a plug-in replacement for
self-attention, the NormLin module consistently enhances Transformer-based
forecasters. The code and datasets are available at

Conclusion: 在线学习-遗忘问题可通过所提算法高效解决，同时保持竞争性遗憾边界。

Abstract: We formalize the problem of online learning-unlearning, where a model is
updated sequentially in an online setting while accommodating unlearning
requests between updates. After a data point is unlearned, all subsequent
outputs must be statistically indistinguishable from those of a model trained
without that point. We present two online learner-unlearner (OLU) algorithms,
both built upon online gradient descent (OGD). The first, passive OLU,
leverages OGD's contractive property and injects noise when unlearning occurs,
incurring no additional computation. The second, active OLU, uses an offline
unlearning algorithm that shifts the model toward a solution excluding the
deleted data. Under standard convexity and smoothness assumptions, both methods
achieve regret bounds comparable to those of standard OGD, demonstrating that
one can maintain competitive regret bounds while providing unlearning
guarantees.

Motivation: 法律框架要求数据遗忘权，机器遗忘成为解决方案，但现有方法在多样场景中表现不一致，评估标准不全面。

Method: MUBox平台整合23种遗忘技术，测试六种场景和11种指标，支持方法比较和评估研究。

Result: 发现现有方法在复杂场景中效果不一致，评估需多指标，去毒方法效果因攻击类型而异。

Conclusion: MUBox为遗忘方法评估提供统一框架，强调多指标评估和复杂场景测试的重要性。

Abstract: Recent legal frameworks have mandated the right to be forgotten, obligating
the removal of specific data upon user requests. Machine Unlearning has emerged
as a promising solution by selectively removing learned information from
machine learning models. This paper presents MUBox, a comprehensive platform
designed to evaluate unlearning methods in deep learning. MUBox integrates 23
advanced unlearning techniques, tested across six practical scenarios with 11
diverse evaluation metrics. It allows researchers and practitioners to (1)
assess and compare the effectiveness of different machine unlearning methods
across various scenarios; (2) examine the impact of current evaluation metrics
on unlearning performance; and (3) conduct detailed comparative studies on
machine unlearning in a unified framework. Leveraging MUBox, we systematically
evaluate these unlearning methods in deep learning and uncover several key
insights: (a) Even state-of-the-art unlearning methods, including those
published in top-tier venues and winners of unlearning competitions,
demonstrate inconsistent effectiveness across diverse scenarios. Prior research
has predominantly focused on simplified settings, such as random forgetting and
class-wise unlearning, highlighting the need for broader evaluations across
more difficult unlearning tasks. (b) Assessing unlearning performance remains a
non-trivial problem, as no single evaluation metric can comprehensively capture
the effectiveness, efficiency, and preservation of model utility. Our findings
emphasize the necessity of employing multiple metrics to achieve a balanced and
holistic assessment of unlearning methods. (c) In the context of depoisoning,
our evaluation reveals significant variability in the effectiveness of existing
approaches, which is highly dependent on the specific type of poisoning
attacks.

Result: 数值实验验证了该方法在真实金融数据聚类中的高效性。

Conclusion: 该方法在数据不完整和重尾分布情况下表现优异，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: There are various approaches to graph learning for data clustering,
incorporating different spectral and structural constraints through diverse
graph structures. Some methods rely on bipartite graph models, where nodes are
divided into two classes: centers and members. These models typically require
access to data for the center nodes in addition to observations from the member
nodes. However, such additional data may not always be available in many
practical scenarios. Moreover, popular Gaussian models for graph learning have
demonstrated limited effectiveness in modeling data with heavy-tailed
distributions, which are common in financial markets. In this paper, we propose
a clustering method based on a bipartite graph model that addresses these
challenges. First, it can infer clusters from incomplete data without requiring
information about the center nodes. Second, it is designed to effectively
handle heavy-tailed data. Numerical experiments using real financial data
validate the efficiency of the proposed method for data clustering.

Result: 在多个模拟环境中表现优于两种先进算法，学习更快且样本需求更少。

Conclusion: 该方法在连续空间中高效推断成本函数，具有更好的灵活性和性能。

Abstract: We present an iterative inverse reinforcement learning algorithm to infer
optimal cost functions in continuous spaces. Based on a popular maximum entropy
criteria, our approach iteratively finds a weight improvement step and proposes
a method to find an appropriate step size that ensures learned cost function
features remain similar to the demonstrated trajectory features. In contrast to
similar approaches, our algorithm can individually tune the effectiveness of
each observation for the partition function and does not need a large sample
set, enabling faster learning. We generate sample trajectories by solving an
optimal control problem instead of random sampling, leading to more informative
trajectories. The performance of our method is compared to two state of the art
algorithms to demonstrate its benefits in several simulated environments.

Result: 在多种稀疏奖励场景中，ISA显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: ISA有效解决了稀疏奖励MARL中的信用分配和探索问题，具有显著性能优势。

Abstract: Training cooperative agents in sparse-reward scenarios poses significant
challenges for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Without clear
feedback on actions at each step in sparse-reward setting, previous methods
struggle with precise credit assignment among agents and effective exploration.
In this paper, we introduce a novel method to deal with both credit assignment
and exploration problems in reward-sparse domains. Accordingly, we propose an
algorithm that calculates the Influence Scope of Agents (ISA) on states by
taking specific value of the dimensions/attributes of states that can be
influenced by individual agents. The mutual dependence between agents' actions
and state attributes are then used to calculate the credit assignment and to
delimit the exploration space for each individual agent. We then evaluate ISA
in a variety of sparse-reward multi-agent scenarios. The results show that our
method significantly outperforms the state-of-art baselines.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables distributed machine learning training while
preserving privacy, representing a paradigm shift for data-sensitive and
decentralized environments. Despite its rapid advancements, FL remains a
complex and multifaceted field, requiring a structured understanding of its
methodologies, challenges, and applications. In this survey, we introduce a
meta-framework perspective, conceptualising FL as a composition of modular
components that systematically address core aspects such as communication,
optimisation, security, and privacy. We provide a historical contextualisation
of FL, tracing its evolution from distributed optimisation to modern
distributed learning paradigms. Additionally, we propose a novel taxonomy
distinguishing Aggregation from Alignment, introducing the concept of alignment
as a fundamental operator alongside aggregation. To bridge theory with
practice, we explore available FL frameworks in Python, facilitating real-world
implementation. Finally, we systematise key challenges across FL sub-fields,
providing insights into open research questions throughout the meta-framework
modules. By structuring FL within a meta-framework of modular components and
emphasising the dual role of Aggregation and Alignment, this survey provides a
holistic and adaptable foundation for understanding and advancing FL research
and deployment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的Chebyshev1KANs架构AC-PKAN，通过引入小波激活的MLP和注意力机制，解决了原方法的秩崩溃问题，并在多个基准任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始的Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) 在解决偏微分方程时计算和内存消耗大，而改进的Chebyshev1KANs仍存在秩崩溃问题，限制了其表达能力。

Method: 通过集成小波激活的MLP和内部注意力机制，设计了一种新架构AC-PKAN，并引入外部残差梯度注意力机制（RGA）动态调整损失项权重。

Result: AC-PKAN在九个基准任务中表现优于或匹配现有最佳模型（如PINNsFormer），证明了其解决复杂工程问题的能力。

Conclusion: AC-PKAN显著提升了弱监督物理信息神经网络（PINNs）的表达能力，适用于零数据或数据稀疏场景。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently shown promise for solving
partial differential equations (PDEs). Yet their original formulation is
computationally and memory intensive, motivating the introduction of Chebyshev
Type-I-based KANs (Chebyshev1KANs). Although Chebyshev1KANs have outperformed
the vanilla KANs architecture, our rigorous theoretical analysis reveals that
they still suffer from rank collapse, ultimately limiting their expressive
capacity. To overcome these limitations, we enhance Chebyshev1KANs by
integrating wavelet-activated MLPs with learnable parameters and an internal
attention mechanism. We prove that this design preserves a full-rank Jacobian
and is capable of approximating solutions to PDEs of arbitrary order.
Furthermore, to alleviate the loss instability and imbalance introduced by the
Chebyshev polynomial basis, we externally incorporate a Residual Gradient
Attention (RGA) mechanism that dynamically re-weights individual loss terms
according to their gradient norms and residual magnitudes. By jointly
leveraging internal and external attention, we present AC-PKAN, a novel
architecture that constitutes an enhancement to weakly supervised
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and extends the expressive power of
KANs. Experimental results from nine benchmark tasks across three domains show
that AC-PKAN consistently outperforms or matches state-of-the-art models such
as PINNsFormer, establishing it as a highly effective tool for solving complex
real-world engineering problems in zero-data or data-sparse regimes. The code
will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决云服务器上大型语言模型（LLMs）的隐私和带宽问题，以及本地小型语言模型（SLMs）性能不足的挑战。

Method: 使用稀疏隐私感知门控网络动态路由数据，引入负载均衡机制和带宽自适应令牌卸载方案。

Result: 实验表明PWC-MoE在保护隐私的同时保持高性能，适用于带宽受限和隐私敏感场景。

Conclusion: PWC-MoE为隐私敏感和带宽受限环境中的LLM部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hosted on cloud servers alleviate the
computational and storage burdens on local devices but raise privacy concerns
due to sensitive data transmission and require substantial communication
bandwidth, which is challenging in constrained environments. In contrast, small
language models (SLMs) running locally enhance privacy but suffer from limited
performance on complex tasks. To balance computational cost, performance, and
privacy protection under bandwidth constraints, we propose a privacy-aware
wireless collaborative mixture of experts (PWC-MoE) framework. Specifically,
PWC-MoE employs a sparse privacy-aware gating network to dynamically route
sensitive tokens to privacy experts located on local clients, while
non-sensitive tokens are routed to non-privacy experts located at the remote
base station. To achieve computational efficiency, the gating network ensures
that each token is dynamically routed to and processed by only one expert. To
enhance scalability and prevent overloading of specific experts, we introduce a
group-wise load-balancing mechanism for the gating network that evenly
distributes sensitive tokens among privacy experts and non-sensitive tokens
among non-privacy experts. To adapt to bandwidth constraints while preserving
model performance, we propose a bandwidth-adaptive and importance-aware token
offloading scheme. This scheme incorporates an importance predictor to evaluate
the importance scores of non-sensitive tokens, prioritizing the most important
tokens for transmission to the base station based on their predicted importance
and the available bandwidth. Experiments demonstrate that the PWC-MoE framework
effectively preserves privacy and maintains high performance even in
bandwidth-constrained environments, offering a practical solution for deploying
LLMs in privacy-sensitive and bandwidth-limited scenarios.

*Fangyuan Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于信息瓶颈理论的语言建模目标（IBLM），并通过实验观察到预训练中的记忆-压缩循环，进而设计了GAPT算法来优化模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是通过压缩内部表示来提升模型的泛化能力，同时探索语言建模中的记忆与压缩动态。

Method: 方法包括引入IBLM目标，提出GAPT算法，并在GPT-2预训练中验证其效果。

Result: 实验结果显示，GAPT降低了表示熵（MBE）50%，提升了交叉熵4.8%，并在OOD任务中泛化能力提升35%。

Conclusion: 结论表明，GAPT通过模拟生物睡眠巩固机制，有效优化了模型的记忆与压缩平衡，提升了泛化能力。

Abstract: We prove theoretically that generalization improves not only through data
scaling but also by compressing internal representations. To operationalize
this insight, we introduce the Information Bottleneck Language Modeling (IBLM)
objective, which reframes language modeling as a constrained optimization
problem: minimizing representation entropy subject to optimal prediction
performance. Empirically, we observe an emergent memorization-compression cycle
during LLM pretraining, evidenced by oscillation positive/negative gradient
alignment between cross-entropy and Matrix-Based Entropy (MBE), a measure of
representation entropy. This pattern closely mirrors the predictive-compressive
trade-off prescribed by IBLM and also parallels the biological alternation
between awake learning and sleep consolidation. Motivated by this observation,
we propose Gated Phase Transition (GAPT), a training algorithm that adaptively
switches between memorization and compression phases. When applied to GPT-2
pretraining on FineWeb dataset, GAPT reduces MBE by 50% and improves
cross-entropy by 4.8%. GAPT improves OOD generalizatino by 35% in a pretraining
task on arithmetic multiplication. In a setting designed to simulate
catastrophic forgetting, GAPT reduces interference by compressing and
separating representations, achieving a 97% improvement in separation -
paralleling the functional role of sleep consolidation.

Result: 在TSP、CVRP和FFSP等基准测试中，该方法显著优于现有强化学习算法，收敛效率和解决方案质量均有提升。

Conclusion: Preference Optimization方法有效解决了强化学习在组合优化中的关键问题，表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful tool for neural
combinatorial optimization, enabling models to learn heuristics that solve
complex problems without requiring expert knowledge. Despite significant
progress, existing RL approaches face challenges such as diminishing reward
signals and inefficient exploration in vast combinatorial action spaces,
leading to inefficiency. In this paper, we propose Preference Optimization, a
novel method that transforms quantitative reward signals into qualitative
preference signals via statistical comparison modeling, emphasizing the
superiority among sampled solutions. Methodologically, by reparameterizing the
reward function in terms of policy and utilizing preference models, we
formulate an entropy-regularized RL objective that aligns the policy directly
with preferences while avoiding intractable computations. Furthermore, we
integrate local search techniques into the fine-tuning rather than
post-processing to generate high-quality preference pairs, helping the policy
escape local optima. Empirical results on various benchmarks, such as the
Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem
(CVRP) and the Flexible Flow Shop Problem (FFSP), demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms existing RL algorithms, achieving superior
convergence efficiency and solution quality.

Abstract: We present a (proto) Foundation Model for Nuclear Physics, capable of
operating on low-level detector inputs from Imaging Cherenkov Detectors at the
future Electron Ion Collider. To address limitations in existing next-token
prediction approaches-namely resolution loss from VQ-VAE tokenization and lack
of conditional generation-we propose three key innovations: (i) separate
vocabularies for discrete spatial features and continuous variates, combined
via Causal Multi-Head Cross-Attention (CMHCA), (ii) continuous kinematic
conditioning through prepended context embeddings, and (iii) scalable and
simple, high-resolution continuous variate tokenization without joint
vocabulary inflation. Our model enables fast, high-fidelity generation of pixel

the High Performance DIRC. We also show our model generalizes to reconstruction
tasks such as pion and kaon identification, in which we show its ability to
leverage fine-tuning.

Conclusion: SC-FNO在多种微分方程和神经算子中具有普适性，性能提升显著且训练时间增加有限。

Abstract: Parametric differential equations of the form du/dt = f(u, x, t, p) are
fundamental in science and engineering. While deep learning frameworks such as
the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) can efficiently approximate solutions, they
struggle with inverse problems, sensitivity estimation (du/dp), and concept
drift. We address these limitations by introducing a sensitivity-based
regularization strategy, called Sensitivity-Constrained Fourier Neural
Operators (SC-FNO). SC-FNO achieves high accuracy in predicting solution paths
and consistently outperforms standard FNO and FNO with physics-informed
regularization. It improves performance in parameter inversion tasks, scales to
high-dimensional parameter spaces (tested with up to 82 parameters), and
reduces both data and training requirements. These gains are achieved with a
modest increase in training time (30% to 130% per epoch) and generalize across
various types of differential equations and neural operators. Code and selected
experiments are available at: https://github.com/AMBehroozi/SC_Neural_Operators

significantly contribute to the model's predictions, providing enhanced
interpretability beyond traditional feature-attribution methods. Based on it,

Conclusion: SPAT证明了保留最有效注意力机制的重要性，为高效模型设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Attention-based architectures have achieved superior performance in
multivariate time series forecasting but are computationally expensive.
Techniques such as patching and adaptive masking have been developed to reduce
their sizes and latencies. In this work, we propose a structured pruning
method, SPAT ($\textbf{S}$ensitivity $\textbf{P}$runer for
$\textbf{At}$tention), which selectively removes redundant attention mechanisms
and yields highly effective models. Different from previous approaches, SPAT
aims to remove the entire attention module, which reduces the risk of
overfitting and enables speed-up without demanding specialized hardware. We
propose a dynamic sensitivity metric, $\textbf{S}$ensitivity
$\textbf{E}$nhanced $\textbf{N}$ormalized $\textbf{D}$ispersion (SEND) that
measures the importance of each attention module during the pre-training phase.
Experiments on multivariate datasets demonstrate that SPAT-pruned models
achieve reductions of 2.842% in MSE, 1.996% in MAE, and 35.274% in FLOPs.
Furthermore, SPAT-pruned models outperform existing lightweight, Mamba-based
and LLM-based SOTA methods in both standard and zero-shot inference,
highlighting the importance of retaining only the most effective attention
mechanisms. We have made our code publicly available

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) are fundamental to modeling physical

expensive, while neural-network-based solvers require large training datasets
and often lack interpretability. In this work, we frame PDE solving as a code

inference-time algorithms and scaling strategies, CodePDE unlocks critical
capacities of LLM for PDE solving: reasoning, debugging, selfrefinement, and
test-time scaling -- all without task-specific tuning. CodePDE achieves
superhuman performance across a range of representative PDE problems. We also
present a systematic empirical analysis of LLM generated solvers, analyzing
their accuracy, efficiency, and numerical scheme choices. Our findings
highlight the promise and the current limitations of LLMs in PDE solving,

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly expanding and integrating more into
daily life to automate tasks, guide decision making, and enhance efficiency.
However, complex AI models, which make decisions without providing clear
explanations (known as the "black-box problem"), currently restrict trust and
widespread adoption of AI. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has
emerged to address the black-box problem of making AI systems more
interpretable and transparent so stakeholders can trust, verify, and act upon
AI-based outcomes. Researchers have developed various techniques to foster XAI
in the Software Development Lifecycle. However, there are gaps in applying XAI
techniques in the Software Engineering phases. Literature review shows that 68%
of XAI in Software Engineering research is focused on maintenance as opposed to
8% on software management and requirements. In this paper, we present a
comprehensive survey of the applications of XAI methods such as concept-based
explanations, Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), SHapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP), rule extraction, attention mechanisms,
counterfactual explanations, and example-based explanations to the different
phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), including requirements
elicitation, design and development, testing and deployment, and evolution. To
the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first comprehensive survey
of XAI techniques for every phase of the Software Development Life Cycle
(SDLC). This survey aims to promote explainable AI in Software Engineering and
facilitate the practical application of complex AI models in AI-driven software
development.

TL;DR: SweRank是一个高效的检索-重排框架，用于软件问题定位，解决了传统方法的不足，并在性能上超越了现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件问题定位是开发中的关键但耗时的任务，现有方法（如基于LLM的代理方法）存在延迟和成本高的问题，而传统代码排名模型则难以处理冗长的问题描述。

Method: 提出SweRank框架，结合检索和重排技术，并使用新构建的大规模数据集SweLoc进行训练。

Result: 在SWE-Bench-Lite和LocBench上，SweRank表现优于现有排名模型和基于代理的系统。

Conclusion: SweRank和SweLoc为软件问题定位提供了高效且有效的解决方案，并可作为社区资源。

Abstract: Software issue localization, the task of identifying the precise code
locations (files, classes, or functions) relevant to a natural language issue
description (e.g., bug report, feature request), is a critical yet
time-consuming aspect of software development. While recent LLM-based agentic
approaches demonstrate promise, they often incur significant latency and cost
due to complex multi-step reasoning and relying on closed-source LLMs.
Alternatively, traditional code ranking models, typically optimized for
query-to-code or code-to-code retrieval, struggle with the verbose and
failure-descriptive nature of issue localization queries. To bridge this gap,
we introduce SweRank, an efficient and effective retrieve-and-rerank framework
for software issue localization. To facilitate training, we construct SweLoc, a
large-scale dataset curated from public GitHub repositories, featuring
real-world issue descriptions paired with corresponding code modifications.
Empirical results on SWE-Bench-Lite and LocBench show that SweRank achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming both prior ranking models and
costly agent-based systems using closed-source LLMs like Claude-3.5. Further,
we demonstrate SweLoc's utility in enhancing various existing retriever and
reranker models for issue localization, establishing the dataset as a valuable
resource for the community.

### [497] [Sub-diffraction terahertz backpropagation compressive imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07839)
*Yongsheng Zhu,Shaojing Liu,Ximiao Wang,Runli Li,Haili Yang,Jiali Wang,Hongjia Zhu,Yanlin Ke,Ningsheng Xu,Huanjun Chen,Shaozhi Deng*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于无训练神经网络的亚衍射太赫兹反向传播压缩成像技术，显著提高了成像分辨率并减少了采样时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 太赫兹单像素成像（TSPI）虽然简单且成本低，但其分辨率受限于波长，且传统亚波长分辨率方法需要苛刻的实验条件和耗时过程。

Method: 使用单色连续太赫兹波照射物体，通过硅片背面的光激发载流子调制透射波，并用单点探测器记录。利用无训练神经网络在物理模型约束下迭代重建图像，结合角谱传播理论抑制衍射效应。

Result: 实现了亚衍射成像，空间分辨率达λ0/7（λ0=833.3μm），无需超薄光调制器。

Conclusion: 该技术为太赫兹显微成像和其他逆成像问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Terahertz single-pixel imaging (TSPI) has garnered significant attention due
to its simplicity and cost-effectiveness. However, the relatively long
wavelength of THz waves limits sub-diffraction-scale imaging resolution.
Although TSPI technique can achieve sub-wavelength resolution, it requires
harsh experimental conditions and time-consuming processes. Here, we propose a
sub-diffraction THz backpropagation compressive imaging technique. We
illuminate the object with monochromatic continuous-wave THz radiation. The
transmitted THz wave is modulated by prearranged patterns generated on the back
surface of a 500-{\mu}m-thick silicon wafer, realized through photoexcited
carriers using a 532-nm laser. The modulated THz wave is then recorded by a
single-element detector. An untrained neural network is employed to iteratively
reconstruct the object image with an ultralow compression ratio of 1.5625%
under a physical model constraint, thus reducing the long sampling times. To
further suppress the diffraction-field effects, embedded with the angular
spectrum propagation (ASP) theory to model the diffraction of THz waves during
propagation, the network retrieves near-field information from the object,
enabling sub-diffraction imaging with a spatial resolution of ~{\lambda}0/7
({\lambda}0 = 833.3 {\mu}m at 0.36 THz) and eliminating the need for ultrathin
photomodulators. This approach provides an efficient solution for advancing THz
microscopic imaging and addressing other inverse imaging challenges.

### [498] [Pose Estimation for Intra-cardiac Echocardiography Catheter via AI-Based Anatomical Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07851)
*Jaeyoung Huh,Ankur Kapoor,Young-Ho Kim*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉Transformer的解剖感知姿态估计系统，用于仅通过ICE图像确定导管位置和方向，无需外部跟踪传感器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有导航方法依赖电磁跟踪或手动调整，易受干扰且依赖操作者经验，需改进。

Method: 使用ViT模型处理ICE图像，预测位置和方向，训练于851例临床数据。

Result: 平均位置误差9.48 mm，方向误差（16.13°, 8.98°, 10.47°），验证了模型准确性。

Conclusion: 该系统提高了手术效率，减少操作负担，支持无跟踪实时定位，可独立或补充现有系统。

Abstract: Intra-cardiac Echocardiography (ICE) plays a crucial role in
Electrophysiology (EP) and Structural Heart Disease (SHD) interventions by
providing high-resolution, real-time imaging of cardiac structures. However,
existing navigation methods rely on electromagnetic (EM) tracking, which is
susceptible to interference and position drift, or require manual adjustments
based on operator expertise. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
anatomy-aware pose estimation system that determines the ICE catheter position
and orientation solely from ICE images, eliminating the need for external
tracking sensors. Our approach leverages a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based deep
learning model, which captures spatial relationships between ICE images and
anatomical structures. The model is trained on a clinically acquired dataset of
851 subjects, including ICE images paired with position and orientation labels
normalized to the left atrium (LA) mesh. ICE images are patchified into 16x16
embeddings and processed through a transformer network, where a [CLS] token
independently predicts position and orientation via separate linear layers. The
model is optimized using a Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function, balancing
positional and orientational accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate an
average positional error of 9.48 mm and orientation errors of (16.13 deg, 8.98
deg, 10.47 deg) across x, y, and z axes, confirming the model accuracy.
Qualitative assessments further validate alignment between predicted and target
views within 3D cardiac meshes. This AI-driven system enhances procedural
efficiency, reduces operator workload, and enables real-time ICE catheter
localization for tracking-free procedures. The proposed method can function
independently or complement existing mapping systems like CARTO, offering a
transformative approach to ICE-guided interventions.

Abstract: The diffusion model has recently emerged as a potent approach in computer
vision, demonstrating remarkable performances in the field of generative
artificial intelligence. Capable of producing high-quality synthetic images,
diffusion models have been successfully applied across a range of applications.
However, a significant challenge remains with the high computational cost
associated with training and generating these models. This study focuses on the
efficiency and inference time of diffusion-based generative models,
highlighting their applications in both natural and medical imaging. We present
the most recent advances in diffusion models by categorizing them into three
key models: the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), the Latent
Diffusion Model (LDM), and the Wavelet Diffusion Model (WDM). These models play
a crucial role in medical imaging, where producing fast, reliable, and
high-quality medical images is essential for accurate analysis of abnormalities
and disease diagnosis. We first investigate the general framework of DDPM, LDM,
and WDM and discuss the computational complexity gap filled by these models in
natural and medical imaging. We then discuss the current limitations of these
models as well as the opportunities and future research directions in medical
imaging.

Abstract: Precision farming relies on accurate vegetation monitoring to enhance crop
productivity and promote sustainable agricultural practices. This study
presents a comprehensive evaluation of UAV-based imaging for vegetation health
assessment in a palm tree cultivation region in Dubai. By comparing
multispectral and RGB image data, we demonstrate that RGBbased vegetation
indices offer performance comparable to more expensive multispectral indices,
providing a cost-effective alternative for large-scale agricultural monitoring.
Using UAVs equipped with multispectral sensors, indices such as NDVI and SAVI
were computed to categorize vegetation into healthy, moderate, and stressed
conditions. Simultaneously, RGB-based indices like VARI and MGRVI delivered
similar results in vegetation classification and stress detection. Our findings
highlight the practical benefits of integrating RGB imagery into precision
farming, reducing operational costs while maintaining accuracy in plant health
monitoring. This research underscores the potential of UAVbased RGB imaging as
a powerful tool for precision agriculture, enabling broader adoption of
data-driven decision-making in crop management. By leveraging the strengths of
both multispectral and RGB imaging, this work advances the state of UAV
applications in agriculture, paving the way for more efficient and scalable
farming solutions.

Conclusion: SCCDM和KCC的组合在医学图像合成中表现出高效性和实用性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Medical image synthesis plays a crucial role in providing anatomically
accurate images for diagnosis and treatment. Hallux valgus, which affects
approximately 19% of the global population, requires frequent weight-bearing
X-rays for assessment, placing additional strain on both patients and
healthcare providers. Existing X-ray models often struggle to balance image
fidelity, skeletal consistency, and physical constraints, particularly in
diffusion-based methods that lack skeletal guidance. We propose the
Skeletal-Constrained Conditional Diffusion Model (SCCDM) and introduce KCC, a
foot evaluation method utilizing skeletal landmarks. SCCDM incorporates
multi-scale feature extraction and attention mechanisms, improving the
Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) by 5.72% (0.794) and Peak Signal-to-Noise
Ratio (PSNR) by 18.34% (21.40 dB). When combined with KCC, the model achieves
an average score of 0.85, demonstrating strong clinical applicability. The code

Abstract: Current deep learning models are mostly task specific and lack a
user-friendly interface to operate. We present Meta-EyeFM, a multi-function
foundation model that integrates a large language model (LLM) with vision
foundation models (VFMs) for ocular disease assessment. Meta-EyeFM leverages a

systemic diseases, differentiate ocular disease severity, and identify common
ocular signs. The model achieved 100% accuracy in routing fundus images to
appropriate VFMs, which achieved $\ge$ 82.2% accuracy in disease detection,
$\ge$ 89% in severity differentiation, $\ge$ 76% in sign identification.
Meta-EyeFM was 11% to 43% more accurate than Gemini-1.5-flash and ChatGPT-4o

*Lei Su*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于图神经网络（GNN）的邻近上下文聚合框架（GNCAF），用于端到端地分割全切片图像（WSI）中的三级淋巴结构（TLS）区域和成熟阶段，显著提升了分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖细胞代理任务且需额外后处理步骤，无法充分利用邻近上下文信息。

Method: GNCAF通过逐步聚合多跳邻近上下文并利用自注意力机制指导目标区域分割，可集成到多种分割模型中。

Result: 在两个TLS-SS数据集上，GNCAF在mF1和mIoU上分别提升了22.08%和26.57%。

Conclusion: GNCAF不仅适用于TLS分割，还可扩展到其他任务（如淋巴结转移分割），展示了其任务扩展性。

Abstract: Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) are organized clusters of immune cells,
whose maturity and area can be quantified in whole slide image (WSI) for
various prognostic tasks. Existing methods for assessing these characteristics
typically rely on cell proxy tasks and require additional post-processing
steps. In this work, We focus on a novel task-TLS Semantic Segmentation
(TLS-SS)-which segments both the regions and maturation stages of TLS in WSI in
an end-to-end manner. Due to the extensive scale of WSI and patch-based
segmentation strategies, TLS-SS necessitates integrating from neighboring
patches to guide target patch (target) segmentation. Previous techniques often
employ on multi-resolution approaches, constraining the capacity to leverage
the broader neighboring context while tend to preserve coarse-grained
information. To address this, we propose a GNN-based Neighboring Context
Aggregation Framework (GNCAF), which progressively aggregates multi-hop
neighboring context from the target and employs a self-attention mechanism to
guide the segmentation of the target. GNCAF can be integrated with various
segmentation models to enhance their ability to perceive contextual information
outside of the patch. We build two TLS-SS datasets, called TCGA-COAD and
INHOUSE-PAAD, and make the former (comprising 225 WSIs and 5041 TLSs) publicly
available. Experiments on these datasets demonstrate the superiority of GNCAF,
achieving a maximum of 22.08% and 26.57% improvement in mF1 and mIoU,
respectively. Additionally, we also validate the task scalability of GNCAF on
segmentation of lymph node metastases.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于智能手机的便携式圆锥角膜诊断框架，通过两阶段检测流程实现高精度分类和可视化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 圆锥角膜（KC）的诊断依赖专业设备，限制了可及性，因此需要便携、低成本的替代方案。

Method: 利用智能手机屏幕显示Placido盘，通过两阶段检测流程（WSVM分类和彩色映射可视化）分析角膜反射。

Result: 在模拟眼球模型上验证，分类准确率最高达92.93%，且在不同手机型号上表现稳定。ANOVA和Omega Squared显示特征区分能力显著。

Conclusion: 智能手机框架为KC诊断提供了便携、高精度的解决方案，具有临床潜力。

Abstract: Keratoconus (KC) is a progressive corneal disorder characterized by localized
thinning and protrusion, leading to visual distortion. While Placido disc-based
topography remains a standard in clinical diagnostics, its dependence on
specialized equipment limits accessibility. In this paper, we propose a
portable, smartphone-based diagnostic framework that captures corneal
reflections of a Placido disc displayed on a phone screen and applies a
two-stage detection pipeline, then validate on 3D-printed emulated eyeball
models that simulate normal, moderate, and severe KC stages based on anterior
chamber depth (ACD). The first step of the two-stage detection pipeline is
classifying different stages of KC with features including height and width of
extracted reflections using weighted support vector machine (WSVM). It achieves
a maximum accuracy of 92.93%, and maintains over 90% accuracy across multiple
smartphone models, including the Galaxy Z Flip 3, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 16
Pro. For the second step, we visualize the KC-affected protrusion regions on
the corneas with color maps based on inter-disc distance, that provides an
intuitive representation of disease severity and localization. Moreover, we
validate the ability of the extracted features to differentiate between KC
stages with ANOVA and Omega Squared, with significant p-values (e.g., $p <
10^{-6}$) and large effect sizes ($\\omega^2$ up to 0.8398) among classes.

Motivation: 现实中的MRI研究通常包含不同对比度的数据，而现有深度学习方法需要固定输入模态，限制了大规模预训练和下游任务的适应性。

Method: 提出VIViT框架，支持自监督预训练和分割微调，适应不同对比度的输入。

Result: 在脑梗死和脑肿瘤分割任务中，VIViT表现优于现有CNN和ViT模型，平均Dice分数分别为0.624和0.883。

Conclusion: VIViT框架在异构MRI数据任务中表现出更好的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Self-supervised pretrain techniques have been widely used to improve the
downstream tasks' performance. However, real-world magnetic resonance (MR)
studies usually consist of different sets of contrasts due to different
acquisition protocols, which poses challenges for the current deep learning
methods on large-scale pretrain and different downstream tasks with different
input requirements, since these methods typically require a fixed set of input
modalities or, contrasts. To address this challenge, we propose variable-input
ViT (VIViT), a transformer-based framework designed for self-supervised
pretraining and segmentation finetuning for variable contrasts in each study.
With this ability, our approach can maximize the data availability in pretrain,
and can transfer the learned knowledge from pretrain to downstream tasks
despite variations in input requirements. We validate our method on brain
infarct and brain tumor segmentation, where our method outperforms current CNN
and ViT-based models with a mean Dice score of 0.624 and 0.883 respectively.
These results highlight the efficacy of our design for better adaptability and
performance on tasks with real-world heterogeneous MR data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于未训练神经网络的太赫兹反向传播压缩成像技术，实现了亚衍射分辨率成像，减少了采样时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 太赫兹单像素成像（TSPI）因其简单和经济性备受关注，但其分辨率受限于波长，且现有亚波长分辨率技术需要苛刻的实验条件和耗时过程。

Method: 使用单色连续波太赫兹辐射照射物体，通过硅片背面预置图案调制透射波，利用未训练神经网络在物理模型约束下迭代重建图像，并结合角谱传播理论抑制衍射效应。

Result: 实现了约λ0/7（λ0=833.3μm）的空间分辨率，无需超薄光调制器，且压缩比低至1.5625%。

Conclusion: 该方法为太赫兹显微成像和其他逆成像问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Terahertz single-pixel imaging (TSPI) has garnered significant attention due
to its simplicity and cost-effectiveness. However, the relatively long
wavelength of THz waves limits sub-diffraction-scale imaging resolution.
Although TSPI technique can achieve sub-wavelength resolution, it requires
harsh experimental conditions and time-consuming processes. Here, we propose a
sub-diffraction THz backpropagation compressive imaging technique. We
illuminate the object with monochromatic continuous-wave THz radiation. The
transmitted THz wave is modulated by prearranged patterns generated on the back
surface of a 500-{\mu}m-thick silicon wafer, realized through photoexcited
carriers using a 532-nm laser. The modulated THz wave is then recorded by a
single-element detector. An untrained neural network is employed to iteratively
reconstruct the object image with an ultralow compression ratio of 1.5625%
under a physical model constraint, thus reducing the long sampling times. To
further suppress the diffraction-field effects, embedded with the angular
spectrum propagation (ASP) theory to model the diffraction of THz waves during
propagation, the network retrieves near-field information from the object,
enabling sub-diffraction imaging with a spatial resolution of ~{\lambda}0/7
({\lambda}0 = 833.3 {\mu}m at 0.36 THz) and eliminating the need for ultrathin
photomodulators. This approach provides an efficient solution for advancing THz
microscopic imaging and addressing other inverse imaging challenges.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉Transformer的解剖感知姿态估计系统，用于从ICE图像中确定导管位置和方向，无需外部跟踪传感器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有导航方法依赖电磁跟踪或手动调整，易受干扰且依赖操作者经验，需改进。

Method: 使用ViT模型处理ICE图像，通过16x16嵌入和Transformer网络预测位置和方向，训练于851例临床数据。

Result: 平均位置误差9.48毫米，方向误差16.13°、8.98°、10.47°，验证了模型准确性。

Conclusion: 该系统提高了手术效率，减少操作负担，支持无跟踪实时导管定位，可独立或补充现有系统。

Abstract: Intra-cardiac Echocardiography (ICE) plays a crucial role in
Electrophysiology (EP) and Structural Heart Disease (SHD) interventions by
providing high-resolution, real-time imaging of cardiac structures. However,
existing navigation methods rely on electromagnetic (EM) tracking, which is
susceptible to interference and position drift, or require manual adjustments
based on operator expertise. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
anatomy-aware pose estimation system that determines the ICE catheter position
and orientation solely from ICE images, eliminating the need for external
tracking sensors. Our approach leverages a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based deep
learning model, which captures spatial relationships between ICE images and
anatomical structures. The model is trained on a clinically acquired dataset of
851 subjects, including ICE images paired with position and orientation labels
normalized to the left atrium (LA) mesh. ICE images are patchified into 16x16
embeddings and processed through a transformer network, where a [CLS] token
independently predicts position and orientation via separate linear layers. The
model is optimized using a Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function, balancing
positional and orientational accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate an
average positional error of 9.48 mm and orientation errors of (16.13 deg, 8.98
deg, 10.47 deg) across x, y, and z axes, confirming the model accuracy.
Qualitative assessments further validate alignment between predicted and target
views within 3D cardiac meshes. This AI-driven system enhances procedural
efficiency, reduces operator workload, and enables real-time ICE catheter
localization for tracking-free procedures. The proposed method can function
independently or complement existing mapping systems like CARTO, offering a
transformative approach to ICE-guided interventions.

Abstract: The diffusion model has recently emerged as a potent approach in computer
vision, demonstrating remarkable performances in the field of generative
artificial intelligence. Capable of producing high-quality synthetic images,
diffusion models have been successfully applied across a range of applications.
However, a significant challenge remains with the high computational cost
associated with training and generating these models. This study focuses on the
efficiency and inference time of diffusion-based generative models,
highlighting their applications in both natural and medical imaging. We present
the most recent advances in diffusion models by categorizing them into three
key models: the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), the Latent
Diffusion Model (LDM), and the Wavelet Diffusion Model (WDM). These models play
a crucial role in medical imaging, where producing fast, reliable, and
high-quality medical images is essential for accurate analysis of abnormalities
and disease diagnosis. We first investigate the general framework of DDPM, LDM,
and WDM and discuss the computational complexity gap filled by these models in
natural and medical imaging. We then discuss the current limitations of these
models as well as the opportunities and future research directions in medical
imaging.

Abstract: Precision farming relies on accurate vegetation monitoring to enhance crop
productivity and promote sustainable agricultural practices. This study
presents a comprehensive evaluation of UAV-based imaging for vegetation health
assessment in a palm tree cultivation region in Dubai. By comparing
multispectral and RGB image data, we demonstrate that RGBbased vegetation
indices offer performance comparable to more expensive multispectral indices,
providing a cost-effective alternative for large-scale agricultural monitoring.
Using UAVs equipped with multispectral sensors, indices such as NDVI and SAVI
were computed to categorize vegetation into healthy, moderate, and stressed
conditions. Simultaneously, RGB-based indices like VARI and MGRVI delivered
similar results in vegetation classification and stress detection. Our findings
highlight the practical benefits of integrating RGB imagery into precision
farming, reducing operational costs while maintaining accuracy in plant health
monitoring. This research underscores the potential of UAVbased RGB imaging as
a powerful tool for precision agriculture, enabling broader adoption of
data-driven decision-making in crop management. By leveraging the strengths of
both multispectral and RGB imaging, this work advances the state of UAV
applications in agriculture, paving the way for more efficient and scalable

Conclusion: SCCDM和KCC的组合在医学图像合成中表现出色，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Medical image synthesis plays a crucial role in providing anatomically
accurate images for diagnosis and treatment. Hallux valgus, which affects
approximately 19% of the global population, requires frequent weight-bearing
X-rays for assessment, placing additional strain on both patients and
healthcare providers. Existing X-ray models often struggle to balance image
fidelity, skeletal consistency, and physical constraints, particularly in
diffusion-based methods that lack skeletal guidance. We propose the
Skeletal-Constrained Conditional Diffusion Model (SCCDM) and introduce KCC, a
foot evaluation method utilizing skeletal landmarks. SCCDM incorporates
multi-scale feature extraction and attention mechanisms, improving the
Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) by 5.72% (0.794) and Peak Signal-to-Noise
Ratio (PSNR) by 18.34% (21.40 dB). When combined with KCC, the model achieves
an average score of 0.85, demonstrating strong clinical applicability. The code

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Mamba的网络SpectMamba，用于半监督歌唱旋律提取，解决了现有方法的计算效率低、音符建模不足和标注数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在歌唱旋律提取中存在计算效率低、音符建模不足和标注数据稀缺的问题。

Method: 引入视觉Mamba实现线性计算复杂度，提出音符-f0解码器模拟音乐表演，并设计置信二元正则化模块利用未标注数据。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: SpectMamba在计算效率、音符建模和数据利用方面表现优越。

Abstract: Singing melody extraction (SME) is a key task in the field of music
information retrieval. However, existing methods are facing several
limitations: firstly, prior models use transformers to capture the contextual
dependencies, which requires quadratic computation resulting in low efficiency
in the inference stage. Secondly, prior works typically rely on
frequencysupervised methods to estimate the fundamental frequency (f0), which
ignores that the musical performance is actually based on notes. Thirdly,
transformers typically require large amounts of labeled data to achieve optimal
performances, but the SME task lacks of sufficient annotated data. To address
these issues, in this paper, we propose a mamba-based network, called
SpectMamba, for semi-supervised singing melody extraction using confidence
binary regularization. In particular, we begin by introducing vision mamba to
achieve computational linear complexity. Then, we propose a novel note-f0
decoder that allows the model to better mimic the musical performance. Further,
to alleviate the scarcity of the labeled data, we introduce a confidence binary
regularization (CBR) module to leverage the unlabeled data by maximizing the
probability of the correct classes. The proposed method is evaluated on several
public datasets and the conducted experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed method.

Motivation: AI音乐生成多集中于音频领域，但其在音乐制作产业中因灵活性不足而应用受限。本文旨在通过符号音乐编辑提升灵活性，仅需文本指令即可操作。

Method: 采用LLM零样本提示技术，设计了一种创新的格式将LLM与音乐编辑结合，并提供了标注数据集以评估效果。

Abstract: Most work in AI music generation focused on audio, which has seen limited use
in the music production industry due to its rigidity. To maximize flexibility
while assuming only textual instructions from producers, we are among the first
to tackle symbolic music editing. We circumvent the known challenge of lack of
labeled data by proving that LLMs with zero-shot prompting can effectively edit
drum grooves. The recipe of success is a creatively designed format that
interfaces LLMs and music, while we facilitate evaluation by providing an
evaluation dataset with annotated unit tests that highly aligns with musicians'
judgment.

Conclusion: 尽管新兴技术有望改进去中心化AI生态系统，但当前AI代币的实现仍存在显著差距，需更务实的评估和发展方向。

Abstract: The convergence of blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) has led to the
emergence of AI-based tokens, which are cryptographic assets designed to power
decentralized AI platforms and services. This paper provides a comprehensive
review of leading AI-token projects, examining their technical architectures,
token utilities, consensus mechanisms, and underlying business models. We
explore how these tokens operate across various blockchain ecosystems and
assess the extent to which they offer value beyond traditional centralized AI
services. Based on this assessment, our analysis identifies several core
limitations. From a technical perspective, many platforms depend extensively on
off-chain computation, exhibit limited capabilities for on-chain intelligence,
and encounter significant scalability challenges. From a business perspective,
many models appear to replicate centralized AI service structures, simply
adding token-based payment and governance layers without delivering truly novel
value. In light of these challenges, we also examine emerging developments that
may shape the next phase of decentralized AI systems. These include approaches
for on-chain verification of AI outputs, blockchain-enabled federated learning,
and more robust incentive frameworks. Collectively, while emerging innovations
offer pathways to strengthen decentralized AI ecosystems, significant gaps
remain between the promises and the realities of current AI-token
implementations. Our findings contribute to a growing body of research at the

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a new paradigm for

significant technical challenges due to their inherently heterogeneous
computational pipelines comprising LLMs, databases, and specialized processing

architecture offers three key innovations: First, it provides a flexible
specification interface enabling users to implement custom RAG pipelines.
Secondly, it deploys these pipelines as distributed inference systems while
optimizing for the unique scalability characteristics of individual RAG
components. Third, Patchwork incorporates an online scheduling mechanism that
continuously monitors request load and execution progress, dynamically
minimizing SLO violations through strategic request prioritization and resource
auto-scaling. Our experimental evaluation across four distinct RAG
implementations demonstrates that Patchwork delivers substantial performance
improvements over commercial alternatives, achieving throughput gains exceeding
48% while simultaneously reducing SLO violations by ~24%.

Method: 提出Fused3S算法，首次将稀疏矩阵操作的三个步骤（SDDMM、softmax和SpMM）融合为一个整体，优化张量核心利用并减少数据移动。

Result: 在H100和A30 GPU上，Fused3S比现有技术快1.6-16.3倍和1.5-14倍；集成到Graph Transformer推理中，端到端性能提升1.05-5.36倍。

Conclusion: Fused3S在稀疏注意力计算中表现出显著优势，适用于多种数据集和GPU架构。

Abstract: Sparse attention is a core building block in many leading neural network
models, from graph-structured learning to sparse sequence modeling. It can be
decomposed into a sequence of three sparse matrix operations (3S): sampled
dense-dense matrix multiplication (SDDMM), softmax normalization, and sparse
matrix multiplication (SpMM). Efficiently executing the 3S computational
pattern on modern GPUs remains challenging due to (a) the mismatch between
unstructured sparsity and tensor cores optimized for dense operations, and (b)
the high cost of data movement. Previous works have optimized these sparse
operations individually or addressed one of these challenges. This paper
introduces Fused3S, the first fused 3S algorithm that jointly maximizes tensor
core utilization and minimizes data movement. Across real-world graph datasets,
Fused3S achieves $1.6- 16.3\times$ and $1.5-14\times$ speedup over
state-of-the-art on H100 and A30 GPUs. Furthermore, integrating Fused3S into
Graph Transformer inference accelerates end-to-end performance by
$1.05-5.36\times$, consistently outperforming all 3S baselines across diverse
datasets (single and batched graphs) and GPU architectures.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于3D高斯的在线密集映射框架，用于从单目图像流中重建逼真细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单目在线重建中的两个关键挑战：无需依赖深度图的高斯分布，以及确保重建地图的局部和全局一致性。

Method: 引入分层高斯管理模块和全局一致性优化模块，并提出多级占用哈希体素（MOHV）结构。

Result: 相比现有RGB-only和RGB-D方法，实现了更高质量的重建和更高的计算效率。

Conclusion: 框架具有通用性和可扩展性，能无缝集成多种跟踪系统。

Abstract: We propose an online 3D Gaussian-based dense mapping framework for
photorealistic details reconstruction from a monocular image stream. Our
approach addresses two key challenges in monocular online reconstruction:
distributing Gaussians without relying on depth maps and ensuring both local
and global consistency in the reconstructed maps. To achieve this, we introduce
two key modules: the Hierarchical Gaussian Management Module for effective
Gaussian distribution and the Global Consistency Optimization Module for
maintaining alignment and coherence at all scales. In addition, we present the
Multi-level Occupancy Hash Voxels (MOHV), a structure that regularizes
Gaussians for capturing details across multiple levels of granularity. MOHV
ensures accurate reconstruction of both fine and coarse geometries and
textures, preserving intricate details while maintaining overall structural
integrity. Compared to state-of-the-art RGB-only and even RGB-D methods, our
framework achieves superior reconstruction quality with high computational
efficiency. Moreover, it integrates seamlessly with various tracking systems,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有海报设计方法主要关注图像中心增强，忽视了布局多样性和通用场景下的设计意图多样性。

Method: 通过将布局结构化为SVG语言中的树形结构，结合设计意图向量化和层次节点表示，利用LLMs进行上下文学习预测新布局树。

Result: 实验表明PosterO能生成视觉吸引力的布局，并在多个基准测试中达到最新性能。

Conclusion: PosterO通过布局中心方法和LLMs的应用，显著提升了海报设计的多样性和适应性，并构建了首个多用途海报数据集PStylish7。

Abstract: In poster design, content-aware layout generation is crucial for
automatically arranging visual-textual elements on the given image. With
limited training data, existing work focused on image-centric enhancement.
However, this neglects the diversity of layouts and fails to cope with
shape-variant elements or diverse design intents in generalized settings. To
this end, we proposed a layout-centric approach that leverages layout knowledge
implicit in large language models (LLMs) to create posters for omnifarious
purposes, hence the name PosterO. Specifically, it structures layouts from
datasets as trees in SVG language by universal shape, design intent
vectorization, and hierarchical node representation. Then, it applies LLMs
during inference to predict new layout trees by in-context learning with
intent-aligned example selection. After layout trees are generated, we can
seamlessly realize them into poster designs by editing the chat with LLMs.
Extensive experimental results have demonstrated that PosterO can generate
visually appealing layouts for given images, achieving new state-of-the-art
performance across various benchmarks. To further explore PosterO's abilities
under the generalized settings, we built PStylish7, the first dataset with
multi-purpose posters and various-shaped elements, further offering a
challenging test for advanced research.

TL;DR: 提出自适应视图规划方法，通过动态相机轨迹优化多视图合成，提升单视图3D重建的遮挡揭示和3D一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统多视图合成中无序或同步生成视图导致的遮挡和3D一致性问题。

Method: 生成自适应相机轨迹（ACT），最大化遮挡区域可见性，并利用视频扩散模型生成新视图，输入多视图3D重建模型。

Result: 在GSO数据集上显著优于现有方法，定量和定性均表现优异。

Conclusion: 自适应视图规划有效提升3D重建质量，无需运行时训练，仅需预训练模型的前向推理。

Abstract: We introduce adaptive view planning to multi-view synthesis, aiming to
improve both occlusion revelation and 3D consistency for single-view 3D
reconstruction. Instead of generating an unordered set of views independently
or simultaneously, we generate a sequence of views, leveraging temporal
consistency to enhance 3D coherence. Most importantly, our view sequence is not
determined by a pre-determined camera setup. Instead, we compute an adaptive
camera trajectory (ACT), specifically, an orbit of camera views, which
maximizes the visibility of occluded regions of the 3D object to be
reconstructed. Once the best orbit is found, we feed it to a video diffusion
model to generate novel views around the orbit, which in turn, are passed to a
multi-view 3D reconstruction model to obtain the final reconstruction. Our
multi-view synthesis pipeline is quite efficient since it involves no run-time
training/optimization, only forward inferences by applying the pre-trained
models for occlusion analysis and multi-view synthesis. Our method predicts
camera trajectories that reveal occlusions effectively and produce consistent
novel views, significantly improving 3D reconstruction over SOTA on the unseen
GSO dataset, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Abstract: Generating full-body human gestures encompassing face, body, hands, and
global movements from audio is a valuable yet challenging task in virtual
avatar creation. Previous systems focused on tokenizing the human gestures
framewisely and predicting the tokens of each frame from the input audio.
However, one observation is that the number of frames required for a complete
expressive human gesture, defined as granularity, varies among different human
gesture patterns. Existing systems fail to model these gesture patterns due to
the fixed granularity of their gesture tokens. To solve this problem, we
propose a novel framework named Multi-Granular Gesture Generator (M3G) for
audio-driven holistic gesture generation. In M3G, we propose a novel
Multi-Granular VQ-VAE (MGVQ-VAE) to tokenize motion patterns and reconstruct
motion sequences from different temporal granularities. Subsequently, we
proposed a multi-granular token predictor that extracts multi-granular
information from audio and predicts the corresponding motion tokens. Then M3G
reconstructs the human gestures from the predicted tokens using the MGVQ-VAE.
Both objective and subjective experiments demonstrate that our proposed M3G
framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of generating
natural and expressive full-body human gestures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统矩阵式代码（如QR码）在变形和定制化方面受限，Claycode旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过树结构编码信息，将比特映射到拓扑树中，并以颜色区域嵌套在目标多边形内绘制。解码时从摄像头流中实时提取。

Result: Claycode在严重变形下仍保持高容错性，优于传统2D代码。

Conclusion: Claycode为高度定制化和变形场景提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces Claycode, a novel 2D scannable code designed for
extensive stylization and deformation. Unlike traditional matrix-based codes
(e.g., QR codes), Claycodes encode their message in a tree structure. During
the encoding process, bits are mapped into a topology tree, which is then
depicted as a nesting of color regions drawn within the boundaries of a target
polygon shape. When decoding, Claycodes are extracted and interpreted in
real-time from a camera stream. We detail the end-to-end pipeline and show that
Claycodes allow for extensive stylization without compromising their
functionality. We then empirically demonstrate Claycode's high tolerance to
heavy deformations, outperforming traditional 2D scannable codes in scenarios
where they typically fail.

TL;DR: CAD-Coder是一个将自然语言指令转换为CAD脚本代码的框架，生成可编辑的CAD文件，解决了传统生成方法缺乏交互性和几何标注的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CAD设计依赖专家手工绘制或修改现有库文件，无法快速个性化；现有生成方法缺乏交互性和几何标注，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出CAD-Coder框架，通过自然语言指令生成CAD脚本代码，构建包含29,130个Dxf文件及其脚本代码的数据集，保留可编辑性和几何标注。

Result: 在多种2D/3D CAD生成任务中表现优于现有方法，提供可编辑的草图和几何标注。

Conclusion: CAD-Coder实现了交互式生成CAD，解决了现有方法的局限性，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Computer-aided design (CAD) is a way to digitally create 2D drawings and 3D
models of real-world products. Traditional CAD typically relies on hand-drawing
by experts or modifications of existing library files, which doesn't allow for
rapid personalization. With the emergence of generative artificial
intelligence, convenient and efficient personalized CAD generation has become
possible. However, existing generative methods typically produce outputs that
lack interactive editability and geometric annotations, limiting their
practical applications in manufacturing. To enable interactive generative CAD,
we propose CAD-Coder, a framework that transforms natural language instructions
into CAD script codes, which can be executed in Python environments to generate
human-editable CAD files (.Dxf). To facilitate the generation of editable CAD
sketches with annotation information, we construct a comprehensive dataset
comprising 29,130 Dxf files with their corresponding script codes, where each
sketch preserves both editability and geometric annotations. We evaluate
CAD-Coder on various 2D/3D CAD generation tasks against existing methods,
demonstrating superior interactive capabilities while uniquely providing
editable sketches with geometric annotations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于3D高斯分布的在线密集映射框架，用于从单目图像流中重建真实感细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单目在线重建中的两个关键挑战：无需依赖深度图的高斯分布，以及确保重建地图的局部和全局一致性。

Method: 引入分层高斯管理模块和全局一致性优化模块，并提出多级占用哈希体素（MOHV）结构。

Result: 在重建质量和计算效率上优于现有RGB-only和RGB-D方法，并能与多种跟踪系统无缝集成。

Conclusion: 该框架在细节重建和整体结构完整性方面表现出色，具有通用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: We propose an online 3D Gaussian-based dense mapping framework for
photorealistic details reconstruction from a monocular image stream. Our
approach addresses two key challenges in monocular online reconstruction:
distributing Gaussians without relying on depth maps and ensuring both local
and global consistency in the reconstructed maps. To achieve this, we introduce
two key modules: the Hierarchical Gaussian Management Module for effective
Gaussian distribution and the Global Consistency Optimization Module for
maintaining alignment and coherence at all scales. In addition, we present the
Multi-level Occupancy Hash Voxels (MOHV), a structure that regularizes
Gaussians for capturing details across multiple levels of granularity. MOHV
ensures accurate reconstruction of both fine and coarse geometries and
textures, preserving intricate details while maintaining overall structural
integrity. Compared to state-of-the-art RGB-only and even RGB-D methods, our
framework achieves superior reconstruction quality with high computational
efficiency. Moreover, it integrates seamlessly with various tracking systems,
ensuring generality and scalability.

TL;DR: PosterO提出了一种基于布局的方法，利用大语言模型（LLMs）的布局知识生成多样化海报设计，解决了现有方法在通用场景下布局多样性和形状适应性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有海报设计方法主要关注图像增强，忽视了布局多样性和形状适应性，无法满足通用场景需求。

Method: 通过SVG语言将布局结构化为树，结合设计意图向量化和层次节点表示，利用LLMs进行上下文学习预测新布局树。

Result: PosterO在多个基准测试中表现优异，生成了视觉吸引力的布局。

Conclusion: PosterO展示了在通用场景下的强大能力，并通过PStylish7数据集为未来研究提供了挑战。

Abstract: In poster design, content-aware layout generation is crucial for
automatically arranging visual-textual elements on the given image. With
limited training data, existing work focused on image-centric enhancement.
However, this neglects the diversity of layouts and fails to cope with
shape-variant elements or diverse design intents in generalized settings. To
this end, we proposed a layout-centric approach that leverages layout knowledge
implicit in large language models (LLMs) to create posters for omnifarious
purposes, hence the name PosterO. Specifically, it structures layouts from
datasets as trees in SVG language by universal shape, design intent
vectorization, and hierarchical node representation. Then, it applies LLMs
during inference to predict new layout trees by in-context learning with
intent-aligned example selection. After layout trees are generated, we can
seamlessly realize them into poster designs by editing the chat with LLMs.
Extensive experimental results have demonstrated that PosterO can generate
visually appealing layouts for given images, achieving new state-of-the-art
performance across various benchmarks. To further explore PosterO's abilities
under the generalized settings, we built PStylish7, the first dataset with
multi-purpose posters and various-shaped elements, further offering a
challenging test for advanced research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统多视角合成中无序视角或固定相机轨迹导致的遮挡问题和3D不一致性。

Method: 计算自适应相机轨迹（ACT），优化遮挡区域可见性，结合视频扩散模型生成新视角，输入多视角3D重建模型。

Result: 在GSO数据集上显著提升3D重建效果，定量和定性均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 自适应视角规划有效提升遮挡揭示和3D一致性，无需运行时训练，高效且性能优越。

Abstract: We introduce adaptive view planning to multi-view synthesis, aiming to
improve both occlusion revelation and 3D consistency for single-view 3D
reconstruction. Instead of generating an unordered set of views independently
or simultaneously, we generate a sequence of views, leveraging temporal
consistency to enhance 3D coherence. Most importantly, our view sequence is not
determined by a pre-determined camera setup. Instead, we compute an adaptive
camera trajectory (ACT), specifically, an orbit of camera views, which
maximizes the visibility of occluded regions of the 3D object to be
reconstructed. Once the best orbit is found, we feed it to a video diffusion
model to generate novel views around the orbit, which in turn, are passed to a
multi-view 3D reconstruction model to obtain the final reconstruction. Our
multi-view synthesis pipeline is quite efficient since it involves no run-time
training/optimization, only forward inferences by applying the pre-trained
models for occlusion analysis and multi-view synthesis. Our method predicts
camera trajectories that reveal occlusions effectively and produce consistent
novel views, significantly improving 3D reconstruction over SOTA on the unseen
GSO dataset, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统课堂话语评估依赖人工编码，耗时且成本高，而现有AI技术多局限于单一句子分析，缺乏对整个课程段话语质量的评估。

Method: 采用注意力机制捕捉多模态交互，多任务学习预测话语质量分数，并将任务建模为有序分类问题。

Result: 在GTI德国数据集上，文本模态表现最佳，结合音频特征后模型一致性提升，总体Quadratic Weighted Kappa得分为0.384，接近人类评分者间一致性（0.326）。

Conclusion: 该研究为自动化话语质量评估奠定了基础，支持通过多维反馈促进教师专业发展。

Abstract: Classroom discourse is an essential vehicle through which teaching and
learning take place. Assessing different characteristics of discursive
practices and linking them to student learning achievement enhances the
understanding of teaching quality. Traditional assessments rely on manual
coding of classroom observation protocols, which is time-consuming and costly.
Despite many studies utilizing AI techniques to analyze classroom discourse at
the utterance level, investigations into the evaluation of discursive practices
throughout an entire lesson segment remain limited. To address this gap, our
study proposes a novel text-centered multimodal fusion architecture to assess
the quality of three discourse components grounded in the Global Teaching
InSights (GTI) observation protocol: Nature of Discourse, Questioning, and
Explanations. First, we employ attention mechanisms to capture inter- and
intra-modal interactions from transcript, audio, and video streams. Second, a
multi-task learning approach is adopted to jointly predict the quality scores
of the three components. Third, we formulate the task as an ordinal
classification problem to account for rating level order. The effectiveness of
these designed elements is demonstrated through an ablation study on the GTI
Germany dataset containing 92 videotaped math lessons. Our results highlight
the dominant role of text modality in approaching this task. Integrating
acoustic features enhances the model's consistency with human ratings,
achieving an overall Quadratic Weighted Kappa score of 0.384, comparable to
human inter-rater reliability (0.326). Our study lays the groundwork for the
future development of automated discourse quality assessment to support teacher
professional development through timely feedback on multidimensional discourse
practices.

Conclusion: LECTOR模型为教育数据分析提供了新视角，展示了整合阅读内容和活动数据的潜力，可用于个性化干预设计。

Abstract: Educational e-book platforms provide valuable information to teachers and
researchers through two main sources: reading activity data and reading content
data. While reading activity data is commonly used to analyze learning
strategies and predict low-performing students, reading content data is often
overlooked in these analyses. To address this gap, this study proposes LECTOR
(Lecture slides and Topic Relationships), a model that summarizes information
from reading content in a format that can be easily integrated with reading
activity data. Our first experiment compared LECTOR to representative Natural
Language Processing (NLP) models in extracting key information from 2,255
lecture slides, showing an average improvement of 5% in F1-score. These results
were further validated through a human evaluation involving 28 students, which
showed an average improvement of 21% in F1-score over a model predominantly
used in current educational tools. Our second experiment compared reading
preferences extracted by LECTOR with traditional reading activity data in
predicting low-performing students using 600,712 logs from 218 students. The
results showed a tendency to improve the predictive performance by integrating
LECTOR. Finally, we proposed examples showing the potential application of the
reading preferences extracted by LECTOR in designing personalized interventions
for students.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是揭示联邦机构在拨款政策中对AI的治理作用，这一领域此前被忽视。

Method: 通过分析2009至2024年间Grants.gov上的40,000多项非国防联邦拨款通知，筛选提及AI的记录，研究其目标和限制。

Result: 研究发现拨款政策中AI治理不足，缺乏具体评判标准和限制，尤其在涉及人权领域时。

Conclusion: 论文指出拨款政策是AI治理的新领域，但与其他监管措施脱节，需进一步研究其透明度和问责机制。

Abstract: Much scholarship considers how U.S. federal agencies govern artificial
intelligence (AI) through rulemaking and their own internal use policies. But
agencies have an overlooked AI governance role: setting discretionary grant
policy when directing billions of dollars in federal financial assistance.
These dollars enable state and local entities to study, create, and use AI.
This funding not only goes to dedicated AI programs, but also to grantees using
AI in the course of meeting their routine grant objectives. As discretionary
grantmakers, agencies guide and restrict what grant winners do -- a hidden
lever for AI governance. Agencies pull this lever by setting program
objectives, judging criteria, and restrictions for AI use. Using a novel
dataset of over 40,000 non-defense federal grant notices of funding opportunity
(NOFOs) posted to Grants.gov between 2009 and 2024, we analyze how agencies
regulate the use of AI by grantees. We select records mentioning AI and review
their stated goals and requirements. We find agencies promoting AI in notice
narratives, shaping adoption in ways other records of grant policy might fail
to capture. Of the grant opportunities that mention AI, we find only a handful
of AI-specific judging criteria or restrictions. This silence holds even when
agencies fund AI uses in contexts affecting people's rights and which, under an
analogous federal procurement regime, would result in extra oversight. These
findings recast grant notices as a site of AI policymaking -- albeit one that
is developing out of step with other regulatory efforts and incomplete in its
consideration of transparency, accountability, and privacy protections. The
paper concludes by drawing lessons from AI procurement scholarship, while
identifying distinct challenges in grantmaking that invite further study.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种三阶段自下而上的框架，用于模拟社会结构的涌现，解决了多智能体AI中缺乏可模拟模型的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有经济学和社会学理论对社会结构的描述多为事后解释，缺乏从个体行为出发的明确建模，导致社会结构的起源和操作定义不清晰。

Method: 提出了三阶段框架：互惠动态（个体交换）、规范稳定化（共享期望的巩固）和制度构建（稳定模式的外部化）。

Result: 通过基于个体互惠的社会涌现，框架能够系统地探索道德、文化和制度结构如何从最小认知互动中产生。

Conclusion: 该框架为多智能体AI和社会科学提供了一种新的建模方法，填补了理论与实际模拟之间的空白。

Abstract: A major bottleneck in multi-agent AI is the lack of simulateable models for
the bottom-up emergence of social structure under realistic behavioral
constraints. Similarly, many foundational theories in economics and sociology
including the concepts of "institutions" and "norms" tend to describe social
structures post hoc, often relying on implicit assumptions of shared culture,
morality, or symbolic agreement. These concepts are often treated as primitives
rather than reconstructed from agent-level behavior, leaving both their origins
and operational definitions under-specified. To address this, we propose a
three-stage bottom-up framework: Reciprocal Dynamics, capturing
individual-level reciprocal exchanges; Norm Stabilization, the consolidation of
shared expectations; and Institutional Construction, the externalization of
stable patterns into scalable structures. By grounding social emergence in
agent-level reciprocity, our framework enables the systematic exploration of
how moral, cultural, and institutional structures emerge from cognitively
minimal interactions.

Result: 在GTI德国数据集上验证了模型的有效性，文本模态起主导作用，结合音频特征后模型与人类评分一致性提高，总体Quadratic Weighted Kappa得分为0.384。

Conclusion: 该研究为自动话语质量评估奠定了基础，支持通过多维反馈促进教师专业发展。

Abstract: Classroom discourse is an essential vehicle through which teaching and
learning take place. Assessing different characteristics of discursive
practices and linking them to student learning achievement enhances the
understanding of teaching quality. Traditional assessments rely on manual
coding of classroom observation protocols, which is time-consuming and costly.
Despite many studies utilizing AI techniques to analyze classroom discourse at
the utterance level, investigations into the evaluation of discursive practices
throughout an entire lesson segment remain limited. To address this gap, our
study proposes a novel text-centered multimodal fusion architecture to assess
the quality of three discourse components grounded in the Global Teaching
InSights (GTI) observation protocol: Nature of Discourse, Questioning, and
Explanations. First, we employ attention mechanisms to capture inter- and
intra-modal interactions from transcript, audio, and video streams. Second, a
multi-task learning approach is adopted to jointly predict the quality scores
of the three components. Third, we formulate the task as an ordinal
classification problem to account for rating level order. The effectiveness of
these designed elements is demonstrated through an ablation study on the GTI
Germany dataset containing 92 videotaped math lessons. Our results highlight
the dominant role of text modality in approaching this task. Integrating
acoustic features enhances the model's consistency with human ratings,
achieving an overall Quadratic Weighted Kappa score of 0.384, comparable to
human inter-rater reliability (0.326). Our study lays the groundwork for the
future development of automated discourse quality assessment to support teacher
professional development through timely feedback on multidimensional discourse
practices.

TL;DR: LECTOR模型通过整合阅读内容数据与阅读活动数据，提升了从讲座幻灯片中提取关键信息的能力，并在预测低绩效学生方面表现出潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前教育电子书平台主要利用阅读活动数据，而忽略了阅读内容数据的价值。本研究旨在填补这一空白，提出LECTOR模型以更好地整合和分析这两种数据。

Method: 提出LECTOR模型，结合自然语言处理技术从讲座幻灯片中提取关键信息，并通过实验验证其性能。

Result: LECTOR在F1分数上平均提升5%（与NLP模型相比）和21%（与现有教育工具模型相比），并在预测低绩效学生方面显示出潜力。

Conclusion: LECTOR模型为教育数据分析提供了新视角，展示了整合阅读内容数据的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Educational e-book platforms provide valuable information to teachers and
researchers through two main sources: reading activity data and reading content
data. While reading activity data is commonly used to analyze learning
strategies and predict low-performing students, reading content data is often
overlooked in these analyses. To address this gap, this study proposes LECTOR
(Lecture slides and Topic Relationships), a model that summarizes information
from reading content in a format that can be easily integrated with reading
activity data. Our first experiment compared LECTOR to representative Natural
Language Processing (NLP) models in extracting key information from 2,255
lecture slides, showing an average improvement of 5% in F1-score. These results
were further validated through a human evaluation involving 28 students, which
showed an average improvement of 21% in F1-score over a model predominantly
used in current educational tools. Our second experiment compared reading
preferences extracted by LECTOR with traditional reading activity data in
predicting low-performing students using 600,712 logs from 218 students. The
results showed a tendency to improve the predictive performance by integrating
LECTOR. Finally, we proposed examples showing the potential application of the
reading preferences extracted by LECTOR in designing personalized interventions
for students.

### [549] [One Bad NOFO? AI Governance in Federal Grantmaking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08133)
*Dan Bateyko,Karen Levy*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文探讨了美国联邦机构如何通过拨款政策间接治理人工智能（AI），发现其监管措施与其他领域相比不完善。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注机构通过规则制定和内部政策治理AI，但忽略了拨款政策作为治理工具的作用。

Method: 分析了2009至2024年间超过4万份非国防联邦拨款通知，筛选提及AI的记录并审查其目标和限制。

Result: 发现机构虽在拨款叙述中推广AI，但缺乏具体的评判标准或限制，尤其在涉及人权的情境中。

Conclusion: 拨款通知是AI政策制定的新领域，但其发展与其他监管不同步，需进一步研究以完善透明度、问责和隐私保护。

Abstract: Much scholarship considers how U.S. federal agencies govern artificial
intelligence (AI) through rulemaking and their own internal use policies. But
agencies have an overlooked AI governance role: setting discretionary grant
policy when directing billions of dollars in federal financial assistance.
These dollars enable state and local entities to study, create, and use AI.
This funding not only goes to dedicated AI programs, but also to grantees using
AI in the course of meeting their routine grant objectives. As discretionary
grantmakers, agencies guide and restrict what grant winners do -- a hidden
lever for AI governance. Agencies pull this lever by setting program
objectives, judging criteria, and restrictions for AI use. Using a novel
dataset of over 40,000 non-defense federal grant notices of funding opportunity
(NOFOs) posted to Grants.gov between 2009 and 2024, we analyze how agencies
regulate the use of AI by grantees. We select records mentioning AI and review
their stated goals and requirements. We find agencies promoting AI in notice
narratives, shaping adoption in ways other records of grant policy might fail
to capture. Of the grant opportunities that mention AI, we find only a handful
of AI-specific judging criteria or restrictions. This silence holds even when
agencies fund AI uses in contexts affecting people's rights and which, under an
analogous federal procurement regime, would result in extra oversight. These
findings recast grant notices as a site of AI policymaking -- albeit one that
is developing out of step with other regulatory efforts and incomplete in its
consideration of transparency, accountability, and privacy protections. The
paper concludes by drawing lessons from AI procurement scholarship, while
identifying distinct challenges in grantmaking that invite further study.

### [550] [Reciprocity as the Foundational Substrate of Society: How Reciprocal Dynamics Scale into Social Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08319)
*Egil Diau*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 提出一个三阶段自下而上的框架，用于模拟社会结构的涌现，填补多智能体AI中缺乏可模拟模型的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体AI中缺乏对社会结构自下而上涌现的可模拟模型，且经济学和社会学中的基础理论（如“制度”和“规范”）往往事后描述，依赖于共享文化或道德的隐含假设。

Method: 提出三阶段框架：互惠动力学（个体互惠交换）、规范稳定化（共享期望的巩固）和制度构建（稳定模式的外部化）。

Result: 通过基于代理互惠的社会涌现，框架能够系统地探索道德、文化和制度结构如何从最小认知交互中产生。

Conclusion: 该框架为理解社会结构的自下而上涌现提供了可操作的方法，填补了理论和模拟之间的空白。

Abstract: A major bottleneck in multi-agent AI is the lack of simulateable models for
the bottom-up emergence of social structure under realistic behavioral
constraints. Similarly, many foundational theories in economics and sociology
including the concepts of "institutions" and "norms" tend to describe social
structures post hoc, often relying on implicit assumptions of shared culture,
morality, or symbolic agreement. These concepts are often treated as primitives
rather than reconstructed from agent-level behavior, leaving both their origins
and operational definitions under-specified. To address this, we propose a
three-stage bottom-up framework: Reciprocal Dynamics, capturing
individual-level reciprocal exchanges; Norm Stabilization, the consolidation of
shared expectations; and Institutional Construction, the externalization of
stable patterns into scalable structures. By grounding social emergence in
agent-level reciprocity, our framework enables the systematic exploration of
how moral, cultural, and institutional structures emerge from cognitively
minimal interactions.

Motivation: 微观结构对材料性能至关重要，但因其难以量化、预测和优化，很少作为设计变量。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 框架整合了扩散图像生成模型、定量图像分析流程和粒子群优化算法，通过SEM图像提取形态特征并预测合成条件。

Result: 平台能准确预测特定共沉淀条件下的微观结构，并通过实验验证了预测与合成结构的高度一致性。

Conclusion: 该框架为数据驱动的材料设计提供了实用策略，支持正向预测和逆向设计，推动自主微观结构工程的发展。

Abstract: Microstructure often dictates materials performance, yet it is rarely treated
as an explicit design variable because microstructure is hard to quantify,
predict, and optimize. Here, we introduce an image centric, closed-loop
framework that makes microstructural morphology into a controllable objective
and demonstrate its use case with Li- and Mn-rich layered oxide cathode
precursors. This work presents an integrated, AI driven framework for the
predictive design and optimization of lithium-ion battery cathode precursor
synthesis. This framework integrates a diffusion-based image generation model,
a quantitative image analysis pipeline, and a particle swarm optimization (PSO)
algorithm. By extracting key morphological descriptors such as texture,
sphericity, and median particle size (D50) from SEM images, the platform
accurately predicts SEM like morphologies resulting from specific
coprecipitation conditions, including reaction time-, solution concentration-,
and pH-dependent structural changes. Optimization then pinpoints synthesis
parameters that yield user defined target morphologies, as experimentally
validated by the close agreement between predicted and synthesized structures.
This framework offers a practical strategy for data driven materials design,
enabling both forward prediction and inverse design of synthesis conditions and
paving the way toward autonomous, image guided microstructure engineering.

Abstract: Understanding multicomponent complex material systems is essential for design

state-of-the-art crystal structure prediction (CSP) methods effectively
identify new structures and assess phase stability, they face fundamental

practical feasibility. In this work, we propose a flexible and automated
workflow to build a highly generalizable and data-efficient machine learning

The workflow is validated on both Mg-Ca-H ternary and Be-P-N-O quaternary
systems, demonstrating substantial machine learning acceleration in
high-throughput structural optimization and enabling the efficient
identification of promising compounds. These results underscore the

Main category: physics.data-an

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在物理科学中，机器学习用于参数估计时，系统不确定性（如探测器校准错误）会导致数据分布偏移，从而影响统计精度。目前，在HEP和更广泛的ML领域，如何在这种偏移下实现不确定性感知的参数估计仍是一个未解决的问题。

Method: 通过对比归一化流（CNFs）嵌入数据和参数，生成可调对比分布，结合分类器和频率学方法，实现鲁棒的参数估计和不确定性量化。

Result: 在HiggsML Uncertainty Challenge数据集上取得了最佳性能，证明了CNFs在数据分布偏移下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CNFs结合分类器和频率学技术，为数据分布偏移下的参数估计和不确定性量化提供了理论支持和实证效果。

Abstract: Estimating physical parameters from data is a crucial application of machine
learning (ML) in the physical sciences. However, systematic uncertainties, such
as detector miscalibration, induce data distribution distortions that can erode
statistical precision. In both high-energy physics (HEP) and broader ML
contexts, achieving uncertainty-aware parameter estimation under these domain
shifts remains an open problem. In this work, we address this challenge of
uncertainty-aware parameter estimation for a broad set of tasks critical for
HEP. We introduce a novel approach based on Contrastive Normalizing Flows
(CNFs), which achieves top performance on the HiggsML Uncertainty Challenge
dataset. Building on the insight that a binary classifier can approximate the
model parameter likelihood ratio, we address the practical limitations of
expressivity and the high cost of simulating high-dimensional parameter grids
by embedding data and parameters in a learned CNF mapping. This mapping yields
a tunable contrastive distribution that enables robust classification under
shifted data distributions. Through a combination of theoretical analysis and
empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that CNFs, when coupled with a classifier
and established frequentist techniques, provide principled parameter estimation
and uncertainty quantification through classification that is robust to data
distribution distortions.

Motivation: 现有方法仅关注VVS在物体识别中的作用，但作者认为VVS功能更广泛，尤其是相对位置预测（RP），因此提出结合RP学习以更符合生物学现实。

Abstract: Based on the concept that ventral visual stream (VVS) mainly functions for

we introduce an additional function involving VVS, named relative position (RP)
prediction. We first theoretically explain contrastive learning may be unable
to yield the model capability of RP prediction. Motivated by this, we
subsequently integrate RP learning with contrastive learning, and propose a new
unsupervised task-driven method to model VVS, which is more inline with
biological reality. We conduct extensive experiments, demonstrating that: (i)
our method significantly improves downstream performance of object recognition
while enhancing RP predictivity; (ii) RP predictivity generally improves the

of VVS in location perception (especially RP prediction) from a computational

Abstract: The standard A/B testing approaches are mostly based on t-test in large scale

paper, we propose several approaches to addresses these challenges: (i)
regression adjustment, generalized estimating equation, Man-Whitney U and
Zero-Trimmed U that addresses each of these issues separately, and (ii) a novel
doubly robust generalized U that handles ROI consideration, distribution
robustness and small samples in one framework. We provide theoretical results
on asymptotic normality and efficiency bounds, together with insights on the
efficiency gain from theoretical analysis. We further conduct comprehensive
simulation studies and apply the methods to multiple real A/B tests.

industry applications. These standard approaches however suffers from low
statistical power in business settings, due to nature of small sample-size or
non-Gaussian distribution or return-on-investment (ROI) consideration. In this
paper, we propose several approaches to addresses these challenges: (i)
regression adjustment, generalized estimating equation, Man-Whitney U and
Zero-Trimmed U that addresses each of these issues separately, and (ii) a novel
doubly robust generalized U that handles ROI consideration, distribution
robustness and small samples in one framework. We provide theoretical results
on asymptotic normality and efficiency bounds, together with insights on the
efficiency gain from theoretical analysis. We further conduct comprehensive
simulation studies and apply the methods to multiple real A/B tests.

*Kourosh Shahnazari,Seyed Moein Ayyoubzadeh*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 该研究通过构建多维相似性网络，模拟古典波斯诗人的影响力动态，结合语义、词汇、风格、主题和韵律特征，识别关键诗人、风格枢纽和桥梁诗人，并通过社区检测算法揭示文学流派。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过计算模型揭示波斯诗人之间的影响力动态，结合文学研究与计算语言学，提供数据驱动的视角。

Method: 使用Ganjoor语料库构建多维度相似性网络，计算中心性指标，并应用Louvain社区检测算法。

Result: 识别出关键诗人、风格枢纽和桥梁诗人，揭示了与已知文学流派（如Sabk-e Hindi）对应的诗人集群。

Conclusion: 该模型为波斯文学传统提供了可解释且可扩展的计算视角，突出了结构上重要但知名度较低的诗人。

Abstract: This study formalizes a computational model to simulate classical Persian
poets' dynamics of influence through constructing a multi-dimensional
similarity network. Using a rigorously curated dataset based on Ganjoor's
corpus, we draw upon semantic, lexical, stylistic, thematic, and metrical
features to demarcate each poet's corpus. Each is contained within weighted
similarity matrices, which are then appended to generate an aggregate graph
showing poet-to-poet influence. Further network investigation is carried out to
identify key poets, style hubs, and bridging poets by calculating degree,
closeness, betweenness, eigenvector, and Katz centrality measures. Further, for
typological insight, we use the Louvain community detection algorithm to
demarcate clusters of poets sharing both style and theme coherence, which
correspond closely to acknowledged schools of literature like Sabk-e Hindi,
Sabk-e Khorasani, and the Bazgasht-e Adabi phenomenon. Our findings provide a
new data-driven view of Persian literature distinguished between canonical
significance and interextual influence, thus highlighting relatively
lesser-known figures who hold great structural significance. Combining
computational linguistics with literary study, this paper produces an
interpretable and scalable model for poetic tradition, enabling retrospective
reflection as well as forward-looking research within digital humanities.

Abstract: In today's digital environment, the rapid propagation of fake news via social
networks poses significant social challenges. Most existing detection methods
either employ traditional classification models, which suffer from low
interpretability and limited generalization capabilities, or craft specific
prompts for large language models (LLMs) to produce explanations and results
directly, failing to leverage LLMs' reasoning abilities fully. Inspired by the
saying that "truth becomes clearer through debate," our study introduces a
novel multi-agent system with LLMs named TruEDebate (TED) to enhance the
interpretability and effectiveness of fake news detection. TED employs a
rigorous debate process inspired by formal debate settings. Central to our
approach are two innovative components: the DebateFlow Agents and the
InsightFlow Agents. The DebateFlow Agents organize agents into two teams, where
one supports and the other challenges the truth of the news. These agents
engage in opening statements, cross-examination, rebuttal, and closing
statements, simulating a rigorous debate process akin to human discourse
analysis, allowing for a thorough evaluation of news content. Concurrently, the
InsightFlow Agents consist of two specialized sub-agents: the Synthesis Agent
and the Analysis Agent. The Synthesis Agent summarizes the debates and provides
an overarching viewpoint, ensuring a coherent and comprehensive evaluation. The
Analysis Agent, which includes a role-aware encoder and a debate graph,
integrates role embeddings and models the interactions between debate roles and
arguments using an attention mechanism, providing the final judgment.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合生成模型，用于高效采样高维多模态概率分布，解决了传统蒙特卡洛方法在多模态分布中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统蒙特卡洛方法（如Metropolis-Hastings和Langevin Monte Carlo）在高维多模态分布中难以正确采样各模态比例，尤其是模态分离明显的情况。

Method: 采用分治策略：1）通过能量函数最小化识别所有模态；2）训练分类器分割各模态域；3）为每个模态训练扩散模型辅助的生成模型；4）使用桥采样估计归一化常数以调整模态比例。

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法能有效处理100维内不同形状的多模态分布，并在偏微分方程贝叶斯反问题中得到应用。

Conclusion: 提出的混合生成模型为高维多模态分布采样提供了高效解决方案，尤其在模态分离明显的场景中表现优异。

Abstract: We propose a hybrid generative model for efficient sampling of
high-dimensional, multimodal probability distributions for Bayesian inference.
Traditional Monte Carlo methods, such as the Metropolis-Hastings and Langevin
Monte Carlo sampling methods, are effective for sampling from single-mode
distributions in high-dimensional spaces. However, these methods struggle to
produce samples with the correct proportions for each mode in multimodal
distributions, especially for distributions with well separated modes. To
address the challenges posed by multimodality, we adopt a divide-and-conquer
strategy. We start by minimizing the energy function with initial guesses
uniformly distributed within the prior domain to identify all the modes of the
energy function. Then, we train a classifier to segment the domain
corresponding to each mode. After the domain decomposition, we train a
diffusion-model-assisted generative model for each identified mode within its
support. Once each mode is characterized, we employ bridge sampling to estimate
the normalizing constant, allowing us to directly adjust the ratios between the
modes. Our numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed framework can
effectively handle multimodal distributions with varying mode shapes in up to
100 dimensions. An application to Bayesian inverse problem for partial
differential equations is also provided.

Motivation: 在非参数框架下，分布鲁棒优化的研究较少，且模型误设可能影响泛化性能，因此需要深入分析。

Method: 通过分析分布扰动引起的正则化效应，并使用带Lipschitz约束的前馈神经网络，建立非渐近误差界。

Result: 误差界揭示了不确定性水平和神经网络结构对泛化性能的影响，并适用于Lipschitz和二次损失函数。

Conclusion: 提出的估计器在模拟研究和MNIST数据集应用中表现出鲁棒性。

Abstract: Distributionally robust optimization has become a powerful tool for
prediction and decision-making under model uncertainty. By focusing on the
local worst-case risk, it enhances robustness by identifying the most
unfavorable distribution within a predefined ambiguity set. While extensive
research has been conducted in parametric settings, studies on nonparametric
frameworks remain limited. This paper studies the generalization properties of
Wasserstein distributionally robust nonparametric estimators, with particular
attention to the impact of model misspecification, where non-negligible
discrepancies between the estimation function space and target function can
impair generalization performance. We establish non-asymptotic error bounds for
the excess local worst-case risk by analyzing the regularization effects
induced by distributional perturbations and employing feedforward neural
networks with Lipschitz constraints. These bounds illustrate how uncertainty
levels and neural network structures influence generalization performance and
are applicable to both Lipschitz and quadratic loss functions. Furthermore, we
investigate the Lagrangian relaxation of the local worst-case risk and derive
corresponding non-asymptotic error bounds for these estimators. The robustness
of the proposed estimator is evaluated through simulation studies and
illustrated with an application to the MNIST dataset.

Abstract: Federated Learning has gained traction in privacy-sensitive collaborative
environments, with local SGD emerging as a key optimization method in
decentralized settings. While its convergence properties are well-studied,
asymptotic statistical guarantees beyond convergence remain limited. In this
paper, we present two generalized Gaussian approximation results for local SGD
and explore their implications. First, we prove a Berry-Esseen theorem for the
final local SGD iterates, enabling valid multiplier bootstrap procedures.
Second, motivated by robustness considerations, we introduce two distinct
time-uniform Gaussian approximations for the entire trajectory of local SGD.
The time-uniform approximations support Gaussian bootstrap-based tests for
detecting adversarial attacks. Extensive simulations are provided to support
our theoretical results.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is essential for trustworthy
machine learning (ML), particularly in high-stakes domains such as healthcare
and finance. Shapley value (SV) methods provide a principled framework for
feature attribution in complex models but incur high computational costs,
limiting their scalability in high-dimensional settings. We propose Stochastic
Iterative Momentum for Shapley Value Approximation (SIM-Shapley), a stable and
efficient SV approximation method inspired by stochastic optimization. We
analyze variance theoretically, prove linear $Q$-convergence, and demonstrate
improved empirical stability and low bias in practice on real-world datasets.
In our numerical experiments, SIM-Shapley reduces computation time by up to 85%
relative to state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining comparable feature
attribution quality. Beyond feature attribution, our stochastic mini-batch
iterative framework extends naturally to a broader class of sample average
approximation problems, offering a new avenue for improving computational
efficiency with stability guarantees. Code is publicly available at

has been given to continuous symmetry discovery using vector fields which serve
as infinitesimal generators for Lie group symmetries. In this paper, we extend
the notion of non-affine symmetry discovery to functions defined by neural

Conclusion: 经典核方法能够实现类似神经网络的功能，为理解神经网络的成功提供了新视角。

Abstract: The impressive practical performance of neural networks is often attributed
to their ability to learn low-dimensional data representations and hierarchical
structure directly from data. In this work, we argue that these two phenomena
are not unique to neural networks, and can be elicited from classical kernel
methods. Namely, we show that the derivative of the kernel predictor can detect
the influential coordinates with low sample complexity. Moreover, by
iteratively using the derivatives to reweight the data and retrain kernel
machines, one is able to efficiently learn hierarchical polynomials with finite
leap complexity. Numerical experiments illustrate the developed theory.

Motivation: 精准医学中，许多治疗伴随副作用，可能导致患者承受不必要的风险，因此需要控制治疗风险。

Method: 提出了一种认证学习方法，能够在有限样本下控制治疗风险，适用于部分可识别设置。

Result: 方法在模拟和真实数据中均得到验证。

Conclusion: 该方法为精准医学中的治疗分配问题提供了一种可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Learning beneficial treatment allocations for a patient population is an
important problem in precision medicine. Many treatments come with adverse side
effects that are not commensurable with their potential benefits. Patients who
do not receive benefits after such treatments are thereby subjected to
unnecessary harm. This is a `treatment risk' that we aim to control when
learning beneficial allocations. The constrained learning problem is challenged
by the fact that the treatment risk is not in general identifiable using either
randomized trial or observational data. We propose a certifiable learning
method that controls the treatment risk with finite samples in the partially
identified setting. The method is illustrated using both simulated and real
data.

Abstract: Nowadays, Neural Networks are considered one of the most effective methods
for various tasks such as anomaly detection, computer-aided disease detection,
or natural language processing. However, these networks suffer from the
``black-box'' problem which makes it difficult to understand how they make
decisions. In order to solve this issue, an R package called neuralGAM is
introduced. This package implements a Neural Network topology based on
Generalized Additive Models, allowing to fit an independent Neural Network to
estimate the contribution of each feature to the output variable, yielding a
highly accurate and interpretable Deep Learning model. The neuralGAM package
provides a flexible framework for training Generalized Additive Neural
Networks, which does not impose any restrictions on the Neural Network
architecture. We illustrate the use of the neuralGAM package in both synthetic
and real data examples.

Result: 实验表明，该方法能在时间限制下快速、可靠地完成昂贵模型的贝叶斯推断。

Conclusion: UA-SABI为计算昂贵模型提供了一种高效且可靠的贝叶斯推断解决方案。

Abstract: Bayesian inference typically relies on a large number of model evaluations to
estimate posterior distributions. Established methods like Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) and Amortized Bayesian Inference (ABI) can become computationally
challenging. While ABI enables fast inference after training, generating
sufficient training data still requires thousands of model simulations, which
is infeasible for expensive models. Surrogate models offer a solution by
providing approximate simulations at a lower computational cost, allowing the
generation of large data sets for training. However, the introduced
approximation errors and uncertainties can lead to overconfident posterior
estimates. To address this, we propose Uncertainty-Aware Surrogate-based
Amortized Bayesian Inference (UA-SABI) - a framework that combines surrogate
modeling and ABI while explicitly quantifying and propagating surrogate
uncertainties through the inference pipeline. Our experiments show that this
approach enables reliable, fast, and repeated Bayesian inference for
computationally expensive models, even under tight time constraints.

Abstract: Modeling the continuous--time dynamics of probability distributions from
time--dependent data samples is a fundamental problem in many fields, including
digital health. The aim is to analyze how the distribution of a biomarker, such
as glucose, evolves over time and how these changes may reflect the progression
of chronic diseases such as diabetes. In this paper, we propose a novel
probabilistic model based on a mixture of Gaussian distributions to capture how
samples from a continuous-time stochastic process evolve over the time. To
model potential distribution shifts over time, we introduce a time-dependent
function parameterized by a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE)
and estimate it non--parametrically using the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD).
The proposed model is highly interpretable, detects subtle temporal shifts, and
remains computationally efficient. Through simulation studies, we show that it
performs competitively in terms of estimation accuracy against
state-of-the-art, less interpretable methods such as normalized gradient--flows
and non--parameteric kernel density estimators. Finally, we demonstrate the
utility of our method on digital clinical--trial data, showing how the
interventions alters the time-dependent distribution of glucose levels and
enabling a rigorous comparison of control and treatment groups from novel
mathematical and clinical perspectives.

<details>

Motivation: 传统UQ方法对模型误设不鲁棒，而共形推断不考虑模型选择导致区间过大，需改进。

Method: 基于PCS框架，通过预测检查筛选模型，多轮bootstrap评估变异性，提出新校准方案提高局部适应性。

Result: 在17个回归和6个分类数据集上，PCS-UQ覆盖率达标且区间宽度减少约20%；在深度学习模型中，计算高效方案减少20%预测集大小。

Conclusion: PCS-UQ在覆盖率和效率上优于传统方法，理论证明其变体满足共形推断的覆盖要求。

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) models are increasingly deployed in high-stakes
domains, trustworthy uncertainty quantification (UQ) is critical for ensuring
the safety and reliability of these models. Traditional UQ methods rely on
specifying a true generative model and are not robust to misspecification. On
the other hand, conformal inference allows for arbitrary ML models but does not
consider model selection, which leads to large interval sizes. We tackle these
drawbacks by proposing a UQ method based on the predictability, computability,
and stability (PCS) framework for veridical data science proposed by Yu and
Kumbier. Specifically, PCS-UQ addresses model selection by using a prediction
check to screen out unsuitable models. PCS-UQ then fits these screened
algorithms across multiple bootstraps to assess inter-sample variability and
algorithmic instability, enabling more reliable uncertainty estimates. Further,
we propose a novel calibration scheme that improves local adaptivity of our
prediction sets. Experiments across $17$ regression and $6$ classification
datasets show that PCS-UQ achieves the desired coverage and reduces width over
conformal approaches by $\approx 20\%$. Further, our local analysis shows
PCS-UQ often achieves target coverage across subgroups while conformal methods
fail to do so. For large deep-learning models, we propose computationally
efficient approximation schemes that avoid the expensive multiple bootstrap
trainings of PCS-UQ. Across three computer vision benchmarks, PCS-UQ reduces
prediction set size over conformal methods by $20\%$. Theoretically, we show a
modified PCS-UQ algorithm is a form of split conformal inference and achieves
the desired coverage with exchangeable data.

Abstract: We propose a hybrid generative model for efficient sampling of
high-dimensional, multimodal probability distributions for Bayesian inference.
Traditional Monte Carlo methods, such as the Metropolis-Hastings and Langevin
Monte Carlo sampling methods, are effective for sampling from single-mode
distributions in high-dimensional spaces. However, these methods struggle to
produce samples with the correct proportions for each mode in multimodal
distributions, especially for distributions with well separated modes. To
address the challenges posed by multimodality, we adopt a divide-and-conquer
strategy. We start by minimizing the energy function with initial guesses
uniformly distributed within the prior domain to identify all the modes of the
energy function. Then, we train a classifier to segment the domain
corresponding to each mode. After the domain decomposition, we train a
diffusion-model-assisted generative model for each identified mode within its
support. Once each mode is characterized, we employ bridge sampling to estimate
the normalizing constant, allowing us to directly adjust the ratios between the
modes. Our numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed framework can
effectively handle multimodal distributions with varying mode shapes in up to
100 dimensions. An application to Bayesian inverse problem for partial
differential equations is also provided.

Conclusion: 通过模拟研究和MNIST数据集的应用验证了所提估计器的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Distributionally robust optimization has become a powerful tool for
prediction and decision-making under model uncertainty. By focusing on the
local worst-case risk, it enhances robustness by identifying the most
unfavorable distribution within a predefined ambiguity set. While extensive
research has been conducted in parametric settings, studies on nonparametric
frameworks remain limited. This paper studies the generalization properties of
Wasserstein distributionally robust nonparametric estimators, with particular
attention to the impact of model misspecification, where non-negligible
discrepancies between the estimation function space and target function can
impair generalization performance. We establish non-asymptotic error bounds for
the excess local worst-case risk by analyzing the regularization effects
induced by distributional perturbations and employing feedforward neural
networks with Lipschitz constraints. These bounds illustrate how uncertainty
levels and neural network structures influence generalization performance and
are applicable to both Lipschitz and quadratic loss functions. Furthermore, we
investigate the Lagrangian relaxation of the local worst-case risk and derive
corresponding non-asymptotic error bounds for these estimators. The robustness
of the proposed estimator is evaluated through simulation studies and
illustrated with an application to the MNIST dataset.

Abstract: Federated Learning has gained traction in privacy-sensitive collaborative
environments, with local SGD emerging as a key optimization method in
decentralized settings. While its convergence properties are well-studied,
asymptotic statistical guarantees beyond convergence remain limited. In this
paper, we present two generalized Gaussian approximation results for local SGD
and explore their implications. First, we prove a Berry-Esseen theorem for the
final local SGD iterates, enabling valid multiplier bootstrap procedures.
Second, motivated by robustness considerations, we introduce two distinct
time-uniform Gaussian approximations for the entire trajectory of local SGD.
The time-uniform approximations support Gaussian bootstrap-based tests for
detecting adversarial attacks. Extensive simulations are provided to support
our theoretical results.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is essential for trustworthy
machine learning (ML), particularly in high-stakes domains such as healthcare
and finance. Shapley value (SV) methods provide a principled framework for
feature attribution in complex models but incur high computational costs,
limiting their scalability in high-dimensional settings. We propose Stochastic
Iterative Momentum for Shapley Value Approximation (SIM-Shapley), a stable and
efficient SV approximation method inspired by stochastic optimization. We
analyze variance theoretically, prove linear $Q$-convergence, and demonstrate
improved empirical stability and low bias in practice on real-world datasets.
In our numerical experiments, SIM-Shapley reduces computation time by up to 85%
relative to state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining comparable feature
attribution quality. Beyond feature attribution, our stochastic mini-batch
iterative framework extends naturally to a broader class of sample average
approximation problems, offering a new avenue for improving computational
efficiency with stability guarantees. Code is publicly available at

Conclusion: 经典核方法在低维数据表示和分层结构学习上具有与神经网络相当的能力。

Abstract: The impressive practical performance of neural networks is often attributed
to their ability to learn low-dimensional data representations and hierarchical
structure directly from data. In this work, we argue that these two phenomena
are not unique to neural networks, and can be elicited from classical kernel
methods. Namely, we show that the derivative of the kernel predictor can detect
the influential coordinates with low sample complexity. Moreover, by
iteratively using the derivatives to reweight the data and retrain kernel
machines, one is able to efficiently learn hierarchical polynomials with finite
leap complexity. Numerical experiments illustrate the developed theory.

Motivation: 精准医疗中，许多治疗伴随不可忽视的副作用，患者可能因无效治疗受到不必要伤害，因此需要控制治疗风险。

Method: 提出了一种可认证的学习方法，在部分可识别设置中利用有限样本控制治疗风险。

Result: 方法在模拟和真实数据中均得到验证。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效控制治疗风险，适用于精准医疗中的治疗分配问题。

Abstract: Learning beneficial treatment allocations for a patient population is an
important problem in precision medicine. Many treatments come with adverse side
effects that are not commensurable with their potential benefits. Patients who
do not receive benefits after such treatments are thereby subjected to
unnecessary harm. This is a `treatment risk' that we aim to control when
learning beneficial allocations. The constrained learning problem is challenged
by the fact that the treatment risk is not in general identifiable using either
randomized trial or observational data. We propose a certifiable learning
method that controls the treatment risk with finite samples in the partially
identified setting. The method is illustrated using both simulated and real
data.

Abstract: Nowadays, Neural Networks are considered one of the most effective methods
for various tasks such as anomaly detection, computer-aided disease detection,
or natural language processing. However, these networks suffer from the
``black-box'' problem which makes it difficult to understand how they make
decisions. In order to solve this issue, an R package called neuralGAM is
introduced. This package implements a Neural Network topology based on
Generalized Additive Models, allowing to fit an independent Neural Network to
estimate the contribution of each feature to the output variable, yielding a
highly accurate and interpretable Deep Learning model. The neuralGAM package
provides a flexible framework for training Generalized Additive Neural
Networks, which does not impose any restrictions on the Neural Network
architecture. We illustrate the use of the neuralGAM package in both synthetic
and real data examples.

Result: 实验表明，该方法能在时间限制下实现快速、可靠的贝叶斯推理。

Conclusion: UA-SABI为计算昂贵模型提供了一种高效且可靠的贝叶斯推理解决方案。

Abstract: Bayesian inference typically relies on a large number of model evaluations to
estimate posterior distributions. Established methods like Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) and Amortized Bayesian Inference (ABI) can become computationally
challenging. While ABI enables fast inference after training, generating
sufficient training data still requires thousands of model simulations, which
is infeasible for expensive models. Surrogate models offer a solution by
providing approximate simulations at a lower computational cost, allowing the
generation of large data sets for training. However, the introduced
approximation errors and uncertainties can lead to overconfident posterior
estimates. To address this, we propose Uncertainty-Aware Surrogate-based
Amortized Bayesian Inference (UA-SABI) - a framework that combines surrogate
modeling and ABI while explicitly quantifying and propagating surrogate
uncertainties through the inference pipeline. Our experiments show that this
approach enables reliable, fast, and repeated Bayesian inference for
computationally expensive models, even under tight time constraints.

Abstract: Modeling the continuous--time dynamics of probability distributions from
time--dependent data samples is a fundamental problem in many fields, including
digital health. The aim is to analyze how the distribution of a biomarker, such
as glucose, evolves over time and how these changes may reflect the progression
of chronic diseases such as diabetes. In this paper, we propose a novel
probabilistic model based on a mixture of Gaussian distributions to capture how
samples from a continuous-time stochastic process evolve over the time. To
model potential distribution shifts over time, we introduce a time-dependent
function parameterized by a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE)
and estimate it non--parametrically using the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD).
The proposed model is highly interpretable, detects subtle temporal shifts, and
remains computationally efficient. Through simulation studies, we show that it
performs competitively in terms of estimation accuracy against
state-of-the-art, less interpretable methods such as normalized gradient--flows
and non--parameteric kernel density estimators. Finally, we demonstrate the
utility of our method on digital clinical--trial data, showing how the
interventions alters the time-dependent distribution of glucose levels and
enabling a rigorous comparison of control and treatment groups from novel
mathematical and clinical perspectives.

Motivation: 机器学习模型在高风险领域部署时，需要可靠的不确定性量化（UQ）以确保安全性和可靠性。传统UQ方法对模型设定敏感，而现有方法如共形推断未考虑模型选择。

Method: 基于PCS框架，通过预测检查筛选模型，利用多轮bootstrap评估样本间变异性和算法不稳定性，并提出局部校准方案。

Result: 在17个回归和6个分类数据集上，PCS-UQ覆盖率达标且区间宽度比共形方法减少约20%。在深度学习中，计算效率优化方案进一步减少20%的预测集大小。

Conclusion: PCS-UQ通过模型选择和局部校准显著提升了不确定性量化的可靠性，适用于传统和深度学习模型。

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) models are increasingly deployed in high-stakes
domains, trustworthy uncertainty quantification (UQ) is critical for ensuring
the safety and reliability of these models. Traditional UQ methods rely on
specifying a true generative model and are not robust to misspecification. On
the other hand, conformal inference allows for arbitrary ML models but does not
consider model selection, which leads to large interval sizes. We tackle these
drawbacks by proposing a UQ method based on the predictability, computability,
and stability (PCS) framework for veridical data science proposed by Yu and
Kumbier. Specifically, PCS-UQ addresses model selection by using a prediction
check to screen out unsuitable models. PCS-UQ then fits these screened
algorithms across multiple bootstraps to assess inter-sample variability and
algorithmic instability, enabling more reliable uncertainty estimates. Further,
we propose a novel calibration scheme that improves local adaptivity of our
prediction sets. Experiments across $17$ regression and $6$ classification
datasets show that PCS-UQ achieves the desired coverage and reduces width over
conformal approaches by $\approx 20\%$. Further, our local analysis shows
PCS-UQ often achieves target coverage across subgroups while conformal methods
fail to do so. For large deep-learning models, we propose computationally
efficient approximation schemes that avoid the expensive multiple bootstrap
trainings of PCS-UQ. Across three computer vision benchmarks, PCS-UQ reduces
prediction set size over conformal methods by $20\%$. Theoretically, we show a
modified PCS-UQ algorithm is a form of split conformal inference and achieves
the desired coverage with exchangeable data.

Abstract: Millions of users leverage generative pretrained transformer (GPT)-based
language models developed by leading model providers for a wide range of tasks.
To support enhanced user interaction and customization, many platforms-such as
OpenAI-now enable developers to create and publish tailored model instances,
known as custom GPTs, via dedicated repositories or application stores. These
custom GPTs empower users to browse and interact with specialized applications
designed to meet specific needs. However, as custom GPTs see growing adoption,
concerns regarding their security vulnerabilities have intensified. Existing
research on these vulnerabilities remains largely theoretical, often lacking
empirical, large-scale, and statistically rigorous assessments of associated
risks.
  In this study, we analyze 14,904 custom GPTs to assess their susceptibility
to seven exploitable threats, such as roleplay-based attacks, system prompt
leakage, phishing content generation, and malicious code synthesis, across
various categories and popularity tiers within the OpenAI marketplace. We
introduce a multi-metric ranking system to examine the relationship between a
custom GPT's popularity and its associated security risks.
  Our findings reveal that over 95% of custom GPTs lack adequate security
protections. The most prevalent vulnerabilities include roleplay-based
vulnerabilities (96.51%), system prompt leakage (92.20%), and phishing
(91.22%). Furthermore, we demonstrate that OpenAI's foundational models exhibit
inherent security weaknesses, which are often inherited or amplified in custom
GPTs. These results highlight the urgent need for enhanced security measures
and stricter content moderation to ensure the safe deployment of GPT-based

### [594] [Where the Devil Hides: Deepfake Detectors Can No Longer Be Trusted](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08255)
*Shuaiwei Yuan,Junyu Dong,Yuezun Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文探讨了第三方数据提供者可能通过投毒数据在Deepfake检测器中植入后门的风险，并提出了一种生成隐蔽且有效触发器的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI生成技术的发展，Deepfake检测器依赖第三方数据训练可能面临数据投毒的安全风险，导致检测器被植入后门，影响其可靠性。

Method: 开发了一种触发器生成器，可合成密码控制、语义抑制、自适应且不可见的触发器模式，并通过脏标签和干净标签两种投毒场景植入后门。

Result: 实验证明该方法在隐蔽性、有效性和实用性上优于多个基线。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了Deepfake检测器的潜在安全风险，并提供了解决方案，强调了数据来源安全的重要性。

Abstract: With the advancement of AI generative techniques, Deepfake faces have become
incredibly realistic and nearly indistinguishable to the human eye. To counter
this, Deepfake detectors have been developed as reliable tools for assessing
face authenticity. These detectors are typically developed on Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) and trained using third-party datasets. However, this protocol
raises a new security risk that can seriously undermine the trustfulness of
Deepfake detectors: Once the third-party data providers insert poisoned
(corrupted) data maliciously, Deepfake detectors trained on these datasets will
be injected ``backdoors'' that cause abnormal behavior when presented with
samples containing specific triggers. This is a practical concern, as
third-party providers may distribute or sell these triggers to malicious users,
allowing them to manipulate detector performance and escape accountability.
  This paper investigates this risk in depth and describes a solution to
stealthily infect Deepfake detectors. Specifically, we develop a trigger
generator, that can synthesize passcode-controlled, semantic-suppression,
adaptive, and invisible trigger patterns, ensuring both the stealthiness and
effectiveness of these triggers. Then we discuss two poisoning scenarios,
dirty-label poisoning and clean-label poisoning, to accomplish the injection of
backdoors. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, stealthiness,
and practicality of our method compared to several baselines.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了智能电表和燃气表的先进计量基础设施（AMI）数据隐私问题，提出结合多种隐私保护技术的混合架构，以满足加州隐私法规和FIPPs要求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能电表和燃气表数据虽具价值，但隐私问题突出，需在合规前提下实现数据分析。

Method: 综合数据匿名化、隐私保护机器学习（差分隐私和联邦学习）、合成数据生成及加密技术（安全多方计算、同态加密），提出混合架构。

Result: 评估了各技术的理论基础与效果，提出满足实际需求的架构，确保隐私保护与数据分析的平衡。

Conclusion: 为公用事业数据科学家提供了隐私设计的蓝图，支持创新与合规并重。

Abstract: Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) data from smart electric and gas
meters enables valuable insights for utilities and consumers, but also raises
significant privacy concerns. In California, regulatory decisions (CPUC
D.11-07-056 and D.11-08-045) mandate strict privacy protections for customer
energy usage data, guided by the Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPs).
We comprehensively explore solutions drawn from data anonymization,
privacy-preserving machine learning (differential privacy and federated
learning), synthetic data generation, and cryptographic techniques (secure
multiparty computation, homomorphic encryption). This allows advanced
analytics, including machine learning models, statistical and econometric
analysis on energy consumption data, to be performed without compromising
individual privacy.
  We evaluate each technique's theoretical foundations, effectiveness, and
trade-offs in the context of utility data analytics, and we propose an
integrated architecture that combines these methods to meet real-world needs.
The proposed hybrid architecture is designed to ensure compliance with
California's privacy rules and FIPPs while enabling useful analytics, from
forecasting and personalized insights to academic research and econometrics,
while strictly protecting individual privacy. Mathematical definitions and
derivations are provided where appropriate to demonstrate privacy guarantees
and utility implications rigorously. We include comparative evaluations of the
techniques, an architecture diagram, and flowcharts to illustrate how they work
together in practice. The result is a blueprint for utility data scientists and
engineers to implement privacy-by-design in AMI data handling, supporting both
data-driven innovation and strict regulatory compliance.

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the de facto industry
standard for user-facing NLP applications, offering the ability to integrate
data without re-training or fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs). This
capability enhances the quality and accuracy of responses but also introduces
novel security and privacy challenges, particularly when sensitive data is
integrated. With the rapid adoption of RAG, securing data and services has
become a critical priority. This paper first reviews the vulnerabilities of RAG
pipelines, and outlines the attack surface from data pre-processing and data
storage management to integration with LLMs. The identified risks are then
paired with corresponding mitigations in a structured overview. In a second
step, the paper develops a framework that combines RAG-specific security
considerations, with existing general security guidelines, industry standards,
and best practices. The proposed framework aims to guide the implementation of
robust, compliant, secure, and trustworthy RAG systems.

Abstract: Millions of users leverage generative pretrained transformer (GPT)-based
language models developed by leading model providers for a wide range of tasks.
To support enhanced user interaction and customization, many platforms-such as
OpenAI-now enable developers to create and publish tailored model instances,
known as custom GPTs, via dedicated repositories or application stores. These
custom GPTs empower users to browse and interact with specialized applications
designed to meet specific needs. However, as custom GPTs see growing adoption,
concerns regarding their security vulnerabilities have intensified. Existing
research on these vulnerabilities remains largely theoretical, often lacking
empirical, large-scale, and statistically rigorous assessments of associated
risks.
  In this study, we analyze 14,904 custom GPTs to assess their susceptibility
to seven exploitable threats, such as roleplay-based attacks, system prompt
leakage, phishing content generation, and malicious code synthesis, across
various categories and popularity tiers within the OpenAI marketplace. We
introduce a multi-metric ranking system to examine the relationship between a

Main category: cs.DL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个名为SciCom Wiki的协作平台，旨在支持科学传播知识基础设施（SciCom KI），通过FAIR原则管理非文本媒体内容，并开发了一种神经符号计算事实核查工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 民主社会需要可靠的信息来源，但视频和播客等非文本媒体既是信息传播的主要载体，也是错误信息的传播渠道。现有的SciCom KI系统尚未完善，无法应对内容泛滥的挑战。

Method: 通过调查53位利益相关者的需求，并在11次访谈中细化这些需求，开发了一个基于Wikibase的开源服务平台。针对最需要的功能——事实核查，开发了一种神经符号计算方法，将异构媒体转换为知识图谱。

Result: 原型系统通过14位参与者的评估，事实核查工具通过10次专家访谈和43位用户的公开调查验证了其必要性和可用性。

Conclusion: SciCom Wiki及其事实核查框架能够满足需求，但SciCom KI在FAIR知识和协作系统方面仍显不足，需要进一步协作以应对信息泛滥。

Abstract: Democratic societies need accessible, reliable information. Videos and
Podcasts have established themselves as the medium of choice for civic
dissemination, but also as carriers of misinformation. The emerging Science
Communication Knowledge Infrastructure (SciCom KI) curating non-textual media
is still fragmented and not adequately equipped to scale against the content
flood. Our work sets out to support the SciCom KI with a central, collaborative
platform, the SciCom Wiki, to facilitate FAIR (findable, accessible,
interoperable, reusable) media representation and the fact-checking of their
content, particularly for videos and podcasts. Building an open-source service
system centered around Wikibase, we survey requirements from 53 stakeholders,
refine these in 11 interviews, and evaluate our prototype based on these
requirements with another 14 participants. To address the most requested
feature, fact-checking, we developed a neurosymbolic computational
fact-checking approach, converting heterogenous media into knowledge graphs.
This increases machine-readability and allows comparing statements against
equally represented ground-truth. Our computational fact-checking tool was
iteratively evaluated through 10 expert interviews, a public user survey with
43 participants verified the necessity and usability of our tool. Overall, our
findings identified several needs to systematically support the SciCom KI. The
SciCom Wiki, as a FAIR digital library complementing our neurosymbolic
computational fact-checking framework, was found suitable to address the raised
requirements. Further, we identified that the SciCom KI is severely
underdeveloped regarding FAIR knowledge and related systems facilitating its
collaborative creation and curation. Our system can provide a central knowledge
node, yet a collaborative effort is required to scale against the imminent
(mis-)information flood.

Motivation: 通过结合光子量子计算的表达能力和经典神经网络的可部署性，探索一种参数高效的训练方法，同时解决量子硬件在推理阶段的限制。

Method: 利用光子QNNs生成高维概率分布，并通过MPS模型映射到经典网络权重，实现参数压缩和高效训练。

Result: 在MNIST分类任务中，该框架以3,292参数（χ=10）达到95.50%±0.84%的准确率，接近经典基线（96.89%±0.31%，6,690参数）。在χ=4时实现10倍压缩，准确率损失小于3%。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了光子量子计算在分布式量子机器学习中的实用性，结合了光子希尔伯特空间的表达能力和经典神经网络的可部署性。

Abstract: We introduce a distributed quantum-classical framework that synergizes
photonic quantum neural networks (QNNs) with matrix-product-state (MPS) mapping
to achieve parameter-efficient training of classical neural networks. By
leveraging universal linear-optical decompositions of $M$-mode interferometers
and photon-counting measurement statistics, our architecture generates neural
parameters through a hybrid quantum-classical workflow: photonic QNNs with
$M(M+1)/2$ trainable parameters produce high-dimensional probability
distributions that are mapped to classical network weights via an MPS model
with bond dimension $\chi$. Empirical validation on MNIST classification
demonstrates that photonic QT achieves an accuracy of $95.50\% \pm 0.84\%$
using 3,292 parameters ($\chi = 10$), compared to $96.89\% \pm 0.31\%$ for
classical baselines with 6,690 parameters. Moreover, a ten-fold compression
ratio is achieved at $\chi = 4$, with a relative accuracy loss of less than
$3\%$. The framework outperforms classical compression techniques (weight
sharing/pruning) by 6--12\% absolute accuracy while eliminating quantum
hardware requirements during inference through classical deployment of
compressed parameters. Simulations incorporating realistic photonic noise
demonstrate the framework's robustness to near-term hardware imperfections.
Ablation studies confirm quantum necessity: replacing photonic QNNs with random
inputs collapses accuracy to chance level ($10.0\% \pm 0.5\%$). Photonic
quantum computing's room-temperature operation, inherent scalability through
spatial-mode multiplexing, and HPC-integrated architecture establish a
practical pathway for distributed quantum machine learning, combining the
expressivity of photonic Hilbert spaces with the deployability of classical

Abstract: As large-scale social data explode and machine-learning methods evolve,
scholars of entrepreneurship and innovation face new research opportunities but
also unique challenges. This chapter discusses the difficulties of leveraging
large-scale data to identify technological and commercial novelty, document new
venture origins, and forecast competition between new technologies and
commercial forms. It suggests how scholars can take advantage of new text,
network, image, audio, and video data in two distinct ways that advance
innovation and entrepreneurship research. First, machine-learning models,
combined with large-scale data, enable the construction of precision
measurements that function as system-level observatories of innovation and
entrepreneurship across human societies. Second, new artificial intelligence
models fueled by big data generate 'digital doubles' of technology and
business, forming laboratories for virtual experimentation about innovation and
entrepreneurship processes and policies. The chapter argues for the advancement
of theory development and testing in entrepreneurship and innovation by
coupling big data with big models.

TL;DR: CellVerse是一个新的语言驱动的单细胞分析基准测试，评估了14种LLMs在细胞生物学任务中的表现，发现现有模型仍有显著改进空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究未全面评估LLMs在语言驱动的单细胞分析任务中的表现，CellVerse填补了这一空白。

Method: 引入CellVerse基准测试，整合四种单细胞多组学数据，评估14种LLMs在三个层次任务中的表现。

Result: 现有专家模型表现不佳，通用模型初步具备细胞生物学理解能力，但整体性能仍有较大提升空间。

Conclusion: CellVerse揭示了LLMs在细胞生物学应用中的挑战，为下一代单细胞分析奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of modeling single-cell data
as natural languages and the potential of leveraging powerful large language
models (LLMs) for understanding cell biology. However, a comprehensive
evaluation of LLMs' performance on language-driven single-cell analysis tasks
still remains unexplored. Motivated by this challenge, we introduce CellVerse,
a unified language-centric question-answering benchmark that integrates four
types of single-cell multi-omics data and encompasses three hierarchical levels
of single-cell analysis tasks: cell type annotation (cell-level), drug response
prediction (drug-level), and perturbation analysis (gene-level). Going beyond
this, we systematically evaluate the performance across 14 open-source and
closed-source LLMs ranging from 160M to 671B on CellVerse. Remarkably, the
experimental results reveal: (1) Existing specialist models (C2S-Pythia) fail
to make reasonable decisions across all sub-tasks within CellVerse, while
generalist models such as Qwen, Llama, GPT, and DeepSeek family models exhibit
preliminary understanding capabilities within the realm of cell biology. (2)
The performance of current LLMs falls short of expectations and has substantial
room for improvement. Notably, in the widely studied drug response prediction
task, none of the evaluated LLMs demonstrate significant performance
improvement over random guessing. CellVerse offers the first large-scale
empirical demonstration that significant challenges still remain in applying
LLMs to cell biology. By introducing CellVerse, we lay the foundation for
advancing cell biology through natural languages and hope this paradigm could
facilitate next-generation single-cell analysis.

Motivation: 传统单分子荧光数据分析流程依赖人工经验和手动阈值，限制了可扩展性和可重复性。

Method: 提出DASH架构，实现轨迹分类、状态分配和自动排序，无需用户干预。

Result: DASH在Cas12a介导的DNA切割等系统中表现出鲁棒性能。

Conclusion: DASH为单分子水平生物动力学结构变化研究提供了自动化和详细的分析策略。

Abstract: Single-molecule fluorescence assays enable high-resolution analysis of
biomolecular dynamics, but traditional analysis pipelines are labor-intensive

deep learning models have automated aspects of data processing, yet many still

Therefore, we present DASH, a fully streamlined architecture for trace
classification, state assignment, and automatic sorting that requires no user
input. DASH demonstrates robust performance across users and experimental
conditions both in equilibrium and non-equilibrium systems such as
Cas12a-mediated DNA cleavage. This paper proposes a novel strategy for the
automatic and detailed sorting of single-molecule fluorescence events. The
dynamic cleavage process of Cas12a is used as an example to provide a
comprehensive analysis. This approach is crucial for studying biokinetic
structural changes at the single-molecule level.

Abstract: This study conducts a Quantitative Structure Property Relationship (QSPR)
analysis to explore the correlation between the physical properties of drug
molecules and their topological indices using machine learning techniques.
While prior studies in drug design have focused on degree-based topological
indices, this work analyzes a dataset of 166 drug molecules by computing
degree-distance-based topological indices, incorporating vertex-edge weightings
with respect to different six atomic properties (atomic number, atomic radius,
atomic mass, density, electronegativity, ionization). Both linear models
(Linear Regression, Lasso, and Ridge Regression) and nonlinear approaches
(Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks) were employed to predict
molecular properties. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of these
indices in predicting specific physicochemical properties and underscore the
practical relevance of computational methods in molecular property estimation.
The study provides an innovative perspective on integrating topological indices
with machine learning to enhance predictive accuracy, highlighting their
potential application in drug discovery and development processes. This
predictive may also explain that establishing a reliable relationship between
topological indices and physical properties enables chemists to gain
preliminary insights into molecular behavior before conducting experimental
analyses, thereby optimizing resource utilization in cheminformatics research.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在可合成性控制上的不足，尤其是合成路线的灵活性和反应约束的整合。

Conclusion: 展示了预训练模型在严格可合成性约束下生成优化小分子的潜力。

Abstract: Synthesizability in small molecule generative design remains a bottleneck.
Existing works that do consider synthesizability can output predicted synthesis
routes for generated molecules. However, there has been minimal attention in
addressing the ease of synthesis and enabling flexibility to incorporate
desired reaction constraints. In this work, we propose a small molecule
generative design framework that enables steerable and granular
synthesizability control. Generated molecules satisfy arbitrary multi-parameter
optimization objectives with predicted synthesis routes containing pre-defined
allowed reactions, while optionally avoiding others. One can also enforce that
all reactions belong to a pre-defined set. We show the capability to
mix-and-match these reaction constraints across the most common medicinal
chemistry transformations. Next, we show how our framework can be used to
valorize industrial byproducts towards de novo optimized molecules. Going
further, we demonstrate how granular control over synthesizability constraints
can loosely mimic virtual screening of ultra-large make-on-demand libraries.
Using only a single GPU, we generate and dock 15k molecules to identify
promising candidates in Freedom 4.0 constituting 142B make-on-demand molecules
(assessing only 0.00001% of the library). Generated molecules satisfying the
reaction constraints have > 90% exact match rate. Lastly, we benchmark our
framework against recent synthesizability-constrained generative models and
demonstrate the highest sample efficiency even when imposing the additional
constraint that all molecules must be synthesizable from a single reaction
type. The main theme is demonstrating that a pre-trained generalist molecular
generative model can be incentivized to generate property-optimized small
molecules under challenging synthesizability constraints through reinforcement
learning.

domain-specific models BioBERT and SciBERT. Embeddings are computed via an
expression-weighted average across the top N most highly expressed genes in
each cell, providing a compact, semantically rich representation. This
multimodal strategy bridges structured biological data with state-of-the-art

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PRISM是一种去中心化算法，用于解决多任务多智能体路径规划问题，通过快速信息共享和运动约束实现高效协作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体在复杂环境中同时规划路径时的死锁和协作问题。

Method: 采用快速通信策略，通过信息包交换运动约束信息，避免碰撞并提高协作效率。

Result: 在5种环境和25个随机场景中测试，PRISM比集中式CBS支持更多智能体，比去中心化TPTS处理更多任务，且计算速度更快。

Conclusion: PRISM在复杂动态环境中表现出鲁棒性、可扩展性和高效性。

Abstract: We introduce PRISM (Pathfinding with Rapid Information Sharing using Motion
Constraints), a decentralized algorithm designed to address the multi-task
multi-agent pathfinding (MT-MAPF) problem. PRISM enables large teams of agents
to concurrently plan safe and efficient paths for multiple tasks while avoiding
collisions. It employs a rapid communication strategy that uses information
packets to exchange motion constraint information, enhancing cooperative
pathfinding and situational awareness, even in scenarios without direct
communication. We prove that PRISM resolves and avoids all deadlock scenarios
when possible, a critical challenge in decentralized pathfinding. Empirically,
we evaluate PRISM across five environments and 25 random scenarios,
benchmarking it against the centralized Conflict-Based Search (CBS) and the
decentralized Token Passing with Task Swaps (TPTS) algorithms. PRISM
demonstrates scalability and solution quality, supporting 3.4 times more agents
than CBS and handling up to 2.5 times more tasks in narrow passage environments
than TPTS. Additionally, PRISM matches CBS in solution quality while achieving
faster computation times, even under low-connectivity conditions. Its
decentralized design reduces the computational burden on individual agents,
making it scalable for large environments. These results confirm PRISM's
robustness, scalability, and effectiveness in complex and dynamic pathfinding
scenarios.

Motivation: 批在线强化学习有望通过减少人工数据收集的需求并利用自我改进实现可扩展的机器人学习，但现有方法难以高效利用自主收集的数据。

Method: 通过实验研究了算法类别（如Q函数引导与模仿学习）、策略提取方法（隐式与显式）和策略表达能力对性能的影响，并提出了一种结合这些因素的通用方法。

Result: 研究发现，Q函数引导、隐式策略提取和高表达能力策略显著提升性能，加入时间相关噪声进一步提高了多样性。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种有效的批在线强化学习方法，显著优于现有方法，并展示了其在性能和扩展性上的优势。

Abstract: The ability to learn from large batches of autonomously collected data for
policy improvement -- a paradigm we refer to as batch online reinforcement
learning -- holds the promise of enabling truly scalable robot learning by
significantly reducing the need for human effort of data collection while
getting benefits from self-improvement. Yet, despite the promise of this
paradigm, it remains challenging to achieve due to algorithms not being able to
learn effectively from the autonomous data. For example, prior works have
applied imitation learning and filtered imitation learning methods to the batch
online RL problem, but these algorithms often fail to efficiently improve from
the autonomously collected data or converge quickly to a suboptimal point. This
raises the question of what matters for effective batch online RL in robotics.
Motivated by this question, we perform a systematic empirical study of three
axes -- (i) algorithm class, (ii) policy extraction methods, and (iii) policy
expressivity -- and analyze how these axes affect performance and scaling with
the amount of autonomous data. Through our analysis, we make several
observations. First, we observe that the use of Q-functions to guide batch
online RL significantly improves performance over imitation-based methods.
Building on this, we show that an implicit method of policy extraction -- via
choosing the best action in the distribution of the policy -- is necessary over
traditional policy extraction methods from offline RL. Next, we show that an
expressive policy class is preferred over less expressive policy classes. Based
on this analysis, we propose a general recipe for effective batch online RL. We
then show a simple addition to the recipe of using temporally-correlated noise
to obtain more diversity results in further performance gains. Our recipe
obtains significantly better performance and scaling compared to prior methods.

to learn new tasks by observing and imitating experts. However, applying this
ability to robots presents significant challenges due to the inherent
differences between human and robot embodiments in both their visual appearance
and physical capabilities. While previous methods bridge this gap using
cross-embodiment datasets with shared scenes and tasks, collecting such aligned
data between humans and robots at scale is not trivial. In this paper, we
propose UniSkill, a novel framework that learns embodiment-agnostic skill
representations from large-scale cross-embodiment video data without any
labels, enabling skills extracted from human video prompts to effectively
transfer to robot policies trained only on robot data. Our experiments in both
simulation and real-world environments show that our cross-embodiment skills
successfully guide robots in selecting appropriate actions, even with unseen
video prompts. The project website can be found at:

Abstract: Recent studies have shown the great potential of diffusion models in
improving reinforcement learning (RL) by modeling complex policies, expressing
a high degree of multi-modality, and efficiently handling high-dimensional
continuous control tasks. However, there is currently limited research on how
to optimize diffusion-based polices (e.g., Diffusion Policy) fast and stably.
In this paper, we propose an Adam-based Diffusion Policy Optimization (ADPO), a
fast algorithmic framework containing best practices for fine-tuning
diffusion-based polices in robotic control tasks using the adaptive gradient
descent method in RL. Adaptive gradient method is less studied in training RL,
let alone diffusion-based policies. We confirm that ADPO outperforms other
diffusion-based RL methods in terms of overall effectiveness for fine-tuning on
standard robotic tasks. Concretely, we conduct extensive experiments on
standard robotic control tasks to test ADPO, where, particularly, six popular
diffusion-based RL methods are provided as benchmark methods. Experimental
results show that ADPO acquires better or comparable performance than the
baseline methods. Finally, we systematically analyze the sensitivity of
multiple hyperparameters in standard robotics tasks, providing guidance for
subsequent practical applications. Our video demonstrations are released in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体强化学习（MARL）在复杂海洋环境中控制自主车辆（AV）时样本效率低，且高保真模拟器在多车辆场景中无法显著加速训练。

Method: 采用迭代蒸馏方法将高保真模拟转换为简化的GPU加速环境，并提出TransfMAPPO架构，学习对智能体和目标数量不变的多智能体策略。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AV) offer a cost-effective solution for scientific
missions such as underwater tracking. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has
emerged as a powerful method for controlling AVs in complex marine
environments. However, scaling these techniques to a fleet--essential for
multi-target tracking or targets with rapid, unpredictable motion--presents
significant computational challenges. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)
is notoriously sample-inefficient, and while high-fidelity simulators like
Gazebo's LRAUV provide 100x faster-than-real-time single-robot simulations,
they offer no significant speedup for multi-vehicle scenarios, making MARL
training impractical. To address these limitations, we propose an iterative
distillation method that transfers high-fidelity simulations into a simplified,
GPU-accelerated environment while preserving high-level dynamics. This approach
achieves up to a 30,000x speedup over Gazebo through parallelization, enabling
efficient training via end-to-end GPU acceleration. Additionally, we introduce
a novel Transformer-based architecture (TransfMAPPO) that learns multi-agent
policies invariant to the number of agents and targets, significantly improving
sample efficiency. Following large-scale curriculum learning conducted entirely
on GPU, we perform extensive evaluations in Gazebo, demonstrating that our
method maintains tracking errors below 5 meters over extended durations, even
in the presence of multiple fast-moving targets. This work bridges the gap
between large-scale MARL training and high-fidelity deployment, providing a
scalable framework for autonomous fleet control in real-world sea missions.

Result: 在PyBullet仿真中，成功率达95%，位置RMSE为0.129米，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了多旋翼飞行器的适应性和可靠性，适用于动态不确定环境。

Abstract: Multirotors play a significant role in diverse field robotics applications
but remain highly susceptible to actuator failures, leading to rapid
instability and compromised mission reliability. While various fault-tolerant
control (FTC) strategies using reinforcement learning (RL) have been widely
explored, most previous approaches require prior knowledge of the multirotor
model or struggle to adapt to new configurations. To address these limitations,
we propose a novel hybrid RL-based FTC framework integrated with a
transformer-based online adaptation module. Our framework leverages a
transformer architecture to infer latent representations in real time, enabling
adaptation to previously unseen system models without retraining. We evaluate
our method in a PyBullet simulation under loss-of-effectiveness actuator
faults, achieving a 95% success rate and a positional root mean square error
(RMSE) of 0.129 m, outperforming existing adaptation methods with 86% success
and an RMSE of 0.153 m. Further evaluations on quadrotors with varying
configurations confirm the robustness of our framework across untrained
dynamics. These results demonstrate the potential of our framework to enhance
the adaptability and reliability of multirotors, enabling efficient fault
management in dynamic and uncertain environments. Website is available at

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Coverage Path Planning (CPP) is critical for
applications such as precision agriculture and search and rescue. While
traditional methods rely on discrete grid-based representations, real-world UAV
operations require power-efficient continuous motion planning. We formulate the
UAV CPP problem in a continuous environment, minimizing power consumption while
ensuring complete coverage. Our approach models the environment with
variable-size axis-aligned rectangles and UAV motion with curvature-constrained
B\'ezier curves. We train a reinforcement learning agent using an
action-mapping-based Soft Actor-Critic (AM-SAC) algorithm employing a
self-adaptive curriculum. Experiments on both procedurally generated and
hand-crafted scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in learning
energy-efficient coverage strategies.

Abstract: Causal understanding is important in many disciplines of science and
engineering, where we seek to understand how different factors in the system
causally affect an experiment or situation and pave a pathway towards creating
effective or optimising existing models. Examples of use cases are autonomous
exploration and modelling of unknown environments or assessing key variables in
optimising large complex systems. In this paper, we analyse a Reinforcement
Learning approach called Causal Curiosity, which aims to estimate as accurately
and efficiently as possible, without directly measuring them, the value of
factors that causally determine the dynamics of a system. Whilst the idea
presents a pathway forward, measurement accuracy is the foundation of
methodology effectiveness. Focusing on the current causal curiosity's robotic
manipulator, we present for the first time a measurement accuracy analysis of
the future potentials and current limitations of this technique and an analysis
of its sensitivity and confounding factor disentanglement capability - crucial
for causal analysis. As a result of our work, we promote proposals for an
improved and efficient design of Causal Curiosity methods to be applied to
real-world complex scenarios.

Conclusion: 自动课程学习框架显著提升了强化学习自动驾驶代理的鲁棒性和训练效率，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of training end-to-end autonomous driving
agents using Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL agents are typically trained in a
fixed set of scenarios and nominal behavior of surrounding road users in
simulations, limiting their generalization and real-life deployment. While
domain randomization offers a potential solution by randomly sampling driving
scenarios, it frequently results in inefficient training and sub-optimal
policies due to the high variance among training scenarios. To address these
limitations, we propose an automatic curriculum learning framework that
dynamically generates driving scenarios with adaptive complexity based on the
agent's evolving capabilities. Unlike manually designed curricula that
introduce expert bias and lack scalability, our framework incorporates a
``teacher'' that automatically generates and mutates driving scenarios based on
their learning potential -- an agent-centric metric derived from the agent's
current policy -- eliminating the need for expert design. The framework
enhances training efficiency by excluding scenarios the agent has mastered or
finds too challenging. We evaluate our framework in a reinforcement learning
setting where the agent learns a driving policy from camera images. Comparative
results against baseline methods, including fixed scenario training and domain
randomization, demonstrate that our approach leads to enhanced generalization,
achieving higher success rates: +9\% in low traffic density, +21\% in high
traffic density, and faster convergence with fewer training steps. Our findings
highlight the potential of ACL in improving the robustness and efficiency of
RL-based autonomous driving agents.

TL;DR: FSD（From Seeing to Doing）是一种新型视觉语言模型，通过空间关系推理生成中间表示，为机器人操作提供细粒度指导，显著提升了零样本性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉-语言-动作（VLA）模型在零样本性能上表现不足，主要由于数据稀缺和异构性。FSD旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 结合分层数据管道和自一致性机制，对齐空间坐标与视觉信号，生成中间表示。

Result: 在8个基准测试和VABench上表现优异，零样本机器人操作成功率显著提升（SimplerEnv 54.1%，真实任务72%）。

Conclusion: FSD通过空间推理和自一致性机制，显著提升了机器人操作的泛化能力和零样本性能。

Abstract: Achieving generalization in robotic manipulation remains a critical
challenge, particularly for unseen scenarios and novel tasks. Current
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, while building on top of general
Vision-Language Models (VLMs), still fall short of achieving robust zero-shot
performance due to the scarcity and heterogeneity prevalent in embodied
datasets. To address these limitations, we propose FSD (From Seeing to Doing),
a novel vision-language model that generates intermediate representations
through spatial relationship reasoning, providing fine-grained guidance for
robotic manipulation. Our approach combines a hierarchical data pipeline for
training with a self-consistency mechanism that aligns spatial coordinates with
visual signals. Through extensive experiments, we comprehensively validated
FSD's capabilities in both "seeing" and "doing," achieving outstanding
performance across 8 benchmarks for general spatial reasoning and embodied
reference abilities, as well as on our proposed more challenging benchmark
VABench. We also verified zero-shot capabilities in robot manipulation,
demonstrating significant performance improvements over baseline methods in
both SimplerEnv and real robot settings. Experimental results show that FSD
achieves 54.1% success rate in SimplerEnv and 72% success rate across 8
real-world tasks, outperforming the strongest baseline by 30%.

Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) is essential for effective Human-Robot

This study evaluates the ability of a vision-based tactile sensor to classify
15 activities, comparing its performance to an IMU-based data glove.
Additionally, we propose a multi-modal framework combining tactile and motion
data to leverage their complementary strengths. We examined three approaches:
motion-based classification (MBC) using IMU data, tactile-based classification
(TBC) with single or dual video streams, and multi-modal classification (MMC)
integrating both. Offline validation on segmented datasets assessed each
configuration's accuracy under controlled conditions, while online validation
on continuous action sequences tested online performance. Results showed the
multi-modal approach consistently outperformed single-modality methods,
highlighting the potential of integrating tactile and motion sensing to enhance
HAR systems for collaborative robotics.

Conclusion: 内部语音显著提升了机器人的透明度和人机交互信任度，适用于医疗保健场景。

Abstract: We explore the use of inner speech as a mechanism to enhance transparency and
trust in social robots for dietary advice. In humans, inner speech structures
thought processes and decision-making; in robotics, it improves explainability
by making reasoning explicit. This is crucial in healthcare scenarios, where
trust in robotic assistants depends on both accurate recommendations and
human-like dialogue, which make interactions more natural and engaging.
Building on this, we developed a social robot that provides dietary advice, and
we provided the architecture with inner speech capabilities to validate user
input, refine reasoning, and generate clear justifications. The system
integrates large language models for natural language understanding and a
knowledge graph for structured dietary information. By making decisions more
transparent, our approach strengthens trust and improves human-robot
interaction in healthcare. We validated this by measuring the computational
efficiency of our architecture and conducting a small user study, which
assessed the reliability of inner speech in explaining the robot's behavior.

Conclusion: PRISM在复杂动态路径规划场景中表现出鲁棒性、可扩展性和高效性，适用于大规模环境。

Abstract: We introduce PRISM (Pathfinding with Rapid Information Sharing using Motion
Constraints), a decentralized algorithm designed to address the multi-task
multi-agent pathfinding (MT-MAPF) problem. PRISM enables large teams of agents
to concurrently plan safe and efficient paths for multiple tasks while avoiding
collisions. It employs a rapid communication strategy that uses information
packets to exchange motion constraint information, enhancing cooperative
pathfinding and situational awareness, even in scenarios without direct
communication. We prove that PRISM resolves and avoids all deadlock scenarios
when possible, a critical challenge in decentralized pathfinding. Empirically,
we evaluate PRISM across five environments and 25 random scenarios,
benchmarking it against the centralized Conflict-Based Search (CBS) and the
decentralized Token Passing with Task Swaps (TPTS) algorithms. PRISM
demonstrates scalability and solution quality, supporting 3.4 times more agents
than CBS and handling up to 2.5 times more tasks in narrow passage environments
than TPTS. Additionally, PRISM matches CBS in solution quality while achieving
faster computation times, even under low-connectivity conditions. Its
decentralized design reduces the computational burden on individual agents,
making it scalable for large environments. These results confirm PRISM's
robustness, scalability, and effectiveness in complex and dynamic pathfinding
scenarios.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在性能和扩展性上显著优于现有方法，为批量在线RL提供了有效方案。

Abstract: The ability to learn from large batches of autonomously collected data for
policy improvement -- a paradigm we refer to as batch online reinforcement
learning -- holds the promise of enabling truly scalable robot learning by
significantly reducing the need for human effort of data collection while
getting benefits from self-improvement. Yet, despite the promise of this
paradigm, it remains challenging to achieve due to algorithms not being able to
learn effectively from the autonomous data. For example, prior works have
applied imitation learning and filtered imitation learning methods to the batch
online RL problem, but these algorithms often fail to efficiently improve from
the autonomously collected data or converge quickly to a suboptimal point. This
raises the question of what matters for effective batch online RL in robotics.
Motivated by this question, we perform a systematic empirical study of three
axes -- (i) algorithm class, (ii) policy extraction methods, and (iii) policy
expressivity -- and analyze how these axes affect performance and scaling with
the amount of autonomous data. Through our analysis, we make several
observations. First, we observe that the use of Q-functions to guide batch
online RL significantly improves performance over imitation-based methods.
Building on this, we show that an implicit method of policy extraction -- via
choosing the best action in the distribution of the policy -- is necessary over
traditional policy extraction methods from offline RL. Next, we show that an
expressive policy class is preferred over less expressive policy classes. Based
on this analysis, we propose a general recipe for effective batch online RL. We
then show a simple addition to the recipe of using temporally-correlated noise
to obtain more diversity results in further performance gains. Our recipe
obtains significantly better performance and scaling compared to prior methods.

emerged as a powerful method for controlling AVs in complex marine
environments. However, scaling these techniques to a fleet--essential for

Abstract: Multirotors play a significant role in diverse field robotics applications
but remain highly susceptible to actuator failures, leading to rapid
instability and compromised mission reliability. While various fault-tolerant
control (FTC) strategies using reinforcement learning (RL) have been widely
explored, most previous approaches require prior knowledge of the multirotor
model or struggle to adapt to new configurations. To address these limitations,
we propose a novel hybrid RL-based FTC framework integrated with a
transformer-based online adaptation module. Our framework leverages a
transformer architecture to infer latent representations in real time, enabling
adaptation to previously unseen system models without retraining. We evaluate
our method in a PyBullet simulation under loss-of-effectiveness actuator
faults, achieving a 95% success rate and a positional root mean square error
(RMSE) of 0.129 m, outperforming existing adaptation methods with 86% success
and an RMSE of 0.153 m. Further evaluations on quadrotors with varying
configurations confirm the robustness of our framework across untrained
dynamics. These results demonstrate the potential of our framework to enhance
the adaptability and reliability of multirotors, enabling efficient fault
management in dynamic and uncertain environments. Website is available at

Conclusion: 该方法为无人机连续覆盖路径规划提供了一种有效的解决方案，显著提升了能量效率。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Coverage Path Planning (CPP) is critical for
applications such as precision agriculture and search and rescue. While
traditional methods rely on discrete grid-based representations, real-world UAV
operations require power-efficient continuous motion planning. We formulate the
UAV CPP problem in a continuous environment, minimizing power consumption while
ensuring complete coverage. Our approach models the environment with
variable-size axis-aligned rectangles and UAV motion with curvature-constrained
B\'ezier curves. We train a reinforcement learning agent using an
action-mapping-based Soft Actor-Critic (AM-SAC) algorithm employing a
self-adaptive curriculum. Experiments on both procedurally generated and
hand-crafted scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in learning
energy-efficient coverage strategies.

Conclusion: 本文为Causal Curiosity方法的改进提供了方向，以更好地适应复杂现实场景的需求。

Abstract: Causal understanding is important in many disciplines of science and
engineering, where we seek to understand how different factors in the system
causally affect an experiment or situation and pave a pathway towards creating
effective or optimising existing models. Examples of use cases are autonomous
exploration and modelling of unknown environments or assessing key variables in
optimising large complex systems. In this paper, we analyse a Reinforcement
Learning approach called Causal Curiosity, which aims to estimate as accurately
and efficiently as possible, without directly measuring them, the value of
factors that causally determine the dynamics of a system. Whilst the idea
presents a pathway forward, measurement accuracy is the foundation of
methodology effectiveness. Focusing on the current causal curiosity's robotic
manipulator, we present for the first time a measurement accuracy analysis of
the future potentials and current limitations of this technique and an analysis
of its sensitivity and confounding factor disentanglement capability - crucial
for causal analysis. As a result of our work, we promote proposals for an
improved and efficient design of Causal Curiosity methods to be applied to
real-world complex scenarios.

Conclusion: 自动课程学习框架显著提升强化学习自动驾驶代理的鲁棒性和训练效率。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of training end-to-end autonomous driving
agents using Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL agents are typically trained in a
fixed set of scenarios and nominal behavior of surrounding road users in
simulations, limiting their generalization and real-life deployment. While
domain randomization offers a potential solution by randomly sampling driving
scenarios, it frequently results in inefficient training and sub-optimal
policies due to the high variance among training scenarios. To address these
limitations, we propose an automatic curriculum learning framework that
dynamically generates driving scenarios with adaptive complexity based on the
agent's evolving capabilities. Unlike manually designed curricula that
introduce expert bias and lack scalability, our framework incorporates a
``teacher'' that automatically generates and mutates driving scenarios based on
their learning potential -- an agent-centric metric derived from the agent's
current policy -- eliminating the need for expert design. The framework
enhances training efficiency by excluding scenarios the agent has mastered or
finds too challenging. We evaluate our framework in a reinforcement learning
setting where the agent learns a driving policy from camera images. Comparative
results against baseline methods, including fixed scenario training and domain
randomization, demonstrate that our approach leads to enhanced generalization,
achieving higher success rates: +9\% in low traffic density, +21\% in high
traffic density, and faster convergence with fewer training steps. Our findings
highlight the potential of ACL in improving the robustness and efficiency of
RL-based autonomous driving agents.

TL;DR: FSD是一种新型视觉语言模型，通过空间关系推理生成中间表示，显著提升了机器人操作的零样本性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉-语言-动作模型在零样本性能上表现不足，主要由于数据集稀缺和异构性。

Method: 提出FSD模型，结合分层数据管道和自一致性机制，对齐空间坐标与视觉信号。

Result: 在8个基准测试中表现优异，零样本机器人操作任务中成功率显著提升。

Conclusion: FSD在空间推理和机器人操作任务中表现出色，为通用化机器人操作提供了新思路。

Abstract: Achieving generalization in robotic manipulation remains a critical
challenge, particularly for unseen scenarios and novel tasks. Current
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, while building on top of general
Vision-Language Models (VLMs), still fall short of achieving robust zero-shot
performance due to the scarcity and heterogeneity prevalent in embodied
datasets. To address these limitations, we propose FSD (From Seeing to Doing),
a novel vision-language model that generates intermediate representations
through spatial relationship reasoning, providing fine-grained guidance for
robotic manipulation. Our approach combines a hierarchical data pipeline for
training with a self-consistency mechanism that aligns spatial coordinates with
visual signals. Through extensive experiments, we comprehensively validated
FSD's capabilities in both "seeing" and "doing," achieving outstanding
performance across 8 benchmarks for general spatial reasoning and embodied
reference abilities, as well as on our proposed more challenging benchmark
VABench. We also verified zero-shot capabilities in robot manipulation,
demonstrating significant performance improvements over baseline methods in
both SimplerEnv and real robot settings. Experimental results show that FSD
achieves 54.1% success rate in SimplerEnv and 72% success rate across 8
real-world tasks, outperforming the strongest baseline by 30%.

Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) is essential for effective Human-Robot
Collaboration (HRC), enabling robots to interpret and respond to human actions.
This study evaluates the ability of a vision-based tactile sensor to classify
15 activities, comparing its performance to an IMU-based data glove.
Additionally, we propose a multi-modal framework combining tactile and motion
data to leverage their complementary strengths. We examined three approaches:
motion-based classification (MBC) using IMU data, tactile-based classification
(TBC) with single or dual video streams, and multi-modal classification (MMC)
integrating both. Offline validation on segmented datasets assessed each
configuration's accuracy under controlled conditions, while online validation
on continuous action sequences tested online performance. Results showed the
multi-modal approach consistently outperformed single-modality methods,
highlighting the potential of integrating tactile and motion sensing to enhance
HAR systems for collaborative robotics.

Method: 开发了一种具备内部语音功能的社交机器人，结合大语言模型和知识图谱，用于验证用户输入、优化推理并生成清晰解释。

Result: 通过计算效率测试和小型用户研究验证了内部语音在解释机器人行为中的可靠性。

Conclusion: 内部语音显著提升了机器人的透明度和人机交互信任度，适用于医疗场景。

Abstract: We explore the use of inner speech as a mechanism to enhance transparency and
trust in social robots for dietary advice. In humans, inner speech structures
thought processes and decision-making; in robotics, it improves explainability
by making reasoning explicit. This is crucial in healthcare scenarios, where
trust in robotic assistants depends on both accurate recommendations and
human-like dialogue, which make interactions more natural and engaging.
Building on this, we developed a social robot that provides dietary advice, and
we provided the architecture with inner speech capabilities to validate user
input, refine reasoning, and generate clear justifications. The system
integrates large language models for natural language understanding and a
knowledge graph for structured dietary information. By making decisions more
transparent, our approach strengthens trust and improves human-robot
interaction in healthcare. We validated this by measuring the computational
efficiency of our architecture and conducting a small user study, which
assessed the reliability of inner speech in explaining the robot's behavior.

Abstract: Neural rendering has gained prominence for its high-quality output, which is
crucial for AR/VR applications. However, its large voxel grid data size and
irregular access patterns challenge real-time processing on edge devices. While
previous works have focused on improving data locality, they have not
adequately addressed the issue of large voxel grid sizes, which necessitate
frequent off-chip memory access and substantial on-chip memory. This paper
introduces SpNeRF, a software-hardware co-design solution tailored for sparse
volumetric neural rendering. We first identify memory-bound rendering
inefficiencies and analyze the inherent sparsity in the voxel grid data of
neural rendering. To enhance efficiency, we propose novel preprocessing and
online decoding steps, reducing the memory size for voxel grid. The
preprocessing step employs hash mapping to support irregular data access while
maintaining a minimal memory size. The online decoding step enables efficient
on-chip sparse voxel grid processing, incorporating bitmap masking to mitigate
PSNR loss caused by hash collisions. To further optimize performance, we design
a dedicated hardware architecture supporting our sparse voxel grid processing
technique. Experimental results demonstrate that SpNeRF achieves an average
21.07$\times$ reduction in memory size while maintaining comparable PSNR
levels. When benchmarked against Jetson XNX, Jetson ONX, RT-NeRF.Edge and
NeuRex.Edge, our design achieves speedups of 95.1$\times$, 63.5$\times$,
1.5$\times$ and 10.3$\times$, and improves energy efficiency by 625.6$\times$,

that learning the relative values of space coupling parameters is key to
capturing unknown block-sparse patterns and improving recovery accuracy.
Experiments validate that SPP-SBL successfully recovers various challenging

Abstract: We introduce ai.txt, a novel domain-specific language (DSL) designed to
explicitly regulate interactions between AI models, agents, and web content,
addressing critical limitations of the widely adopted robots.txt standard. As
AI increasingly engages with online materials for tasks such as training,
summarization, and content modification, existing regulatory methods lack the
necessary granularity and semantic expressiveness to ensure ethical and legal
compliance. ai.txt extends traditional URL-based access controls by enabling
precise element-level regulations and incorporating natural language
instructions interpretable by AI systems. To facilitate practical deployment,
we provide an integrated development environment with code autocompletion and
automatic XML generation. Furthermore, we propose two compliance mechanisms:
XML-based programmatic enforcement and natural language prompt integration, and
demonstrate their effectiveness through preliminary experiments and case
studies. Our approach aims to aid the governance of AI-Internet interactions,

Abstract: Twenty-five years ago, the specification of the Intelligent Product was
established, envisaging real-time connectivity that not only enables products
to gather accurate data about themselves but also allows them to assess and
influence their own destiny. Early work by the Auto-ID project focused on
creating a single, open-standard repository for storing and retrieving product
information, laying a foundation for scalable connectivity. A decade later, the
approach was revisited in light of low-cost RFID systems that promised a
low-cost link between physical goods and networked information environments.
Since then, advances in blockchain, Web3, and artificial intelligence have
introduced unprecedented levels of resilience, consensus, and autonomy. By
leveraging decentralised identity, blockchain-based product information and
history, and intelligent AI-to-AI collaboration, this paper examines these
developments and outlines a new specification for the Intelligent Product 3.0,
illustrating how decentralised and AI-driven capabilities facilitate seamless

Abstract: General-purpose large language models (LLMs), despite their broad
capabilities accrued from open-world data, frequently exhibit suboptimal
performance when confronted with the nuanced and specialized demands inherent
in real-time telecommunications applications. This investigation addresses this
critical limitation through the meticulous fine-tuning of TSLAM-Mini developed
by NetoAI, a compact (3.8-billion parameter) causal language model
architecturally derived from Phi-4 Mini Instruct 4B. The fine-tuning regimen
leverages a bespoke dataset comprising 100,000 samples, strategically
engineered to address 20 pivotal telecommunications use-cases, encompassing
domains such as Network Fundamentals, IP Routing, MPLS, Network Security,
Automation, OSS/BSS, RAN, Mobile Core, Satellite Communications, and Ethical
AI. This dataset was curated utilizing NetoAI's DigiTwin platform, enriched
with granular insights from venerated network Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and
authoritative RFC documents, thereby capturing high-fidelity representations of
real-world network dynamics through simulations inspired by digital twin
paradigms. Employing Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA), a state-of-the-art
Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) technique, we achieved substantial
training efficiency and enabled prospective deployment on resource-constrained
hardware. A novel evaluation framework, predicated on a high-capacity LLM
(Qwen3-235B-A22B) functioning as an automated adjudicator, was instituted to
rigorously assess instruction-following fidelity and response quality across
the specified telecom use-cases. Empirical results unequivocally demonstrate
TSLAM-Mini's superior aptitude in telecom-centric applications, underscoring
the profound efficacy of domain-specific datasets and PEFT methodologies for
advancing intelligent network management.

Abstract: The proliferation of intelligent applications at the wireless edge, alongside
the exponential growth of multimodal data, poses challenges for deploying
multimodal large models (MLMs) in resource-constrained networks. These
constraints manifest as limited bandwidth, computational capacity, and
stringent latency requirements, particularly under low signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) conditions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a token
communication paradigm that facilitates the decentralized deployment of MLMs
across user devices and edge infrastructure (e.g., base stations). In this
paradigm, task-relevant tokens are extracted from multimodal inputs and serve
as the primary medium for communication between distributed model components.
To align semantics and optimize transmission efficiency, we propose a
dual-pronged approach: 1) We design a contrastive split fine-tuning method to
project heterogeneous modalities into a shared feature space, enabling seamless
interaction between model components while preserving modal-specific semantics.
2) We employ a lightweight compression technique to reduce the size of
transmitted tokens, minimizing bandwidth consumption without sacrificing
task-critical information. The proposed framework integrates collaborative
fine-tuning of both the foundation model and multimodal transceivers, ensuring
that token generation and utilization are tailored to specific downstream
tasks. Simulation experiments conducted under different SNR conditions
demonstrate that our method results in a $13.7\%$ improvement in test accuracy.
Furthermore, our approach exhibits quicker convergence rates, even with reduced
token lengths, highlighting the promise of token communication for facilitating
more scalable and resilient MLM implementations in practical multiuser

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于实际感知节点和测试车辆的成本限制，粗粒度的信道指纹（CF）无法满足无线收发器设计需求，需要一种方法将其转化为细粒度CF。

Method: 设计了条件生成扩散模型（CGDM），利用变分推理技术学习目标数据的复杂分布，并通过轻量化设计（如剪枝和知识蒸馏）优化模型。

Result: 实验结果显示，CGDM在重建性能上显著优于基线方法，且在不同放大因子的零样本测试中表现出良好的可扩展性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: CGDM为粗粒度到细粒度CF的转换提供了高效解决方案，展示了在智能环境感知通信中的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) acquisition for massive
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems is essential for future mobile
communication networks. Channel fingerprint (CF), also referred to as channel
knowledge map, is a key enabler for intelligent environment-aware communication
and can facilitate CSI acquisition. However, due to the cost limitations of
practical sensing nodes and test vehicles, the resulting CF is typically
coarse-grained, making it insufficient for wireless transceiver design. In this
work, we introduce the concept of CF twins and design a conditional generative
diffusion model (CGDM) with strong implicit prior learning capabilities as the
computational core of the CF twin to establish the connection between coarse-
and fine-grained CFs. Specifically, we employ a variational inference technique
to derive the evidence lower bound (ELBO) for the log-marginal distribution of
the observed fine-grained CF conditioned on the coarse-grained CF, enabling the
CGDM to learn the complicated distribution of the target data. During the
denoising neural network optimization, the coarse-grained CF is introduced as
side information to accurately guide the conditioned generation of the CGDM. To
make the proposed CGDM lightweight, we further leverage the additivity of
network layers and introduce a one-shot pruning approach along with a
multi-objective knowledge distillation technique. Experimental results show
that the proposed approach exhibits significant improvement in reconstruction
performance compared to the baselines. Additionally, zero-shot testing on
reconstruction tasks with different magnification factors further demonstrates
the scalability and generalization ability of the proposed approach.

Method: 采用定制的条件生成扩散模型（CDiff），同时优化环境信息和CF，重构出细粒度的EnvCF。

Result: 实验表明，CDiff在EnvCF构建上的性能显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CDiff为环境感知通信提供了一种有效的细粒度CF重构方法。

Abstract: The paradigm shift from environment-unaware communication to intelligent
environment-aware communication is expected to facilitate the acquisition of
channel state information for future wireless communications. Channel
Fingerprint (CF), as an emerging enabling technology for environment-aware
communication, provides channel-related knowledge for potential locations
within the target communication area. However, due to the limited availability
of practical devices for sensing environmental information and measuring
channel-related knowledge, most of the acquired environmental information and
CF are coarse-grained, insufficient to guide the design of wireless
transmissions. To address this, this paper proposes a deep conditional
generative learning approach, namely a customized conditional generative
diffusion model (CDiff). The proposed CDiff simultaneously refines
environmental information and CF, reconstructing a fine-grained CF that
incorporates environmental information, referred to as EnvCF, from its
coarse-grained counterpart. Experimental results show that the proposed
approach significantly improves the performance of EnvCF construction compared
to the baselines.

Furthermore, the enhanced DRL agent outperforms a reactive Multi-Armed Bandit

Abstract: We introduce ai.txt, a novel domain-specific language (DSL) designed to
explicitly regulate interactions between AI models, agents, and web content,
addressing critical limitations of the widely adopted robots.txt standard. As
AI increasingly engages with online materials for tasks such as training,
summarization, and content modification, existing regulatory methods lack the
necessary granularity and semantic expressiveness to ensure ethical and legal
compliance. ai.txt extends traditional URL-based access controls by enabling
precise element-level regulations and incorporating natural language
instructions interpretable by AI systems. To facilitate practical deployment,
we provide an integrated development environment with code autocompletion and
automatic XML generation. Furthermore, we propose two compliance mechanisms:
XML-based programmatic enforcement and natural language prompt integration, and
demonstrate their effectiveness through preliminary experiments and case
studies. Our approach aims to aid the governance of AI-Internet interactions,

Abstract: Twenty-five years ago, the specification of the Intelligent Product was
established, envisaging real-time connectivity that not only enables products
to gather accurate data about themselves but also allows them to assess and
influence their own destiny. Early work by the Auto-ID project focused on
creating a single, open-standard repository for storing and retrieving product

approach was revisited in light of low-cost RFID systems that promised a
low-cost link between physical goods and networked information environments.
Since then, advances in blockchain, Web3, and artificial intelligence have
introduced unprecedented levels of resilience, consensus, and autonomy. By
leveraging decentralised identity, blockchain-based product information and
history, and intelligent AI-to-AI collaboration, this paper examines these
developments and outlines a new specification for the Intelligent Product 3.0,

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于条件生成扩散模型（CGDM）的CF twins方法，用于将粗粒度信道指纹（CF）转换为细粒度CF，显著提升了重建性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于实际感知节点和测试车辆的成本限制，现有的信道指纹（CF）通常是粗粒度的，不足以支持无线收发器设计。因此，需要一种方法将粗粒度CF转换为细粒度CF。

Method: 设计了条件生成扩散模型（CGDM），利用变分推理技术推导证据下界（ELBO），并通过去噪神经网络优化和轻量化技术（如剪枝和知识蒸馏）实现高效生成。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在重建性能上显著优于基线方法，且在不同放大因子下的零样本测试中表现出良好的可扩展性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 提出的CGDM方法能够有效连接粗粒度和细粒度CF，为智能环境感知通信提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) acquisition for massive
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems is essential for future mobile
communication networks. Channel fingerprint (CF), also referred to as channel
knowledge map, is a key enabler for intelligent environment-aware communication
and can facilitate CSI acquisition. However, due to the cost limitations of
practical sensing nodes and test vehicles, the resulting CF is typically
coarse-grained, making it insufficient for wireless transceiver design. In this
work, we introduce the concept of CF twins and design a conditional generative
diffusion model (CGDM) with strong implicit prior learning capabilities as the
computational core of the CF twin to establish the connection between coarse-
and fine-grained CFs. Specifically, we employ a variational inference technique
to derive the evidence lower bound (ELBO) for the log-marginal distribution of
the observed fine-grained CF conditioned on the coarse-grained CF, enabling the
CGDM to learn the complicated distribution of the target data. During the
denoising neural network optimization, the coarse-grained CF is introduced as
side information to accurately guide the conditioned generation of the CGDM. To
make the proposed CGDM lightweight, we further leverage the additivity of
network layers and introduce a one-shot pruning approach along with a
multi-objective knowledge distillation technique. Experimental results show
that the proposed approach exhibits significant improvement in reconstruction
performance compared to the baselines. Additionally, zero-shot testing on
reconstruction tasks with different magnification factors further demonstrates
the scalability and generalization ability of the proposed approach.

Motivation: 由于现有设备获取的环境信息和信道指纹（CF）多为粗粒度，不足以指导无线传输设计，因此需要一种方法将其细化和优化。

Method: 采用定制化的条件生成扩散模型（CDiff），同时细化环境信息和CF，重构出细粒度的EnvCF。

Result: 实验结果表明，CDiff方法在EnvCF构建上的性能显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CDiff方法有效解决了粗粒度数据问题，为环境感知通信提供了更精细的信道指纹。

Abstract: The paradigm shift from environment-unaware communication to intelligent
environment-aware communication is expected to facilitate the acquisition of
channel state information for future wireless communications. Channel
Fingerprint (CF), as an emerging enabling technology for environment-aware
communication, provides channel-related knowledge for potential locations
within the target communication area. However, due to the limited availability
of practical devices for sensing environmental information and measuring
channel-related knowledge, most of the acquired environmental information and
CF are coarse-grained, insufficient to guide the design of wireless
transmissions. To address this, this paper proposes a deep conditional
generative learning approach, namely a customized conditional generative
diffusion model (CDiff). The proposed CDiff simultaneously refines
environmental information and CF, reconstructing a fine-grained CF that
incorporates environmental information, referred to as EnvCF, from its
coarse-grained counterpart. Experimental results show that the proposed
approach significantly improves the performance of EnvCF construction compared
to the baselines.

Conclusion: 证明了记忆和优先学习对6G波束管理的优势，同时确认MAB作为强基线。

Abstract: Adaptive beam switching in 6G networks is challenged by high frequencies,
mobility, and blockage. We propose an Online Learning framework using Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with an enhanced state representation (velocity

for real-time beam optimization. Validated via Nvidia Sionna under
time-correlated blockage, our approach significantly enhances resilience in
SNR, throughput, and accuracy compared to a conventional heuristic.
Furthermore, the enhanced DRL agent outperforms a reactive Multi-Armed Bandit

variability. This demonstrates the benefits of memory and prioritized learning
for robust 6G beam management, while confirming MAB as a strong baseline.

K-means to identify distinct floors. Evaluated on the Huawei University

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了KB-VQA系统的效果，展示了多模态和多粒度协调的重要性。

Abstract: Vision-language retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become an effective
approach for tackling Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (KB-VQA), which
requires external knowledge beyond the visual content presented in images. The
effectiveness of Vision-language RAG systems hinges on multimodal retrieval,
which is inherently challenging due to the diverse modalities and knowledge
granularities in both queries and knowledge bases. Existing methods have not
fully tapped into the potential interplay between these elements. We propose a
multimodal RAG system featuring a coarse-to-fine, multi-step retrieval that
harmonizes multiple granularities and modalities to enhance efficacy. Our
system begins with a broad initial search aligning knowledge granularity for
cross-modal retrieval, followed by a multimodal fusion reranking to capture the
nuanced multimodal information for top entity selection. A text reranker then
filters out the most relevant fine-grained section for augmented generation.
Extensive experiments on the InfoSeek and Encyclopedic-VQA benchmarks show our
method achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance and highly competitive
answering results, underscoring its effectiveness in advancing KB-VQA systems.

Abstract: Biomedical question-answering (QA) systems require effective retrieval and
generation components to ensure accuracy, efficiency, and scalability. This
study systematically examines a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for
biomedical QA, evaluating retrieval strategies and response time trade-offs. We
first assess state-of-the-art retrieval methods, including BM25, BioBERT,
MedCPT, and a hybrid approach, alongside common data stores such as
Elasticsearch, MongoDB, and FAISS, on a ~10% subset of PubMed (2.4M documents)
to measure indexing efficiency, retrieval latency, and retriever performance in
the end-to-end RAG system. Based on these insights, we deploy the final RAG
system on the full 24M PubMed corpus, comparing different retrievers' impact on
overall performance. Evaluations of the retrieval depth show that retrieving 50
documents with BM25 before reranking with MedCPT optimally balances accuracy
(0.90), recall (0.90), and response time (1.91s). BM25 retrieval time remains
stable (82ms), while MedCPT incurs the main computational cost. These results
highlight previously not well-known trade-offs in retrieval depth, efficiency,

Abstract: Benefiting from the effectiveness of graph neural networks (GNNs) and
contrastive learning, GNN-based contrastive learning has become mainstream for
knowledge-aware recommendation. However, most existing contrastive
learning-based methods have difficulties in effectively capturing the
underlying hierarchical structure within user-item bipartite graphs and
knowledge graphs. Moreover, they commonly generate positive samples for
contrastive learning by perturbing the graph structure, which may lead to a
shift in user preference learning. To overcome these limitations, we propose
hyperbolic contrastive learning with model-augmentation for knowledge-aware
recommendation. To capture the intrinsic hierarchical graph structures, we
first design a novel Lorentzian knowledge aggregation mechanism, which enables
more effective representations of users and items. Then, we propose three
model-level augmentation techniques to assist Hyperbolic contrastive learning.
Different from the classical structure-level augmentation (e.g., edge
dropping), the proposed model-augmentations can avoid preference shifts between
the augmented positive pair. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to
demonstrate the superiority (maximum improvement of $11.03\%$) of proposed
methods over existing baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实世界中应用机器学习方法需要提供安全保证，但现有方法通常计算成本高，难以适用于大规模数据集和嵌入式设备。

Method: 提出CoLSafe算法，其计算复杂度随数据点数量呈次线性增长，并推导了安全性和最优性保证。

Result: 在七自由度机械臂上展示了算法的有效性。

Conclusion: CoLSafe为机器学习在物理系统中提供了一种高效且安全的学习方法。

Abstract: Applying machine learning methods to physical systems that are supposed to
act in the real world requires providing safety guarantees. However, methods
that include such guarantees often come at a high computational cost, making
them inapplicable to large datasets and embedded devices with low computational
power. In this paper, we propose CoLSafe, a computationally lightweight safe
learning algorithm whose computational complexity grows sublinearly with the
number of data points. We derive both safety and optimality guarantees and
showcase the effectiveness of our algorithm on a seven-degrees-of-freedom robot
arm.

### [682] [Diffusion-assisted Model Predictive Control Optimization for Power System Real-Time Operation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08535)
*Linna Xu,Yongli Zhu*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的模型预测控制（MPC）框架，用于实时电力系统操作，结合扩散模型提升负荷预测精度，并通过模型识别推导系统动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在可再生能源主导的电力系统中，缺乏明确的状态转移规律限制了MPC的应用，因此需要一种新方法来提升预测精度和系统动态识别。

Method: 采用扩散模型增强训练数据集，结合模型识别技术推导系统动态，改进MPC框架。

Result: 在工业园区系统和IEEE 30总线系统上的案例研究表明，扩散模型显著提高了负荷预测精度，且推导的系统动态适用于实时电网操作。

Conclusion: 改进的MPC框架结合扩散模型和模型识别技术，有效解决了可再生能源电力系统中的预测和动态识别问题。

Abstract: This paper presents a modified model predictive control (MPC) framework for
real-time power system operation. The framework incorporates a diffusion model
tailored for time series generation to enhance the accuracy of the load
forecasting module used in the system operation. In the absence of explicit
state transition law, a model-identification procedure is leveraged to derive
the system dynamics, thereby eliminating a barrier when applying MPC to a
renewables-dominated power system. Case study results on an industry park
system and the IEEE 30-bus system demonstrate that using the diffusion model to
augment the training dataset significantly improves load-forecasting accuracy,
and the inferred system dynamics are applicable to the real-time grid operation
with solar and wind.

### [685] [Justified Evidence Collection for Argument-based AI Fairness Assurance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08064)
*Alpay Sabuncuoglu,Christopher Burr,Carsten Maple*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于系统工程的方法，通过动态论证保证框架和软件工具，分两阶段实现AI系统的公平性治理，并在金融领域进行了案例验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保AI系统的公平性是一个复杂的社会技术挑战，需要全生命周期的持续监督和论证。动态论证保证方法已被用于评估和缓解AI系统的安全风险，本文将其扩展到公平性和可解释性等更广泛的规范性目标。

Method: 分两阶段：1）需求规划阶段，多学科团队通过公平治理流程定义目标和主张；2）持续监控阶段，通过工具动态收集证据支持论证。

Result: 框架在金融领域的案例研究中验证了其有效性，特别是在支持公平性相关论证方面。

Conclusion: 该框架为AI系统的公平性治理提供了一种系统化、动态化的方法，并通过实际案例展示了其可行性。

Abstract: It is well recognised that ensuring fair AI systems is a complex
sociotechnical challenge, which requires careful deliberation and continuous
oversight across all stages of a system's lifecycle, from defining requirements
to model deployment and deprovisioning. Dynamic argument-based assurance cases,
which present structured arguments supported by evidence, have emerged as a
systematic approach to evaluating and mitigating safety risks and hazards in
AI-enabled system development and have also been extended to deal with broader
normative goals such as fairness and explainability. This paper introduces a
systems-engineering-driven framework, supported by software tooling, to
operationalise a dynamic approach to argument-based assurance in two stages. In
the first stage, during the requirements planning phase, a multi-disciplinary
and multi-stakeholder team define goals and claims to be established (and
evidenced) by conducting a comprehensive fairness governance process. In the
second stage, a continuous monitoring interface gathers evidence from existing
artefacts (e.g. metrics from automated tests), such as model, data, and use
case documentation, to support these arguments dynamically. The framework's
effectiveness is demonstrated through an illustrative case study in finance,
with a focus on supporting fairness-related arguments.

### [686] [Communication Styles and Reader Preferences of LLM and Human Experts in Explaining Health Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08143)
*Jiawei Zhou,Kritika Venkatachalam,Minje Choi,Koustuv Saha,Munmun De Choudhury*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）与人类在健康信息纠偏中的沟通风格差异，发现LLMs在说服策略、确定性表达和社会价值对齐上得分较低，但人类评价更偏好LLM生成的内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在信息辅助中的广泛应用，研究其与人类沟通风格和价值观的对齐至关重要，尤其是在健康信息纠偏这一关键领域。

Method: 通过比较1498条健康错误信息的解释（来自权威机构与LLM生成），从信息、发送者和接收者三个维度评估沟通风格，并进行了99名参与者的盲评。

Result: LLM生成内容在说服策略、确定性表达和社会价值对齐上得分较低，但人类评价显示60%以上更偏好LLM内容的清晰性、完整性和说服力。

Conclusion: 尽管在传统质量指标上得分较低，LLMs的结构化信息呈现方式可能更有效地吸引读者。

Abstract: With the wide adoption of large language models (LLMs) in information
assistance, it is essential to examine their alignment with human communication
styles and values. We situate this study within the context of fact-checking
health information, given the critical challenge of rectifying conceptions and
building trust. Recent studies have explored the potential of LLM for health
communication, but style differences between LLMs and human experts and
associated reader perceptions remain under-explored. In this light, our study
evaluates the communication styles of LLMs, focusing on how their explanations
differ from those of humans in three core components of health communication:
information, sender, and receiver. We compiled a dataset of 1498 health
misinformation explanations from authoritative fact-checking organizations and
generated LLM responses to inaccurate health information. Drawing from health
communication theory, we evaluate communication styles across three key
dimensions of information linguistic features, sender persuasive strategies,
and receiver value alignments. We further assessed human perceptions through a
blinded evaluation with 99 participants. Our findings reveal that LLM-generated
articles showed significantly lower scores in persuasive strategies, certainty
expressions, and alignment with social values and moral foundations. However,
human evaluation demonstrated a strong preference for LLM content, with over
60% responses favoring LLM articles for clarity, completeness, and
persuasiveness. Our results suggest that LLMs' structured approach to
presenting information may be more effective at engaging readers despite
scoring lower on traditional measures of quality in fact-checking and health
communication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估科学家和研究组的学术专长，支持学术环境管理，如职业规划和评估。

Method: 通过三个维度建模职业发展：研究主题演变、出版记录与影响、合作动态。结合AI技术提供自动化解释和比较分析。

Result: 开发了交互式多标签多视图系统，支持探索性分析职业里程碑，如高影响力文章、新兴研究主题等。

Conclusion: VizCV通过AI/ML技术实现主题分析、降维可视化和交互式文本生成，为个人或团队的职业发展提供深入理解。

Abstract: Analyzing how the publication records of scientists and research groups have
evolved over the years is crucial for assessing their expertise since it can
support the management of academic environments by assisting with career
planning and evaluation. We introduce VizCV, a novel web-based end-to-end
visual analytics framework that enables the interactive exploration of
researchers' scientific trajectories. It incorporates AI-assisted analysis and
supports automated reporting of career evolution. Our system aims to model
career progression through three key dimensions: a) research topic evolution to
detect and visualize shifts in scholarly focus over time, b) publication record
and the corresponding impact, c) collaboration dynamics depicting the growth
and transformation of a researcher's co-authorship network. AI-driven insights
provide automated explanations of career transitions, detecting significant
shifts in research direction, impact surges, or collaboration expansions. The
system also supports comparative analysis between researchers, allowing users
to compare topic trajectories and impact growth. Our interactive, multi-tab and
multiview system allows for the exploratory analysis of career milestones under
different perspectives, such as the most impactful articles, emerging research
themes, or obtaining a detailed analysis of the contribution of the researcher
in a subfield. The key contributions include AI/ML techniques for: a) topic
analysis, b) dimensionality reduction for visualizing patterns and trends, c)
the interactive creation of textual descriptions of facets of data through
configurable prompt generation and large language models, that include key
indicators, to help understanding the career development of individuals or
groups.
