TL;DR: 论文提出了一种从LLM隐藏状态中提取人格特质表示的新方法，使用大五人格框架，通过低秩子空间发现识别特质特定层，实现精确的人格特质控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在生成中表现出隐含人格特质，但可靠控制或对齐这些特质以满足特定需求仍是一个开放挑战。需要有效的机制在生成过程中操纵模型行为。

Method: 提出新流程：从transformer层提取隐藏状态激活，使用大五人格特质框架，应用低秩子空间发现方法，识别不同模型架构中特质特定的最优层进行稳健注入。

Result: 发现人格特质占据低秩共享子空间，这些潜在结构可通过精心扰动转化为有效转向机制，而不影响流畅性、方差和通用能力。

Conclusion: 该方法在心理学理论和实际模型对齐之间架起桥梁，实现了对LLM输出中人格特质表达的精确控制。

Abstract: Large Language Models exhibit implicit personalities in their generation, but
reliably controlling or aligning these traits to meet specific needs remains an
open challenge. The need for effective mechanisms for behavioural manipulation
of the model during generation is a critical gap in the literature that needs
to be fulfilled. Personality-aware LLMs hold a promising direction towards this
objective. However, the relationship between these psychological constructs and
their representations within LLMs remains underexplored and requires further
investigation. Moreover, it is intriguing to understand and study the use of
these representations to steer the models' behaviour. We propose a novel
pipeline that extracts hidden state activations from transformer layers using
the Big Five Personality Traits (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion,
Agreeableness and Neuroticism), which is a comprehensive and empirically
validated framework to model human personality applies low-rank subspace
discovery methods, and identifies trait-specific optimal layers across
different model architectures for robust injection. The resulting
personality-aligned directions are then operationalised through a flexible
steering framework with dynamic layer selection, enabling precise control of
trait expression in LLM outputs. Our findings reveal that personality traits
occupy a low-rank shared subspace, and that these latent structures can be
transformed into actionable mechanisms for effective steering through careful
perturbations without impacting the fluency, variance and general capabilities,
helping to bridge the gap between psychological theory and practical model
alignment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TextualVerifier是一个用于TextGrad的自我验证框架，通过链式思维推理和多数投票机制，提升文本推理的有效性，无需数值梯度即可实现可靠的文本优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TextGrad缺乏确保文本推理有效性的自我验证机制，这限制了其在复合AI系统中的可靠性。

Method: 采用四阶段工作流：链式思维分解、变体生成、多数投票和共识聚合，与TextGrad在损失函数和优化结果验证阶段非侵入式集成。

Result: 在PRM800K上推理步骤有效性提升29%；与TextGrad集成后在GPQA-Diamond、MMLU-ML和MMLU-CP基准上分别获得8.08、10.71和3.92个百分点的改进，统计显著（p < 0.001）。

Conclusion: TextualVerifier是首个基于LLM技术的TextGrad自我验证框架，无需数值梯度即可实现更可靠的推理，为文本优化验证开辟了新方向。

Abstract: TextGrad is a novel approach to text-based automatic differentiation that
enables composite AI systems to perform optimization without explicit numerical
equations. However, it currently lacks self-verification mechanisms that ensure
reasoning validity in text-based decision making. This research introduces
TextualVerifier, a verification framework that leverages chain-of-thought
reasoning and majority voting with large language models to address this
verification gap. TextualVerifier implements a four-stage workflow:
chain-of-thought decomposition, variant generation, majority voting, and
consensus aggregation. It integrates non-invasively with TextGrad at both the
loss function and optimization result verification stages. Experimental
evaluation using the Gemini 1.5 Pro model is conducted in two phases: (1)
standalone evaluation on PRM800K, and (2) integrated evaluation with TextGrad
on GPQA-Diamond, MMLU-ML, and MMLU-CP benchmarks. Results show statistically
significant improvements (p < 0.001). In phase one, TextualVerifier improves
the validity of reasoning steps by 29 percent. In phase two, integration into
TextGrad loss function yields a 2.2 percentage point gain from 68.2 to 70.4
percent with a moderate overhead of 5.9 LLM calls on average. Further
evaluations of TextualVerifier versioning yield 8.08, 10.71, and 3.92
percentage point improvements on GPQA, MMLU-ML, and MMLU-CP respectively.
TextualVerifier thus presents the first self-verification framework for
TextGrad through LLM-based techniques without requiring numerical gradients,
enabling more reliable reasoning and opening new directions for verification in
text-based optimization.

TL;DR: STARS是一种解码时算法，通过迭代采样、评分和拒绝/接受固定大小的token片段来引导模型生成，提高对齐质量和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型对齐方法（如微调）计算成本高且效果不佳，而推理时方法（如Best-of-N采样）需要不切实际的计算量才能达到最优对齐。

Method: 提出STARS算法：在解码时迭代采样固定大小的token片段，使用奖励模型评分，然后拒绝/接受这些片段，从而早期修正生成路径。

Result: 在6个LLM上的实验显示，STARS在胜率上比监督微调(SFT)高出14.9个百分点，比直接偏好优化(DPO)高出4.3个百分点，且与强Best-of-N基线竞争力相当。

Conclusion: 细粒度的奖励引导采样是传统微调和全序列排序方法的通用、鲁棒且高效的替代方案，用于对齐LLM。

Abstract: Aligning large language models with human values is crucial for their safe
deployment; however, existing methods, such as fine-tuning, are computationally
expensive and suboptimal. In contrast, inference-time approaches like Best-of-N
sampling require practically infeasible computation to achieve optimal
alignment. We propose STARS: Segment-level Token Alignment with Rejection
Sampling, a decoding-time algorithm that steers model generation by iteratively
sampling, scoring, and rejecting/accepting short, fixed-size token segments.
This allows for early correction of the generation path, significantly
improving computational efficiency and boosting alignment quality. Across a
suite of six LLMs, we show that STARS outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
by up to 14.9 percentage points and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) by up
to 4.3 percentage points on win-rates, while remaining highly competitive with
strong Best-of-N baselines. Our work establishes granular, reward-guided
sampling as a generalizable, robust, and efficient alternative to traditional
fine-tuning and full-sequence ranking methods for aligning LLMs.

TL;DR: GRAD是一种解码时方法，通过构建稀疏token转移图来缓解LLM幻觉问题，无需重新训练模型，在多个问答基准测试中显著提升准确性和降低幻觉率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缓解LLM幻觉的方法依赖外部知识源，但基于提示的方法脆弱且领域敏感，符号知识集成成本高昂。受知识图谱启发，作者希望开发一种轻量级、即插即用的解码时方法。

Method: GRAD通过在前向传播中累积检索语料库的下一token对数概率来构建稀疏token转移图。解码时，图检索的对数概率经过最大归一化并与模型对数概率自适应融合，优先选择高证据的延续同时保持流畅性。

Result: 在三个模型和多个问答基准测试中，GRAD始终优于基线方法：内在准确率提升9.7%，幻觉率降低8.6%，正确性提高6.9%，在所有方法中获得最高的真实性-信息性乘积分数。

Conclusion: GRAD提供了一种轻量级的替代方案，证明语料级token转移的统计证据可以有效引导生成更真实和可验证的输出。

Abstract: Hallucination mitigation remains a persistent challenge for large language
models (LLMs), even as model scales grow. Existing approaches often rely on
external knowledge sources, such as structured databases or knowledge graphs,
accessed through prompting or retrieval. However, prompt-based grounding is
fragile and domain-sensitive, while symbolic knowledge integration incurs heavy
retrieval and formatting costs. Motivated by knowledge graphs, we introduce
Graph-Retrieved Adaptive Decoding (GRAD), a decoding-time method that grounds
generation in corpus-derived evidence without retraining. GRAD constructs a
sparse token transition graph by accumulating next-token logits across a small
retrieved corpus in a single forward pass. During decoding, graph-retrieved
logits are max-normalized and adaptively fused with model logits to favor
high-evidence continuations while preserving fluency. Across three models and a
range of question-answering benchmarks spanning intrinsic, extrinsic
hallucination, and factuality tasks, GRAD consistently surpasses baselines,
achieving up to 9.7$\%$ higher intrinsic accuracy, 8.6$\%$ lower hallucination
rates, and 6.9$\%$ greater correctness compared to greedy decoding, while
attaining the highest truth--informativeness product score among all methods.
GRAD offers a lightweight, plug-and-play alternative to contrastive decoding
and knowledge graph augmentation, demonstrating that statistical evidence from
corpus-level token transitions can effectively steer generation toward more
truthful and verifiable outputs.

Motivation: RAG管道在检索证据不完整时经常失败，导致推理过程中存在空白。溯因推理作为一种生成合理缺失前提来解释观察的方法，可以填补这些空白。

Method: 提出一个集成溯因推理的框架：检测证据不足、生成候选缺失前提、通过一致性和合理性检查进行验证。

Result: 在溯因推理和多跳问答基准测试中，该方法提高了答案准确性和推理忠实度。

Conclusion: 溯因推理是增强RAG系统鲁棒性和可解释性的有前景方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced with retrieval -- commonly referred to
as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) -- have demonstrated strong performance
in knowledge-intensive tasks. However, RAG pipelines often fail when retrieved
evidence is incomplete, leaving gaps in the reasoning process. In such cases,
\emph{abductive inference} -- the process of generating plausible missing
premises to explain observations -- offers a principled approach to bridge
these gaps. In this paper, we propose a framework that integrates abductive
inference into retrieval-augmented LLMs. Our method detects insufficient
evidence, generates candidate missing premises, and validates them through
consistency and plausibility checks. Experimental results on abductive
reasoning and multi-hop QA benchmarks show that our approach improves both
answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness. This work highlights abductive
inference as a promising direction for enhancing the robustness and
explainability of RAG systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在知识密集型领域（如手术、天文学、治疗）的应用，用户（通常是领域专家）不仅需要答案，还需要反映专家级推理的有意义解释。现有评估方案主要强调解释的合理性或内部忠实性，未能捕捉解释内容是否真正符合专家直觉。

Method: 与领域专家合作，开发了新的指标来衡量LLM解释与专家判断的对齐程度，构建了T-FIX基准，涵盖七个知识密集型领域。

Result: 提出了专家对齐作为评估解释的标准，并建立了相应的评估框架。

Conclusion: T-FIX基准为解决LLM在专业领域解释质量评估提供了重要工具，强调了专家直觉在评估中的关键作用。

Abstract: As LLMs are deployed in knowledge-intensive settings (e.g., surgery,
astronomy, therapy), users expect not just answers, but also meaningful
explanations for those answers. In these settings, users are often domain
experts (e.g., doctors, astrophysicists, psychologists) who require
explanations that reflect expert-level reasoning. However, current evaluation
schemes primarily emphasize plausibility or internal faithfulness of the
explanation, which fail to capture whether the content of the explanation truly
aligns with expert intuition. We formalize expert alignment as a criterion for
evaluating explanations with T-FIX, a benchmark spanning seven
knowledge-intensive domains. In collaboration with domain experts, we develop
novel metrics to measure the alignment of LLM explanations with expert
judgment.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注批处理在降低推理成本方面的作用，但忽视了其在正则化模型行为方面的潜在价值，特别是在多步推理任务中。

Method: 在13个多样化基准测试上进行综合研究，通过行为分析考察批处理对模型推理行为的影响，包括过度思考、犹豫语言和决策果断性等方面。

Result: 批处理显著提高准确性，减少3-5倍推理token使用，抑制过度思考，减少重复自我修正，促进更果断的答案，并观察到批处理中出现集体效应。

Conclusion: 批处理不仅是吞吐量优化技术，更是强大的推理时正则化器，能够实现更高效可靠的LLM推理。

Abstract: Recent work has explored batch prompting as a strategy to amortize inference
cost in large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we show that batching
offers an additional, underappreciated benefit: it regularizes model behavior
during multi-step reasoning for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). We conduct a
comprehensive study across 13 diverse benchmarks and observe that batching
improves accuracy while substantially reducing reasoning token usage, often by
3x-5x. Through detailed behavioral analysis, we find that batching suppresses
overthinking, reduces hedging language (e.g., repetitive self-corrections), and
encourages more decisive answers. Surprisingly, we also observe emergent
collective effects in batched inference: models often generalize patterns from
earlier examples to solve harder ones in the same batch. These findings
position batching not just as a throughput optimization, but as a powerful
inference-time regularizer for more efficient and reliable LLM reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在数学推理任务上的表现可能被训练数据泄露或表面模式匹配所夸大，需要更严格的评估方法来衡量真实的推理能力。

Method: 使用35个LLMs模拟学生，基于IRT构建难度排序器，通过强化学习指导问题重写模型生成不同难度级别的对抗性问题变体。

Result: 在竞赛级数学基准测试中，RIDE生成的对抗性问题使26个先进LLMs的平均性能下降了21.73%，暴露了数学推理的鲁棒性不足。

Conclusion: RIDE框架有效揭示了LLMs数学推理能力的局限性，为更准确的模型评估提供了新方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve high performance on mathematical
reasoning, but these results can be inflated by training data leakage or
superficial pattern matching rather than genuine reasoning. To this end, an
adversarial perturbation-based evaluation is needed to measure true
mathematical reasoning ability. Current rule-based perturbation methods often
generate ill-posed questions and impede the systematic evaluation of question
difficulty and the evolution of benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we propose
RIDE, a novel adversarial question-rewriting framework that leverages Item
Response Theory (IRT) to rigorously measure question difficulty and to generate
intrinsically more challenging, well-posed variations of mathematical problems.
We employ 35 LLMs to simulate students and build a difficulty ranker from their
responses. This ranker provides a reward signal during reinforcement learning
and guides a question-rewriting model to reformulate existing questions across
difficulty levels. Applying RIDE to competition-level mathematical benchmarks
yields perturbed versions that degrade advanced LLM performance, with
experiments showing an average 21.73% drop across 26 models, thereby exposing
limited robustness in mathematical reasoning and confirming the validity of our
evaluation approach.

Motivation: 当前社会科学研究中使用LLM模拟人类行为的假设缺乏有效验证，现有基于人类判断的评估方法不够可靠，需要更稳健的工具来评估LLM生成文本的真实性和校准模型。

Method: 引入计算图灵测试框架，整合BERT检测性、语义相似度等聚合指标与风格标记、主题模式等可解释语言特征；系统比较9个开源LLM在5种校准策略下的表现，包括微调、风格提示和上下文检索。

Result: 即使经过校准，LLM输出仍明显区别于人类文本，特别是在情感基调和情感表达方面；指令调优模型表现不如基础模型；模型规模扩大不会增强人类相似度；存在人类相似度与语义保真度之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 研究为LLM模拟提供了可扩展的验证和校准框架，同时警示当前LLM在捕捉人类交流方面存在局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in the social sciences to
simulate human behavior, based on the assumption that they can generate
realistic, human-like text. Yet this assumption remains largely untested.
Existing validation efforts rely heavily on human-judgment-based evaluations --
testing whether humans can distinguish AI from human output -- despite evidence
that such judgments are blunt and unreliable. As a result, the field lacks
robust tools for assessing the realism of LLM-generated text or for calibrating
models to real-world data. This paper makes two contributions. First, we
introduce a computational Turing test: a validation framework that integrates
aggregate metrics (BERT-based detectability and semantic similarity) with
interpretable linguistic features (stylistic markers and topical patterns) to
assess how closely LLMs approximate human language within a given dataset.
Second, we systematically compare nine open-weight LLMs across five calibration
strategies -- including fine-tuning, stylistic prompting, and context retrieval
-- benchmarking their ability to reproduce user interactions on X (formerly
Twitter), Bluesky, and Reddit. Our findings challenge core assumptions in the
literature. Even after calibration, LLM outputs remain clearly distinguishable
from human text, particularly in affective tone and emotional expression.
Instruction-tuned models underperform their base counterparts, and scaling up
model size does not enhance human-likeness. Crucially, we identify a trade-off:
optimizing for human-likeness often comes at the cost of semantic fidelity, and
vice versa. These results provide a much-needed scalable framework for
validation and calibration in LLM simulations -- and offer a cautionary note
about their current limitations in capturing human communication.

Motivation: 虽然研究者致力于改进预训练数据集，但很少关注预训练机制从数据中提取知识和概念的效率。本文旨在量化预训练过程中遗留的数据集价值，并研究这种损失如何随模型规模变化。

Method: 使用检索增强生成(RAG)和测试时计算作为量化工具，评估预训练后从标准开源数据集检索带来的性能提升，并通过去污染验证结果的可靠性。

Result: 在MMLU、Math-500和SimpleQA任务上，预训练后检索带来显著准确率提升，且这些提升在去污染后依然存在。对于MMLU，检索相当于预训练计算量的约5倍。通过额外测试时计算解析检索上下文，LLaMA 3.1 8B模型在MMLU上获得10个百分点的提升。

Conclusion: 当前的预训练方法未能充分利用现有预训练数据集中的信息，存在显著的改进空间。

Abstract: Large language models learn from their vast pre-training corpora, gaining the
ability to solve an ever increasing variety of tasks; yet although researchers
work to improve these datasets, there is little effort to understand how
efficient the pre-training apparatus is at extracting ideas and knowledge from
the data. In this work, we use retrieval augmented generation along with
test-time compute as a way to quantify how much dataset value was left behind
by the process of pre-training, and how this changes across scale. We
demonstrate that pre-training then retrieving from standard and largely
open-sourced datasets results in significant accuracy gains in MMLU, Math-500,
and SimpleQA, which persist through decontamination. For MMLU we observe that
retrieval acts as a ~5x compute multiplier versus pre-training alone. We show
that these results can be further improved by leveraging additional compute at
test time to parse the retrieved context, demonstrating a 10 percentage point
improvement on MMLU for the public LLaMA 3.1 8B model. Overall, our results
suggest that today's pre-training methods do not make full use of the
information in existing pre-training datasets, leaving significant room for
progress.

Abstract: As a significant part of post-training of the Large Language Models (LLMs),
Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has greatly improved LLMs'
reasoning skills. However, some RLVR algorithms, such as GRPO (Group Relative
Policy Optimization) and GSPO (Group Sequence Policy Optimization), are
observed to suffer from unstable policy updates and low usage of sampling data,
respectively. The importance ratio of GRPO is calculated at the token level,
which focuses more on optimizing a single token. This will be easily affected
by outliers, leading to model training collapse. GSPO proposed the calculation
of the response level importance ratio, which solves the problem of high
variance and training noise accumulation in the calculation of the GRPO
importance ratio. However, since all the response tokens share a common
importance ratio, extreme values can easily raise or lower the overall mean,
leading to the entire response being mistakenly discarded, resulting in a
decrease in the utilization of sampled data. This paper introduces SSPO, which
applies sentence-level importance ratio, taking the balance between GRPO and
GSPO. SSPO not only avoids training collapse and high variance, but also
prevents the whole response tokens from being abandoned by the clipping
mechanism. Furthermore, we apply sentence entropy to PPO-CLIP to steadily
adjust the clipping bounds, encouraging high-entropy tokens to explore and
narrow the clipping range of low-entropy tokens. In particular, SSPO achieves
an average score of 46.57 across five datasets, surpassing GRPO (43.01) and
GSPO (44.42), and wins state-of-the-art performance on three datasets. These
results highlight SSPO's effectiveness in leveraging generated data by taking
the essence of GSPO but rejecting its shortcomings.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a critical technique for grounding
Large Language Models (LLMs) in factual evidence, yet evaluating RAG systems in
specialized, safety-critical domains remains a significant challenge. Existing
evaluation frameworks often rely on heuristic-based metrics that fail to
capture domain-specific nuances and other works utilize LLM-as-a-Judge
approaches that lack validated alignment with human judgment. This paper
introduces RAGalyst, an automated, human-aligned agentic framework designed for
the rigorous evaluation of domain-specific RAG systems. RAGalyst features an
agentic pipeline that generates high-quality, synthetic question-answering (QA)
datasets from source documents, incorporating an agentic filtering step to
ensure data fidelity. The framework refines two key LLM-as-a-Judge
metrics-Answer Correctness and Answerability-using prompt optimization to
achieve a strong correlation with human annotations. Applying this framework to
evaluate various RAG components across three distinct domains (military
operations, cybersecurity, and bridge engineering), we find that performance is
highly context-dependent. No single embedding model, LLM, or hyperparameter
configuration proves universally optimal. Additionally, we provide an analysis
on the most common low Answer Correctness reasons in RAG. These findings
highlight the necessity of a systematic evaluation framework like RAGalyst,
which empowers practitioners to uncover domain-specific trade-offs and make
informed design choices for building reliable and effective RAG systems.
RAGalyst is available on our Github.

Abstract: When a language model generates text, the selection of individual tokens
might lead it down very different reasoning paths, making uncertainty difficult
to quantify. In this work, we consider whether reasoning language models
represent the alternate paths that they could take during generation. To test
this hypothesis, we use hidden activations to control and predict a language
model's uncertainty during chain-of-thought reasoning. In our experiments, we
find a clear correlation between how uncertain a model is at different tokens,
and how easily the model can be steered by controlling its activations. This
suggests that activation interventions are most effective when there are
alternate paths available to the model -- in other words, when it has not yet
committed to a particular final answer. We also find that hidden activations
can predict a model's future outcome distribution, demonstrating that models
implicitly represent the space of possible paths.

TL;DR: LEASH是一种无需训练的解码算法，通过监控token级熵的斜率和top-logit边际改善来自适应停止推理生成，在保持准确性的同时显著减少token使用和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-Thought提示虽然能增强大语言模型的复杂推理能力，但生成完整固定长度的推理过程在计算上是浪费的，增加了token使用和延迟。

Method: LEASH通过监控两个内在信号：token级熵的斜率和top-logit边际改善，当这两个信号都趋于平稳时停止生成，表明模型已达到稳定的推理状态。

Result: 在GSM8K和AQuA-RAT基准测试中，LEASH将平均token生成减少30-35%，延迟减少27%，相对于CoT仅造成10个百分点的准确率下降。

Conclusion: LEASH是模型无关的，无需额外训练或监督，为CoT解码提供了一个简单高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is a key technique for enabling complex
reasoning in large language models. However, generating full, fixed-length
rationales is computationally wasteful, inflating both token usage and latency.
We introduce LEASH: Logit-Entropy Adaptive Stopping Heuristic, a training-free
decoding algorithm that adaptively halts rationale generation. LEASH monitors
two intrinsic signals: the slope of token-level entropy and the improvement in
the top-logit margin. It terminates the generation once both signals plateau,
indicating the model has reached a stable reasoning state. Across four
instruction-tuned models on the GSM8K and AQuA-RAT benchmarks, LEASH reduces
average token generation by 30--35% and latency by 27%, while incurring a 10
p.p. accuracy drop relative to CoT. LEASH is model-agnostic and requires no
additional training or supervision, offering a simple and efficient alternative
to CoT decoding.

Motivation: 大型语言模型广泛使用护栏来强制执行伦理、法律和应用特定约束，虽然能有效减轻有害响应，但这些护栏暴露了可观察的决策模式，引入了新的漏洞类别。

Method: 提出了护栏逆向工程攻击(GRA)框架，采用强化学习结合遗传算法驱动的数据增强，通过迭代收集输入-输出对、优先处理分歧案例、应用定向突变和交叉，逐步收敛到受害者护栏的高保真替代模型。

Result: 在三个广泛部署的商业系统(ChatGPT、DeepSeek、Qwen3)上评估，GRA实现了超过0.92的规则匹配率，API成本低于85美元，证明了护栏提取的实际可行性。

Conclusion: 当前护栏设计存在严重漏洞，LLM部署迫切需要更强大的防御机制来应对这些安全风险。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly employ guardrails to enforce
ethical, legal, and application-specific constraints on their outputs. While
effective at mitigating harmful responses, these guardrails introduce a new
class of vulnerabilities by exposing observable decision patterns. In this
work, we present the first study of black-box LLM guardrail reverse-engineering
attacks. We propose Guardrail Reverse-engineering Attack (GRA), a reinforcement
learning-based framework that leverages genetic algorithm-driven data
augmentation to approximate the decision-making policy of victim guardrails. By
iteratively collecting input-output pairs, prioritizing divergence cases, and
applying targeted mutations and crossovers, our method incrementally converges
toward a high-fidelity surrogate of the victim guardrail. We evaluate GRA on
three widely deployed commercial systems, namely ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Qwen3,
and demonstrate that it achieves an rule matching rate exceeding 0.92 while
requiring less than $85 in API costs. These findings underscore the practical
feasibility of guardrail extraction and highlight significant security risks
for current LLM safety mechanisms. Our findings expose critical vulnerabilities
in current guardrail designs and highlight the urgent need for more robust
defense mechanisms in LLM deployment.

Motivation: 传统多标签分类方法在LLMs中效率较低，特别是在短文本推理时。需要一种既能保持准确性又能显著提升效率的方法。

Method: 将多标签分类分解为独立的二分查询，使用前缀缓存机制优化推理效率，通过DeepSeek-V3生成标注数据，蒸馏训练小模型（HerBERT-Large、CLARIN-1B等）。

Result: 微调后的模型在训练维度上显著优于零样本基线，实现了效率提升而不损失准确性。

Conclusion: 二分查询分解结合蒸馏和缓存感知推理为基于LLM的分类提供了可扩展且有效的框架，该方法具有通用性。

Abstract: We introduce a method for efficient multi-label text classification with
large language models (LLMs), built on reformulating classification tasks as
sequences of dichotomic (yes/no) decisions. Instead of generating all labels in
a single structured response, each target dimension is queried independently,
which, combined with a prefix caching mechanism, yields substantial efficiency
gains for short-text inference without loss of accuracy. To demonstrate the
approach, we focus on affective text analysis, covering 24 dimensions including
emotions and sentiment. Using LLM-to-SLM distillation, a powerful annotator
model (DeepSeek-V3) provides multiple annotations per text, which are
aggregated to fine-tune smaller models (HerBERT-Large, CLARIN-1B, PLLuM-8B,
Gemma3-1B). The fine-tuned models show significant improvements over zero-shot
baselines, particularly on the dimensions seen during training. Our findings
suggest that decomposing multi-label classification into dichotomic queries,
combined with distillation and cache-aware inference, offers a scalable and
effective framework for LLM-based classification. While we validate the method
on affective states, the approach is general and applicable across domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多智能体设置中，LLMs通常以普通token形式传递消息，丢弃了大部分潜在语义信息，这限制了信息传输并增加了不必要的计算开销。

Method: 使用学习到的映射函数实现表示空间之间的直接语义交换，训练了一个双编码器翻译器在Llama-2-7B和Mistral-7B-Instruct之间进行向量翻译。

Result: 翻译器实现了0.538的平均余弦对齐度，以30%的混合强度注入翻译向量可以引导目标模型的生成而不破坏logits稳定性，双向评估显示2.01:1的传输不对称性。

Conclusion: 保守的向量注入保持了计算稳定性，证明了跨模型潜在通信是可行的，使协作AI系统能够共享含义而非仅传递token。

Abstract: In multi-agent settings, such as debate, reflection, or tool-calling, large
language models (LLMs) pass messages as plain tokens, discarding most latent
semantics. This constrains information transfer and adds unnecessary
computational overhead. We form a latent bridge via vector translations, which
use learned mappings that enable direct semantic exchange between
representation spaces. A dual-encoder translator trained between Llama-2-7B and
Mistral-7B-Instruct attains an average cosine alignment of 0.538. Injecting the
translated vectors at 30 percent blending strength steers the target model's
generation without destabilizing logits. Bidirectional evaluation shows a
2.01:1 transfer asymmetry, indicating that general-purpose models yield more
transferable representations than instruction-tuned variants. This conservative
injection preserves computational stability while demonstrating that
cross-model latent communication is feasible, enabling collaborative AI systems
that share meaning rather than tokens.

Motivation: 现有方法未能充分理解时间约束的复杂语义信息，而LLMs虽然具有强大的语义理解和推理泛化能力，但在时序推理方面存在局限性，容易出现幻觉和知识缺失问题。

Method: 提出PoK框架：1) 知识规划模块将复杂时序问题分解为预定义工具的子目标序列；2) 构建时序知识库和对比检索框架，选择性检索语义和时间对齐的事实。

Result: 在四个TKGQA基准数据集上的实验表明，PoK显著提高了LLMs的检索精度和推理准确性，最大提升达56.0%，超越了最先进的TKGQA方法。

Conclusion: 通过结构化规划和时序知识检索的结合，PoK有效增强了时序推理的可解释性和事实一致性。

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graph Question Answering (TKGQA) aims to answer
time-sensitive questions by leveraging factual information from Temporal
Knowledge Graphs (TKGs). While previous studies have employed pre-trained TKG
embeddings or graph neural networks to inject temporal knowledge, they fail to
fully understand the complex semantic information of time constraints.
Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress,
benefiting from their strong semantic understanding and reasoning
generalization capabilities. However, their temporal reasoning ability remains
limited. LLMs frequently suffer from hallucination and a lack of knowledge. To
address these limitations, we propose the Plan of Knowledge framework with a
contrastive temporal retriever, which is named PoK. Specifically, the proposed
Plan of Knowledge module decomposes a complex temporal question into a sequence
of sub-objectives from the pre-defined tools, serving as intermediate guidance
for reasoning exploration. In parallel, we construct a Temporal Knowledge Store
(TKS) with a contrastive retrieval framework, enabling the model to selectively
retrieve semantically and temporally aligned facts from TKGs. By combining
structured planning with temporal knowledge retrieval, PoK effectively enhances
the interpretability and factual consistency of temporal reasoning. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark TKGQA datasets demonstrate that PoK significantly
improves the retrieval precision and reasoning accuracy of LLMs, surpassing the
performance of the state-of-the-art TKGQA methods by 56.0% at most.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型是否以类似人类的方式生成词汇联想，特别是对情感词汇的联想行为，以了解LLMs的内部表征与人类心理词典的相似性。

Method: 通过比较人类参与者和大型语言模型对情感词汇的联想反应，分析联想重叠度、情感放大效应和创造性差异。

Result: 人类与LLMs的联想重叠度为中等水平；LLMs倾向于放大刺激词的情感负荷；LLMs的联想更可预测且缺乏创造性。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在词汇联想行为上与人类存在显著差异，表现出情感放大、可预测性强和创造性不足的特点。

Abstract: Human word associations are a well-known method of gaining insight into the
internal mental lexicon, but the responses spontaneously offered by human
participants to word cues are not always predictable as they may be influenced
by personal experience, emotions or individual cognitive styles. The ability to
form associative links between seemingly unrelated concepts can be the driving
mechanisms of creativity. We perform a comparison of the associative behaviour
of humans compared to large language models. More specifically, we explore
associations to emotionally loaded words and try to determine whether large
language models generate associations in a similar way to humans. We find that
the overlap between humans and LLMs is moderate, but also that the associations
of LLMs tend to amplify the underlying emotional load of the stimulus, and that
they tend to be more predictable and less creative than human ones.

Conclusion: 多智能体方法能有效提升Text-to-SQL任务的性能，特别是对于小型模型，其中规划器-编码器流程表现最佳。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems provide a natural language interface that can enable even
laymen to access information stored in databases. However, existing Large
Language Models (LLM) struggle with SQL generation from natural instructions
due to large schema sizes and complex reasoning. Prior work often focuses on
complex, somewhat impractical pipelines using flagship models, while smaller,
efficient models remain overlooked. In this work, we explore three multi-agent
LLM pipelines, with systematic performance benchmarking across a range of small
to large open-source models: (1) Multi-agent discussion pipeline, where agents
iteratively critique and refine SQL queries, and a judge synthesizes the final
answer; (2) Planner-Coder pipeline, where a thinking model planner generates
stepwise SQL generation plans and a coder synthesizes queries; and (3)
Coder-Aggregator pipeline, where multiple coders independently generate SQL
queries, and a reasoning agent selects the best query. Experiments on the
Bird-Bench Mini-Dev set reveal that Multi-Agent discussion can improve small
model performance, with up to 10.6% increase in Execution Accuracy for
Qwen2.5-7b-Instruct seen after three rounds of discussion. Among the pipelines,
the LLM Reasoner-Coder pipeline yields the best results, with DeepSeek-R1-32B
and QwQ-32B planners boosting Gemma 3 27B IT accuracy from 52.4% to the highest

Motivation: 当前AI生成内容泛滥导致通信剧场现象，发送者用LLM将简单想法膨胀为冗长内容，接收者用LLM压缩回摘要，双方都不接触真实内容。LAAC旨在改变这一模式，让LLM成为促进真实知识交流的智能中介。

Method: 通过多智能体架构进行受控实验，评估三个可信维度：信息捕获保真度（不同通信类型中意图提取的准确性）、可重现性（多次交互中结构化知识的一致性）、查询响应完整性（接收者响应无幻觉、来源混淆或捏造的可靠性）。

Result: 初步发现揭示了可测量的信任差距，在LAAC可靠部署于高风险通信场景前必须解决这些问题。

Conclusion: 虽然LAAC有潜力改变AI辅助通信模式，但在部署为可信通信中介前需要解决信息保真度、一致性和可靠性等关键信任问题。

Abstract: The proliferation of AI-generated content has created an absurd communication
theater where senders use LLMs to inflate simple ideas into verbose content,
recipients use LLMs to compress them back into summaries, and as a consequence
neither party engage with authentic content. LAAC (LLM as a Communicator)
proposes a paradigm shift - positioning LLMs as intelligent communication
intermediaries that capture the sender's intent through structured dialogue and
facilitate genuine knowledge exchange with recipients. Rather than perpetuating
cycles of AI-generated inflation and compression, LAAC enables authentic
communication across diverse contexts including academic papers, proposals,
professional emails, and cross-platform content generation. However, deploying
LLMs as trusted communication intermediaries raises critical questions about
information fidelity, consistency, and reliability. This position paper
systematically evaluates the trustworthiness requirements for LAAC's deployment
across multiple communication domains. We investigate three fundamental
dimensions: (1) Information Capture Fidelity - accuracy of intent extraction
during sender interviews across different communication types, (2)
Reproducibility - consistency of structured knowledge across multiple
interaction instances, and (3) Query Response Integrity - reliability of
recipient-facing responses without hallucination, source conflation, or
fabrication. Through controlled experiments spanning multiple LAAC use cases,
we assess these trust dimensions using LAAC's multi-agent architecture.
Preliminary findings reveal measurable trust gaps that must be addressed before
LAAC can be reliably deployed in high-stakes communication scenarios.

Abstract: This study provides an empirical assessment of whether current large language
models (LLMs) can pass the official qualifying examination for membership in
Poland's National Appeal Chamber (Krajowa Izba Odwo{\l}awcza). The authors
examine two related ideas: using LLM as actual exam candidates and applying the
'LLM-as-a-judge' approach, in which model-generated answers are automatically
evaluated by other models. The paper describes the structure of the exam, which
includes a multiple-choice knowledge test on public procurement law and a
written judgment, and presents the hybrid information recovery and extraction
pipeline built to support the models. Several LLMs (including GPT-4.1, Claude 4
Sonnet and Bielik-11B-v2.6) were tested in closed-book and various
Retrieval-Augmented Generation settings. The results show that although the
models achieved satisfactory scores in the knowledge test, none met the passing
threshold in the practical written part, and the evaluations of the
'LLM-as-a-judge' often diverged from the judgments of the official examining
committee. The authors highlight key limitations: susceptibility to
hallucinations, incorrect citation of legal provisions, weaknesses in logical
argumentation, and the need for close collaboration between legal experts and
technical teams. The findings indicate that, despite rapid technological

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM代码助手在软件开发中的广泛应用，其生成代码中的安全漏洞对网络安全构成严重威胁。现有安全基准和改进方法对实际使用中LLM的影响程度尚不明确。

Method: 引入Prompt Exposure指标，综合考虑漏洞严重性、生成概率和诱导漏洞生成的提示词；基于PE定义Model Exposure评分，评估模型生成漏洞的严重性和普遍性。

Result: 研究发现即使是当前最新的开源模型在现实使用场景中仍然容易受到早期已知漏洞的影响，表明安全性与功能性之间的权衡阻碍了有效漏洞修复。

Conclusion: 需要新的评估指标来推动最严重和普遍漏洞的缓解，PE和ME指标为量化LLM代码生成安全风险提供了有效工具。

Abstract: As the role of Large Language Models (LLM)-based coding assistants in
software development becomes more critical, so does the role of the bugs they
generate in the overall cybersecurity landscape. While a number of LLM code
security benchmarks have been proposed alongside approaches to improve the
security of generated code, it remains unclear to what extent they have
impacted widely used coding LLMs. Here, we show that even the latest
open-weight models are vulnerable in the earliest reported vulnerability
scenarios in a realistic use setting, suggesting that the safety-functionality
trade-off has until now prevented effective patching of vulnerabilities. To
help address this issue, we introduce a new severity metric that reflects the
risk posed by an LLM-generated vulnerability, accounting for vulnerability
severity, generation chance, and the formulation of the prompt that induces
vulnerable code generation - Prompt Exposure (PE). To encourage the mitigation
of the most serious and prevalent vulnerabilities, we use PE to define the
Model Exposure (ME) score, which indicates the severity and prevalence of
vulnerabilities a model generates.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) play a central role in modern artificial
intelligence, yet their development has been primarily focused on English,
resulting in limited support for other languages. We present PLLuM (Polish
Large Language Model), the largest open-source family of foundation models
tailored specifically for the Polish language. Developed by a consortium of
major Polish research institutions, PLLuM addresses the need for high-quality,
transparent, and culturally relevant language models beyond the English-centric
commercial landscape. We describe the development process, including the
construction of a new 140-billion-token Polish text corpus for pre-training, a
77k custom instructions dataset, and a 100k preference optimization dataset. A
key component is a Responsible AI framework that incorporates strict data
governance and a hybrid module for output correction and safety filtering. We
detail the models' architecture, training procedures, and alignment techniques
for both base and instruction-tuned variants, and demonstrate their utility in
a downstream task within public administration. By releasing these models
publicly, PLLuM aims to foster open research and strengthen sovereign AI
technologies in Poland.

Motivation: 研究动机是测试智能体在多轮语言环境中进行上下文敏感语用推理的能力，通过迭代参考游戏评估人类和模型的表现差异。

Method: 使用迭代参考游戏实验，让参与者在不同上下文条件下（数量、顺序、相关性）反复选择新颖指称对象，对比人类和视觉语言模型的表现。

Result: 在没有相关上下文时，模型表现优于随机但显著差于人类；在有相关上下文时，模型性能随试验次数显著提升；抽象指称的少样本参考游戏对机器学习模型仍是挑战。

Conclusion: 上下文相关性对模型语用推理能力有重要影响，相关上下文能显著提升模型性能，但抽象指称的少样本参考游戏仍是模型的难点。

Abstract: Iterated reference games - in which players repeatedly pick out novel
referents using language - present a test case for agents' ability to perform
context-sensitive pragmatic reasoning in multi-turn linguistic environments. We
tested humans and vision-language models on trials from iterated reference
games, varying the given context in terms of amount, order, and relevance.
Without relevant context, models were above chance but substantially worse than
humans. However, with relevant context, model performance increased
dramatically over trials. Few-shot reference games with abstract referents
remain a difficult task for machine learning models.

TL;DR: 提出了REMIND方法，用于评估机器学习模型中的数据遗忘效果，通过分析输入微小变化时的损失变化来检测残留记忆，比单点评估更敏感和可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习遗忘评估方法主要关注单个输入层面的遗忘，可能忽略语义相似示例中的残留影响，这会危及隐私并导致间接信息泄露。

Method: REMIND通过分析模型在输入微小变化时的损失变化模式来检测残留记忆。遗忘数据会产生更平坦的损失景观，而保留数据则表现出更尖锐、波动的模式。

Result: REMIND在仅需查询访问的条件下优于现有方法，在不同模型、数据集和转述输入上表现出鲁棒性，为实际部署提供了实用框架。

Conclusion: REMIND为语言模型中的遗忘评估提供了更敏感和可解释的衡量标准，为记忆和遗忘研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific training data
from a model without requiring full retraining. This capability is crucial for
ensuring privacy, safety, and regulatory compliance. Therefore, verifying
whether a model has truly forgotten target data is essential for maintaining
reliability and trustworthiness. However, existing evaluation methods often
assess forgetting at the level of individual inputs. This approach may overlook
residual influence present in semantically similar examples. Such influence can
compromise privacy and lead to indirect information leakage. We propose REMIND
(Residual Memorization In Neighborhood Dynamics), a novel evaluation method
aiming to detect the subtle remaining influence of unlearned data and classify
whether the data has been effectively forgotten. REMIND analyzes the model's
loss over small input variations and reveals patterns unnoticed by single-point
evaluations. We show that unlearned data yield flatter, less steep loss
landscapes, while retained or unrelated data exhibit sharper, more volatile
patterns. REMIND requires only query-based access, outperforms existing methods
under similar constraints, and demonstrates robustness across different models,
datasets, and paraphrased inputs, making it practical for real-world
deployment. By providing a more sensitive and interpretable measure of
unlearning effectiveness, REMIND provides a reliable framework to assess
unlearning in language models. As a result, REMIND offers a novel perspective
on memorization and unlearning.

Abstract: Data quality and its effective selection are fundamental to improving the
performance of machine translation models, serving as cornerstones for
achieving robust and reliable translation systems. This paper presents a data
selection methodology specifically designed for fine-tuning machine translation
systems, which leverages the synergy between a learner model and a pre-trained
reference model to enhance overall training effectiveness. By defining a
learnability score, our approach systematically evaluates the utility of data
points for training, ensuring that only the most relevant and impactful
examples contribute to the fine-tuning process. Furthermore, our method employs
a batch selection strategy which considers interdependencies among data points,
optimizing the efficiency of the training process while maintaining a focus on
data relevance. Experiments on English to Persian and several other language
pairs using an mBART model fine-tuned on the CCMatrix dataset demonstrate that
our method can achieve up to a fivefold improvement in data efficiency compared
to an iid baseline. Experimental results indicate that our approach improves
computational efficiency by 24 when utilizing cached embeddings, as it requires
fewer training data points. Additionally, it enhances generalization, resulting
in superior translation performance compared to random selection method.

prompt-based text simplification methods, we discovered an interesting finding
that text simplification performance is highly related to the gap between the
source CEFR (Arase et al., 2022) level and the target CEFR level. Inspired by
this finding, we propose two multi-round simplification methods and generate
them via GPT-4o: rule-based simplification (MRS-Rule) and jointly rule-based
LLM simplification (MRS-Joint). Our submitted systems ranked 7 out of 20 teams.
Later improvements with MRS-Joint show that taking the LLM simplified

Abstract: Automatic question generation (AQG) for mathematics education remains an
elusive goal for Intelligent Tutoring Systems and educators. While pre-trained
transformer-based language models have significantly advanced natural language
generation, they often struggle to precisely control problem complexity and
cognitive demands. In this paper, we introduce a collaborative multi-agent
framework as a novel method of incorporating inference-time computation into
AQG. This approach leverages multiple agents that iteratively refine generated
question-answer pairs to better balance complexity and cognitive demand. We
evaluate the generated questions on five meta-evaluation criteria: relevance,
importance, clarity, difficulty matching, answerability, to assess the system's
ability to control the required complexity and quality of the questions.
Preliminary evaluations show that this collaborative multi-agent framework
elevates the quality of generated educational content by fostering a more
nuanced balance between cognitive challenge and clarity. These promising
outcomes suggest that integrating collaborative multi-agent workflows can yield
more controlled, pedagogically valuable content that can help advance automated
educational content generation and adaptive learning environments.

TL;DR: 基于Transformer的医疗报告去标识化模型，通过大规模多模态训练在PHI检测任务上超越了现有学术和商业系统，建立了临床文本安全处理的新基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升医疗报告自动去标识化能力，通过扩展训练数据集和与商业云系统对标，改进受保护健康信息(PHI)的检测性能。

Method: 在现有最先进的Transformer-based PHI去标识化流水线基础上，使用斯坦福大学两个大型标注放射学语料库进行微调，引入新的PHI类别(AGE)，并采用"隐藏式"合成PHI生成方法评估稳定性。

Result: 在Penn数据集上总体F1得分0.973，斯坦福数据集上0.996，超越了之前的最佳模型。合成PHI评估显示一致的检测能力(总体F1: 0.959)，在所有供应商系统中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的去标识化模型在PHI检测方面超越了先前的学术和商业系统，为安全临床文本处理建立了新基准。

Abstract: Objective: To enhance automated de-identification of radiology reports by
scaling transformer-based models through extensive training datasets and
benchmarking performance against commercial cloud vendor systems for protected
health information (PHI) detection. Materials and Methods: In this
retrospective study, we built upon a state-of-the-art, transformer-based, PHI
de-identification pipeline by fine-tuning on two large annotated radiology
corpora from Stanford University, encompassing chest X-ray, chest CT,
abdomen/pelvis CT, and brain MR reports and introducing an additional PHI
category (AGE) into the architecture. Model performance was evaluated on test
sets from Stanford and the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) for token-level
PHI detection. We further assessed (1) the stability of synthetic PHI
generation using a "hide-in-plain-sight" method and (2) performance against
commercial systems. Precision, recall, and F1 scores were computed across all
PHI categories. Results: Our model achieved overall F1 scores of 0.973 on the
Penn dataset and 0.996 on the Stanford dataset, outperforming or maintaining
the previous state-of-the-art model performance. Synthetic PHI evaluation
showed consistent detectability (overall F1: 0.959 [0.958-0.960]) across 50
independently de-identified Penn datasets. Our model outperformed all vendor
systems on synthetic Penn reports (overall F1: 0.960 vs. 0.632-0.754).
Discussion: Large-scale, multimodal training improved cross-institutional
generalization and robustness. Synthetic PHI generation preserved data utility
while ensuring privacy. Conclusion: A transformer-based de-identification model
trained on diverse radiology datasets outperforms prior academic and commercial
systems in PHI detection and establishes a new benchmark for secure clinical
text processing.

Motivation: 解决低资源粤语语音识别面临的挑战，包括标注数据有限、六种声调、变调和口音变化，现有模型如Whisper词错误率较高。

Method: 采用协作式ASR-LALM错误纠正框架，集成强制对齐提取声学特征、LoRA微调Whisper改进声调识别，以及指令调优Qwen-Audio进行韵律感知纠正。

Result: 在自发粤语数据上的评估显示，相比Whisper-Large-V3取得了显著的字错误率提升。

Conclusion: 将声学线索与LALM推理相结合，为低资源声调语言和方言的ASR提供了可扩展策略。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is critical for language accessibility,
yet low-resource Cantonese remains challenging due to limited annotated data,
six lexical tones, tone sandhi, and accent variation. Existing ASR models, such
as Whisper, often suffer from high word error rates. Large audio-language
models (LALMs), in contrast, can leverage broader contextual reasoning but
still require explicit tonal and prosodic acoustic cues. We introduce CantoASR,
a collaborative ASR-LALM error correction framework that integrates forced
alignment for acoustic feature extraction, a LoRA-finetuned Whisper for
improved tone discrimination, and an instruction-tuned Qwen-Audio for
prosody-aware correction. Evaluations on spontaneous Cantonese data show
substantial CER gains over Whisper-Large-V3. These findings suggest that
integrating acoustic cues with LALM reasoning provides a scalable strategy for
low-resource tonal and dialectal ASR.

Conclusion: 该框架能够实现不确定性感知的图像分类、忠实的诊断推理，并为诊断不确定性的临床影响研究提供新途径。

Abstract: Radiology reports are invaluable for clinical decision-making and hold great
potential for automated analysis when structured into machine-readable formats.
These reports often contain uncertainty, which we categorize into two distinct
types: (i) Explicit uncertainty reflects doubt about the presence or absence of
findings, conveyed through hedging phrases. These vary in meaning depending on
the context, making rule-based systems insufficient to quantify the level of
uncertainty for specific findings; (ii) Implicit uncertainty arises when
radiologists omit parts of their reasoning, recording only key findings or
diagnoses. Here, it is often unclear whether omitted findings are truly absent
or simply unmentioned for brevity. We address these challenges with a two-part
framework. We quantify explicit uncertainty by creating an expert-validated,
LLM-based reference ranking of common hedging phrases, and mapping each finding
to a probability value based on this reference. In addition, we model implicit
uncertainty through an expansion framework that systematically adds
characteristic sub-findings derived from expert-defined diagnostic pathways for
14 common diagnoses. Using these methods, we release Lunguage++, an expanded,
uncertainty-aware version of the Lunguage benchmark of fine-grained structured
radiology reports. This enriched resource enables uncertainty-aware image
classification, faithful diagnostic reasoning, and new investigations into the
clinical impact of diagnostic uncertainty.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着低资源语言被纳入NLP研究，大规模数据收集往往重数量轻质量，可能导致语言技术性能不佳并产生有害内容，因此需要评估数据集质量。

Method: 通过分析三种低资源语言的机器翻译数据集，考察性别代表性，包括人名性别分布、动词语法性别和刻板印象描绘。

Result: 发现训练数据主要包含政治和宗教领域文本，而基准数据集集中在新闻、健康、体育领域；存在严重的男性性别偏向；数据量最大的语言中有害和有毒内容更突出。

Conclusion: 数量不能保证质量，需要进一步调查低资源语言数据集并及早减轻有害内容。

Abstract: As low-resourced languages are increasingly incorporated into NLP research,
there is an emphasis on collecting large-scale datasets. But in prioritizing
quantity over quality, we risk 1) building language technologies that perform
poorly for these languages and 2) producing harmful content that perpetuates
societal biases. In this paper, we investigate the quality of Machine
Translation (MT) datasets for three low-resourced languages--Afan Oromo,
Amharic, and Tigrinya, with a focus on the gender representation in the
datasets. Our findings demonstrate that while training data has a large
representation of political and religious domain text, benchmark datasets are
focused on news, health, and sports. We also found a large skew towards the
male gender--in names of persons, the grammatical gender of verbs, and in
stereotypical depictions in the datasets. Further, we found harmful and toxic
depictions against women, which were more prominent for the language with the
largest amount of data, underscoring that quantity does not guarantee quality.
We hope that our work inspires further inquiry into the datasets collected for
low-resourced languages and prompts early mitigation of harmful content.

Motivation: RNN-T在端到端语音识别中严重依赖大规模高质量标注数据，但这些数据获取成本高且困难。为了解决这个问题，需要开发能够处理转录错误的弱监督方法。

Method: 提出弱监督Transducer（WST），设计灵活的训练图，无需额外置信度估计或预训练模型，就能鲁棒地处理转录错误。

Result: 在合成和工业数据集上的实验表明，WST在转录错误率高达70%时仍能有效保持性能，一致优于BTC和OTC等基于CTC的弱监督方法。

Conclusion: WST在实际ASR场景中具有实用性和鲁棒性，为解决标注数据稀缺问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: The Recurrent Neural Network-Transducer (RNN-T) is widely adopted in
end-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks but depends heavily
on large-scale, high-quality annotated data, which are often costly and
difficult to obtain. To mitigate this reliance, we propose a Weakly Supervised
Transducer (WST), which integrates a flexible training graph designed to
robustly handle errors in the transcripts without requiring additional
confidence estimation or auxiliary pre-trained models. Empirical evaluations on
synthetic and industrial datasets reveal that WST effectively maintains
performance even with transcription error rates of up to 70%, consistently
outperforming existing Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)-based weakly
supervised approaches, such as Bypass Temporal Classification (BTC) and
Omni-Temporal Classification (OTC). These results demonstrate the practical
utility and robustness of WST in realistic ASR settings. The implementation
will be publicly available.

Conclusion: 该方法为高效的主题标注提供了可行方案，未来可进一步探索提升可解释性和自动化的研究方向。

Abstract: Extracting topics from text has become an essential task, especially with the
rapid growth of unstructured textual data. Most existing works rely on highly
computational methods to address this challenge. In this paper, we argue that
probabilistic and statistical approaches, such as topic modeling (TM), can
offer effective alternatives that require fewer computational resources. TM is
a statistical method that automatically discovers topics in large collections
of unlabeled text; however, it produces topics as distributions of
representative words, which often lack clear interpretability. Our objective is
to perform topic labeling by assigning meaningful labels to these sets of
words. To achieve this without relying on computationally expensive models, we
propose a graph-based approach that not only enriches topic words with
semantically related terms but also explores the relationships among them. By
analyzing these connections within the graph, we derive suitable labels that
accurately capture each topic's meaning. We present a comparative study between
our proposed method and several benchmarks, including ChatGPT-3.5, across two
different datasets. Our method achieved consistently better results than
traditional benchmarks in terms of BERTScore and cosine similarity and produced
results comparable to ChatGPT-3.5, while remaining computationally efficient.
Finally, we discuss future directions for topic labeling and highlight
potential research avenues for enhancing interpretability and automation.

Result: 分析2,965个项目发现约55%（1,625项）没有突变且能被1-2个分段很好描述。单分段曲线中：形状参数α的中值接近0.5，表明亚指数增长普遍；最终扩散规模主要由增长率R决定；α随主题性质变化，小众/本地主题较小，广泛共享主题较大。

Conclusion: 亚指数增长是社会扩散的常见模式，该模型为一致描述、比较和解释复杂多样的增长曲线提供了实用框架。α可解释为外向沟通偏好的指标。

Abstract: The diffusion of ideas and language in society has conventionally been
described by S-shaped models, such as the logistic curve. However, the role of
sub-exponential growth -a slower than exponential pattern known in
epidemiology- has been largely overlooked in broader social phenomena. Here, we
present a piecewise power-law model to characterize complex growth curves with
a few parameters. We systematically analyzed a large-scale dataset of
approximately one billion Japanese blog articles linked to Wikipedia
vocabulary, and observed consistent patterns in web search trend data (English,
Spanish, and Japanese). Our analysis of the 2,965 selected items reveals that
about 55% (1,625 items) were found to have no abrupt jumps and were well
captured by one or two segments. For single-segment curves, we found that (i)
the mode of the shape parameter alpha was near 0.5, indicating prevalent
sub-exponential growth; (ii) the ultimate diffusion scale is primarily
determined by the growth rate R, with minor contributions from alpha or the
duration T; and (iii) alpha showed a tendency to vary with the nature of the
topic, being smaller for niche/local topics and larger for widely shared ones.
Furthermore, a micro-behavioral model distinguishing outward contact with
strangers from inward interaction within their community suggests that alpha
can be interpreted as an index of the preference for outward-oriented
communication. These findings suggest that sub-exponential growth is a common
pattern of social diffusion, and our model provides a practical framework for
consistently describing, comparing, and interpreting complex and diverse growth
curves.

Method: 基于Angluin经典特征化的递归版本，给出了可k-列表识别的语言集合的精确特征化，并建立了与统计学习理论中识别速率的联系。

Result: 发现语言集合可k-列表识别的充要条件是该集合可以分解为k个可识别（列表大小为1）的语言子集合。在统计设置下，可k-列表识别的集合能以指数速率识别，而不可识别的集合则无法以任何趋近于零的速率识别。

Conclusion: 本文提供了语言识别理论的重要扩展，将经典的单猜测识别推广到多猜测情况，并建立了与统计学习速率的紧密联系。

Abstract: We study the problem of language identification in the limit, where given a
sequence of examples from a target language, the goal of the learner is to
output a sequence of guesses for the target language such that all the guesses
beyond some finite time are correct. Classical results of Gold showed that
language identification in the limit is impossible for essentially any
interesting collection of languages. Later, Angluin gave a precise
characterization of language collections for which this task is possible.
Motivated by recent positive results for the related problem of language
generation, we revisit the classic language identification problem in the
setting where the learner is given the additional power of producing a list of
$k$ guesses at each time step. The goal is to ensure that beyond some finite
time, one of the guesses is correct at each time step.
  We give an exact characterization of collections of languages that can be
$k$-list identified in the limit, based on a recursive version of Angluin's
characterization (for language identification with a list of size $1$). This
further leads to a conceptually appealing characterization: A language
collection can be $k$-list identified in the limit if and only if the
collection can be decomposed into $k$ collections of languages, each of which
can be identified in the limit (with a list of size $1$). We also use our
characterization to establish rates for list identification in the statistical
setting where the input is drawn as an i.i.d. stream from a distribution
supported on some language in the collection. Our results show that if a
collection is $k$-list identifiable in the limit, then the collection can be
$k$-list identified at an exponential rate, and this is best possible. On the
other hand, if a collection is not $k$-list identifiable in the limit, then it
cannot be $k$-list identified at any rate that goes to zero.

Conclusion: 可探索性作为下推系统中非确定性的稳健且操作上有意义的度量，填补了历史确定性和完全非确定性之间的理论空白。

Abstract: We study explorability, a measure of nondeterminism in pushdown automata,
which generalises history-determinism. An automaton is k-explorable if, while
reading the input, it suffices to follow k concurrent runs, built step-by-step
based only on the input seen so far, to construct an accepting one, if it
exists. We show that the class of explorable PDAs lies strictly between
history-deterministic and fully nondeterministic PDAs in terms of both
expressiveness and succinctness. In fact increasing explorability induces an
infinite hierarchy: each level k defines a strictly more expressive class than
level k-1, yet the entire class remains less expressive than general
nondeterministic PDAs. We then introduce a parameterized notion of
explorability, where the number of runs may depend on input length, and show
that exponential explorability precisely captures the context-free languages.
Finally, we prove that explorable PDAs can be doubly exponentially more
succinct than history-deterministic ones, and that the succinctness gap between
deterministic and 2-explorable PDAs is not recursively enumerable. These
results position explorability as a robust and operationally meaningful measure
of nondeterminism for pushdown systems.

Motivation: 现有的“Thinking with Text”和“Thinking with Images”范式存在局限：图像只能捕捉单一时刻，无法表示动态过程；文本和视觉作为分离模态阻碍了统一的多模态理解。

Conclusion: 视频生成模型是潜在的统一多模态理解与生成模型，“Thinking with Video”可作为统一的多模态推理范式。

Abstract: "Thinking with Text" and "Thinking with Images" paradigm significantly
improve the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) and Vision
Language Models (VLMs). However, these paradigms have inherent limitations. (1)
Images capture only single moments and fail to represent dynamic processes or
continuous changes, and (2) The separation of text and vision as distinct
modalities, hindering unified multimodal understanding and generation. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce "Thinking with Video", a new paradigm
that leverages video generation models, such as Sora-2, to bridge visual and
textual reasoning in a unified temporal framework. To support this exploration,
we developed the Video Thinking Benchmark (VideoThinkBench). VideoThinkBench
encompasses two task categories: (1) vision-centric tasks (e.g., Eyeballing
Puzzles), and (2) text-centric tasks (e.g., subsets of GSM8K, MMMU). Our
evaluation establishes Sora-2 as a capable reasoner. On vision-centric tasks,
Sora-2 is generally comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) VLMs, and even
surpasses VLMs on several tasks, such as Eyeballing Games. On text-centric
tasks, Sora-2 achieves 92% accuracy on MATH, and 75.53% accuracy on MMMU.
Furthermore, we systematically analyse the source of these abilities. We also
find that self-consistency and in-context learning can improve Sora-2's
performance. In summary, our findings demonstrate that the video generation
model is the potential unified multimodal understanding and generation model,
positions "thinking with video" as a unified multimodal reasoning paradigm.

Abstract: Empowering Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to deeply integrate image
interaction with long-horizon reasoning capabilities remains a long-standing
challenge in this field. Recent advances in vision-centric reasoning explore a
promising "Thinking with Images" paradigm for LMMs, marking a shift from
image-assisted reasoning to image-interactive thinking. While this milestone
enables models to focus on fine-grained image regions, progress remains
constrained by limited visual tool spaces and task-specific workflow designs.
To bridge this gap, we present V-Thinker, a general-purpose multimodal
reasoning assistant that enables interactive, vision-centric thinking through
end-to-end reinforcement learning. V-Thinker comprises two key components: (1)
a Data Evolution Flywheel that automatically synthesizes, evolves, and verifies
interactive reasoning datasets across three dimensions-diversity, quality, and
difficulty; and (2) a Visual Progressive Training Curriculum that first aligns
perception via point-level supervision, then integrates interactive reasoning
through a two-stage reinforcement learning framework. Furthermore, we introduce
VTBench, an expert-verified benchmark targeting vision-centric interactive
reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that V-Thinker consistently
outperforms strong LMM-based baselines in both general and interactive
reasoning scenarios, providing valuable insights for advancing
image-interactive reasoning applications.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注增强视觉信息处理的粒度，而MLLMs研究表明长文本描述能有效改善细粒度视觉语言对齐。但CLIP的文本编码器存在token长度限制，无法处理嵌入长文本序列中的细粒度文本信息。

Method: 1) 建立自动标注流水线生成像素级定位的长文本描述，构建包含150万样本的LongGRIT数据集；2) 用LLM替换CLIP的原始文本编码器，提出三分支像素-文本对齐学习框架，实现任意粒度的图像区域与对应文本描述的细粒度对齐。

Result: 实验表明PixCLIP在像素级交互和长文本处理方面取得突破，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: PixCLIP通过协同利用增强视觉和文本内容处理粒度的优势，有效解决了CLIP在细粒度图像-文本对齐方面的限制。

Abstract: While the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining(CLIP) model has achieved
remarkable success in a variety of downstream vison language understanding
tasks, enhancing its capability for fine-grained image-text alignment remains
an active research focus. To this end, most existing works adopt the strategy
of explicitly increasing the granularity of visual information processing,
e.g., incorporating visual prompts to guide the model focus on specific local
regions within the image. Meanwhile, researches on Multimodal Large Language
Models(MLLMs) have demonstrated that training with long and detailed textual
descriptions can effectively improve the model's fine-grained vision-language
alignment. However, the inherent token length limitation of CLIP's text encoder
fundamentally limits CLIP to process more granular textual information embedded
in long text sequences. To synergistically leverage the advantages of enhancing
both visual and textual content processing granularity, we propose PixCLIP, a
novel framework designed to concurrently accommodate visual prompt inputs and
process lengthy textual descriptions. Specifically, we first establish an
automated annotation pipeline capable of generating pixel-level localized,
long-form textual descriptions for images. Utilizing this pipeline, we
construct LongGRIT, a high-quality dataset comprising nearly 1.5 million
samples. Secondly, we replace CLIP's original text encoder with the LLM and
propose a three-branch pixel-text alignment learning framework, facilitating
fine-grained alignment between image regions and corresponding textual
descriptions at arbitrary granularity. Experiments demonstrate that PixCLIP
showcases breakthroughs in pixel-level interaction and handling long-form
texts, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: 在线视频可以被系统性地提炼为可操作的指导，在推理时改进计算机使用代理。轨迹分割和选择、动作过滤以及视觉信息都很重要。

Abstract: Computer-use agents can operate computers and automate laborious tasks, but
despite recent rapid progress, they still lag behind human users, especially
when tasks require domain-specific procedural knowledge about particular
applications, platforms, and multi-step workflows. Humans can bridge this gap
by watching video tutorials: we search, skim, and selectively imitate short
segments that match our current subgoal. In this paper, we study how to enable
computer-use agents to learn from online videos at inference time effectively.
We propose a framework that retrieves and filters tutorial videos, converts
them into structured demonstration trajectories, and dynamically selects
trajectories as in-context guidance during execution. Particularly, using a
VLM, we infer UI actions, segment videos into short subsequences of actions,
and assign each subsequence a textual objective. At inference time, a two-stage
selection mechanism dynamically chooses a single trajectory to add in context
at each step, focusing the agent on the most helpful local guidance for its
next decision. Experiments on two widely used benchmarks show that our
framework consistently outperforms strong base agents and variants that use
only textual tutorials or transcripts. Analyses highlight the importance of
trajectory segmentation and selection, action filtering, and visual
information, suggesting that abundant online videos can be systematically
distilled into actionable guidance that improves computer-use agents at
inference time. Our code is available at

Abstract: Despite impressive high-level video comprehension, multimodal language models
struggle with spatial reasoning across time and space. While current spatial
training approaches rely on real-world video data, obtaining diverse footage
with precise spatial annotations remains a bottleneck. To alleviate this
bottleneck, we present SIMS-V -- a systematic data-generation framework that
leverages the privileged information of 3D simulators to create spatially-rich
video training data for multimodal language models. Using this framework, we
investigate which properties of simulated data drive effective real-world
transfer through systematic ablations of question types, mixes, and scales. We
identify a minimal set of three question categories (metric measurement,
perspective-dependent reasoning, and temporal tracking) that prove most
effective for developing transferable spatial intelligence, outperforming
comprehensive coverage despite using fewer question types. These insights
enable highly efficient training: our 7B-parameter video LLM fine-tuned on just
25K simulated examples outperforms the larger 72B baseline and achieves
competitive performance with proprietary models on rigorous real-world spatial
reasoning benchmarks. Our approach demonstrates robust generalization,
maintaining performance on general video understanding while showing
substantial improvements on embodied and real-world spatial tasks.

Conclusion: Evo-1证明了轻量级VLA模型的可行性，在保持高性能的同时显著提升部署效率，为高效VLA模型研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a powerful framework that
unifies perception, language, and control, enabling robots to perform diverse
tasks through multimodal understanding. However, current VLA models typically
contain massive parameters and rely heavily on large-scale robot data
pretraining, leading to high computational costs during training, as well as
limited deployability for real-time inference. Moreover, most training
paradigms often degrade the perceptual representations of the vision-language
backbone, resulting in overfitting and poor generalization to downstream tasks.
In this work, we present Evo-1, a lightweight VLA model that reduces
computation and improves deployment efficiency, while maintaining strong
performance without pretraining on robot data. Evo-1 builds on a native
multimodal Vision-Language model (VLM), incorporating a novel cross-modulated
diffusion transformer along with an optimized integration module, together
forming an effective architecture. We further introduce a two-stage training
paradigm that progressively aligns action with perception, preserving the
representations of the VLM. Notably, with only 0.77 billion parameters, Evo-1
achieves state-of-the-art results on the Meta-World and RoboTwin suite,
surpassing the previous best models by 12.4% and 6.9%, respectively, and also
attains a competitive result of 94.8% on LIBERO. In real-world evaluations,
Evo-1 attains a 78% success rate with high inference frequency and low memory
overhead, outperforming all baseline methods. We release code, data, and model

Conclusion: RISE-T2V通过集成提示重述和语义特征提取，有效解决了文本到视频模型在语义理解和用户意图对齐方面的局限性，提升了模型的生成质量和可用性。

Abstract: Most text-to-video(T2V) diffusion models depend on pre-trained text encoders
for semantic alignment, yet they often fail to maintain video quality when
provided with concise prompts rather than well-designed ones. The primary issue
lies in their limited textual semantics understanding. Moreover, these text
encoders cannot rephrase prompts online to better align with user intentions,
which limits both the scalability and usability of the models, To address these
challenges, we introduce RISE-T2V, which uniquely integrates the processes of
prompt rephrasing and semantic feature extraction into a single and seamless
step instead of two separate steps. RISE-T2V is universal and can be applied to
various pre-trained LLMs and video diffusion models(VDMs), significantly
enhancing their capabilities for T2V tasks. We propose an innovative module
called the Rephrasing Adapter, enabling diffusion models to utilize text hidden
states during the next token prediction of the LLM as a condition for video
generation. By employing a Rephrasing Adapter, the video generation model can
implicitly rephrase basic prompts into more comprehensive representations that
better match the user's intent. Furthermore, we leverage the powerful
capabilities of LLMs to enable video generation models to accomplish a broader
range of T2V tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RISE-T2V is a
versatile framework applicable to different video diffusion model
architectures, significantly enhancing the ability of T2V models to generate
high-quality videos that align with user intent. Visual results are available

Motivation: 传统扩散模型采样速度慢，计算成本高。研究发现噪声估计和额外引导项对数值误差的敏感性不同，存在可优化的冗余计算。

Method: 将CFG ODE重新表述为多速率ODE系统，噪声估计在细粒度时间步网格上计算（龟速方程），额外引导在粗网格上计算（兔速方程）。引入误差边界感知时间步采样器和引导尺度调度器。

Result: THG将函数评估次数减少高达30%，生成保真度几乎无损失（ΔImageReward ≤ 0.032），在相同计算预算下优于最先进的基于CFG的无训练加速器。

Conclusion: 多速率公式为扩散求解器提供了新潜力，为实现无需模型重新训练的高质量实时图像合成铺平了道路。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Tortoise and Hare Guidance (THG), a training-free
strategy that accelerates diffusion sampling while maintaining high-fidelity
generation. We demonstrate that the noise estimate and the additional guidance
term exhibit markedly different sensitivity to numerical error by reformulating
the classifier-free guidance (CFG) ODE as a multirate system of ODEs. Our
error-bound analysis shows that the additional guidance branch is more robust
to approximation, revealing substantial redundancy that conventional solvers
fail to exploit. Building on this insight, THG significantly reduces the
computation of the additional guidance: the noise estimate is integrated with
the tortoise equation on the original, fine-grained timestep grid, while the
additional guidance is integrated with the hare equation only on a coarse grid.
We also introduce (i) an error-bound-aware timestep sampler that adaptively
selects step sizes and (ii) a guidance-scale scheduler that stabilizes large
extrapolation spans. THG reduces the number of function evaluations (NFE) by up
to 30% with virtually no loss in generation fidelity ($\Delta$ImageReward
$\leq$ 0.032) and outperforms state-of-the-art CFG-based training-free
accelerators under identical computation budgets. Our findings highlight the
potential of multirate formulations for diffusion solvers, paving the way for
real-time high-quality image synthesis without any model retraining. The source

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have facilitated progress in sketch

work, we propose a training-free framework based on diffusion models that
enables explicit style guidance via textual prompts and referenced style
sketches. Unlike previous style transfer methods that overwrite key and value
matrices in self-attention, we incorporate the reference features as auxiliary
information with linear smoothing and leverage a style-content guidance
mechanism. This design effectively reduces content leakage from reference
sketches and enhances synthesis quality, especially in cases with low
structural similarity between reference and target sketches. Furthermore, we
extend our framework to support controllable multi-style generation by
integrating features from multiple reference sketches, coordinated via a joint
AdaIN module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
high-quality sketch generation with accurate style alignment and improved
flexibility in style control. The official implementation of M3S is available

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学图像分割中CNN方法难以建模长距离依赖关系，而Transformer方法数据需求大且计算昂贵的问题。

Method: 将基于有理函数的KANs集成到Swin Transformer编码器中，使用Group Rational KANs (GR-KANs)提高表达能力和数据效率，减少FLOPs。

Result: 在四个不同的2D和3D医学图像分割基准测试中达到最先进性能，在数据稀缺设置下表现尤其出色。

Conclusion: KAN增强的Transformer在数据高效的医学图像分割方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is critical for accurate diagnostics and treatment
planning, but remains challenging due to complex anatomical structures and
limited annotated training data. CNN-based segmentation methods excel at local
feature extraction, but struggle with modeling long-range dependencies.
Transformers, on the other hand, capture global context more effectively, but
are inherently data-hungry and computationally expensive. In this work, we
introduce UKAST, a U-Net like architecture that integrates rational-function
based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into Swin Transformer encoders. By
leveraging rational base functions and Group Rational KANs (GR-KANs) from the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (KAT), our architecture addresses the
inefficiencies of vanilla spline-based KANs, yielding a more expressive and
data-efficient framework with reduced FLOPs and only a very small increase in
parameter count compared to SwinUNETR. UKAST achieves state-of-the-art
performance on four diverse 2D and 3D medical image segmentation benchmarks,
consistently surpassing both CNN- and Transformer-based baselines. Notably, it
attains superior accuracy in data-scarce settings, alleviating the data-hungry
limitations of standard Vision Transformers. These results show the potential
of KAN-enhanced Transformers to advance data-efficient medical image
segmentation. Code is available at: https://github.com/nsapkota417/UKAST

Relevance: 35.0

TL;DR: 提出了边界距离回归(BDR)和自适应时间细化(ATR)两个互补方法，用于优化时序动作定位中的边界检测。BDR通过有符号距离回归替代分类，实现信息论最优定位；ATR通过连续深度选择自适应分配计算资源，在减少18%计算量的同时提升2.9%性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时序动作定位方法对不同难度的边界采用统一计算，但边界检测难度存在显著差异。需要更智能的计算分配和更精确的边界定位方法。

Method: 1. BDR：使用有符号距离回归替代分类，提供信息论最优的边界定位，可轻松集成到现有方法中
2. ATR：通过连续深度选择τ∈[0,1]自适应分配计算，实现端到端可微优化，无需强化学习

Result: 在THUMOS14数据集上，ATR在162G FLOPs下达到56.5% mAP@0.7，相比统一处理的53.6%提升2.9%，同时减少18%计算量。BDR使边界峰值锐化43%，在四个基准测试中均获得1.8-3.1% mAP@0.7提升。

Conclusion: 该方法通过自适应计算分配和优化的边界定位，显著提升了时序动作定位的性能和效率，特别在边界异质性高的场景下效果更明显。

Abstract: Temporal action localization requires precise boundary detection; however,
current methods apply uniform computation despite significant variations in
difficulty across boundaries. We present two complementary contributions.
First, Boundary Distance Regression (BDR) provides information-theoretically
optimal localization through signed-distance regression rather than
classification, achieving 43\% sharper boundary peaks. BDR retrofits to
existing methods with approximately 50 lines of code, yielding consistent 1.8
to 3.1\% mAP@0.7 improvements across diverse architectures. Second, Adaptive
Temporal Refinement (ATR) allocates computation via continuous depth selection
$\tau \in [0,1]$, enabling end-to-end differentiable optimization without
reinforcement learning. On THUMOS14, ATR achieves 56.5\% mAP@0.7 at 162G FLOPs,
compared to 53.6\% at 198G for uniform processing, providing a 2.9\%
improvement with 18\% less compute. Gains scale with boundary heterogeneity,
showing 4.2\% improvement on short actions. Training cost is mitigated via
knowledge distillation, with lightweight students retaining 99\% performance at
baseline cost. Results are validated across four benchmarks with rigorous
statistical testing.

Motivation: 传统解剖标志点检测依赖领域特定模型，而大规模预训练视觉模型的出现提供了新机遇。作者发现面向人体姿态定位优化的基础模型对解剖标志点检测具有强先验，但这一潜力尚未被充分挖掘。

Method: 将人体姿态估计基础模型Sapiens适配到医学影像领域，通过多数据集预训练构建MedSapiens模型，并在有限标注数据设置下评估其适应性。

Result: MedSapiens在平均成功检测率上比通用模型提升5.26%，比专业模型提升21.81%，在少样本设置下比现有SOTA提升2.69%。

Conclusion: 人体中心基础模型固有的空间姿态定位优化特性为解剖标志点检测提供了强先验，通过适当适配可在医学影像任务中取得优异性能。

Abstract: This paper does not introduce a novel architecture; instead, it revisits a
fundamental yet overlooked baseline: adapting human-centric foundation models
for anatomical landmark detection in medical imaging. While landmark detection
has traditionally relied on domain-specific models, the emergence of
large-scale pre-trained vision models presents new opportunities. In this
study, we investigate the adaptation of Sapiens, a human-centric foundation
model designed for pose estimation, to medical imaging through multi-dataset
pretraining, establishing a new state of the art across multiple datasets. Our
proposed model, MedSapiens, demonstrates that human-centric foundation models,
inherently optimized for spatial pose localization, provide strong priors for
anatomical landmark detection, yet this potential has remained largely
untapped. We benchmark MedSapiens against existing state-of-the-art models,
achieving up to 5.26% improvement over generalist models and up to 21.81%
improvement over specialist models in the average success detection rate (SDR).
To further assess MedSapiens adaptability to novel downstream tasks with few
annotations, we evaluate its performance in limited-data settings, achieving
2.69% improvement over the few-shot state of the art in SDR. Code and model
weights are available at https://github.com/xmed-lab/MedSapiens .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中物体经常发生状态转换（如苹果被切成块、蝴蝶破茧），现有方法在物体外观显著变化时容易丢失跟踪目标，需要解决这一限制。

Method: TubeletGraph系统首先识别可能被忽略的轨迹，基于语义和邻近性先验决定是否整合，然后推理添加的轨迹并生成描述每个观察到的转换的状态图。

Result: TubeletGraph在状态转换下实现了最先进的跟踪性能，展示了对物体转换的更深理解，以及在复杂物体转换的时间定位和语义推理方面的有前景能力。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了物体状态转换过程中的跟踪挑战，为理解真实世界物体动态提供了新工具。

Abstract: Real-world objects frequently undergo state transformations. From an apple
being cut into pieces to a butterfly emerging from its cocoon, tracking through
these changes is important for understanding real-world objects and dynamics.
However, existing methods often lose track of the target object after
transformation, due to significant changes in object appearance. To address
this limitation, we introduce the task of Track Any State: tracking objects
through transformations while detecting and describing state changes,
accompanied by a new benchmark dataset, VOST-TAS. To tackle this problem, we
present TubeletGraph, a zero-shot system that recovers missing objects after
transformation and maps out how object states are evolving over time.
TubeletGraph first identifies potentially overlooked tracks, and determines
whether they should be integrated based on semantic and proximity priors. Then,
it reasons about the added tracks and generates a state graph describing each
observed transformation. TubeletGraph achieves state-of-the-art tracking
performance under transformations, while demonstrating deeper understanding of
object transformations and promising capabilities in temporal grounding and
semantic reasoning for complex object transformations. Code, additional
results, and the benchmark dataset are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘设备上的CNN微调面临严格的内存、计算和能耗限制，全微调不可行。需要开发参数高效的微调方法来应对领域偏移问题。

Method: 使用张量分解(TT-SVD)对预训练卷积层进行分解，选择性更新输出端核心，采用零初始化保持辅助路径初始不活跃，最后将更新融合回密集核中，不改变推理成本。

Result: 在多种HAR数据集和CNN骨干上，LoRA-Edge仅更新最多1.49%的参数，精度与全微调相差不超过4.7%，在Jetson Orin Nano上收敛速度提升1.4-3.8倍。

Conclusion: LoRA-Edge实现了结构对齐、参数高效的边缘设备CNN自适应，为边缘平台提供了实用的微调解决方案。

Abstract: On-device fine-tuning of CNNs is essential to withstand domain shift in edge
applications such as Human Activity Recognition (HAR), yet full fine-tuning is
infeasible under strict memory, compute, and energy budgets. We present
LoRA-Edge, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method that builds on
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with tensor-train assistance. LoRA-Edge (i) applies
Tensor-Train Singular Value Decomposition (TT-SVD) to pre-trained convolutional
layers, (ii) selectively updates only the output-side core with
zero-initialization to keep the auxiliary path inactive at the start, and (iii)
fuses the update back into dense kernels, leaving inference cost unchanged.
This design preserves convolutional structure and reduces the number of
trainable parameters by up to two orders of magnitude compared to full
fine-tuning. Across diverse HAR datasets and CNN backbones, LoRA-Edge achieves
accuracy within 4.7% of full fine-tuning while updating at most 1.49% of
parameters, consistently outperforming prior parameter-efficient baselines
under similar budgets. On a Jetson Orin Nano, TT-SVD initialization and
selective-core training yield 1.4-3.8x faster convergence to target F1.
LoRA-Edge thus makes structure-aligned, parameter-efficient on-device CNN
adaptation practical for edge platforms.

Method: 在训练过程中使用基础噪声注入技术（高斯、斑点、泊松和椒盐噪声）来提高模型对分布偏移的鲁棒性。

Result: 噪声注入技术将分布内和分布外评估的性能差距从0.10-0.20显著降低到0.01-0.06，基于AUC、F1、准确率、召回率和特异性等关键指标。

Conclusion: 基础噪声注入是一种简单有效的技术，可以显著提高深度学习模型在分布外数据上的泛化性能。

Abstract: Deep learned (DL) models for image recognition have been shown to fail to
generalize to data from different devices, populations, etc. COVID-19 detection
from Chest X-rays (CXRs), in particular, has been shown to fail to generalize
to out-of-distribution (OOD) data from new clinical sources not covered in the
training set. This occurs because models learn to exploit shortcuts -
source-specific artifacts that do not translate to new distributions - rather
than reasonable biomarkers to maximize performance on in-distribution (ID)
data. Rendering the models more robust to distribution shifts, our study
investigates the use of fundamental noise injection techniques (Gaussian,
Speckle, Poisson, and Salt and Pepper) during training. Our empirical results
demonstrate that this technique can significantly reduce the performance gap
between ID and OOD evaluation from 0.10-0.20 to 0.01-0.06, based on results
averaged over ten random seeds across key metrics such as AUC, F1, accuracy,

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理类别不平衡和小样本问题，即使在弱数据集上也能产生高质量的预测结果。

Abstract: Small, imbalanced datasets and poor input image quality can lead to high
false predictions rates with deep learning models. This paper introduces
Class-Based Image Composition, an approach that allows us to reformulate
training inputs through a fusion of multiple images of the same class into
combined visual composites, named Composite Input Images (CoImg). That enhances
the intra-class variance and improves the valuable information density per
training sample and increases the ability of the model to distinguish between
subtle disease patterns. Our method was evaluated on the Optical Coherence
Tomography Dataset for Image-Based Deep Learning Methods (OCTDL) (Kulyabin et
al., 2024), which contains 2,064 high-resolution optical coherence tomography
(OCT) scans of the human retina, representing seven distinct diseases with a
significant class imbalance. We constructed a perfectly class-balanced version
of this dataset, named Co-OCTDL, where each scan is resented as a 3x1 layout
composite image. To assess the effectiveness of this new representation, we
conducted a comparative analysis between the original dataset and its variant
using a VGG16 model. A fair comparison was ensured by utilizing the identical
model architecture and hyperparameters for all experiments. The proposed
approach markedly improved diagnostic results.The enhanced Dataset achieved
near-perfect accuracy (99.6%) with F1-score (0.995) and AUC (0.9996), compared
to a baseline model trained on raw dataset. The false prediction rate was also
significantly lower, this demonstrates that the method can producehigh-quality
predictions even for weak datasets affected by class imbalance or small sample
size.

Motivation: 现有基于2D渲染伪监督和视图特定特征学习的3D高斯分割方法在多视图一致性方面存在困难，需要开发直接在3D高斯空间中操作且能保持多视图一致性的方法。

Method: 提出CaRF框架，包含高斯场相机编码(GFCE)将相机几何融入高斯-文本交互，以及训练时配对视图监督(ITPVS)来对齐不同视图的高斯对数概率。

Result: 在Ref LERF、LERF OVS和3D OVS三个基准测试上分别实现了16.8%、4.3%和2.0%的mIoU平均提升，优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: CaRF促进了更可靠和视图一致的3D场景理解，对具身AI、AR/VR交互和自主感知具有潜在益处。

Abstract: Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation (R3DGS) aims to interpret
free-form language expressions and localize the corresponding 3D regions in
Gaussian fields. While recent advances have introduced cross-modal alignment
between language and 3D geometry, existing pipelines still struggle with
cross-view consistency due to their reliance on 2D rendered pseudo supervision
and view specific feature learning. In this work, we present Camera Aware
Referring Field (CaRF), a fully differentiable framework that operates directly
in the 3D Gaussian space and achieves multi view consistency. Specifically,
CaRF introduces Gaussian Field Camera Encoding (GFCE), which incorporates
camera geometry into Gaussian text interactions to explicitly model view
dependent variations and enhance geometric reasoning. Building on this, In
Training Paired View Supervision (ITPVS) is proposed to align per Gaussian
logits across calibrated views during training, effectively mitigating single
view overfitting and exposing inter view discrepancies for optimization.
Extensive experiments on three representative benchmarks demonstrate that CaRF
achieves average improvements of 16.8%, 4.3%, and 2.0% in mIoU over state of
the art methods on the Ref LERF, LERF OVS, and 3D OVS datasets, respectively.
Moreover, this work promotes more reliable and view consistent 3D scene
understanding, with potential benefits for embodied AI, AR/VR interaction, and
autonomous perception.

Conclusion: Bratrix通过语言锚定的多模态对齐方法，有效提升了视觉语义从神经信号中的解码性能，为神经信号理解提供了新的框架。

Abstract: Unveiling visual semantics from neural signals such as EEG, MEG, and fMRI
remains a fundamental challenge due to subject variability and the entangled
nature of visual features. Existing approaches primarily align neural activity
directly with visual embeddings, but visual-only representations often fail to
capture latent semantic dimensions, limiting interpretability and deep
robustness. To address these limitations, we propose Bratrix, the first
end-to-end framework to achieve multimodal Language-Anchored Vision-Brain
alignment. Bratrix decouples visual stimuli into hierarchical visual and
linguistic semantic components, and projects both visual and brain
representations into a shared latent space, enabling the formation of aligned
visual-language and brain-language embeddings. To emulate human-like perceptual
reliability and handle noisy neural signals, Bratrix incorporates a novel
uncertainty perception module that applies uncertainty-aware weighting during
alignment. By leveraging learnable language-anchored semantic matrices to
enhance cross-modal correlations and employing a two-stage training strategy of
single-modality pretraining followed by multimodal fine-tuning, Bratrix-M
improves alignment precision. Extensive experiments on EEG, MEG, and fMRI
benchmarks demonstrate that Bratrix improves retrieval, reconstruction, and
captioning performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, specifically
surpassing 14.3% in 200-way EEG retrieval task. Code and model are available.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) synthesis has made significant advancements in recent
years, driving applications such as generating datasets automatically. However,
precise control over object localization in generated images remains a
challenge. Existing methods fail to fully utilize positional information,
leading to an inadequate understanding of object spatial layouts. To address
this issue, we propose SpatialLock, a novel framework that leverages perception
signals and grounding information to jointly control the generation of spatial
locations. SpatialLock incorporates two components: Position-Engaged Injection
(PoI) and Position-Guided Learning (PoG). PoI directly integrates spatial
information through an attention layer, encouraging the model to learn the
grounding information effectively. PoG employs perception-based supervision to
further refine object localization. Together, these components enable the model
to generate objects with precise spatial arrangements and improve the visual
quality of the generated images. Experiments show that SpatialLock sets a new
state-of-the-art for precise object positioning, achieving IOU scores above 0.9
across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in document understanding, determining the

Motivation: 传统深度学习模型在不同传感器、区域或训练数据有限的情况下表现不佳，需要更稳健的滑坡测绘方法来进行灾害准备和响应。

Method: 采用三轴分析框架（传感器、标签、域）来适应地理空间基础模型Prithvi-EO-2.0，结合全局预训练、自监督学习和适应性微调策略。

Result: Prithvi-EO-2.0在滑坡测绘任务中一致优于任务特定的CNN（U-Net、U-Net++）、视觉Transformer（Segformer、SwinV2-B）和其他GeoFMs（TerraMind、SatMAE），展现出对光谱变化的鲁棒性、标签稀缺下的准确性保持以及跨数据集和地理环境的可靠泛化能力。

Abstract: Landslides cause severe damage to lives, infrastructure, and the environment,
making accurate and timely mapping essential for disaster preparedness and
response. However, conventional deep learning models often struggle when
applied across different sensors, regions, or under conditions of limited
training data. To address these challenges, we present a three-axis analytical
framework of sensor, label, and domain for adapting geospatial foundation
models (GeoFMs), focusing on Prithvi-EO-2.0 for landslide mapping. Through a
series of experiments, we show that it consistently outperforms task-specific
CNNs (U-Net, U-Net++), vision transformers (Segformer, SwinV2-B), and other
GeoFMs (TerraMind, SatMAE). The model, built on global pretraining,
self-supervision, and adaptable fine-tuning, proved resilient to spectral
variation, maintained accuracy under label scarcity, and generalized more
reliably across diverse datasets and geographic settings. Alongside these
strengths, we also highlight remaining challenges such as computational cost
and the limited availability of reusable AI-ready training data for landslide
research. Overall, our study positions GeoFMs as a step toward more robust and
scalable approaches for landslide risk reduction and environmental monitoring.

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展的流式视频质量评估模型，该模型无需参考视频且无需人工标注，通过合成退化训练时间感知卷积架构来预测全参考指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频质量评估方法存在局限性：全参考方法需要干净参考视频，大多数无参考方法依赖昂贵的人工标注，而大多数无人工标注的无参考方法是基于图像的，忽略了视频对象检测所需的时间上下文。

Method: 利用DAVIS数据集的合成退化，训练时间感知卷积架构直接从退化视频预测全参考指标（LPIPS、PSNR、SSIM），在推理时无需参考视频。

Result: 流式方法优于图像基线，能泛化到各种退化类型；与广泛使用的BRISQUE相比，与全参考指标的相关性更高。

Conclusion: 时间建模对于现实世界视觉系统中可扩展的视频质量评估具有重要价值，验证了时间感知、无人工标注方法的有效性。

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is vital for computer vision tasks, but
existing approaches face major limitations: full-reference (FR) metrics require
clean reference videos, and most no-reference (NR) models depend on training on
costly human opinion labels. Moreover, most opinion-unaware NR methods are
image-based, ignoring temporal context critical for video object detection. In
this work, we present a scalable, streaming-based VQA model that is both
no-reference and opinion-unaware. Our model leverages synthetic degradations of
the DAVIS dataset, training a temporal-aware convolutional architecture to
predict FR metrics (LPIPS , PSNR, SSIM) directly from degraded video, without
references at inference. We show that our streaming approach outperforms our
own image-based baseline by generalizing across diverse degradations,
underscoring the value of temporal modeling for scalable VQA in real-world
vision systems. Additionally, we demonstrate that our model achieves higher
correlation with full-reference metrics compared to BRISQUE, a widely-used
opinion-aware image quality assessment baseline, validating the effectiveness
of our temporal, opinion-unaware approach.

Abstract: Deploying autonomous robots that can learn new skills from demonstrations is
an important challenge of modern robotics. Existing solutions often apply
end-to-end imitation learning with Vision-Language Action (VLA) models or
symbolic approaches with Action Model Learning (AML). On the one hand, current
VLA models are limited by the lack of high-level symbolic planning, which
hinders their abilities in long-horizon tasks. On the other hand, symbolic
approaches in AML lack generalization and scalability perspectives. In this
paper we present a new neuro-symbolic approach, GraSP-VLA, a framework that
uses a Continuous Scene Graph representation to generate a symbolic
representation of human demonstrations. This representation is used to generate
new planning domains during inference and serves as an orchestrator for
low-level VLA policies, scaling up the number of actions that can be reproduced
in a row. Our results show that GraSP-VLA is effective for modeling symbolic
representations on the task of automatic planning domain generation from
observations. In addition, results on real-world experiments show the potential
of our Continuous Scene Graph representation to orchestrate low-level VLA
policies in long-horizon tasks.

Result: 选定的CycleGAN将噪声输入从34.66 dB/0.9234 SSIM提升到38.913 dB/0.971 SSIM，获得1.9441的估计分数和1.9343的未见集分数。Noise2Score在绝对PSNR/SSIM上稍逊，但对高噪声输入有显著改善。

Conclusion: CycleGAN提供最强的最终图像质量，而Noise2Score在无配对情况下提供具有竞争力的稳健替代方案。

Abstract: We study CT image denoising in the unpaired and self-supervised regimes by
evaluating two strong, training-data-efficient paradigms: a CycleGAN-based
residual translator and a Noise2Score (N2S) score-matching denoiser. Under a
common evaluation protocol, a configuration sweep identifies a simple standard
U-Net backbone within CycleGAN (lambda_cycle = 30, lambda_iden = 2, ngf = ndf =
64) as the most reliable setting; we then train it to convergence with a longer

SSIM to 38.913 dB / 0.971 SSIM and attains an estimated score of 1.9441 and an

Abstract: Covariance descriptors capture second-order statistics of image features.
They have shown strong performance in general computer vision tasks, but remain
underexplored in medical imaging. We investigate their effectiveness for both
conventional and learning-based medical image classification, with a particular
focus on SPDNet, a classification network specifically designed for symmetric
positive definite (SPD) matrices. We propose constructing covariance
descriptors from features extracted by pre-trained general vision encoders
(GVEs) and comparing them with handcrafted descriptors. Two GVEs - DINOv2 and
MedSAM - are evaluated across eleven binary and multi-class datasets from the
MedMNSIT benchmark. Our results show that covariance descriptors derived from
GVE features consistently outperform those derived from handcrafted features.
Moreover, SPDNet yields superior performance to state-of-the-art methods when
combined with DINOv2 features. Our findings highlight the potential of
combining covariance descriptors with powerful pretrained vision encoders for

Abstract: The growing sophistication of synthetic image and deepfake generation models
has turned source attribution and authenticity verification into a critical
challenge for modern computer vision systems. Recent studies suggest that
diffusion pipelines unintentionally imprint persistent statistical traces,
known as signal leaks, within their outputs, particularly in latent
representations. Building on this observation, we propose Proto-LeakNet, a
signal-leak-aware and interpretable attribution framework that integrates
closed-set classification with a density-based open-set evaluation on the
learned embeddings, enabling analysis of unseen generators without retraining.
Operating in the latent domain of diffusion models, our method re-simulates
partial forward diffusion to expose residual generator-specific cues. A
temporal attention encoder aggregates multi-step latent features, while a
feature-weighted prototype head structures the embedding space and enables
transparent attribution. Trained solely on closed data and achieving a Macro
AUC of 98.13%, Proto-LeakNet learns a latent geometry that remains robust under
post-processing, surpassing state-of-the-art methods, and achieves strong
separability between known and unseen generators. These results demonstrate
that modeling signal-leak bias in latent space enables reliable and
interpretable AI-image and deepfake forensics. The code for the whole work will

Abstract: Herbicide field trials require accurate identification of plant species and
assessment of herbicide-induced damage across diverse environments. While
general-purpose vision foundation models have shown promising results in
complex visual domains, their performance can be limited in agriculture, where
fine-grained distinctions between species and damage types are critical.
  In this work, we adapt a general-purpose vision foundation model to herbicide
trial characterization. Trained using a self-supervised learning approach on a
large, curated agricultural dataset, the model learns rich and transferable
representations optimized for herbicide trials images.
  Our domain-specific model significantly outperforms the best general-purpose
foundation model in both species identification (F1 score improvement from 0.91
to 0.94) and damage classification (from 0.26 to 0.33). Under unseen conditions
(new locations and other time), it achieves even greater gains (species
identification from 0.56 to 0.66; damage classification from 0.17 to 0.27). In
domain-shift scenarios, such as drone imagery, it maintains strong performance
(species classification from 0.49 to 0.60).
  Additionally, we show that domain-specific pretraining enhances segmentation
accuracy, particularly in low-annotation regimes. An annotation-efficiency
analysis reveals that, under unseen conditions, the domain-specific model
achieves 5.4% higher F1 score than the general-purpose model, while using 80%
fewer labeled samples.
  These results demonstrate the generalization capabilities of domain-specific
foundation models and their potential to significantly reduce manual annotation
efforts, offering a scalable and automated solution for herbicide trial
analysis.

Abstract: The accurate delineation of tumours in radiological images like Computed
Tomography is a very specialised and time-consuming task, and currently a
bottleneck preventing quantitative analyses to be performed routinely in the
clinical setting. For this reason, developing methods for the automated
segmentation of tumours in medical imaging is of the utmost importance and has
driven significant efforts in recent years. However, challenges regarding the
impracticality of 3D scans, given the large amount of voxels to be analysed,
usually requires the downsampling of such images or using patches thereof when
applying traditional convolutional neural networks. To overcome this problem,
in this paper we propose a new methodology that uses, divided into two stages,
voxel sparsification and submanifold sparse convolutional networks. This method
allows segmentations to be performed with high-resolution inputs and a native
3D model architecture, obtaining state-of-the-art accuracies while
significantly reducing the computational resources needed in terms of GPU
memory and time. We studied the deployment of this methodology in the context
of Computed Tomography images of renal cancer patients from the KiTS23
challenge, and our method achieved results competitive with the challenge
winners, with Dice similarity coefficients of 95.8% for kidneys + masses, 85.7%
for tumours + cysts, and 80.3% for tumours alone. Crucially, our method also
offers significant computational improvements, achieving up to a 60% reduction
in inference time and up to a 75\% reduction in VRAM usage compared to an
equivalent dense architecture, across both CPU and various GPU cards tested.

Abstract: Humanoid robots are expected to operate in human-centered environments where
safe and natural physical interaction is essential. However, most recent
reinforcement learning (RL) policies emphasize rigid tracking and suppress
external forces. Existing impedance-augmented approaches are typically
restricted to base or end-effector control and focus on resisting extreme
forces rather than enabling compliance. We introduce GentleHumanoid, a
framework that integrates impedance control into a whole-body motion tracking
policy to achieve upper-body compliance. At its core is a unified spring-based
formulation that models both resistive contacts (restoring forces when pressing
against surfaces) and guiding contacts (pushes or pulls sampled from human
motion data). This formulation ensures kinematically consistent forces across
the shoulder, elbow, and wrist, while exposing the policy to diverse
interaction scenarios. Safety is further supported through task-adjustable
force thresholds. We evaluate our approach in both simulation and on the
Unitree G1 humanoid across tasks requiring different levels of compliance,
including gentle hugging, sit-to-stand assistance, and safe object
manipulation. Compared to baselines, our policy consistently reduces peak
contact forces while maintaining task success, resulting in smoother and more
natural interactions. These results highlight a step toward humanoid robots
that can safely and effectively collaborate with humans and handle objects in
real-world environments.

Abstract: The global waste crisis is escalating, with solid waste generation expected
to increase by 70% by 2050. Traditional waste collection methods, particularly
in remote or harsh environments like deserts, are labor-intensive, inefficient,
and often hazardous. Recent advances in computer vision and deep learning have
opened the door to automated waste detection systems, yet most research focuses

Abstract: Unknown anomaly detection in medical imaging remains a fundamental challenge
due to the scarcity of labeled anomalies and the high cost of expert
supervision. We introduce an unsupervised, oracle-free framework that
incrementally expands a trusted set of normal samples without any anomaly
labels. Starting from a small, verified seed of normal images, our method
alternates between lightweight adapter updates and uncertainty-gated sample
admission. A frozen pretrained vision backbone is augmented with tiny
convolutional adapters, ensuring rapid domain adaptation with negligible
computational overhead. Extracted embeddings are stored in a compact coreset
enabling efficient k-nearest neighbor anomaly (k-NN) scoring. Safety during
incremental expansion is enforced by dual probabilistic gates, a sample is
admitted into the normal memory only if its distance to the existing coreset
lies within a calibrated z-score threshold, and its SWAG-based epistemic
uncertainty remains below a seed-calibrated bound. This mechanism prevents
drift and false inclusions without relying on generative reconstruction or
replay buffers. Empirically, our system steadily refines the notion of
normality as unlabeled data arrive, producing substantial gains over baselines.
On COVID-CXR, ROC-AUC improves from 0.9489 to 0.9982 (F1: 0.8048 to 0.9746); on
Pneumonia CXR, ROC-AUC rises from 0.6834 to 0.8968; and on Brain MRI ND-5,
ROC-AUC increases from 0.6041 to 0.7269 and PR-AUC from 0.7539 to 0.8211. These
results highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework
for real-world, label-scarce medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Reconstructing real-world objects from multi-view images is essential for
applications in 3D editing, AR/VR, and digital content creation. Existing
methods typically prioritize either geometric accuracy (Multi-View Stereo) or
photorealistic rendering (Novel View Synthesis), often decoupling geometry and
appearance optimization, which hinders downstream editing tasks. This paper
advocates an unified treatment on geometry and appearance optimization for
seamless Gaussian-mesh joint optimization. More specifically, we propose a
novel framework that simultaneously optimizes mesh geometry (vertex positions
and faces) and vertex colors via Gaussian-guided mesh differentiable rendering,
leveraging photometric consistency from input images and geometric
regularization from normal and depth maps. The obtained high-quality 3D
reconstruction can be further exploit in down-stream editing tasks, such as
relighting and shape deformation. The code will be publicly available upon
acceptance.

Motivation: 传统基于均值和方差的风格迁移方法在处理运动数据时存在不足，因为运动数据具有复杂的动态模式和时空连贯性特性，需要更全面的统计建模。

Result: 实验结果表明，AStF在运动风格迁移任务中表现出色，超越了现有最先进方法，能够更好地建模动态风格的时空统计模式。

Conclusion: 通过引入更高阶统计量(偏度和峰度)，AStF能够更全面地捕捉运动数据的复杂统计特性，显著提升了运动风格迁移的质量。

Abstract: Human motion style transfer allows characters to appear less rigidity and
more realism with specific style. Traditional arbitrary image style transfer
typically process mean and variance which is proved effective. Meanwhile,
similar methods have been adapted for motion style transfer. However, due to
the fundamental differences between images and motion, relying on mean and
variance is insufficient to fully capture the complex dynamic patterns and
spatiotemporal coherence properties of motion data. Building upon this, our key
insight is to bring two more coefficient, skewness and kurtosis, into the
analysis of motion style. Specifically, we propose a novel Adaptive Statistics
Fusor (AStF) which consists of Style Disentanglement Module (SDM) and
High-Order Multi-Statistics Attention (HOS-Attn). We trained our AStF in
conjunction with a Motion Consistency Regularization (MCR) discriminator.
Experimental results show that, by providing a more comprehensive model of the
spatiotemporal statistical patterns inherent in dynamic styles, our proposed
AStF shows proficiency superiority in motion style transfers over
state-of-the-arts. Our code and model are available at

Abstract: Video-based Visible-Infrared person re-identification (VVI-ReID) aims to
retrieve the same pedestrian across visible and infrared modalities from video
sequences. Existing methods tend to exploit modality-invariant visual features
but largely overlook gait features, which are not only modality-invariant but
also rich in temporal dynamics, thus limiting their ability to model the
spatiotemporal consistency essential for cross-modal video matching. To address
these challenges, we propose a DINOv2-Driven Gait Representation Learning
(DinoGRL) framework that leverages the rich visual priors of DINOv2 to learn
gait features complementary to appearance cues, facilitating robust
sequence-level representations for cross-modal retrieval. Specifically, we
introduce a Semantic-Aware Silhouette and Gait Learning (SASGL) model, which
generates and enhances silhouette representations with general-purpose semantic
priors from DINOv2 and jointly optimizes them with the ReID objective to
achieve semantically enriched and task-adaptive gait feature learning.
Furthermore, we develop a Progressive Bidirectional Multi-Granularity
Enhancement (PBMGE) module, which progressively refines feature representations
by enabling bidirectional interactions between gait and appearance streams
across multiple spatial granularities, fully leveraging their complementarity
to enhance global representations with rich local details and produce highly
discriminative features. Extensive experiments on HITSZ-VCM and BUPT datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our approach, significantly outperforming
existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D reconstruction for autonomous driving has advanced rapidly,
yet existing methods struggle with the joint challenges of sparse,
non-overlapping camera views and complex scene dynamics. We present UniSplat, a
general feed-forward framework that learns robust dynamic scene reconstruction
through unified latent spatio-temporal fusion. UniSplat constructs a 3D latent
scaffold, a structured representation that captures geometric and semantic
scene context by leveraging pretrained foundation models. To effectively
integrate information across spatial views and temporal frames, we introduce an
efficient fusion mechanism that operates directly within the 3D scaffold,
enabling consistent spatio-temporal alignment. To ensure complete and detailed
reconstructions, we design a dual-branch decoder that generates dynamic-aware
Gaussians from the fused scaffold by combining point-anchored refinement with
voxel-based generation, and maintain a persistent memory of static Gaussians to
enable streaming scene completion beyond current camera coverage. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that UniSplat achieves
state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis, while providing robust

Abstract: Imitation learning-based robot control policies are enjoying renewed interest
in video-based robotics. However, it remains unclear whether this approach
applies to X-ray-guided procedures, such as spine instrumentation. This is
because interpretation of multi-view X-rays is complex. We examine
opportunities and challenges for imitation policy learning in bi-plane-guided
cannula insertion. We develop an in silico sandbox for scalable, automated
simulation of X-ray-guided spine procedures with a high degree of realism. We
curate a dataset of correct trajectories and corresponding bi-planar X-ray
sequences that emulate the stepwise alignment of providers. We then train
imitation learning policies for planning and open-loop control that iteratively
align a cannula solely based on visual information. This precisely controlled
setup offers insights into limitations and capabilities of this method. Our
policy succeeded on the first attempt in 68.5% of cases, maintaining safe
intra-pedicular trajectories across diverse vertebral levels. The policy
generalized to complex anatomy, including fractures, and remained robust to
varied initializations. Rollouts on real bi-planar X-rays further suggest that
the model can produce plausible trajectories, despite training exclusively in
simulation. While these preliminary results are promising, we also identify
limitations, especially in entry point precision. Full closed-look control will
require additional considerations around how to provide sufficiently frequent
feedback. With more robust priors and domain knowledge, such models may provide
a foundation for future efforts toward lightweight and CT-free robotic
intra-operative spinal navigation.

Abstract: Humans can quickly and effortlessly extract a variety of information about
others' social interactions from visual input, ranging from visuospatial cues
like whether two people are facing each other to higher-level information. Yet,
the computations supporting these abilities remain poorly understood, and
social interaction recognition continues to challenge even the most advanced AI
vision systems. Here, we hypothesized that humans rely on 3D visuospatial pose
information to make social interaction judgments, which is absent in most AI
vision models. To test this, we combined state-of-the-art pose and depth
estimation algorithms to extract 3D joint positions of people in short video
clips depicting everyday human actions and compared their ability to predict
human social interaction judgments with current AI vision models. Strikingly,
3D joint positions outperformed most current AI vision models, revealing that
key social information is available in explicit body position but not in the
learned features of most vision models, including even the layer-wise
embeddings of the pose models used to extract joint positions. To uncover the
critical pose features humans use to make social judgments, we derived a
compact set of 3D social pose features describing only the 3D position and
direction of faces in the videos. We found that these minimal descriptors
matched the predictive strength of the full set of 3D joints and significantly
improved the performance of off-the-shelf AI vision models when combined with
their embeddings. Moreover, the degree to which 3D social pose features were
represented in each off-the-shelf AI vision model predicted the model's ability
to match human social judgments. Together, our findings provide strong evidence
that human social scene understanding relies on explicit representations of 3D
pose and can be supported by simple, structured visuospatial primitives.

Abstract: Accurate perception of the marine environment through robust multi-object
tracking (MOT) is essential for ensuring safe vessel navigation and effective
maritime surveillance. However, the complicated maritime environment often
causes camera motion and subsequent visual degradation, posing significant
challenges to MOT. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient
Dual-branch Maritime SORT (DMSORT) method for maritime MOT. The core of the
framework is a parallel tracker with affine compensation, which incorporates an
object detection and re-identification (ReID) branch, along with a dedicated
branch for dynamic camera motion estimation. Specifically, a Reversible
Columnar Detection Network (RCDN) is integrated into the detection module to
leverage multi-level visual features for robust object detection. Furthermore,
a lightweight Transformer-based appearance extractor (Li-TAE) is designed to
capture global contextual information and generate robust appearance features.
Another branch decouples platform-induced and target-intrinsic motion by
constructing a projective transformation, applying platform-motion compensation
within the Kalman filter, and thereby stabilizing true object trajectories.
Finally, a clustering-optimized feature fusion module effectively combines
motion and appearance cues to ensure identity consistency under noise,
occlusion, and drift. Extensive evaluations on the Singapore Maritime Dataset
demonstrate that DMSORT achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, DMSORT
attains the fastest runtime among existing ReID-based MOT frameworks while
maintaining high identity consistency and robustness to jitter and occlusion.

Abstract: Background In analytical chemistry, spatial information about materials is
commonly captured through imaging techniques, such as traditional color cameras
or with advanced hyperspectral cameras and microscopes. However, efficiently
extracting and analyzing this spatial information for exploratory and
predictive purposes remains a challenge, especially when using traditional
chemometric methods. Recent advances in deep learning and artificial
intelligence have significantly enhanced image processing capabilities,
enabling the extraction of multiscale deep features that are otherwise
challenging to capture with conventional image processing techniques. Despite
the wide availability of open-source deep learning models, adoption in
analytical chemistry remains limited because of the absence of structured,
step-by-step guidance for implementing these models.
  Results This tutorial aims to bridge this gap by providing a step-by-step
guide for applying deep learning approaches to extract spatial information from
imaging data and integrating it with other data sources, such as spectral
information. Importantly, the focus of this work is not on training deep
learning models for image processing but on using existing open source models
to extract deep features from imaging data.

Abstract: Deep learning models can generate virtual immunohistochemistry (IHC) stains
from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) images, offering a scalable and low-cost
alternative to laboratory IHC. However, reliable evaluation of image quality
remains a challenge as current texture- and distribution-based metrics quantify
image fidelity rather than the accuracy of IHC staining. Here, we introduce an
automated and accuracy grounded framework to determine image quality across
sixteen paired or unpaired image translation models. Using color deconvolution,
we generate masks of pixels stained brown (i.e., IHC-positive) as predicted by
each virtual IHC model. We use the segmented masks of real and virtual IHC to
compute stain accuracy metrics (Dice, IoU, Hausdorff distance) that directly
quantify correct pixel - level labeling without needing expert manual
annotations. Our results demonstrate that conventional image fidelity metrics,
including Frechet Inception Distance (FID), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR),
and structural similarity (SSIM), correlate poorly with stain accuracy and
pathologist assessment. Paired models such as PyramidPix2Pix and AdaptiveNCE
achieve the highest stain accuracy, whereas unpaired diffusion- and GAN-based
models are less reliable in providing accurate IHC positive pixel labels.
Moreover, whole-slide images (WSI) reveal performance declines that are
invisible in patch-based evaluations, emphasizing the need for WSI-level
benchmarks. Together, this framework defines a reproducible approach for
assessing the quality of virtual IHC models, a critical step to accelerate
translation towards routine use by pathologists.

Abstract: Accurate geometric modeling of the aortic valve from 3D CT images is
essential for biomechanical analysis and patient-specific simulations to assess
valve health or make a preoperative plan. However, it remains challenging to
generate aortic valve meshes with both high-quality and consistency across
different patients. Traditional approaches often produce triangular meshes with
irregular topologies, which can result in poorly shaped elements and
inconsistent correspondence due to inter-patient anatomical variation. In this
work, we address these challenges by introducing a template-fitting pipeline
with deep neural networks to generate structured quad (i.e., quadrilateral)
meshes from 3D CT images to represent aortic valve geometries. By remeshing
aortic valves of all patients with a common quad mesh template, we ensure a
uniform mesh topology with consistent node-to-node and element-to-element
correspondence across patients. This consistency enables us to simplify the
learning objective of the deep neural networks, by employing a loss function
with only two terms (i.e., a geometry reconstruction term and a smoothness
regularization term), which is sufficient to preserve mesh smoothness and
element quality. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach
produces high-quality aortic valve surface meshes with improved smoothness and
shape quality, while requiring fewer explicit regularization terms compared to
the traditional methods. These results highlight that using structured quad
meshes for the template and neural network training not only ensures mesh
correspondence and quality but also simplifies the training process, thus
enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of aortic valve modeling.

Abstract: Computer vision methods are increasingly used for the automated analysis of
large volumes of video data collected through camera traps, drones, or direct
observations of animals in the wild. While recent advances have focused
primarily on detecting individual actions, much less work has addressed the
detection and annotation of interactions -- a crucial aspect for understanding
social and individualized animal behavior. Existing open-source annotation
tools support either behavioral labeling without localization of individuals,
or localization without the capacity to capture interactions. To bridge this
gap, we present SILVI, an open-source labeling software that integrates both
functionalities. SILVI enables researchers to annotate behaviors and
interactions directly within video data, generating structured outputs suitable
for training and validating computer vision models. By linking behavioral
ecology with computer vision, SILVI facilitates the development of automated
approaches for fine-grained behavioral analyses. Although developed primarily
in the context of animal behavior, SILVI could be useful more broadly to

Motivation: 现有的基于等值面的3D网格表示方法严重依赖水密化或渲染优化，这不可避免地损害了几何保真度。需要一种能够保持锐度和内部结构的高保真表示方法。

Method: 提出Faithful Contouring稀疏体素化表示，设计双模式自编码器，支持可扩展和细节保持的形状重建。

Result: 在表示精度上达到10^-5级别的距离误差；在网格重建中，Chamfer Distance减少93%，F-score提高35%，超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: Faithful Contouring作为3D学习任务的表示方法具有卓越的保真度，在准确性和效率上都优于现有方法。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient voxelized representations of 3D meshes are the
foundation of 3D reconstruction and generation. However, existing
representations based on iso-surface heavily rely on water-tightening or
rendering optimization, which inevitably compromise geometric fidelity. We
propose Faithful Contouring, a sparse voxelized representation that supports
2048+ resolutions for arbitrary meshes, requiring neither converting meshes to
field functions nor extracting the isosurface during remeshing. It achieves
near-lossless fidelity by preserving sharpness and internal structures, even
for challenging cases with complex geometry and topology. The proposed method
also shows flexibility for texturing, manipulation, and editing. Beyond
representation, we design a dual-mode autoencoder for Faithful Contouring,
enabling scalable and detail-preserving shape reconstruction. Extensive
experiments show that Faithful Contouring surpasses existing methods in
accuracy and efficiency for both representation and reconstruction. For direct
representation, it achieves distance errors at the $10^{-5}$ level; for mesh
reconstruction, it yields a 93\% reduction in Chamfer Distance and a 35\%
improvement in F-score over strong baselines, confirming superior fidelity as a
representation for 3D learning tasks.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于PPG信号的轻量级生物认证框架，使用低帧率指尖视频提取PPG信号，通过CWT转换为时频标度图，并开发了CVT-ConvMixer-LSTM混合深度学习模型，在46个受试者上达到98%的认证准确率。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPG信号因其非侵入性采集、固有的活体检测能力和适用于低成本可穿戴设备而受到生物认证领域的关注，但信号质量受运动伪影、光照变化和个体生理变异性的挑战，需要鲁棒的特征提取和分类方法。

Method: 使用CFIHSR数据集（46个受试者，14Hz采样率），预处理包括基线漂移去除、PCA运动伪影抑制、带通滤波、傅里叶重采样和幅度归一化。通过CWT将一维PPG信号转换为二维时频标度图，开发CVT-ConvMixer-LSTM混合模型，结合CVT和ConvMixer的空间特征与LSTM的时间特征。

Conclusion: 该系统因其高效性、可扩展性和固有的活体检测能力，非常适合现实世界的移动和嵌入式生物安全应用。

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, which measure changes in blood volume in
the skin using light, have recently gained attention in biometric
authentication because of their non-invasive acquisition, inherent liveness
detection, and suitability for low-cost wearable devices. However, PPG signal
quality is challenged by motion artifacts, illumination changes, and
inter-subject physiological variability, making robust feature extraction and
classification crucial. This study proposes a lightweight and cost-effective
biometric authentication framework based on PPG signals extracted from
low-frame-rate fingertip videos. The CFIHSR dataset, comprising PPG recordings
from 46 subjects at a sampling rate of 14 Hz, is employed for evaluation. The
raw PPG signals undergo a standard preprocessing pipeline involving baseline
drift removal, motion artifact suppression using Principal Component Analysis
(PCA), bandpass filtering, Fourier-based resampling, and amplitude
normalization. To generate robust representations, each one-dimensional PPG
segment is converted into a two-dimensional time-frequency scalogram via the
Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), effectively capturing transient
cardiovascular dynamics. We developed a hybrid deep learning model, termed
CVT-ConvMixer-LSTM, by combining spatial features from the Convolutional Vision
Transformer (CVT) and ConvMixer branches with temporal features from a Long
Short-Term Memory network (LSTM). The experimental results on 46 subjects
demonstrate an authentication accuracy of 98%, validating the robustness of the
model to noise and variability between subjects. Due to its efficiency,
scalability, and inherent liveness detection capability, the proposed system is
well-suited for real-world mobile and embedded biometric security applications.

TL;DR: FastGS是一个新颖的3D高斯泼溅加速框架，通过基于多视角一致性的密度化和修剪策略，在保持渲染质量的同时显著提升训练速度，在多个数据集上实现3.32-15.45倍的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D高斯泼溅加速方法未能有效控制训练过程中的高斯数量，导致冗余计算时间开销。需要一种能够平衡训练时间和渲染质量的新方法。

Method: 提出基于多视角一致性的密度化和修剪策略，摒弃预算机制，充分考虑每个高斯的重要性，有效解决训练时间与渲染质量之间的权衡问题。

Result: 在Mip-NeRF 360、Tanks & Temples和Deep Blending数据集上的实验表明，相比DashGaussian实现3.32倍训练加速，相比vanilla 3DGS实现15.45倍加速，同时保持可比较的渲染质量。

Conclusion: FastGS具有强泛化性，在动态场景重建、表面重建、稀疏视图重建、大规模重建和SLAM等各种任务中都能提供2-7倍的训练加速。

Abstract: The dominant 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) acceleration methods fail to
properly regulate the number of Gaussians during training, causing redundant
computational time overhead. In this paper, we propose FastGS, a novel, simple,
and general acceleration framework that fully considers the importance of each
Gaussian based on multi-view consistency, efficiently solving the trade-off
between training time and rendering quality. We innovatively design a
densification and pruning strategy based on multi-view consistency, dispensing
with the budgeting mechanism. Extensive experiments on Mip-NeRF 360, Tanks &
Temples, and Deep Blending datasets demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in training speed, achieving a
3.32$\times$ training acceleration and comparable rendering quality compared
with DashGaussian on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset and a 15.45$\times$ acceleration
compared with vanilla 3DGS on the Deep Blending dataset. We demonstrate that
FastGS exhibits strong generality, delivering 2-7$\times$ training acceleration
across various tasks, including dynamic scene reconstruction, surface
reconstruction, sparse-view reconstruction, large-scale reconstruction, and
simultaneous localization and mapping. The project page is available at

Abstract: The recent and ongoing expansion of marine infrastructure, including offshore
wind farms, oil and gas platforms, artificial islands, and aquaculture
facilities, highlights the need for effective monitoring systems. The
development of robust models for offshore infrastructure detection relies on
comprehensive, balanced datasets, but falls short when samples are scarce,
particularly for underrepresented object classes, shapes, and sizes. By
training deep learning-based YOLOv10 object detection models with a combination
of synthetic and real Sentinel-1 satellite imagery acquired in the fourth
quarter of 2023 from four regions (Caspian Sea, South China Sea, Gulf of
Guinea, and Coast of Brazil), this study investigates the use of synthetic
training data to enhance model performance. We evaluated this approach by
applying the model to detect offshore platforms in three unseen regions (Gulf
of Mexico, North Sea, Persian Gulf) and thereby assess geographic
transferability. This region-holdout evaluation demonstrated that the model
generalises beyond the training areas. In total, 3,529 offshore platforms were
detected, including 411 in the North Sea, 1,519 in the Gulf of Mexico, and
1,593 in the Persian Gulf. The model achieved an F1 score of 0.85, which
improved to 0.90 upon incorporating synthetic data. We analysed how synthetic
data enhances the representation of unbalanced classes and overall model
performance, taking a first step toward globally transferable detection of
offshore infrastructure. This study underscores the importance of balanced
datasets and highlights synthetic data generation as an effective strategy to
address common challenges in remote sensing, demonstrating the potential of
deep learning for scalable, global offshore infrastructure monitoring.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了传感器遮挡对基于BEVFusion架构的3D物体检测性能的影响，发现在nuScenes数据集上，相机遮挡导致mAP下降41.3%，而LiDAR仅在严重遮挡时性能下降47.3%。融合设置中，LiDAR遮挡的影响更大。


<details>

Motivation: 研究环境遮挡（如雾、霾、物理障碍）对多传感器融合3D检测系统的影响，填补了BEV融合架构在遮挡条件下性能评估的研究空白。

Method: 使用BEVFusion架构在nuScenes数据集上评估相机和LiDAR传感器在不同遮挡程度下的3D检测性能，使用mAP和NDS作为评估指标。

Result: 相机中度遮挡导致mAP下降41.3%（35.6%→20.9%），LiDAR严重遮挡时mAP下降47.3%（64.7%→34.1%）。融合设置中，相机遮挡仅导致4.1%下降，而LiDAR遮挡导致26.8%下降。

Conclusion: 模型对LiDAR的依赖更强，需要开发遮挡感知的评估方法和改进的传感器融合技术以应对部分传感器失效。

Abstract: Accurate 3D object detection is essential for automated vehicles to navigate
safely in complex real-world environments. Bird's Eye View (BEV)
representations, which project multi-sensor data into a top-down spatial
format, have emerged as a powerful approach for robust perception. Although
BEV-based fusion architectures have demonstrated strong performance through
multimodal integration, the effects of sensor occlusions, caused by
environmental conditions such as fog, haze, or physical obstructions, on 3D
detection accuracy remain underexplored. In this work, we investigate the
impact of occlusions on both camera and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)
outputs using the BEVFusion architecture, evaluated on the nuScenes dataset.
Detection performance is measured using mean Average Precision (mAP) and the
nuScenes Detection Score (NDS). Our results show that moderate camera
occlusions lead to a 41.3% drop in mAP (from 35.6% to 20.9%) when detection is
based only on the camera. On the other hand, LiDAR sharply drops in performance
only under heavy occlusion, with mAP falling by 47.3% (from 64.7% to 34.1%),
with a severe impact on long-range detection. In fused settings, the effect
depends on which sensor is occluded: occluding the camera leads to a minor 4.1%
drop (from 68.5% to 65.7%), while occluding LiDAR results in a larger 26.8%
drop (to 50.1%), revealing the model's stronger reliance on LiDAR for the task
of 3D object detection. Our results highlight the need for future research into
occlusion-aware evaluation methods and improved sensor fusion techniques that
can maintain detection accuracy in the presence of partial sensor failure or
degradation due to adverse environmental conditions.

Conclusion: 该工具为野生头足类动物行为研究提供了实用工具，减少现实场景中的人工分析需求。

Abstract: Analyzing octopuses in their natural habitats is challenging due to their
camouflage capability, rapid changes in skin texture and color, non-rigid body
deformations, and frequent occlusions, all of which are compounded by variable
underwater lighting and turbidity. Addressing the lack of large-scale annotated
datasets, this paper introduces HideAndSeg, a novel, minimally supervised
AI-based tool for segmenting videos of octopuses. It establishes a quantitative
baseline for this task. HideAndSeg integrates SAM2 with a custom-trained
YOLOv11 object detector. First, the user provides point coordinates to generate
the initial segmentation masks with SAM2. These masks serve as training data
for the YOLO model. After that, our approach fully automates the pipeline by
providing a bounding box prompt to SAM2, eliminating the need for further
manual intervention. We introduce two unsupervised metrics - temporal
consistency $DICE_t$ and new component count $NC_t$ - to quantitatively
evaluate segmentation quality and guide mask refinement in the absence of
ground-truth data, i.e., real-world information that serves to train, validate,
and test AI models. Results show that HideAndSeg achieves satisfactory
performance, reducing segmentation noise compared to the manually prompted
approach. Our method can re-identify and segment the octopus even after periods
of complete occlusion in natural environments, a scenario in which the manually
prompted model fails. By reducing the need for manual analysis in real-world
scenarios, this work provides a practical tool that paves the way for more
efficient behavioral studies of wild cephalopods.

Motivation: CT成像在评估心血管解剖和功能方面应用广泛，但直接从对比剂演化电影中估计血流速度的方法尚未开发。研究旨在评估CT成像对基于物理信息神经网络(PINN)血流估计的影响。

Method: 使用计算流体动力学生成理想化2D血管分叉中的脉动流场，模拟不同机架旋转速度、管电流和脉冲模式成像设置的CT扫描。比较基于重建图像的PINN方法(ImageFlow)与直接使用正弦图的SinoFlow方法。

Result: SinoFlow通过避免滤波反投影引入的误差传播，显著改善了血流估计性能。在所有测试的机架旋转速度下都表现稳健，均方误差和速度误差始终低于ImageFlow。SinoFlow兼容脉冲模式成像，在更短脉冲宽度下保持更高精度。

Conclusion: SinoFlow为基于CT的血流估计提供了更有前景的方法，为PINNs在CT图像中的应用提供了解决方案，合理的采集参数可获得准确的血流估计。

Abstract: Background: Non-invasive imaging-based assessment of blood flow plays a
critical role in evaluating heart function and structure. Computed Tomography
(CT) is a widely-used imaging modality that can robustly evaluate
cardiovascular anatomy and function, but direct methods to estimate blood flow
velocity from movies of contrast evolution have not been developed.
  Purpose: This study evaluates the impact of CT imaging on Physics-Informed
Neural Networks (PINN)-based flow estimation and proposes an improved
framework, SinoFlow, which uses sinogram data directly to estimate blood flow.
  Methods: We generated pulsatile flow fields in an idealized 2D vessel
bifurcation using computational fluid dynamics and simulated CT scans with
varying gantry rotation speeds, tube currents, and pulse mode imaging settings.
We compared the performance of PINN-based flow estimation using reconstructed
images (ImageFlow) to SinoFlow.
  Results: SinoFlow significantly improved flow estimation performance by
avoiding propagating errors introduced by filtered backprojection. SinoFlow was
robust across all tested gantry rotation speeds and consistently produced lower
mean squared error and velocity errors than ImageFlow. Additionally, SinoFlow
was compatible with pulsed-mode imaging and maintained higher accuracy with
shorter pulse widths.
  Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential of SinoFlow for CT-based
flow estimation, providing a more promising approach for non-invasive blood
flow assessment. The findings aim to inform future applications of PINNs to CT
images and provide a solution for image-based estimation, with reasonable
acquisition parameters yielding accurate flow estimates.

Conclusion: 通过专门的数据集和直接监督方法，可以有效地预测场景的结构布局，弥补现有重建方法在预测被遮挡表面方面的不足。

Abstract: Modern scene reconstruction methods are able to accurately recover 3D
surfaces that are visible in one or more images. However, this leads to
incomplete reconstructions, missing all occluded surfaces. While much progress
has been made on reconstructing entire objects given partial observations using
generative models, the structural elements of a scene, like the walls, floors
and ceilings, have received less attention. We argue that these scene elements
should be relatively easy to predict, since they are typically planar,
repetitive and simple, and so less costly approaches may be suitable. In this
work, we present a synthetic dataset -- Room Envelopes -- that facilitates
progress on this task by providing a set of RGB images and two associated
pointmaps for each image: one capturing the visible surface and one capturing
the first surface once fittings and fixtures are removed, that is, the
structural layout. As we show, this enables direct supervision for feed-forward
monocular geometry estimators that predict both the first visible surface and
the first layout surface. This confers an understanding of the scene's extent,
as well as the shape and location of its objects.

Abstract: Image registration refers to the process of spatially aligning two or more
images by mapping them into a common coordinate system, so that corresponding
anatomical or tissue structures are matched across images. In digital
pathology, registration enables direct comparison and integration of
information from different stains or imaging modalities, sup-porting
applications such as biomarker analysis and tissue reconstruction. Accurate
registration of images from different modalities is an essential step in
digital pathology. In this study, we investigated how various color
transformation techniques affect image registration between hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E) stained images and non-linear multimodal images. We used a dataset
of 20 tissue sample pairs, with each pair undergoing several preprocessing
steps, including different color transformation (CycleGAN, Macenko, Reinhard,
Vahadane), inversion, contrast adjustment, intensity normalization, and
denoising. All images were registered using the VALIS registration method,
which first applies rigid registration and then performs non-rigid registration
in two steps on both low and high-resolution images. Registration performance
was evaluated using the relative Target Registration Error (rTRE). We reported
the median of median rTRE values (MMrTRE) and the average of median rTRE values
(AMrTRE) for each method. In addition, we performed a custom point-based
evaluation using ten manually selected key points. Registration was done
separately for two scenarios, using either the original or inverted multimodal
images. In both scenarios, CycleGAN color transformation achieved the lowest
registration errors, while the other methods showed higher errors. These
findings show that applying color transformation before registration improves
alignment between images from different modalities and supports more reliable
analysis in digital pathology.

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate assessment of surgical complexity is essential in
Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy (LC), where severe inflammation is associated with
longer operative times and increased risk of postoperative complications. The
Parkland Grading Scale (PGS) provides a clinically validated framework for
stratifying inflammation severity; however, its automation in surgical videos
remains largely unexplored, particularly in realistic scenarios where complete

we introduce STC-Net, a novel framework for SingleTimestamp-based Complexity

supervision. Unlike prior methods limited to static images or manually trimmed
clips, STC-Net operates directly on full videos. It jointly performs temporal
localization and grading through a localization, window proposal, and grading
module. We introduce a novel loss formulation combining hard and soft
localization objectives and background-aware grading supervision. Results:
Evaluated on a private dataset of 1,859 LC videos, STC-Net achieves an accuracy

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于偏振分辨近红外成像的眼动追踪系统(PET)，通过测量眼组织反射光的偏振状态来提高追踪精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于光强的眼动追踪系统在某些条件下性能受限，偏振成像可以提供额外的光学对比度机制，提高追踪的鲁棒性和准确性。

Method: 使用偏振滤光片阵列相机配合线性偏振近红外光源，在巩膜和角膜上检测可追踪特征，并基于卷积神经网络训练机器学习模型。

Result: 在346名参与者的测试中，PET系统相比仅基于光强的基线系统，将中位数95百分位绝对注视误差降低了10-16%，在眼睑遮挡、眼距变化和瞳孔大小变化等条件下表现更稳定。

Conclusion: 偏振光-组织相互作用效应可以显著改善人机交互性能，PET作为一种简单、鲁棒的传感模式有望应用于未来的可穿戴设备。

Abstract: Polarization-resolved near-infrared imaging adds a useful optical contrast
mechanism to eye tracking by measuring the polarization state of light
reflected by ocular tissues in addition to its intensity. In this paper we
demonstrate how this contrast can be used to enable eye tracking. Specifically,
we demonstrate that a polarization-enabled eye tracking (PET) system composed
of a polarization--filter--array camera paired with a linearly polarized
near-infrared illuminator can reveal trackable features across the sclera and
gaze-informative patterns on the cornea, largely absent in intensity-only
images. Across a cohort of 346 participants, convolutional neural network based
machine learning models trained on data from PET reduced the median
95th-percentile absolute gaze error by 10--16\% relative to capacity-matched
intensity baselines under nominal conditions and in the presence of eyelid
occlusions, eye-relief changes, and pupil-size variation. These results link
light--tissue polarization effects to practical gains in human--computer
interaction and position PET as a simple, robust sensing modality for future
wearable devices.

Conclusion: 为FMT重建建立了新的鲁棒准确范式，为复杂临床相关场景中更可靠的分子成像铺平道路。

Abstract: Fluorescence Molecular Tomography (FMT) is a promising technique for
non-invasive 3D visualization of fluorescent probes, but its reconstruction
remains challenging due to the inherent ill-posedness and reliance on
inaccurate or often-unknown tissue optical properties. While deep learning
methods have shown promise, their supervised nature limits generalization
beyond training data. To address these problems, we propose $\mu$NeuFMT, a
self-supervised FMT reconstruction framework that integrates implicit
neural-based scene representation with explicit physical modeling of photon
propagation. Its key innovation lies in jointly optimize both the fluorescence
distribution and the optical properties ($\mu$) during reconstruction,
eliminating the need for precise prior knowledge of tissue optics or
pre-conditioned training data. We demonstrate that $\mu$NeuFMT robustly
recovers accurate fluorophore distributions and optical coefficients even with
severely erroneous initial values (0.5$\times$ to 2$\times$ of ground truth).
Extensive numerical, phantom, and in vivo validations show that $\mu$NeuFMT
outperforms conventional and supervised deep learning approaches across diverse
heterogeneous scenarios. Our work establishes a new paradigm for robust and
accurate FMT reconstruction, paving the way for more reliable molecular imaging
in complex clinically related scenarios, such as fluorescence guided surgery.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Robust benchmarks are crucial for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs). Yet we find that models can ace many multimodal benchmarks without
strong visual understanding, instead exploiting biases, linguistic priors, and
superficial patterns. This is especially problematic for vision-centric
benchmarks that are meant to require visual inputs. We adopt a diagnostic
principle for benchmark design: if a benchmark can be gamed, it will be.
Designers should therefore try to ``game'' their own benchmarks first, using
diagnostic and debiasing procedures to systematically identify and mitigate
non-visual biases. Effective diagnosis requires directly ``training on the test
set'' -- probing the released test set for its intrinsic, exploitable patterns.
  We operationalize this standard with two components. First, we diagnose
benchmark susceptibility using a ``Test-set Stress-Test'' (TsT) methodology.
Our primary diagnostic tool involves fine-tuning a powerful Large Language
Model via $k$-fold cross-validation on exclusively the non-visual, textual
inputs of the test set to reveal shortcut performance and assign each sample a
bias score $s(x)$. We complement this with a lightweight Random Forest-based
diagnostic operating on hand-crafted features for fast, interpretable auditing.
Second, we debias benchmarks by filtering high-bias samples using an
``Iterative Bias Pruning'' (IBP) procedure. Applying this framework to four
benchmarks -- VSI-Bench, CV-Bench, MMMU, and VideoMME -- we uncover pervasive
non-visual biases. As a case study, we apply our full framework to create
VSI-Bench-Debiased, demonstrating reduced non-visual solvability and a wider
vision-blind performance gap than the original.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We argue that progress in true multimodal intelligence calls for a shift from
reactive, task-driven systems and brute-force long context towards a broader
paradigm of supersensing. We frame spatial supersensing as four stages beyond
linguistic-only understanding: semantic perception (naming what is seen),
streaming event cognition (maintaining memory across continuous experiences),
implicit 3D spatial cognition (inferring the world behind pixels), and
predictive world modeling (creating internal models that filter and organize
information). Current benchmarks largely test only the early stages, offering
narrow coverage of spatial cognition and rarely challenging models in ways that
require true world modeling. To drive progress in spatial supersensing, we
present VSI-SUPER, a two-part benchmark: VSR (long-horizon visual spatial
recall) and VSC (continual visual spatial counting). These tasks require
arbitrarily long video inputs yet are resistant to brute-force context
expansion. We then test data scaling limits by curating VSI-590K and training
Cambrian-S, achieving +30% absolute improvement on VSI-Bench without
sacrificing general capabilities. Yet performance on VSI-SUPER remains limited,
indicating that scale alone is insufficient for spatial supersensing. We
propose predictive sensing as a path forward, presenting a proof-of-concept in
which a self-supervised next-latent-frame predictor leverages surprise
(prediction error) to drive memory and event segmentation. On VSI-SUPER, this
approach substantially outperforms leading proprietary baselines, showing that
spatial supersensing requires models that not only see but also anticipate,
select, and organize experience.

Motivation: 解决强化学习在大型语言模型代理中实际应用面临的挑战：昂贵的环境交互、任务多样性有限、奖励信号不可靠以及基础设施复杂性，这些因素阻碍了可扩展经验数据的收集。

Method: 1) 将环境动态提炼为基于推理的经验模型，通过逐步推理推导一致的状态转换和反馈信号；2) 使用离线真实数据初始化经验回放缓冲区，并通过新交互持续丰富；3) 自适应生成挑战当前代理策略的新任务，实现有效的在线课程学习。

Result: 在多样化环境和代理骨干上的实验表明，DreamGym显著改善了RL训练。在非RL就绪任务如WebArena上，性能超过所有基线30%以上；在RL就绪但成本高昂的设置中，仅使用合成交互就能匹配GRPO和PPO性能；在将纯合成经验训练的策略转移到真实环境RL时，DreamGym在需要更少真实世界交互的同时带来显著性能提升。

Conclusion: DreamGym为通用强化学习提供了一个可扩展的预热启动策略，通过合成经验有效支持自主代理的在线RL训练。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) can empower large language model (LLM)
agents by enabling self-improvement through interaction, its practical adoption
remains challenging due to costly rollouts, limited task diversity, unreliable
reward signals, and infrastructure complexity, all of which obstruct the
collection of scalable experience data. To address these challenges, we
introduce DreamGym, the first unified framework designed to synthesize diverse
experiences with scalability in mind to enable effective online RL training for
autonomous agents. Rather than relying on expensive real-environment rollouts,
DreamGym distills environment dynamics into a reasoning-based experience model
that derives consistent state transitions and feedback signals through
step-by-step reasoning, enabling scalable agent rollout collection for RL. To
improve the stability and quality of transitions, DreamGym leverages an
experience replay buffer initialized with offline real-world data and
continuously enriched with fresh interactions to actively support agent
training. To improve knowledge acquisition, DreamGym adaptively generates new
tasks that challenge the current agent policy, enabling more effective online
curriculum learning. Experiments across diverse environments and agent
backbones demonstrate that DreamGym substantially improves RL training, both in
fully synthetic settings and in sim-to-real transfer scenarios. On non-RL-ready
tasks like WebArena, DreamGym outperforms all baselines by over 30%. And in
RL-ready but costly settings, it matches GRPO and PPO performance using only
synthetic interactions. When transferring a policy trained purely on synthetic
experiences to real-environment RL, DreamGym yields significant additional
performance gains while requiring far fewer real-world interactions, providing
a scalable warm-start strategy for general-purpose RL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在全球范围内被广泛使用，用户使用多种语言与之交互，但训练数据和优化目标存在不平衡，引发了对LLMs是否能代表其广泛用户群文化多样性的质疑。

Method: 使用来自霍夫斯泰德价值观调查模块和世界价值观调查的63个项目，翻译成11种语言，构建带有和不带明确文化视角的提示，测试了10个LLMs。

Result: 提示语言和文化视角都会导致LLM输出变化，但所有模型都显示出对荷兰、德国、美国和日本价值观的系统性偏向。文化视角比针对性提示语言更能提高与人类受访者文化价值观的一致性。

Conclusion: LLMs处于一个尴尬的中间地带：对提示变化足够敏感以产生变化，但又过于固守特定文化默认值，无法充分代表文化多样性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted by users across the
globe, who interact with them in a diverse range of languages. At the same
time, there are well-documented imbalances in the training data and
optimisation objectives of this technology, raising doubts as to whether LLMs
can represent the cultural diversity of their broad user base. In this study,
we look at LLMs and cultural values and examine how prompt language and
cultural framing influence model responses and their alignment with human
values in different countries. We probe 10 LLMs with 63 items from the Hofstede
Values Survey Module and World Values Survey, translated into 11 languages, and
formulated as prompts with and without different explicit cultural
perspectives. Our study confirms that both prompt language and cultural
perspective produce variation in LLM outputs, but with an important caveat:
While targeted prompting can, to a certain extent, steer LLM responses in the
direction of the predominant values of the corresponding countries, it does not
overcome the models' systematic bias toward the values associated with a
restricted set of countries in our dataset: the Netherlands, Germany, the US,
and Japan. All tested models, regardless of their origin, exhibit remarkably
similar patterns: They produce fairly neutral responses on most topics, with
selective progressive stances on issues such as social tolerance. Alignment
with cultural values of human respondents is improved more with an explicit
cultural perspective than with a targeted prompt language. Unexpectedly,
combining both approaches is no more effective than cultural framing with an
English prompt. These findings reveal that LLMs occupy an uncomfortable middle
ground: They are responsive enough to changes in prompts to produce variation,
but too firmly anchored to specific cultural defaults to adequately represent
cultural diversity.

Abstract: Recent LLM-based agents have demonstrated strong capabilities in automated ML
engineering. However, they heavily rely on repeated full training runs to
evaluate candidate solutions, resulting in significant computational overhead,
limited scalability to large search spaces, and slow iteration cycles. To
address these challenges, we introduce ArchPilot, a multi-agent system that
integrates architecture generation, proxy-based evaluation, and adaptive search
into a unified framework. ArchPilot consists of three specialized agents: an
orchestration agent that coordinates the search process using a Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS)-inspired novel algorithm with a restart mechanism and
manages memory of previous candidates; a generation agent that iteratively
generates, improves, and debugs candidate architectures; and an evaluation
agent that executes proxy training runs, generates and optimizes proxy
functions, and aggregates the proxy scores into a fidelity-aware performance
metric. This multi-agent collaboration allows ArchPilot to prioritize
high-potential candidates with minimal reliance on expensive full training
runs, facilitating efficient ML engineering under limited budgets. Experiments
on MLE-Bench demonstrate that ArchPilot outperforms SOTA baselines such as AIDE
and ML-Master, validating the effectiveness of our multi-agent system.

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了LLM决策中的脆弱性，为在多属性纠缠下实现更公平、表示感知的控制奠定了基础。

Abstract: Although behavioral studies have documented numerical reasoning errors in
large language models (LLMs), the underlying representational mechanisms remain
unclear. We hypothesize that numerical attributes occupy shared latent
subspaces and investigate two questions:(1) How do LLMs internally integrate
multiple numerical attributes of a single entity? (2)How does irrelevant
numerical context perturb these representations and their downstream outputs?
To address these questions, we combine linear probing with partial correlation
analysis and prompt-based vulnerability tests across models of varying sizes.
Our results show that LLMs encode real-world numerical correlations but tend to
systematically amplify them. Moreover, irrelevant context induces consistent
shifts in magnitude representations, with downstream effects that vary by model
size. These findings reveal a vulnerability in LLM decision-making and lay the
groundwork for fairer, representation-aware control under multi-attribute
entanglement.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning but struggle with
knowledge-intensive questions due to limited context and parametric knowledge.
However, existing methods that rely on finetuned LLMs or GNN retrievers are

We propose the LLM-KGFR collaborative framework, where an LLM works with a
structured retriever, the Knowledge Graph Foundation Retriever (KGFR). KGFR
encodes relations using LLM-generated descriptions and initializes entities
based on their roles in the question, enabling zero-shot generalization to
unseen KGs. To handle large graphs efficiently, it employs Asymmetric
Progressive Propagation (APP)- a stepwise expansion that selectively limits
high-degree nodes while retaining informative paths. Through node-, edge-, and
path-level interfaces, the LLM iteratively requests candidate answers,
supporting facts, and reasoning paths, forming a controllable reasoning loop.
Experiments demonstrate that LLM-KGFR achieves strong performance while
maintaining scalability and generalization, providing a practical solution for

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning for Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is powerful for
training large reasoning models, its training dynamics harbor a critical
challenge: RL overfitting, where models gain training rewards but lose
generalization. Our analysis reveals this is driven by policy
over-specialization and catastrophic forgetting of diverse solutions generated
during training. Standard optimization discards this valuable inter-step policy
diversity. To address this, we introduce RLoop, a self-improving framework
built on iterative policy initialization. RLoop transforms the standard
training process into a virtuous cycle: it first uses RL to explore the
solution space from a given policy, then filters the successful trajectories to
create an expert dataset. This dataset is used via Rejection-sampling
Fine-Tuning (RFT) to refine the initial policy, creating a superior starting
point for the next iteration. This loop of exploration and exploitation via
iterative re-initialization effectively converts transient policy variations
into robust performance gains. Our experiments show RLoop mitigates forgetting
and substantially improves generalization, boosting average accuracy by 9% and
pass@32 by over 15% compared to vanilla RL.

Conclusion: Iterative RMFT提供了一个原则性的通用后训练框架，可有效增强LLM的决策能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as "agents" for
decision-making (DM) in interactive and dynamic environments. Yet, since they
were not originally designed for DM, recent studies show that LLMs can struggle
even in basic online DM problems, failing to achieve low regret or an effective
exploration-exploitation tradeoff. To address this, we introduce Iterative
Regret-Minimization Fine-Tuning (Iterative RMFT), a post-training procedure
that repeatedly distills low-regret decision trajectories back into the base
model. At each iteration, the model rolls out multiple decision trajectories,
selects the k-lowest regret ones, and fine-tunes itself on them. Unlike prior
methods that (a) distill action sequences from known DM algorithms or (b) rely
on manually crafted chain-of-thought templates, our approach leverages the
regret metric to elicit the model's own DM ability and reasoning rationales.
This reliance on model-generated reasoning avoids rigid output engineering and
provides more flexible, natural-language training signals. Empirical results
show that Iterative RMFT improves LLMs' DM performance across diverse models -
from Transformers with numerical input/output, to open-weight LLMs, and
advanced closed-weight models like GPT-4o mini. Its flexibility in output and
reasoning formats enables generalization across tasks with varying horizons,
action spaces, reward processes, and natural-language contexts. Finally, we
provide theoretical insight showing that a single-layer Transformer under this
paradigm can act as a no-regret learner in a simplified setting. Overall,
Iterative RMFT offers a principled and general post-training framework for
enhancing LLMs' decision-making capabilities.

Method: CoRPO使用自适应基线强制执行最低质量阈值，确保失败解决方案永远不会被正向强化。一旦策略持续满足此阈值，基线自动转换为相对偏好模式，推动模型寻找最优解而非仅可接受的解。

Result: 在代码验证任务上，CoRPO表现出更稳定的收敛性和更好的域外泛化能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作是在使LLM通过强化学习学习真正新能力的研究计划中的关键一步，通过使LLM能够从丰富的多维反馈中学习来实现这一目标。

Abstract: Group-relative Policy Optimization's (GRPO) simplicity makes it highly
desirable for adapting LLMs to become experts at specific tasks. But this
simplicity also makes it ill-specified as we seek to enhance RL training with
richer, non-binary feedback. When using ordinal rewards to give partial credit,
GRPO's simplicity starts to hurt, as its group-average baseline often assigns a
positive advantage to failed trajectories and reinforces incorrect behavior.
  We introduce Correctness Relative Policy Optimization (CoRPO), a new
formulation that solves this flaw. CoRPO uses an adaptive baseline that
enforces a minimum quality threshold, ensuring failed solutions are never
positively reinforced. Once the policy consistently meets this threshold, the
baseline automatically transitions to a relative preference mode, pushing the
model to find optimal solutions rather than just "acceptable" ones. We
empirically validate CoRPO on a code verification task, where it demonstrates
more stable convergence and better out-of-domain generalization.
  This work represents a critical step in our broader research program to
enable LLMs to learn genuinely new capabilities through reinforcement learning.
We achieve this by enabling LLMs to learn from rich, multi-dimensional feedback
- progressing from binary to ordinal rewards in this work, and onward to
denser, per-step supervision.

TL;DR: 本文开发了一个博弈论实验的数字孪生系统，通过系统化的提示和探测框架评估LLMs与人类决策行为的相似度。研究发现Llama能高保真复现人类合作模式，而Qwen更接近纳什均衡预测，表明适当校准的LLMs可以复制人类行为模式并探索新的实验空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs与人类决策的相似度至关重要，因为不匹配可能在应用中产生有害结果，而无法复现人类行为会使LLMs在社会模拟中无效。

Method: 开发博弈论实验的数字孪生系统，引入系统化的提示和探测框架，测试三个开源模型（Llama、Mistral和Qwen），无需基于角色的提示实现群体级行为复现。

Result: Llama能高保真复现人类合作模式，捕捉人类偏离理性选择理论的行为；Qwen与纳什均衡预测高度一致；成功生成并预注册了原始参数网格外的新游戏配置的可检验假设。

Conclusion: 适当校准的LLMs可以复制人类行为模式，为社会科学研究提供补充方法，生成关于人类社交决策的新经验预测。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used both to make decisions in
domains such as health, education and law, and to simulate human behavior. Yet
how closely LLMs mirror actual human decision-making remains poorly understood.
This gap is critical: misalignment could produce harmful outcomes in practical
applications, while failure to replicate human behavior renders LLMs
ineffective for social simulations. Here, we address this gap by developing a
digital twin of game-theoretic experiments and introducing a systematic
prompting and probing framework for machine-behavioral evaluation. Testing
three open-source models (Llama, Mistral and Qwen), we find that Llama
reproduces human cooperation patterns with high fidelity, capturing human
deviations from rational choice theory, while Qwen aligns closely with Nash
equilibrium predictions. Notably, we achieved population-level behavioral
replication without persona-based prompting, simplifying the simulation
process. Extending beyond the original human-tested games, we generate and
preregister testable hypotheses for novel game configurations outside the
original parameter grid. Our findings demonstrate that appropriately calibrated
LLMs can replicate aggregate human behavioral patterns and enable systematic
exploration of unexplored experimental spaces, offering a complementary
approach to traditional research in the social and behavioral sciences that
generates new empirical predictions about human social decision-making.

TL;DR: VeriCoT是一个神经符号方法，从CoT推理中提取和验证形式逻辑论证，通过一阶逻辑形式化推理步骤，使用自动求解器验证逻辑有效性，并提高推理的可靠性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs虽然能通过CoT进行多步推理，但无法可靠验证自身逻辑，即使在得出正确答案时底层推理也可能存在缺陷，这在高风险场景中会削弱信任。

Method: 将CoT推理步骤形式化为一阶逻辑，识别前提条件（源上下文、常识知识或先前推理步骤），使用自动求解器验证逻辑有效性，并通过验证信号进行推理时自我反思、监督微调和偏好微调。

Result: 在ProofWriter、LegalBench和BioASQ数据集上的实验表明，VeriCoT能有效识别有缺陷的推理，并作为最终答案正确性的强预测指标。

Conclusion: VeriCoT通过结合神经和符号方法，显著提高了LLM推理的可靠性和可验证性，为高风险应用提供了更可信的推理框架。

Abstract: LLMs can perform multi-step reasoning through Chain-of-Thought (CoT), but
they cannot reliably verify their own logic. Even when they reach correct
answers, the underlying reasoning may be flawed, undermining trust in
high-stakes scenarios. To mitigate this issue, we introduce VeriCoT, a
neuro-symbolic method that extracts and verifies formal logical arguments from
CoT reasoning. VeriCoT formalizes each CoT reasoning step into first-order
logic and identifies premises that ground the argument in source context,
commonsense knowledge, or prior reasoning steps. The symbolic representation
enables automated solvers to verify logical validity while the NL premises
allow humans and systems to identify ungrounded or fallacious reasoning steps.
Experiments on the ProofWriter, LegalBench, and BioASQ datasets show VeriCoT
effectively identifies flawed reasoning, and serves as a strong predictor of
final answer correctness. We also leverage VeriCoT's verification signal for
(1) inference-time self-reflection, (2) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on
VeriCoT-distilled datasets and (3) preference fine-tuning (PFT) with direct
preference optimization (DPO) using verification-based pairwise rewards,
further improving reasoning validity and accuracy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show great promise as a powerful tool for
scientific literature exploration. However, their effectiveness in providing
scientifically accurate and comprehensive answers to complex questions within
specialized domains remains an active area of research. Using the field of
high-temperature cuprates as an exemplar, we evaluate the ability of LLM
systems to understand the literature at the level of an expert. We construct an
expert-curated database of 1,726 scientific papers that covers the history of
the field, and a set of 67 expert-formulated questions that probe deep
understanding of the literature. We then evaluate six different LLM-based
systems for answering these questions, including both commercially available
closed models and a custom retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system capable
of retrieving images alongside text. Experts then evaluate the answers of these
systems against a rubric that assesses balanced perspectives, factual
comprehensiveness, succinctness, and evidentiary support. Among the six systems
two using RAG on curated literature outperformed existing closed models across
key metrics, particularly in providing comprehensive and well-supported
answers. We discuss promising aspects of LLM performances as well as critical
short-comings of all the models. The set of expert-formulated questions and the
rubric will be valuable for assessing expert level performance of LLM based
reasoning systems.

Result: 初始阶段25-33%程序不安全，弱加密/配置相关漏洞最难避免，Python安全性最高，C和C#最低。反思提示显著提升安全性，前两轮收益最大。

Conclusion: 反思提示能有效提升LLM生成安全代码的能力，但仍有改进空间，特别是处理特定类型漏洞方面。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now widely used to draft and refactor code,
but code that works is not necessarily secure. We evaluate secure code
generation using the Instruct Prime, which eliminated compliance-required
prompts and cue contamination, and evaluate five instruction-tuned code LLMs
using a zero-shot baseline and a three-round reflexion prompting approach.
Security is measured using the Insecure Code Detector (ICD), and results are
reported by measuring Repair, Regression, and NetGain metrics, considering the
programming language and CWE family. Our findings show that insecurity remains
common at the first round: roughly 25-33% of programs are insecure at a
zero-shot baseline (t0 ). Weak cryptography/config-dependent bugs are the
hardest to avoid while templated ones like XSS, code injection, and hard-coded
secrets are handled more reliably. Python yields the highest secure rates; C
and C# are the lowest, with Java, JS, PHP, and C++ in the middle. Reflexion
prompting improves security for all models, improving average accuracy from
70.74% at t0 to 79.43% at t3 , with the largest gains in the first round
followed by diminishing returns. The trends with Repair, Regression, and
NetGain metrics show that applying one to two rounds produces most of the

the tool over manually creating or selecting test cases, as it allowed them to

Abstract: We introduce GUI-360$^\circ$, a large-scale, comprehensive dataset and
benchmark suite designed to advance computer-using agents (CUAs). CUAs present
unique challenges and is constrained by three persistent gaps: a scarcity of
real-world CUA tasks, the lack of automated collection-and-annotation pipelines
for multi-modal trajectories, and the absence of a unified benchmark that
jointly evaluates GUI grounding, screen parsing, and action prediction.
  GUI-360$^\circ$ addresses these gaps with an LLM-augmented, largely automated
pipeline for query sourcing, environment-template construction, task
instantiation, batched execution, and LLM-driven quality filtering. The
released corpus contains over 1.2M executed action steps across thousands of
trajectories in popular Windows office applications, and includes
full-resolution screenshots, accessibility metadata when available,
instantiated goals, intermediate reasoning traces, and both successful and
failed action trajectories. The dataset supports three canonical tasks, GUI
grounding, screen parsing, and action prediction, and a hybrid GUI+API action
space that reflects modern agent designs. Benchmarking state-of-the-art
vision--language models on GUI-360$^\circ$ reveals substantial out-of-the-box
shortcomings in grounding and action prediction; supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning yield significant gains but do not close the gap to
human-level reliability. We release GUI-360$^\circ$ and accompanying code to

Abstract: In explainable AI, Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) are typically obtained
by training linear classifier probes to detect human-understandable concepts as
directions in the activation space of deep neural networks. It is widely
assumed that a high probe accuracy indicates a CAV faithfully representing its
target concept. However, we show that the probe's classification accuracy alone
is an unreliable measure of concept alignment, i.e., the degree to which a CAV
captures the intended concept. In fact, we argue that probes are more likely to
capture spurious correlations than they are to represent only the intended
concept. As part of our analysis, we demonstrate that deliberately misaligned
probes constructed to exploit spurious correlations, achieve an accuracy close
to that of standard probes. To address this severe problem, we introduce a
novel concept localization method based on spatial linear attribution, and
provide a comprehensive comparison of it to existing feature visualization
techniques for detecting and mitigating concept misalignment. We further
propose three classes of metrics for quantitatively assessing concept
alignment: hard accuracy, segmentation scores, and augmentation robustness. Our
analysis shows that probes with translation invariance and spatial alignment
consistently increase concept alignment. These findings highlight the need for
alignment-based evaluation metrics rather than probe accuracy, and the
importance of tailoring probes to both the model architecture and the nature of
the target concept.

Abstract: On-device AI agents offer the potential for personalized, low-latency
assistance, but their deployment is fundamentally constrained by limited memory
capacity, which restricts usable context. This reduced practical context window
creates a trade-off between supporting rich, stateful interactions with complex
tool capabilities and maintaining on-device feasibility. We break this
trade-off with a framework for context-efficient on-device agents, driven by
three synergistic optimizations (1) a dynamic memory system using specialized
LoRA adapters to distill conversational history into a compressed, and
structured Context State Object; (2) a minimalist serialization format for tool
schemas to minimize token overhead per tool; and (3) a just-in-time
schema-passing mechanism that loads full tool definitions only upon tool
selection. We instantiate this framework by adapting a 3B parameter SLM to
context-efficient trajectories and rigorously evaluate it against a
conventional baseline on complex user tasks. Our agent matches, or exceeds, the
performance of a conventional baseline while dramatically compressing context,
achieving more than a 6-fold reduction in initial system prompt context and a
10- to 25-fold reduction in context growth rate based on the interaction
verbosity, demonstrating that strategic context management is key to unlocking
capable and persistent on-device AI.

Abstract: Large-scale disaster Search And Rescue (SAR) operations are persistently
challenged by complex terrain and disrupted communications. While Unmanned
Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms offer a promising solution for tasks like wide-area
search and supply delivery, yet their effective coordination places a
significant cognitive burden on human operators. The core human-machine
collaboration bottleneck lies in the ``intention-to-action gap'', which is an
error-prone process of translating a high-level rescue objective into a
low-level swarm command under high intensity and pressure. To bridge this gap,
this study proposes a novel LLM-CRF system that leverages Large Language Models
(LLMs) to model and augment human-swarm teaming cognition. The proposed
framework initially captures the operator's intention through natural and
multi-modal interactions with the device via voice or graphical annotations. It
then employs the LLM as a cognitive engine to perform intention comprehension,
hierarchical task decomposition, and mission planning for the UAV swarm. This
closed-loop framework enables the swarm to act as a proactive partner,
providing active feedback in real-time while reducing the need for manual
monitoring and control, which considerably advances the efficacy of the SAR
task. We evaluate the proposed framework in a simulated SAR scenario.
Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional order and
command-based interfaces, the proposed LLM-driven approach reduced task
completion time by approximately $64.2\%$ and improved task success rate by
$7\%$. It also leads to a considerable reduction in subjective cognitive
workload, with NASA-TLX scores dropping by $42.9\%$. This work establishes the
potential of LLMs to create more intuitive and effective human-swarm
collaborations in high-stakes scenarios.

Motivation: 随着LLM越来越多地用于软件工程任务，需要了解它们在负责任AI价值观方面与人类判断的对齐程度，以确保AI辅助软件开发的价值一致性。

Method: 评估23个LLM在四个任务上的表现：选择关键负责任AI价值观、在特定情境中评估重要性、解决价值观冲突、以及优先考虑体现这些价值观的软件需求。

Result: LLM总体上更接近AI从业者的价值观，强调公平、隐私、透明度、安全和问责制，但在声明的价值观与实际需求优先级之间存在不一致性。

Conclusion: 在需求工程中依赖LLM存在实际风险，需要系统性的方法来基准测试、解释和监控AI辅助软件开发中的价值对齐。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in software
engineering tasks such as requirements elicitation, design, and evaluation,
raising critical questions regarding their alignment with human judgments on
responsible AI values. This study investigates how closely LLMs' value
preferences align with those of two human groups: a US-representative sample
and AI practitioners. We evaluate 23 LLMs across four tasks: (T1) selecting key
responsible AI values, (T2) rating their importance in specific contexts, (T3)
resolving trade-offs between competing values, and (T4) prioritizing software
requirements that embody those values. The results show that LLMs generally
align more closely with AI practitioners than with the US-representative
sample, emphasizing fairness, privacy, transparency, safety, and
accountability. However, inconsistencies appear between the values that LLMs
claim to uphold (Tasks 1-3) and the way they prioritize requirements (Task 4),
revealing gaps in faithfulness between stated and applied behavior. These
findings highlight the practical risk of relying on LLMs in requirements
engineering without human oversight and motivate the need for systematic
approaches to benchmark, interpret, and monitor value alignment in AI-assisted
software development.

Motivation: 尽管LLM代理在软件开发中声称能大幅提高生产力，但缺乏实证证据支持这些说法。本研究旨在通过严谨的因果推断方法，量化评估流行LLM助手Cursor对开发速度和软件质量的实际影响。

Method: 采用前沿的双重差分设计，比较使用Cursor的GitHub项目与匹配的未使用Cursor的对照组项目，并使用面板广义矩估计方法分析长期影响机制。

Result: Cursor采用导致项目级开发速度显著但短暂的大幅提升，同时静态分析警告和代码复杂度显著且持续增加。面板GMM估计显示代码复杂度和警告增加是导致长期速度下降的主要因素。

Conclusion: LLM助手虽然短期内能提高开发效率，但可能以牺牲代码质量为代价，最终影响长期开发速度。这对软件工程实践者、LLM助手设计者和研究者具有重要启示。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the promise to revolutionize
the field of software engineering. Among other things, LLM agents are rapidly
gaining momentum in their application to software development, with
practitioners claiming a multifold productivity increase after adoption. Yet,
empirical evidence is lacking around these claims. In this paper, we estimate
the causal effect of adopting a widely popular LLM agent assistant, namely
Cursor, on development velocity and software quality. The estimation is enabled
by a state-of-the-art difference-in-differences design comparing
Cursor-adopting GitHub projects with a matched control group of similar GitHub
projects that do not use Cursor. We find that the adoption of Cursor leads to a
significant, large, but transient increase in project-level development
velocity, along with a significant and persistent increase in static analysis
warnings and code complexity. Further panel generalized method of moments
estimation reveals that the increase in static analysis warnings and code
complexity acts as a major factor causing long-term velocity slowdown. Our
study carries implications for software engineering practitioners, LLM agent
assistant designers, and researchers.

Abstract: Multi-Agentic AI systems, powered by large language models (LLMs), are
inherently non-deterministic and prone to silent failures such as drift,

curate and label two benchmark datasets comprising \textbf{4,275 and 894}

methods on these datasets, we show that supervised (XGBoost) and
semi-supervised (SVDD) approaches perform comparably, achieving accuracies up

TL;DR: 提出Agentmandering框架，将选区重划重新构想为两个代表对立政治利益的智能体之间的回合制谈判，使用LLM智能体将战略互动嵌入选区重划过程，显著减少党派偏见和不公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有计算方法主要生成大量法律上有效的选区重划方案，但忽视了选择过程中的战略动态，这为党派行为者挑选政治上有利的地图创造了机会。仅仅满足形式约束并不能确保公平性。

Method: 基于博弈论思想，特别是"选择并冻结"协议，使用LLM智能体代表对立政治利益进行回合制谈判，智能体轮流从候选地图集中选择和冻结选区，通过受约束和可解释的选择逐步划分州。

Result: 在2020年美国人口普查后数据上的评估显示，Agentmandering显著减少了党派偏见和不公平性，同时实现了比标准基线低2到3个数量级的方差，在摇摆州场景中表现出公平性和稳定性。

Conclusion: Agentmandering框架通过将战略互动嵌入选区重划过程，能够有效减少党派偏见，提高公平性和稳定性，特别是在政治竞争激烈的场景中。

Abstract: Redistricting plays a central role in shaping how votes are translated into
political power. While existing computational methods primarily aim to generate
large ensembles of legally valid districting plans, they often neglect the
strategic dynamics involved in the selection process. This oversight creates
opportunities for partisan actors to cherry-pick maps that, while technically
compliant, are politically advantageous. Simply satisfying formal constraints
does not ensure fairness when the selection process itself can be manipulated.
We propose \textbf{Agentmandering}, a framework that reimagines redistricting
as a turn-based negotiation between two agents representing opposing political
interests. Drawing inspiration from game-theoretic ideas, particularly the
\textit{Choose-and-Freeze} protocol, our method embeds strategic interaction
into the redistricting process via large language model (LLM) agents. Agents
alternate between selecting and freezing districts from a small set of
candidate maps, gradually partitioning the state through constrained and
interpretable choices. Evaluation on post-2020 U.S. Census data across all
states shows that Agentmandering significantly reduces partisan bias and
unfairness, while achieving 2 to 3 orders of magnitude lower variance than
standard baselines. These results demonstrate both fairness and stability,
especially in swing-state scenarios. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了LLM系统在确保药物安全方面的关键挑战，为通过更好的提示和任务特定调优提高可靠性提供了见解。

Abstract: Numerous medical systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have
achieved remarkable progress in diverse healthcare tasks. However, research on
their medication safety remains limited due to the lack of real world datasets,
constrained by privacy and accessibility issues. Moreover, evaluation of LLMs
in realistic clinical consultation settings, particularly regarding medication
safety, is still underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose a framework
that simulates and evaluates clinical consultations to systematically assess
the medication safety capabilities of LLMs. Within this framework, we generate
inquiry diagnosis dialogues with embedded medication risks and construct a
dedicated medication safety database, RxRisk DB, containing 6,725
contraindications, 28,781 drug interactions, and 14,906 indication-drug pairs.
A two-stage filtering strategy ensures clinical realism and professional
quality, resulting in the benchmark RxSafeBench with 2,443 high-quality
consultation scenarios. We evaluate leading open-source and proprietary LLMs
using structured multiple choice questions that test their ability to recommend
safe medications under simulated patient contexts. Results show that current
LLMs struggle to integrate contraindication and interaction knowledge,
especially when risks are implied rather than explicit. Our findings highlight
key challenges in ensuring medication safety in LLM-based systems and provide
insights into improving reliability through better prompting and task-specific
tuning. RxSafeBench offers the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
medication safety in LLMs, advancing safer and more trustworthy AI-driven
clinical decision support.

Method: 将Flavell、Nelson和Narens的元认知理论形式化为计算规范，在生成前添加显式监控来捕获元认知体验（难度评估、置信度判断），并通过验证反馈改进未来监控。

Result: 虽然未提供实证验证，但这是首次系统性地将基础元认知理论转化为计算规范。

Conclusion: MGV框架为理解推理系统失败提供了原则性词汇，并为未来测试时推理设计提出了具体的架构干预建议。

Abstract: Test-time reasoning architectures such as those following the Generate-Verify
paradigm -- where a model iteratively refines or verifies its own generated
outputs -- prioritise generation and verification but exclude the monitoring
processes that determine when and how reasoning should begin. This omission may
contribute to the prefix dominance trap, in which models commit early to
suboptimal reasoning paths and seldom recover, yielding roughly 20% accuracy
loss. We address this architectural gap by formalising Flavell's and Nelson and
Narens' metacognitive theories into computational specifications, proposing the
Monitor-Generate-Verify (MGV) framework. MGV extends the Generate-Verify
paradigm by adding explicit monitoring that captures metacognitive experiences
(from difficulty assessments to confidence judgements) before generation begins
and refines future monitoring through verification feedback. Though we present
no empirical validation, this work provides the first systematic computational
translation of foundational metacognitive theories, offering a principled
vocabulary for understanding reasoning system failures and suggesting specific
architectural interventions for future test-time reasoning designs.

Conclusion: 将经典路由算法与基于LLM的语义推理层结合是创建个性化、自适应和可扩展城市交通优化解决方案的有效方法

Abstract: Traditional vehicle routing systems efficiently optimize singular metrics
like time or distance, and when considering multiple metrics, they need more
processes to optimize . However, they lack the capability to interpret and
integrate the complex, semantic, and dynamic contexts of human drivers, such as
multi-step tasks, situational constraints, or urgent needs. This paper
introduces and evaluates PAVe (Personalized Agentic Vehicular Routing), a
hybrid agentic assistant designed to augment classical pathfinding algorithms
with contextual reasoning. Our approach employs a Large Language Model (LLM)
agent that operates on a candidate set of routes generated by a multi-objective
(time, CO2) Dijkstra algorithm. The agent evaluates these options against
user-provided tasks, preferences, and avoidance rules by leveraging a
pre-processed geospatial cache of urban Points of Interest (POIs). In a
benchmark of realistic urban scenarios, PAVe successfully used complex user
intent into appropriate route modifications, achieving over 88% accuracy in its
initial route selections with a local model. We conclude that combining
classical routing algorithms with an LLM-based semantic reasoning layer is a
robust and effective approach for creating personalized, adaptive, and scalable
solutions for urban mobility optimization.

modern AI models by offering explanations of the models to human users. There
are many ways in which researchers have attempted to evaluate the quality of
these XAI models, such as user studies or proposed objective metrics like
"fidelity". However, these current XAI evaluation techniques are ad hoc at best
and not generalizable. Thus, most studies done within this field conduct simple
user surveys to analyze the difference between no explanations and those
generated by their proposed solution. We do not find this to provide adequate
evidence that the explanations generated are of good quality since we believe
any kind of explanation will be "better" in most metrics when compared to none
at all. Thus, our study looks to highlight this pitfall: most explanations,
regardless of quality or correctness, will increase user satisfaction. We also
propose that emphasis should be placed on actionable explanations. We
demonstrate the validity of both of our claims using an agent assistant to
teach chess concepts to users. The results of this chapter will act as a call

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
accelerated progress in code translation, enabling more accurate and efficient
transformation across programming languages. While originally developed for
natural language processing, LLMs have shown strong capabilities in modeling
programming language syntax and semantics, outperforming traditional rule-based
systems in both accuracy and flexibility. These models have streamlined
cross-language conversion, reduced development overhead, and accelerated legacy
code migration. In this paper, we introduce OMPILOT, a novel domain-specific
encoder-decoder transformer tailored for translating C++ code into OpenMP,
enabling effective shared-memory parallelization. OMPILOT leverages custom
pre-training objectives that incorporate the semantics of parallel constructs
and combines both unsupervised and supervised learning strategies to improve
code translation robustness. Unlike previous work that focused primarily on
loop-level transformations, OMPILOT operates at the function level to capture a
wider semantic context. To evaluate our approach, we propose OMPBLEU, a novel
composite metric specifically crafted to assess the correctness and quality of
OpenMP parallel constructs, addressing limitations in conventional translation
metrics.

Result: 专家用户研究表明，SAFE生成的解释能显著帮助初级到中级开发人员理解和解决安全漏洞，提高SAST工具的整体可用性。

Conclusion: LLMs可以有效解决SAST工具的可解释性问题，改善开发人员对安全漏洞的理解和处理能力。

Abstract: The prevalence of security vulnerabilities has prompted companies to adopt
static application security testing (SAST) tools for vulnerability detection.
Nevertheless, these tools frequently exhibit usability limitations, as their
generic warning messages do not sufficiently communicate important information
to developers, resulting in misunderstandings or oversight of critical
findings. In light of recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) and
their text generation capabilities, our work investigates a hybrid approach
that uses LLMs to tackle the SAST explainability challenges. In this paper, we
present SAFE, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) plugin that leverages
GPT-4o to explain the causes, impacts, and mitigation strategies of
vulnerabilities detected by SAST tools. Our expert user study findings indicate
that the explanations generated by SAFE can significantly assist beginner to
intermediate developers in understanding and addressing security
vulnerabilities, thereby improving the overall usability of SAST tools.

### [157] [On the Brittleness of CLIP Text Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04247)

Main category: cs.MM

Relevance: 65.0

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了CLIP等多模态嵌入模型在多媒体信息检索中对非语义查询扰动的鲁棒性，发现句法和语义扰动导致最大不稳定性，而标点符号等表面编辑的脆弱性最为集中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管CLIP等对比学习对齐的多模态模型在零样本分类和信息检索中表现出色，但它们对输入扰动的稳定性不足，特别是在处理人工表达查询时，微小变化会导致结果排序的显著差异。

Method: 使用TRECVID Ad-Hoc Video Search查询和V3C1视频集合，在多个CLIP变体上评估词汇、句法和语义三类非语义查询扰动的影响。

Result: 所有模型都显示句法和语义扰动驱动最大的不稳定性，而脆弱性主要集中在标点符号、大小写等表面编辑上。

Conclusion: 鲁棒性是评估视觉语言模型超越基准准确率的关键维度，当前模型在查询扰动下表现出显著的不稳定性。

Abstract: Multimodal co-embedding models, especially CLIP, have advanced the state of
the art in zero-shot classification and multimedia information retrieval in
recent years by aligning images and text in a shared representation space.
However, such modals trained on a contrastive alignment can lack stability
towards small input perturbations. Especially when dealing with manually
expressed queries, minor variations in the query can cause large differences in
the ranking of the best-matching results. In this paper, we present a
systematic analysis of the effect of multiple classes of non-semantic query
perturbations in an multimedia information retrieval scenario. We evaluate a
diverse set of lexical, syntactic, and semantic perturbations across multiple
CLIP variants using the TRECVID Ad-Hoc Video Search queries and the V3C1 video
collection. Across models, we find that syntactic and semantic perturbations
drive the largest instabilities, while brittleness is concentrated in trivial
surface edits such as punctuation and case. Our results highlight robustness as
a critical dimension for evaluating vision-language models beyond benchmark
accuracy.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在多人类环境中，基于赋权（empowerment）的辅助AI代理可能对其他人类造成去权（disempowerment）的问题，并提出了一个开源的多人类网格世界测试套件Disempower-Grid来实证分析这一现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 赋权作为AI代理的通用目标无关目标，在单人类环境中已被证明能激励辅助行为。但在多人类环境（如家庭、医院）中，为单一人类优化的赋权目标可能对其他人类产生负面影响，这一现象尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 开发了开源的多人类网格世界测试套件Disempower-Grid，通过实验验证辅助RL代理在为单一人类优化赋权时，会显著降低其他人类的环境影响力和奖励，并将此现象形式化为去权。分析了去权发生的条件，并测试了联合赋权作为缓解策略。

Result: 实证表明，为单一人类优化的赋权目标会导致对其他人类的去权效应。联合赋权策略虽然能缓解去权问题，但会以牺牲用户奖励为代价。

Conclusion: AI对齐社区面临更广泛的挑战：在单智能体环境中看似对齐的目标无关目标，在多智能体环境中可能变得不对齐。

Abstract: Empowerment, a measure of an agent's ability to control its environment, has
been proposed as a universal goal-agnostic objective for motivating assistive
behavior in AI agents. While multi-human settings like homes and hospitals are
promising for AI assistance, prior work on empowerment-based assistance assumes
that the agent assists one human in isolation. We introduce an open source
multi-human gridworld test suite Disempower-Grid. Using Disempower-Grid, we
empirically show that assistive RL agents optimizing for one human's
empowerment can significantly reduce another human's environmental influence
and rewards - a phenomenon we formalize as disempowerment. We characterize when
disempowerment occurs in these environments and show that joint empowerment
mitigates disempowerment at the cost of the user's reward. Our work reveals a
broader challenge for the AI alignment community: goal-agnostic objectives that
seem aligned in single-agent settings can become misaligned in multi-agent
contexts.

Result: 成功实现了包含超过100个智能体的VCMAS系统，通过事务调度获得了超过16%的性能提升，并提供了理论分析和实用工具。

Conclusion: OptiMA框架能够有效支持超复杂多智能体系统的执行，事务调度显著提升系统性能，为未来研究提供了理论基础和实用工具。

Abstract: In recent years, the research of multi-agent systems has taken a direction to
explore larger and more complex models to fulfill sophisticated tasks. We point
out two possible pitfalls that might be caused by increasing complexity;
susceptibilities to faults, and performance bottlenecks. To prevent the former
threat, we propose a transaction-based framework to design very complex
multi-agent systems (VCMAS). To address the second threat, we offer to
integrate transaction scheduling into the proposed framework. We implemented
both of these ideas to develop the OptiMA framework and show that it is able to
facilitate the execution of VCMAS with more than a hundred agents. We also
demonstrate the effect of transaction scheduling on such a system by showing
improvements up to more than 16\%. Furthermore, we also performed a theoretical
analysis on the transaction scheduling problem and provided practical tools
that can be used for future research on it.

TL;DR: RAMP是一个轻量级框架，将程序修复重新定义为Ruby语言的反馈驱动迭代过程，使用多智能体协作生成测试、反思错误并改进修复方案，无需依赖大型修复数据库或昂贵微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的自动程序修复方法计算成本高且主要关注少数语言，Ruby作为广泛使用的Web开发语言在APR研究中关注不足，开发者面临持续挑战。

Method: 采用多智能体协作框架，通过轻量级提示和测试驱动反馈，让智能体生成针对性测试、反思错误并迭代改进候选修复方案，最多5次迭代收敛。

Result: 在XCodeEval基准测试中，RAMP在Ruby上达到67%的pass@1性能，优于现有方法，特别擅长修复错误答案、编译错误和运行时错误。

Conclusion: RAMP为多智能体修复策略提供新见解，为将基于LLM的调试工具扩展到研究不足的语言奠定基础。

Abstract: Automated Program Repair (APR) has advanced rapidly with Large Language
Models (LLMs), but most existing methods remain computationally expensive, and
focused on a small set of languages. Ruby, despite its widespread use in web
development and the persistent challenges faced by its developers, has received
little attention in APR research. In this paper, we introduce RAMP, a novel
lightweight framework that formulates program repair as a feedback-driven,
iterative process for Ruby. RAMP employs a team of collaborative agents that
generate targeted tests, reflect on errors, and refine candidate fixes until a
correct solution is found. Unlike prior approaches, RAMP is designed to avoid
reliance on large multilingual repair databases or costly fine-tuning, instead
operating directly on Ruby through lightweight prompting and test-driven
feedback. Evaluation on the XCodeEval benchmark shows that RAMP achieves a
pass@1 of 67% on Ruby, outper-forming prior approaches. RAMP converges quickly
within five iterations, and ablation studies confirm that test generation and
self-reflection are key drivers of its performance. Further analysis shows that
RAMP is particularly effective at repairing wrong answers, compilation errors,
and runtime errors. Our approach provides new insights into multi-agent repair
strategies, and establishes a foundation for extending LLM-based debugging
tools to under-studied languages.

Motivation: 汇编代码分析中的分词方法研究不足，但分词对词汇量大小、语义覆盖和下游任务性能有重要影响，需要系统评估不同分词模型在汇编代码分析中的表现。

Method: 使用多种分词模型进行系统分析，包括内在评估（分词效率、词汇压缩、表示保真度）和外在评估，采用预训练模型如Llama 3.2、BERT、BART评估性能。

Result: 分词选择显著影响下游性能，内在指标只能部分预测外在评估结果，揭示了内在分词特性与实际任务效用之间的复杂权衡。

Conclusion: 研究为低级代码分析中的分词模型优化提供了宝贵见解，有助于提高基于自然语言模型的二进制分析工作流程的鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Tokenization is fundamental in assembly code analysis, impacting intrinsic
characteristics like vocabulary size, semantic coverage, and extrinsic
performance in downstream tasks. Despite its significance, tokenization in the
context of assembly code remains an underexplored area. This study aims to
address this gap by evaluating the intrinsic properties of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tokenization models and parameter choices, such as vocabulary
size. We explore preprocessing customization options and pre-tokenization rules
tailored to the unique characteristics of assembly code. Additionally, we
assess their impact on downstream tasks like function signature prediction -- a
critical problem in binary code analysis.
  To this end, we conduct a thorough study on various tokenization models,
systematically analyzing their efficiency in encoding assembly instructions and
capturing semantic nuances. Through intrinsic evaluations, we compare
tokenizers based on tokenization efficiency, vocabulary compression, and
representational fidelity for assembly code. Using state-of-the-art pre-trained
models such as the decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) Llama 3.2, the
encoder-only transformer BERT, and the encoder-decoder model BART, we evaluate
the effectiveness of these tokenizers across multiple performance metrics.
Preliminary findings indicate that tokenizer choice significantly influences
downstream performance, with intrinsic metrics providing partial but incomplete
predictability of extrinsic evaluation outcomes. These results reveal complex
trade-offs between intrinsic tokenizer properties and their utility in
practical assembly code tasks. Ultimately, this study provides valuable
insights into optimizing tokenization models for low-level code analysis,
contributing to the robustness and scalability of Natural Language Model
(NLM)-based binary analysis workflows.

Motivation: 随着OpenAI的Operator和Google的Project Mariner等网络代理系统的发展，这些能够自主与互联网交互的LLM系统引发了可持续性问题。当前网络代理研究蓬勃发展，但其引发的可持续性问题却鲜有探索。

Method: 采用理论和实证相结合的方法：理论方面通过估算网络代理的能源消耗，实证方面通过基准测试来量化实际能耗。重点关注不同网络代理设计理念对能耗的影响。

Result: 研究结果显示：1) 不同网络代理设计理念会显著影响能源消耗；2) 更高的能源消耗并不一定带来更好的结果；3) 某些网络代理缺乏模型参数和流程的透明度，限制了能耗估算的准确性。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁改变网络代理的评估方式，建议在基准测试中加入专门的能源消耗指标，以促进更可持续的网络代理开发。

Abstract: Web agents, like OpenAI's Operator and Google's Project Mariner, are powerful
agentic systems pushing the boundaries of Large Language Models (LLM). They can
autonomously interact with the internet at the user's behest, such as
navigating websites, filling search masks, and comparing price lists. Though
web agent research is thriving, induced sustainability issues remain largely
unexplored. To highlight the urgency of this issue, we provide an initial
exploration of the energy and $CO_2$ cost associated with web agents from both
a theoretical -via estimation- and an empirical perspective -by benchmarking.
Our results show how different philosophies in web agent creation can severely
impact the associated expended energy, and that more energy consumed does not
necessarily equate to better results. We highlight a lack of transparency
regarding disclosing model parameters and processes used for some web agents as
a limiting factor when estimating energy consumption. Our work contributes
towards a change in thinking of how we evaluate web agents, advocating for
dedicated metrics measuring energy consumption in benchmarks.

Conclusion: 进化方法为深度生成模型的嵌入空间探索提供了潜力，无需微调即可增强可控性。

Abstract: Deep generative models, especially diffusion architectures, have transformed
image generation; however, they are challenging to control and optimize for
specific goals without expensive retraining. Embedding Space Exploration,
especially with Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), has been shown to be a promising
method for optimizing image generation, particularly within Diffusion Models.
Therefore, in this work, we study the performance of an evolutionary
optimization method, namely Separable Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution
Strategy (sep-CMA-ES), against the widely adopted Adaptive Moment Estimation
(Adam), applied to Stable Diffusion XL Turbo's prompt embedding vector. The
evaluation of images combines the LAION Aesthetic Predictor V2 with CLIPScore
into a weighted fitness function, allowing flexible trade-offs between visual
appeal and adherence to prompts. Experiments on a subset of the Parti Prompts
(P2) dataset showcase that sep-CMA-ES consistently yields superior improvements
in aesthetic and alignment metrics in comparison to Adam. Results indicate that
the evolutionary method provides efficient, gradient-free optimization for
diffusion models, enhancing controllability without the need for fine-tuning.
This study emphasizes the potential of evolutionary methods for embedding space

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了将LLM推理与语义感知反馈相结合，在加速和深化漏洞发现方面的潜力

Abstract: Software fuzzing has become a cornerstone in automated vulnerability
discovery, yet existing mutation strategies often lack semantic awareness,
leading to redundant test cases and slow exploration of deep program states. In
this work, I present a hybrid fuzzing framework that integrates static and
dynamic analysis with Large Language Model (LLM)-guided input mutation and
semantic feedback. Static analysis extracts control-flow and data-flow
information, which is transformed into structured prompts for the LLM to
generate syntactically valid and semantically diverse inputs. During execution,
I augment traditional coverage-based feedback with semantic feedback
signals-derived from program state changes, exception types, and output
semantics-allowing the fuzzer to prioritize inputs that trigger novel program
behaviors beyond mere code coverage. I implement our approach atop AFL++,
combining program instrumentation with embedding-based semantic similarity
metrics to guide seed selection. Evaluation on real-world open-source targets,
including libpng, tcpdump, and sqlite, demonstrates that our method achieves
faster time-to-first-bug, higher semantic diversity, and a competitive number
of unique bugs compared to state-of-the-art fuzzers. This work highlights the
potential of combining LLM reasoning with semantic-aware feedback to accelerate

Abstract: Voice AI agents are rapidly transitioning to production deployments, yet
systematic methods for ensuring testing reliability remain underdeveloped.
Organizations cannot objectively assess whether their testing approaches
(internal tools or external platforms) actually work, creating a critical
measurement gap as voice AI scales to billions of daily interactions.
  We present the first systematic framework for evaluating voice AI testing
quality through human-centered benchmarking. Our methodology addresses the
fundamental dual challenge of testing platforms: generating realistic test
conversations (simulation quality) and accurately evaluating agent responses
(evaluation quality). The framework combines established psychometric
techniques (pairwise comparisons yielding Elo ratings, bootstrap confidence
intervals, and permutation tests) with rigorous statistical validation to
provide reproducible metrics applicable to any testing approach.
  To validate the framework and demonstrate its utility, we conducted
comprehensive empirical evaluation of three leading commercial platforms
focused on Voice AI Testing using 21,600 human judgments across 45 simulations
and ground truth validation on 60 conversations. Results reveal statistically
significant performance differences with the proposed framework, with the
top-performing platform, Evalion, achieving 0.92 evaluation quality measured as
f1-score versus 0.73 for others, and 0.61 simulation quality using a league

  This framework enables researchers and organizations to empirically validate

Abstract: Sharing and reconstructing a consistent spatial memory is a critical
challenge in multi-agent systems, where partial observability and limited
bandwidth often lead to catastrophic failures in coordination. We introduce a
multi-agent predictive coding framework that formulate coordination as the
minimization of mutual uncertainty among agents. Instantiated as an information
bottleneck objective, it prompts agents to learn not only who and what to
communicate but also when. At the foundation of this framework lies a
grid-cell-like metric as internal spatial coding for self-localization,
emerging spontaneously from self-supervised motion prediction. Building upon
this internal spatial code, agents gradually develop a bandwidth-efficient
communication mechanism and specialized neural populations that encode
partners' locations: an artificial analogue of hippocampal social place cells
(SPCs). These social representations are further enacted by a hierarchical
reinforcement learning policy that actively explores to reduce joint
uncertainty. On the Memory-Maze benchmark, our approach shows exceptional
resilience to bandwidth constraints: success degrades gracefully from 73.5% to
64.4% as bandwidth shrinks from 128 to 4 bits/step, whereas a full-broadcast
baseline collapses from 67.6% to 28.6%. Our findings establish a theoretically
principled and biologically plausible basis for how complex social
representations emerge from a unified predictive drive, leading to social
collective intelligence.

Result: 分析发现现有数据集中的查询类型混合不受控制，既不适合评估系统执行准确性，也不适合评估解释能力。框架和查询分析将视角从修复歧义转向在解析查询中拥抱合作。

Conclusion: 这种反思为表格数据的自然语言接口提供了更明智的设计和评估方法，并概述了未来研究的影响和方向。

Abstract: Natural language interfaces to tabular data must handle ambiguities inherent
to queries. Instead of treating ambiguity as a deficiency, we reframe it as a
feature of cooperative interaction, where the responsibility of query
specification is shared among the user and the system. We develop a principled
framework distinguishing cooperative queries, i.e., queries that yield a
resolvable interpretation, from uncooperative queries that cannot be resolved.
Applying the framework to evaluations for tabular question answering and
analysis, we analyze the queries in 15 popular datasets, and observe an
uncontrolled mixing of query types neither adequate for evaluating a system's
execution accuracy nor for evaluating interpretation capabilities. Our
framework and analysis of queries shifts the perspective from fixing ambiguity
to embracing cooperation in resolving queries. This reflection enables more
informed design and evaluation for natural language interfaces for tabular

Abstract: Medical image labels are often organized by taxonomies (e.g., organ - tissue
- subtype), yet standard self-supervised learning (SSL) ignores this structure.
We present a hierarchy-preserving contrastive framework that makes the label
tree a first-class training signal and an evaluation target. Our approach
introduces two plug-in objectives: Hierarchy-Weighted Contrastive (HWC), which
scales positive/negative pair strengths by shared ancestors to promote
within-parent coherence, and Level-Aware Margin (LAM), a prototype margin that
separates ancestor groups across levels. The formulation is geometry-agnostic
and applies to Euclidean and hyperbolic embeddings without architectural
changes. Across several benchmarks, including breast histopathology, the
proposed objectives consistently improve representation quality over strong SSL
baselines while better respecting the taxonomy. We evaluate with metrics
tailored to hierarchy faithfulness: HF1 (hierarchical F1), H-Acc
(tree-distance-weighted accuracy), and parent-distance violation rate. We also
report top-1 accuracy for completeness. Ablations show that HWC and LAM are
effective even without curvature, and combining them yields the most
taxonomy-aligned representations. Taken together, these results provide a
simple, general recipe for learning medical image representations that respect
the label tree and advance both performance and interpretability in

Motivation: 解决复杂RTL代码生成任务中需要人工干预的问题，通过智能体协作和自校正机制提高自动化程度和代码质量。

Method: 使用多智能体协作框架，结合专用LLM和硬件仿真工具，采用渐进式错误反馈系统(PEFA)进行迭代校正，生成包含编译、功能正确性和可综合构造检查的RTL代码。

Result: 在两个开源自然语言到RTL数据集上验证，实现了最先进的通过率，同时在token数量上保持高效，有效缩小了开源和闭源LLM之间的性能差距。

Conclusion: 该方法为RTL代码生成设立了新的基准，展示了多智能体协作和渐进式错误反馈在复杂代码生成任务中的有效性。

Abstract: We present an agentic flow consisting of multiple agents that combine
specialized LLMs and hardware simulation tools to collaboratively complete the
complex task of Register Transfer Level (RTL) generation without human
intervention. A key feature of the proposed flow is the progressive error
feedback system of agents (PEFA), a self-correcting mechanism that leverages
iterative error feedback to progressively increase the complexity of the
approach. The generated RTL includes checks for compilation, functional
correctness, and synthesizable constructs. To validate this adaptive approach
to code generation, benchmarking is performed using two opensource natural
language-to-RTL datasets. We demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach
implemented on an open source agentic framework, using both open- and
closed-source LLMs, effectively bridging the performance gap between them.
Compared to previously published methods, our approach sets a new benchmark,
providing state-of-the-art pass rates while being efficient in token counts.

TL;DR: X-Diffusion是一个用于机器人学习的扩散策略框架，通过噪声注入机制有效利用人类视频数据，避免学习物理不可行的动作，在五个操作任务中平均成功率比最佳基线高16%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类视频数据丰富易得，但人类和机器人在动作执行上存在根本差异，直接使用人类动作会导致机器人学习物理不可行的动作。需要一种方法既能利用人类演示中的高级任务指导，又能避免低级执行差异。

Method: X-Diffusion框架首先训练一个分类器来预测噪声动作是由人类还是机器人执行的。然后在策略训练中，只有当人类动作添加了足够噪声使得分类器无法区分其执行主体时，才将其纳入训练。与机器人执行一致的动作在低噪声水平下监督精细去噪，而不匹配的人类动作仅在高噪声水平下提供粗略指导。

Result: 实验表明，在存在执行不匹配的情况下，简单的共同训练会降低策略性能，而X-Diffusion始终能提高性能。在五个操作任务中，X-Diffusion的平均成功率比最佳基线高16%。

Conclusion: X-Diffusion提供了一个原则性的框架，通过利用扩散过程的前向特性，在最大化利用人类数据的同时避免学习动态不可行的动作，有效解决了人类-机器人动作执行不匹配的问题。

Abstract: Human videos can be recorded quickly and at scale, making them an appealing
source of training data for robot learning. However, humans and robots differ
fundamentally in embodiment, resulting in mismatched action execution. Direct
kinematic retargeting of human hand motion can therefore produce actions that
are physically infeasible for robots. Despite these low-level differences,
human demonstrations provide valuable motion cues about how to manipulate and
interact with objects. Our key idea is to exploit the forward diffusion
process: as noise is added to actions, low-level execution differences fade
while high-level task guidance is preserved. We present X-Diffusion, a
principled framework for training diffusion policies that maximally leverages
human data without learning dynamically infeasible motions. X-Diffusion first
trains a classifier to predict whether a noisy action is executed by a human or
robot. Then, a human action is incorporated into policy training only after
adding sufficient noise such that the classifier cannot discern its embodiment.
Actions consistent with robot execution supervise fine-grained denoising at low
noise levels, while mismatched human actions provide only coarse guidance at
higher noise levels. Our experiments show that naive co-training under
execution mismatches degrades policy performance, while X-Diffusion
consistently improves it. Across five manipulation tasks, X-Diffusion achieves
a 16% higher average success rate than the best baseline. The project website
is available at https://portal-cornell.github.io/X-Diffusion/.

Abstract: Currently, there is a lack of rigorous theoretical system for systematically
generating non-trivial and logically valid theorems. Addressing this critical
gap, this paper conducts research to propose a novel automated theorem
generation theory and tool. Based on the concept of standard contradiction
which possesses unique deductive advantages, this paper defines and proves, for
the first time, a new logical structure known as rectangular standard
contradiction. Centered on this structure, a complete Automated Theorem
Generation (ATG) theory is put forward. Theoretical proofs clarify two core
properties of rectangular standard contradiction: first, it is a standard
contradiction (necessarily unsatisfiable); second, it exhibits non-redundancy
(the remaining clause set becomes satisfiable after removing any clause).
Leveraging these properties, this paper proves that partitioning a rectangular
standard contradiction into a premise subset $A$ and negation of its complement
$H$, a valid theorem $A \vdash \neg H$ can be formed, and all such theorems are
logically equivalent. To implement this theory, an efficient template-based ATG
algorithm is designed, and a Rectangular Automated Theorem Generator is
developed. This research enables machines to transition from "verifiers" to
"discoverers", opening up new avenues for fundamental research in the fields of
logic and artificial intelligence.

promise, their influence on students' metacognitive processes remains
underexplored. Existing work has largely focused on correctness and usability,
with limited attention to whether and how students' use of AI assistants

by analyzing student-AI interactions through a metacognitive lens in
university-level programming courses. We examined more than 10,000 dialogue
logs collected over three years, complemented by surveys of students and
educators. Our analysis focused on how prompts and responses aligned with
metacognitive phases and strategies. Synthesizing these findings across data
sources, we distill design considerations for AI-powered coding assistants that
aim to support rather than supplant metacognitive engagement. Our findings
provide guidance for developing educational AI tools that strengthen students'

Conclusion: DKT的有效性主要源于其建模知识组件间因果依赖关系的能力，而非传统认为的双向关系建模。

Abstract: A longstanding goal in computational educational research is to develop
explainable knowledge tracing (KT) models. Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), which
leverages a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict student knowledge and
performance on exercises, has been proposed as a major advancement over
traditional KT methods. Several studies suggest that its performance gains stem
from its ability to model bidirectional relationships between different
knowledge components (KCs) within a course, enabling the inference of a
student's understanding of one KC from their performance on others. In this
paper, we challenge this prevailing explanation and demonstrate that DKT's
strength lies in its implicit ability to model prerequisite relationships as a
causal structure, rather than bidirectional relationships. By pruning exercise
relation graphs into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and training DKT on causal
subsets of the Assistments dataset, we show that DKT's predictive capabilities
align strongly with these causal structures. Furthermore, we propose an
alternative method for extracting exercise relation DAGs using DKT's learned
representations and provide empirical evidence supporting our claim. Our
findings suggest that DKT's effectiveness is largely driven by its capacity to
approximate causal dependencies between KCs rather than simple relational
mappings.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Opus Workflow Evaluation Framework, a

probabilistic function estimating expected performance through success
likelihood, resource usage, and output gain, with the Opus Workflow Normative
Penalties, a set of measurable functions capturing structural and informational
quality across Cohesion, Coupling, Observability, and Information Hygiene. It
supports automated Workflow assessment, ranking, and optimization within modern
automation systems such as Opus and can be integrated into Reinforcement
Learning loops to guide Workflow discovery and refinement. In this paper, we
introduce the Opus Workflow Reward model that formalizes Workflow success as a
probabilistic expectation over costs and outcomes. We define measurable Opus
Workflow Normative Penalties capturing structural, semantic, and signal-related
properties of Workflows. Finally, we propose a unified optimization formulation
for identifying and ranking optimal Workflows under joint Reward-Penalty
trade-offs.

Abstract: A central feature of many deliberative processes, such as citizens'
assemblies and deliberative polls, is the opportunity for participants to
engage directly with experts. While participants are typically invited to
propose questions for expert panels, only a limited number can be selected due
to time constraints. This raises the challenge of how to choose a small set of
questions that best represent the interests of all participants. We introduce
an auditing framework for measuring the level of representation provided by a
slate of questions, based on the social choice concept known as justified
representation (JR). We present the first algorithms for auditing JR in the
general utility setting, with our most efficient algorithm achieving a runtime
of $O(mn\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of participants and $m$ is the number
of proposed questions. We apply our auditing methods to historical
deliberations, comparing the representativeness of (a) the actual questions
posed to the expert panel (chosen by a moderator), (b) participants' questions
chosen via integer linear programming, (c) summary questions generated by large
language models (LLMs). Our results highlight both the promise and current
limitations of LLMs in supporting deliberative processes. By integrating our
methods into an online deliberation platform that has been used for over
hundreds of deliberations across more than 50 countries, we make it easy for
practitioners to audit and improve representation in future deliberations.

Conclusion: 通过推理符号计划而非原始轨迹，DR. WELL避免了脆弱的步骤级对齐，实现了可重用、可同步和可解释的更高级操作。

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent planning requires agents to make joint decisions with
partial information and limited communication. Coordination at the trajectory
level often fails, as small deviations in timing or movement cascade into
conflicts. Symbolic planning mitigates this challenge by raising the level of
abstraction and providing a minimal vocabulary of actions that enable
synchronization and collective progress. We present DR. WELL, a decentralized
neurosymbolic framework for cooperative multi-agent planning. Cooperation
unfolds through a two-phase negotiation protocol: agents first propose
candidate roles with reasoning and then commit to a joint allocation under
consensus and environment constraints. After commitment, each agent
independently generates and executes a symbolic plan for its role without
revealing detailed trajectories. Plans are grounded in execution outcomes via a
shared world model that encodes the current state and is updated as agents act.
By reasoning over symbolic plans rather than raw trajectories, DR. WELL avoids
brittle step-level alignment and enables higher-level operations that are
reusable, synchronizable, and interpretable. Experiments on cooperative
block-push tasks show that agents adapt across episodes, with the dynamic world
model capturing reusable patterns and improving task completion rates and
efficiency. Experiments on cooperative block-push tasks show that our dynamic
world model improves task completion and efficiency through negotiation and
self-refinement, trading a time overhead for evolving, more efficient
collaboration strategies.

Abstract: Food logging, both self-directed and prescribed, plays a critical role in
uncovering correlations between diet, medical, fitness, and health outcomes.
Through conversations with nutritional experts and individuals who practice
dietary tracking, we find current logging methods, such as handwritten and
app-based journaling, are inflexible and result in low adherence and
potentially inaccurate nutritional summaries. These findings, corroborated by
prior literature, emphasize the urgent need for improved food logging methods.
In response, we propose SnappyMeal, an AI-powered dietary tracking system that
leverages multimodal inputs to enable users to more flexibly log their food
intake. SnappyMeal introduces goal-dependent follow-up questions to
intelligently seek missing context from the user and information retrieval from
user grocery receipts and nutritional databases to improve accuracy. We
evaluate SnappyMeal through publicly available nutrition benchmarks and a
multi-user, 3-week, in-the-wild deployment capturing over 500 logged food
instances. Users strongly praised the multiple available input methods and
reported a strong perceived accuracy. These insights suggest that multimodal AI
systems can be leveraged to significantly improve dietary tracking flexibility
and context-awareness, laying the groundwork for a new class of intelligent
self-tracking applications.

Abstract: Nonlinear dynamical systems with input delays pose significant challenges for
prediction, estimation, and control due to their inherent complexity and the
impact of delays on system behavior. Traditional linear control techniques
often fail in these contexts, necessitating innovative approaches. This paper
introduces a novel approach to approximate the Koopman operator using an
LSTM-enhanced Deep Koopman model, enabling linear representations of nonlinear
systems with time delays. By incorporating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
layers, the proposed framework captures historical dependencies and efficiently
encodes time-delayed system dynamics into a latent space. Unlike traditional
extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (eDMD) approaches that rely on predefined
dictionaries, the LSTM-enhanced Deep Koopman model is dictionary-free, which
mitigates the problems with the underlying dynamics being known and
incorporated into the dictionary. Quantitative comparisons with extended eDMD
on a simulated system demonstrate highly significant performance gains in
prediction accuracy in cases where the true nonlinear dynamics are unknown and
achieve comparable results to eDMD with known dynamics of a system.

Conclusion: 该方法为结构健康监测应用提供了一个强大的工具，能够仅基于响应信号自动识别模型类别，无需系统输入信息。

Abstract: The response-only model class selection capability of a novel deep
convolutional neural network method is examined herein in a simple, yet
effective, manner. Specifically, the responses from a unique degree of freedom
along with their class information train and validate a one-dimensional
convolutional neural network. In doing so, the network selects the model class
of new and unlabeled signals without the need of the system input information,
or full system identification. An optional physics-based algorithm enhancement
is also examined using the Kalman filter to fuse the system response signals
using the kinematics constraints of the acceleration and displacement data.
Importantly, the method is shown to select the model class in slight signal
variations attributed to the damping behavior or hysteresis behavior on both
linear and nonlinear dynamic systems, as well as on a 3D building finite
element model, providing a powerful tool for structural health monitoring
applications.

Method: DRCSD包含协作信号解耦模块（按结构特征分解信号为不同阶次）和分层去噪模块（对各阶次进行针对性去噪），并改进传统GNN聚合机制避免交叉阶次信号干扰。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验表明，DRCSD对不稳定交互具有优越鲁棒性，在推荐精度指标上相比最先进基线模型获得统计显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: DRCSD通过解耦协作信号和分层去噪有效提升了推荐系统的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Although the collaborative filtering (CF) algorithm has achieved remarkable
performance in recommendation systems, it suffers from suboptimal
recommendation performance due to noise in the user-item interaction matrix.
Numerous noise-removal studies have improved recommendation models, but most
existing approaches conduct denoising on a single graph. This may cause
attenuation of collaborative signals: removing edges between two nodes can
interrupt paths between other nodes, weakening path-dependent collaborative
information. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel
GNN-based CF model called DRCSD for denoising unstable interactions. DRCSD
includes two core modules: a collaborative signal decoupling module (decomposes
signals into distinct orders by structural characteristics) and an order-wise
denoising module (performs targeted denoising on each order). Additionally, the
information aggregation mechanism of traditional GNN-based CF models is
modified to avoid cross-order signal interference until the final pooling
operation. Extensive experiments on three public real-world datasets show that
DRCSD has superior robustness against unstable interactions and achieves
statistically significant performance improvements in recommendation accuracy
metrics compared to state-of-the-art baseline models.

Motivation: 高性能存内计算追求更高性能导致复杂电路设计和高频操作，加剧IR-drop问题，传统电路级缓解方法资源密集且影响PPA

Conclusion: AIM通过软硬件协同设计有效解决高性能PIM中的IR-drop问题，显著提升能效和性能

Abstract: SRAM Processing-in-Memory (PIM) has emerged as the most promising
implementation for high-performance PIM, delivering superior computing density,
energy efficiency, and computational precision. However, the pursuit of higher
performance necessitates more complex circuit designs and increased operating
frequencies, which exacerbate IR-drop issues. Severe IR-drop can significantly
degrade chip performance and even threaten reliability. Conventional
circuit-level IR-drop mitigation methods, such as back-end optimizations, are
resource-intensive and often compromise power, performance, and area (PPA). To
address these challenges, we propose AIM, comprehensive software and hardware
co-design for architecture-level IR-drop mitigation in high-performance PIM.
Initially, leveraging the bit-serial and in-situ dataflow processing properties
of PIM, we introduce Rtog and HR, which establish a direct correlation between
PIM workloads and IR-drop. Building on this foundation, we propose LHR and WDS,
enabling extensive exploration of architecture-level IR-drop mitigation while
maintaining computational accuracy through software optimization. Subsequently,
we develop IR-Booster, a dynamic adjustment mechanism that integrates
software-level HR information with hardware-based IR-drop monitoring to adapt
the V-f pairs of the PIM macro, achieving enhanced energy efficiency and
performance. Finally, we propose the HR-aware task mapping method, bridging
software and hardware designs to achieve optimal improvement. Post-layout
simulation results on a 7nm 256-TOPS PIM chip demonstrate that AIM achieves up
to 69.2% IR-drop mitigation, resulting in 2.29x energy efficiency improvement
and 1.152x speedup.

Motivation: 城市地表水洪水日益频繁，但由于时间、预算和技术限制，高时空分辨率的洪水预测和监测难以全面实施。如何在资源受限条件下监测城市排水网络并预测流量状况是一个主要挑战。

Method: 使用EPA-SWMM模型生成训练数据集，应用数据驱动稀疏传感框架，通过奇异值分解进行降维和QR分解进行传感器分配，识别最优监测节点。

Abstract: Urban surface water flooding, triggered by intense rainfall overwhelming
drainage systems, is increasingly frequent and widespread. While flood
prediction and monitoring in high spatial-temporal resolution are desired,
practical constraints in time, budget, and technology hinder its full
implementation. How to monitor urban drainage networks and predict flow
conditions under constrained resource is a major challenge. This study presents
a data-driven sparse sensing (DSS) framework, integrated with EPA-SWMM, to
optimize sensor placement and reconstruct peak flowrates in a stormwater
system, using the Woodland Avenue catchment in Duluth, Minnesota, as a case
study. We utilized a SWMM model to generate a training dataset of peak flowrate
profiles across the stormwater network. Furthermore, we applied DSS -
leveraging singular value decomposition for dimensionality reduction and QR
factorization for sensor allocation - to identify the optimal monitoring nodes
based on the simulated training dataset. We then validated the
representativeness of these identified monitoring nodes by comparing the
DSS-reconstructed peak flowrate profiles with those obtained from SWMM. Three
optimally placed sensors among 77 nodes achieved satisfactory reconstruction
performance with Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) values of 0.92-0.95 (25th to
75th percentiles). In addition, the model showed good robustness to uncertainty
in measurements. Its robustness to sensor failures is location-dependent and
improves with the number of sensors deployed. The framework balances
computational efficiency and physical interpretability, enabling high-accuracy
flow reconstruction with minimal sensors. This DSS framework can be further
integrated with predictive models to realize flood early warning and real-time
control under limited sensing and monitoring resource.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient registration of whole slide images (WSIs) is essential
for high-resolution, nuclei-level analysis in multi-stained tissue slides. We
propose a novel coarse-to-fine framework CORE for accurate nuclei-level
registration across diverse multimodal whole-slide image (WSI) datasets. The
coarse registration stage leverages prompt-based tissue mask extraction to
effectively filter out artefacts and non-tissue regions, followed by global
alignment using tissue morphology and ac- celerated dense feature matching with
a pre-trained feature extractor. From the coarsely aligned slides, nuclei
centroids are detected and subjected to fine-grained rigid registration using a
custom, shape-aware point-set registration model. Finally, non-rigid alignment
at the cellular level is achieved by estimating a non-linear dis- placement
field using Coherent Point Drift (CPD). Our approach benefits from
automatically generated nuclei that enhance the accuracy of deformable
registra- tion and ensure precise nuclei-level correspondence across
modalities. The pro- posed model is evaluated on three publicly available WSI
registration datasets, and two private datasets. We show that CORE outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods in terms of generalisability, precision, and
robustness in bright-field and immunofluorescence microscopy WSIs

Abstract: With the increasing frequency and sophistication of Distributed Denial of

interpretable detection methods. Traditional detection systems often struggle
with scalability and transparency, hindering real-time response and
understanding of attack vectors. This paper presents an automated framework for
detecting and interpreting DDoS attacks using machine learning (ML). The
proposed method leverages the Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool (TPOT) to
automate the selection and optimization of ML models and features, reducing the
need for manual experimentation. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is
incorporated to enhance model interpretability, providing detailed insights
into the contribution of individual features to the detection process. By
combining TPOT's automated pipeline selection with SHAP interpretability, this
approach improves the accuracy and transparency of DDoS detection. Experimental
results demonstrate that key features such as mean backward packet length and
minimum forward packet header length are critical in detecting DDoS attacks,
offering a scalable and explainable cybersecurity solution.

Conclusion: 深度Koopman表示与经济优化的结合为热密集型工厂的资源高效控制提供了实际优势。

Abstract: This paper presents a deep Koopman-based Economic Model Predictive Control
(EMPC) for efficient operation of a laboratory-scale pasteurization unit (PU).
The method uses Koopman operator theory to transform the complex, nonlinear
system dynamics into a linear representation, enabling the application of
convex optimization while representing the complex PU accurately. The deep
Koopman model utilizes neural networks to learn the linear dynamics from
experimental data, achieving a 45% improvement in open-loop prediction accuracy
over conventional N4SID subspace identification. Both analyzed models were
employed in the EMPC formulation that includes interpretable economic costs,
such as energy consumption, material losses due to inadequate pasteurization,
and actuator wear. The feasibility of EMPC is ensured using slack variables.
The deep Koopman EMPC and N4SID EMPC are numerically validated on a nonlinear
model of multivariable PU under external disturbance. The disturbances include
feed pump fail-to-close scenario and the introduction of a cold batch to be
pastuerized. These results demonstrate that the deep Koopmand EMPC achieves a
32% reduction in total economic cost compared to the N4SID baseline. This
improvement is mainly due to the reductions in material losses and energy
consumption. Furthermore, the steady-state operation via Koopman-based EMPC
requires 10.2% less electrical energy. The results highlight the practical
advantages of integrating deep Koopman representations with economic
optimization to achieve resource-efficient control of thermal-intensive plants.

Existing approaches to detecting fraud predominantly rely on machine learning

only fails to prevent fraud, but also makes detecting manipulation
computationally intractable. We also introduce a novel rule, ScaledUserProp,
that satisfies all three manipulation-resistance axioms. Finally, experiments
with both real-world and synthetic streaming data support ScaledUserProp as a
fairer alternative compared to existing rules.

Result: 模型在单图像感知上表现良好，但在跨场景推理中表现很差：最佳模型在Common-O上仅35%准确率，在复杂场景中仅1%准确率。模型在类似物体存在时更容易产生幻觉。

Conclusion: 多模态模型在跨场景推理方面存在严重缺陷，多图像训练可能提供改进，需要进一步研究解决幻觉问题。

Abstract: Multimodal language models possess a remarkable ability to handle an
open-vocabulary's worth of objects. Yet the best models still suffer from
hallucinations when reasoning about scenes in the real world, revealing a gap
between their seemingly strong performance on existing perception benchmarks
that are saturating and their reasoning in the real world. To address this gap,
we build a novel benchmark of in-the-wild scenes that we call Common-O. With
more than 10.5k examples using exclusively new images not found in web training
data to avoid contamination, Common-O goes beyond just perception, inspired by
cognitive tests for humans, to probe reasoning across scenes by asking "what's
in common?". We evaluate leading multimodal language models, including models
specifically trained to perform chain-of-thought reasoning. We find that
perceiving objects in single images is tractable for most models, yet reasoning
across scenes is very challenging even for the best models, including reasoning
models. Despite saturating many leaderboards focusing on perception, the best
performing model only achieves 35% on Common-O -- and on Common-O Complex,
consisting of more complex scenes, the best model achieves only 1%. Curiously,
we find models are more prone to hallucinate when similar objects are present
in the scene, suggesting models may be relying on object co-occurrence seen
during training. Among the models we evaluated, we found scale can provide
modest improvements while models explicitly trained with multi-image inputs
show bigger improvements, suggesting scaled multi-image training may offer
promise. We make our benchmark publicly available to spur research into the
challenge of hallucination when reasoning across scenes.

compute. Our results demonstrate that difficulty-aware routing is effective for
cost-efficient deployment of reasoning models.

Abstract: Transitioning from offline to online reinforcement learning (RL) poses
critical challenges due to distributional shifts between the fixed behavior
policy in the offline dataset and the evolving policy during online learning.
Although this issue is widely recognized, few methods attempt to explicitly
assess or utilize the distributional structure of the offline data itself,
leaving a research gap in adapting learning strategies to different types of
samples. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative method,
Energy-Guided Diffusion Stratification (StratDiff), which facilitates smoother
transitions in offline-to-online RL. StratDiff deploys a diffusion model to
learn prior knowledge from the offline dataset. It then refines this knowledge
through energy-based functions to improve policy imitation and generate
offline-like actions during online fine-tuning. The KL divergence between the
generated action and the corresponding sampled action is computed for each
sample and used to stratify the training batch into offline-like and
online-like subsets. Offline-like samples are updated using offline objectives,
while online-like samples follow online learning strategies. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of StratDiff by integrating it with off-the-shelf methods Cal-QL
and IQL. Extensive empirical evaluations on D4RL benchmarks show that StratDiff
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving enhanced adaptability and
more stable performance across diverse RL settings.

language model (LLM) sparsification. TwIST trains multiple subnetworks in
parallel, periodically aggregates their parameters, and resamples new
subnetworks during training. This process identifies high-quality subnetworks
("golden tickets") without requiring post-training procedures such as
calibration or Hessian-based recovery. As a result, TwIST enables zero-cost
pruning at deployment time while achieving perplexity competitive with
state-of-the-art post-training sparsification methods. The benefits are most
pronounced under aggressive sparsity (e.g., 50%+), where TwIST significantly
outperforms baseline methods; for example, reaching 23.14 PPL compared to 31.64
for the closest prior approach. Unlike unstructured pruning, TwIST produces
structured, dense matrices that offer practical inference speedups and memory
reductions on commodity hardware (e.g., CPUs) that do not support efficient
sparse computation. TwIST provides an efficient training-time path to
deployable sparse LLMs without additional fine-tuning or recovery overhead.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved near-human performance across
diverse reasoning tasks, yet their deployment on resource-constrained
Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices remains impractical due to massive parameter
footprints and memory-intensive autoregressive decoding. While split computing
offers a promising solution by partitioning model execution between edge
devices and cloud servers, existing approaches fail to address the unique
challenges of autoregressive inference, particularly the iterative token
generation process and expanding key-value (KV) cache requirements. This work
introduces the first autoregressive-aware split computing framework designed
explicitly for LLM deployment on edge devices. Our approach makes three key
contributions. First, we develop one-point split compression (OPSC), a
mixed-precision quantization scheme that prevents out-of-memory failures by
strategically partitioning models into front-end and back-end segments with
different precision levels. Second, we propose a two-stage intermediate
compression pipeline that combines threshold splitting (TS) and token-wise
adaptive bit quantization (TAB-Q) to preserve accuracy-critical activations
while dramatically reducing communication overhead. Third, we formulate a
unified optimization framework that jointly selects optimal split points,
quantization settings, and sequence lengths to satisfy strict memory and
latency constraints. Extensive evaluations across diverse LLMs and hardware
platforms demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
quantization methods, including SmoothQuant, OmniQuant, and Atom. The framework
achieves a 1.49 inference speedup and significant communication overhead
reduction while maintaining or improving model accuracy.

Conclusion: DartQuant为大语言模型量化提供了高效可行的解决方案，特别适用于资源受限环境。

Abstract: Quantization plays a crucial role in accelerating the inference of
large-scale models, and rotational matrices have been shown to effectively
improve quantization performance by smoothing outliers. However, end-to-end
fine-tuning of rotational optimization algorithms incurs high computational
costs and is prone to overfitting. To address this challenge, we propose an
efficient distribution-aware rotational calibration method, DartQuant, which
reduces the complexity of rotational optimization by constraining the
distribution of the activations after rotation. This approach also effectively
reduces reliance on task-specific losses, thereby mitigating the risk of
overfitting. Additionally, we introduce the QR-Orth optimization scheme, which
replaces expensive alternating optimization with a more efficient solution. In
a variety of model quantization experiments, DartQuant demonstrates superior
performance. Compared to existing methods, it achieves 47$\times$ acceleration
and 10$\times$ memory savings for rotational optimization on a 70B model.
Furthermore, it is the first to successfully complete rotational calibration
for a 70B model on a single 3090 GPU, making quantization of large language
models feasible in resource-constrained environments. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际应用中安全强化学习常涉及无限数量约束（半无限安全RL），如需要在连续参数空间上强制执行安全条件。现有方法难以有效处理此类问题。

Method: EPO通过迭代求解有限约束集的安全RL子问题，采用约束扩展和删除机制自适应调整活动集：违反预定义容差的约束被添加，拉格朗日乘子为零的约束在策略更新后被移除。

Result: 理论分析表明，在温和假设下，通过EPO训练的策略实现了与最优解相当的性能，同时全局约束违反严格保持在预定界限内。

Conclusion: EPO为半无限安全RL问题提供了有效的算法框架，能够平衡策略性能和安全性要求。

Abstract: Safe reinforcement learning (safe RL) aims to respect safety requirements
while optimizing long-term performance. In many practical applications,
however, the problem involves an infinite number of constraints, known as
semi-infinite safe RL (SI-safe RL). Such constraints typically appear when
safety conditions must be enforced across an entire continuous parameter space,
such as ensuring adequate resource distribution at every spatial location. In
this paper, we propose exchange policy optimization (EPO), an algorithmic
framework that achieves optimal policy performance and deterministic bounded
safety. EPO works by iteratively solving safe RL subproblems with finite
constraint sets and adaptively adjusting the active set through constraint
expansion and deletion. At each iteration, constraints with violations
exceeding the predefined tolerance are added to refine the policy, while those
with zero Lagrange multipliers are removed after the policy update. This
exchange rule prevents uncontrolled growth of the working set and supports
effective policy training. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under
mild assumptions, strategies trained via EPO achieve performance comparable to
optimal solutions with global constraint violations strictly remaining within a
prescribed bound.

Conclusion: 为从业者提供了明确的指导，并为新兴低精度格式下的PTQ研究奠定了基础，提出的块旋转策略有效解决了旋转方法与MXFP4的不兼容问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, but their
rapidly growing scale imposes prohibitive costs in memory, computation, and
energy. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution for efficient
deployment, yet achieving accurate W4A4 quantization remains an open challenge.
While most existing methods are designed for INT4 formats, the emergence of
MXFP4 -- a new FP4 format with various hardware support (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel)--
raises questions about the applicability of current techniques. In this work,
we establish a comprehensive benchmark of PTQ methods under the MXFP4 format.
Through systematic evaluation, we find that methods like GPTQ consistently
deliver strong performance, whereas rotation-based approaches, which are almost
used by all state-of-the-art approaches, suffer from severe incompatibility
with MXFP4. We further provide the first in-depth analysis of this conflict,
tracing its root to a fundamental mismatch between MXFP4's PoT (power-of-two)
block scaling and the redistribution of outlier energy via global rotation.
Building on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective block rotation
strategy that adapts rotation-based methods to MXFP4, leading to substantial
accuracy improvements across diverse LLMs. Our findings not only offer clear
guidance for practitioners but also set a foundation for advancing PTQ research
under emerging low-precision formats.

Abstract: Learning from human preferences is a cornerstone of aligning machine learning
models with subjective human judgments. Yet, collecting such preference data is
often costly and time-consuming, motivating the need for more efficient
learning paradigms. Two established approaches offer complementary advantages:
RLHF scales effectively to high-dimensional tasks such as LLM fine-tuning,
while PBO achieves greater sample efficiency through active querying. We
propose a hybrid framework that unifies RLHF's scalability with PBO's query
efficiency by integrating an acquisition-driven module into the RLHF pipeline,
thereby enabling active and sample-efficient preference gathering. We validate
the proposed approach on two representative domains: (i) high-dimensional
preference optimization and (ii) LLM fine-tuning. Experimental results
demonstrate consistent improvements in both sample efficiency and overall
performance across these tasks.

Result: 发现当前不确定性估计器在无模糊假设下表现良好，但在模糊数据上性能退化至接近随机水平；理论分析表明预测分布和集成方法在模糊性下存在根本限制。

Conclusion: 揭示了当前LLM UQ方法的关键缺陷，需要重新思考当前建模范式以应对语言模糊性。

Abstract: Accurate uncertainty quantification (UQ) in Large Language Models (LLMs) is
critical for trustworthy deployment. While real-world language is inherently
ambiguous, reflecting aleatoric uncertainty, existing UQ methods are typically
benchmarked against tasks with no ambiguity. In this work, we demonstrate that
while current uncertainty estimators perform well under the restrictive
assumption of no ambiguity, they degrade to close-to-random performance on
ambiguous data. To this end, we introduce MAQA* and AmbigQA*, the first
ambiguous question-answering (QA) datasets equipped with ground-truth answer
distributions estimated from factual co-occurrence. We find this performance
deterioration to be consistent across different estimation paradigms: using the
predictive distribution itself, internal representations throughout the model,
and an ensemble of models. We show that this phenomenon can be theoretically
explained, revealing that predictive-distribution and ensemble-based estimators
are fundamentally limited under ambiguity. Overall, our study reveals a key
shortcoming of current UQ methods for LLMs and motivates a rethinking of
current modeling paradigms.

Conclusion: Q3R能够以规定的低目标秩训练权重矩阵，实现与密集模型相当的预测性能，计算开销小，且与现有架构完全兼容。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient training, based on low-rank optimization, has become a
highly successful tool for fine-tuning large deep-learning models. However,
these methods fail at low-rank pre-training tasks where maintaining the
low-rank structure and the objective remains a challenging task. We propose the
Quadratic Reweighted Rank Regularizer dubbed Q3R, which leads to a novel
low-rank inducing training strategy inspired by the iteratively reweighted
least squares (IRLS) framework. Q3R is based on a quadratic regularizer term
which majorizes a smoothed log determinant serving as rank surrogate objective.
Unlike other low-rank training techniques, Q3R is able to train weight matrices
with prescribed, low target ranks of models that achieve comparable predictive
performance as dense models, with small computational overhead, while remaining
fully compatible with existing architectures. For example, we demonstrated one
experiment where we are able to truncate $60\%$ and $80\%$ of the parameters of
a ViT-Tiny model with $~1.3\%$ and $~4\%$ accuracy drop in CIFAR-10 performance
respectively. The efficacy of Q3R is confirmed on Transformers across both
image and language tasks, including for low-rank fine-tuning.

Conclusion: 研究为开发更可靠的机制可解释性方法提供了路径，强调需要关注干预引起的分布偏离问题。

Abstract: A common approach to mechanistic interpretability is to causally manipulate
model representations via targeted interventions in order to understand what
those representations encode. Here we ask whether such interventions create
out-of-distribution (divergent) representations, and whether this raises
concerns about how faithful their resulting explanations are to the target
model in its natural state. First, we demonstrate empirically that common
causal intervention techniques often do shift internal representations away
from the natural distribution of the target model. Then, we provide a
theoretical analysis of two classes of such divergences: `harmless' divergences
that occur in the null-space of the weights and from covariance within
behavioral decision boundaries, and `pernicious' divergences that activate
hidden network pathways and cause dormant behavioral changes. Finally, in an
effort to mitigate the pernicious cases, we modify the Counterfactual Latent
(CL) loss from Grant (2025) that regularizes interventions to remain closer to
the natural distributions, reducing the likelihood of harmful divergences while
preserving the interpretive power of interventions. Together, these results
highlight a path towards more reliable interpretability methods.

Motivation: 标准自回归大语言模型的推理过程本质上是顺序的，导致推理时间长且成本高。扩散语言模型（特别是掩码扩散模型）能够并行采样，但缺乏对并行采样能力与性能退化之间关系的严格理解。

Method: 通过函数逼近理论建立采样分布与真实分布之间期望散度的精确表征，利用信息论性质（总相关性和对偶总相关性）推导新的上下界，并设计新的采样调度策略。

Result: 在自然设置下，可以在O(log n)步内进行采样而不会出现明显的性能损失，其中n是总序列长度。同时证明了在没有先验知识的情况下，很难与最优调度竞争。

Conclusion: 扩散语言模型在特定条件下可以实现高效的并行采样，信息论性质为设计有效的采样调度提供了理论基础。

Abstract: A major bottleneck of standard auto-regressive large language models is that
their inference process is inherently sequential, resulting in very long and
costly inference times. To circumvent this, practitioners proposed a class of
language models called diffusion language models, of which the masked diffusion
model (MDM) is the most successful. The MDM is able to sample tokens
out-of-order and, ostensibly, many tokens at once and in parallel. However,
there is very limited rigorous understanding of how much parallel sampling
these models can perform without noticeable degradation in their sampling
performance. Prior work of Li and Cai obtained some preliminary bounds, but
these are not tight for many natural classes of distributions. In this work, we
give a new, exact characterization of the expected divergence between the true
distribution and the sampled distribution, for any distribution and any
unmasking schedule for the sampler, showing an elegant connection to the theory
of univariate function approximation.
  By leveraging this connection, we then attain a number of novel lower and
upper bounds for this problem. While the connection to function approximation
in principle gives the optimal unmasking schedule for any distribution, we show
that it is in general impossible to compete with it without strong a priori
knowledge of the distribution, even in seemingly benign settings. However, we
also demonstrate new upper bounds and new sampling schedules in terms of
well-studied information-theoretic properties of the base distribution, namely,
its total correlation and dual total correlation, which show that in some
natural settings, one can sample in $O(log n)$ steps without any visible loss
in performance, where $n$ is the total sequence length.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in code

focus of AI research. Benchmarks and leaderboards are increasingly popular,
offering quantitative rankings of LLMs. However, they provide limited insight
into the tasks that LLMs consistently fail to solve - information that is
crucial for understanding current limitations and guiding the development of
more capable models. To address this gap, we examined code generation tasks
across four popular benchmarks, identifying those that major LLMs are most
likely to fail. To understand the causes of these failures, we investigated
whether the static complexity of solution code contributes to them, followed by
a systematic inspection of 114 tasks that LLMs consistently struggled with. Our

common complications within benchmark tasks that most often lead to failure.

Abstract: We introduce and formalize the Synthetic Dataset Quality Estimation (SynQuE)
problem: ranking synthetic datasets by their expected real-world task
performance using only limited unannotated real data. This addresses a critical
and open challenge where data is scarce due to collection costs or privacy
constraints. We establish the first comprehensive benchmarks for this problem
by introducing and evaluating proxy metrics that choose synthetic data for
training to maximize task performance on real data. We introduce the first
proxy metrics for SynQuE by adapting distribution and diversity-based distance
measures to our context via embedding models. To address the shortcomings of
these metrics on complex planning tasks, we propose LENS, a novel proxy that
leverages large language model reasoning. Our results show that SynQuE proxies
correlate with real task performance across diverse tasks, including sentiment
analysis, Text2SQL, web navigation, and image classification, with LENS
consistently outperforming others on complex tasks by capturing nuanced
characteristics. For instance, on text-to-SQL parsing, training on the top-3
synthetic datasets selected via SynQuE proxies can raise accuracy from 30.4% to

Abstract: This paper proposes a composable fine-tuning method that integrates graph
structural priors with modular adapters to address the high computational cost
and structural instability faced by large-scale pre-trained models in
multi-task adaptation. The method introduces a relation matrix to model
dependencies among tasks, explicitly encoding correlations between nodes and
paths into graph structural priors, which provide unified structural
constraints for adapter weight allocation and path selection. Modular adapters
are embedded into different layers through low-rank mapping and a pluggable
mechanism, enabling efficient cross-task composition and reuse under prior
guidance. This mechanism not only improves parameter efficiency and training
stability but also alleviates path conflicts and redundant computation in
multi-task scenarios. Furthermore, experiments on hyperparameter sensitivity,
environmental sensitivity, and data sensitivity are conducted to systematically
analyze key factors such as routing temperature, gating thresholds, and
relation matrix regularization strength, verifying the consistency and superior
performance of the method under structural constraints. The results demonstrate
that the proposed framework significantly enhances task prediction accuracy,
adapter weight allocation precision, and overall computational efficiency while
maintaining model lightweight design, highlighting the synergistic advantages
of graph priors and modular mechanisms in composable fine-tuning.

Abstract: In recent years, end-to-end Large Language Model (LLM) technology has shown
substantial advantages across various domains. As critical system software and
infrastructure, compilers are responsible for transforming source code into
target code. While LLMs have been leveraged to assist in compiler development
and maintenance, their potential as an end-to-end compiler remains largely
unexplored. This paper explores the feasibility of LLM as a Compiler (LaaC) and
its future directions. We designed the CompilerEval dataset and framework
specifically to evaluate the capabilities of mainstream LLMs in source code
comprehension and assembly code generation. In the evaluation, we analyzed
various errors, explored multiple methods to improve LLM-generated code, and
evaluated cross-platform compilation capabilities. Experimental results
demonstrate that LLMs exhibit basic capabilities as compilers but currently
achieve low compilation success rates. By optimizing prompts, scaling up the
model, and incorporating reasoning methods, the quality of assembly code
generated by LLMs can be significantly enhanced. Based on these findings, we
maintain an optimistic outlook for LaaC and propose practical architectural
designs and future research directions. We believe that with targeted training,
knowledge-rich prompts, and specialized infrastructure, LaaC has the potential
to generate high-quality assembly code and drive a paradigm shift in the field
of compilation.

Conclusion: SCER通过理论驱动的嵌入正则化有效提升了模型对伪相关性的鲁棒性，在最差群体性能上取得了显著改进

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve strong performance across various domains but
often rely on spurious correlations, making them vulnerable to distribution
shifts. This issue is particularly severe in subpopulation shift scenarios,
where models struggle in underrepresented groups. While existing methods have
made progress in mitigating this issue, their performance gains are still
constrained. They lack a rigorous theoretical framework connecting the
embedding space representations with worst-group error. To address this
limitation, we propose Spurious Correlation-Aware Embedding Regularization for
Worst-Group Robustness (SCER), a novel approach that directly regularizes
feature representations to suppress spurious cues. We show theoretically that
worst-group error is influenced by how strongly the classifier relies on
spurious versus core directions, identified from differences in group-wise mean
embeddings across domains and classes. By imposing theoretical constraints at
the embedding level, SCER encourages models to focus on core features while
reducing sensitivity to spurious patterns. Through systematic evaluation on
multiple vision and language, we show that SCER outperforms prior
state-of-the-art studies in worst-group accuracy. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 这些结果建立了对遗忘的原则性理解，为分析和改进通用学习算法的信息保留能力奠定了基础。

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in developing general learning algorithms is their
tendency to forget past knowledge when adapting to new data. Addressing this
problem requires a principled understanding of forgetting; yet, despite decades
of study, no unified definition has emerged that provides insights into the
underlying dynamics of learning. We propose an algorithm- and task-agnostic
theory that characterises forgetting as a lack of self-consistency in a
learner's predictive distribution over future experiences, manifesting as a
loss of predictive information. Our theory naturally yields a general measure
of an algorithm's propensity to forget. To validate the theory, we design a
comprehensive set of experiments that span classification, regression,
generative modelling, and reinforcement learning. We empirically demonstrate
how forgetting is present across all learning settings and plays a significant
role in determining learning efficiency. Together, these results establish a
principled understanding of forgetting and lay the foundation for analysing and
improving the information retention capabilities of general learning
algorithms.

Abstract: Short-video platforms have become a central medium in the modern Internet
landscape, where efficient information delivery and strong interactivity are
reshaping user engagement and cultural dissemination. Among the various forms
of user interaction, comments play a vital role in fostering community
participation and enabling content re-creation. However, generating comments
that are both compliant with platform guidelines and capable of exhibiting
stylistic diversity and contextual awareness remains a significant challenge.
We introduce LOLGORITHM, a modular multi-agent system (MAS) designed for
controllable short-video comment generation. The system integrates video
segmentation, contextual and affective analysis, and style-aware prompt
construction. It supports six distinct comment styles: puns (homophones),
rhyming, meme application, sarcasm (irony), plain humor, and content
extraction. Powered by a multimodal large language model (MLLM), LOLGORITHM
directly processes video inputs and achieves fine-grained style control through
explicit prompt markers and few-shot examples. To support development and
evaluation, we construct a bilingual dataset using official APIs from Douyin
(Chinese) and YouTube (English), covering five popular video genres: comedy
skits, daily life jokes, funny animal clips, humorous commentary, and talk
shows. Evaluation combines automated metrics originality, relevance, and style
conformity with a large-scale human preference study involving 40 videos and
105 participants. Results show that LOLGORITHM significantly outperforms
baseline models, achieving preference rates of over 90% on Douyin and 87.55% on
YouTube. This work presents a scalable and culturally adaptive framework for
stylized comment generation on short-video platforms, offering a promising path

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved
state-of-the-art performance on numerous benchmark tasks. However, the use of
internet-scale, often proprietary, pretraining corpora raises a critical
concern for both practitioners and users: inflated performance due to test-set
leakage. While prior works have proposed mitigation strategies such as
decontamination of pretraining data and benchmark redesign for LLMs, the
complementary direction of developing detection methods for contaminated VLMs
remains underexplored. To address this gap, we deliberately contaminate
open-source VLMs on popular benchmarks and show that existing detection
approaches either fail outright or exhibit inconsistent behavior. We then
propose a novel simple yet effective detection method based on multi-modal
semantic perturbation, demonstrating that contaminated models fail to
generalize under controlled perturbations. Finally, we validate our approach
across multiple realistic contamination strategies, confirming its robustness
and effectiveness. The code and perturbed dataset will be released publicly.

Conclusion: 基础模型驱动的插补方法能够有效改善隐私-效用权衡，适用于多种模态的数据。

Abstract: Ensuring the privacy of sensitive training data is crucial in
privacy-preserving machine learning. However, in practical scenarios, privacy
protection may be required for only a subset of features. For instance, in ICU
data, demographic attributes like age and gender pose higher privacy risks due
to their re-identification potential, whereas raw lab results are generally
less sensitive. Traditional DP-SGD enforces privacy protection on all features
in one sample, leading to excessive noise injection and significant utility
degradation. We propose FusionDP, a two-step framework that enhances model
utility under feature-level differential privacy. First, FusionDP leverages
large foundation models to impute sensitive features given non-sensitive
features, treating them as external priors that provide high-quality estimates
of sensitive attributes without accessing the true values during model
training. Second, we introduce a modified DP-SGD algorithm that trains models
on both original and imputed features while formally preserving the privacy of
the original sensitive features. We evaluate FusionDP on two modalities: a
sepsis prediction task on tabular data from PhysioNet and a clinical note
classification task from MIMIC-III. By comparing against privacy-preserving
baselines, our results show that FusionDP significantly improves model
performance while maintaining rigorous feature-level privacy, demonstrating the
potential of foundation model-driven imputation to enhance the privacy-utility
trade-off for various modalities.

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) models complex systems by discovering mathematical
expressions that capture underlying relationships in observed data. However,
most SR methods prioritize minimizing prediction error over identifying the
governing equations, often producing overly complex or inaccurate expressions.
To address this, we present a decomposable SR method that generates
interpretable multivariate expressions leveraging transformer models, genetic
algorithms (GAs), and genetic programming (GP). In particular, our explainable
SR method distills a trained ``opaque'' regression model into mathematical
expressions that serve as explanations of its computed function. Our method
employs a Multi-Set Transformer to generate multiple univariate symbolic
skeletons that characterize how each variable influences the opaque model's
response. We then evaluate the generated skeletons' performance using a
GA-based approach to select a subset of high-quality candidates before
incrementally merging them via a GP-based cascade procedure that preserves
their original skeleton structure. The final multivariate skeletons undergo
coefficient optimization via a GA. We evaluated our method on problems with
controlled and varying degrees of noise, demonstrating lower or comparable
interpolation and extrapolation errors compared to two GP-based methods, three
neural SR methods, and a hybrid approach. Unlike them, our approach
consistently learned expressions that matched the original mathematical
structure.

Abstract: Access to trajectory data is a key requirement for developing and validating
Air Traffic Management (ATM) solutions, yet many secondary and regional
airports face severe data scarcity. This limits the applicability of machine
learning methods and the ability to perform large-scale simulations or
"what-if" analyses. In this paper, we investigate whether generative models
trained on data-rich airports can be efficiently adapted to data-scarce
airports using transfer learning. We adapt state-of-the-art diffusion- and
flow-matching-based architectures to the aviation domain and evaluate their
transferability between Zurich (source) and Dublin (target) landing trajectory
datasets. Models are pretrained on Zurich and fine-tuned on Dublin with varying
amounts of local data, ranging from 0% to 100%. Results show that
diffusion-based models achieve competitive performance with as little as 5% of
the Dublin data and reach baseline-level performance around 20%, consistently
outperforming models trained from scratch across metrics and visual
inspections. Latent flow matching and latent diffusion models also benefit from
pretraining, though with more variable gains, while flow matching models show
weaker generalization. Despite challenges in capturing rare trajectory
patterns, these findings demonstrate the potential of transfer learning to
substantially reduce data requirements for trajectory generation in ATM,
enabling realistic synthetic data generation even in environments with limited
historical records.

Abstract: This study proposes a Transformer-based longitudinal modeling method to
address challenges in clinical risk classification with heterogeneous
Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, including irregular temporal patterns,
large modality differences, and complex semantic structures. The method takes
multi-source medical features as input and employs a feature embedding layer to
achieve a unified representation of structured and unstructured data. A
learnable temporal encoding mechanism is introduced to capture dynamic
evolution under uneven sampling intervals. The core model adopts a multi-head
self-attention structure to perform global dependency modeling on longitudinal
sequences, enabling the aggregation of long-term trends and short-term
fluctuations across different temporal scales. To enhance semantic
representation, a semantic-weighted pooling module is designed to assign
adaptive importance to key medical events, improving the discriminative ability
of risk-related features. Finally, a linear mapping layer generates
individual-level risk scores. Experimental results show that the proposed model
outperforms traditional machine learning and temporal deep learning models in
accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-Score, achieving stable and precise risk
identification in multi-source heterogeneous EHR environments and providing an
efficient and reliable framework for clinical intelligent decision-making.

Abstract: The strong lottery ticket hypothesis (SLTH) conjectures that high-performing
subnetworks, called strong lottery tickets (SLTs), are hidden in randomly
initialized neural networks. Although recent theoretical studies have
established the SLTH across various neural architectures, the SLTH for
transformer architectures still lacks theoretical understanding. In particular,
the current theory of the SLTH does not yet account for the multi-head
attention (MHA) mechanism, a core component of transformers. To address this
gap, we introduce a theoretical analysis of the existence of SLTs within MHAs.
We prove that, if a randomly initialized MHA of $H$ heads and input dimension
$d$ has the hidden dimension $O(d\log(Hd^{3/2}))$ for the key and value, it
contains an SLT that approximates an arbitrary MHA with the same input
dimension with high probability. Furthermore, by leveraging this theory for
MHAs, we extend the SLTH to transformers without normalization layers. We
empirically validate our theoretical findings, demonstrating that the
approximation error between the SLT within a source model (MHA and transformer)
and an approximate target counterpart decreases exponentially by increasing the
hidden dimension of the source model.

that integrates nearest neighbor search of relevant examples in a privacy-aware
manner. Our method outperforms existing baselines by a substantial margin
across all evaluated benchmarks, achieving more favorable privacy-utility
trade-offs. To achieve this, we employ nearest neighbor retrieval from a
database of context data, combined with a privacy filter that tracks the
cumulative privacy cost of selected samples to ensure adherence to a central
differential privacy budget. Experimental results on text classification and
document question answering show a clear advantage of the proposed method over
existing baselines.

Abstract: The phenomenon of linear mode connectivity (LMC) links several aspects of
deep learning, including training stability under noisy stochastic gradients,
the smoothness and generalization of local minima (basins), the similarity and
functional diversity of sampled models, and architectural effects on data
processing. In this work, we experimentally study LMC under data shifts and
identify conditions that mitigate their impact. We interpret data shifts as an
additional source of stochastic gradient noise, which can be reduced through
small learning rates and large batch sizes. These parameters influence whether
models converge to the same local minimum or to regions of the loss landscape
with varying smoothness and generalization. Although models sampled via LMC
tend to make similar errors more frequently than those converging to different
basins, the benefit of LMC lies in balancing training efficiency against the
gains achieved from larger, more diverse ensembles. Code and supplementary
materials will be made publicly available at https://github.com/DLR-KI/LMC in

Motivation: 研究如何让智能体在无需外部奖励信号的情况下自主学习和解决任务，实现通用的智能体训练方法，为特定应用场景提供预训练基础。

Method: 将常规强化学习环境转换为目标条件环境，智能体自主选择目标进行学习，该方法独立于底层离策略学习算法，具有环境无关性。

Result: 实验表明，虽然单个目标的性能表现不稳定，但平均目标成功率得到提升并趋于稳定。训练后的智能体能够被指令寻找环境中的任何观测结果。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种通用的智能体训练范式，能够在特定使用场景之前进行通用训练，实现自主和无奖励的学习能力。

Abstract: In this paper we study how transforming regular reinforcement learning
environments into goal-conditioned environments can let agents learn to solve
tasks autonomously and reward-free. We show that an agent can learn to solve
tasks by selecting its own goals in an environment-agnostic way, at training
times comparable to externally guided reinforcement learning. Our method is
independent of the underlying off-policy learning algorithm. Since our method
is environment-agnostic, the agent does not value any goals higher than others,
leading to instability in performance for individual goals. However, in our
experiments, we show that the average goal success rate improves and
stabilizes. An agent trained with this method can be instructed to seek any
observations made in the environment, enabling generic training of agents prior
to specific use cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DQN使用回放缓冲区中的旧策略生成的状态可能无法提供有效的学习信号，导致高方差更新，特别是在采样转移与当前策略不一致时。

Method: SADQ使用随机转移模型显式建模环境动态，将后继状态分布集成到Q值估计过程中，实现更稳定和策略对齐的价值更新，并探索更高效的动作选择策略。

Result: 在标准RL基准测试和实际向量控制任务中，SADQ在稳定性和学习效率方面持续优于DQN变体。

Conclusion: SADQ通过显式建模环境动态和集成后继状态分布，在保持无偏价值估计的同时显著减少了训练方差。

Abstract: Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) estimate future returns by learning from transitions
sampled from a replay buffer. However, the target updates in DQN often rely on
next states generated by actions from past, potentially suboptimal, policy. As
a result, these states may not provide informative learning signals, causing
high variance into the update process. This issue is exacerbated when the
sampled transitions are poorly aligned with the agent's current policy. To
address this limitation, we propose the Successor-state Aggregation Deep
Q-Network (SADQ), which explicitly models environment dynamics using a
stochastic transition model. SADQ integrates successor-state distributions into
the Q-value estimation process, enabling more stable and policy-aligned value
updates. Additionally, it explores a more efficient action selection strategy
with the modeled transition structure. We provide theoretical guarantees that
SADQ maintains unbiased value estimates while reducing training variance. Our
extensive empirical results across standard RL benchmarks and real-world
vector-based control tasks demonstrate that SADQ consistently outperforms DQN
variants in both stability and learning efficiency.

TL;DR: LogHD提出了一种对数级类别轴压缩方法，将超维计算中的类别原型从C个减少到约log_k C个捆绑超向量，内存需求从O(CD)降至O(D log_k C)，同时保持维度D不变，显著提升了能效和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准超维计算采用"每类一个原型"设计，需要O(CD)内存，限制了其在内存、能耗和可靠性受限系统中的应用。现有压缩方法主要减少特征维度D，但会削弱模型鲁棒性。

Method: LogHD使用对数级类别轴压缩，用约⌈log_k C⌉个捆绑超向量替代C个类别原型，采用容量感知码本和基于配置文件的解码方法，可与特征轴稀疏化组合使用。

Result: 在多个数据集和注入比特翻转测试中，LogHD在较小模型下达到竞争性准确率，在相同内存下比特征轴压缩方法能承受2.5-3.0倍更高的比特翻转率。ASIC实现相比AMD Ryzen 9 9950X实现498倍能效提升和62.6倍加速。

Conclusion: LogHD通过类别轴压缩有效解决了超维计算的内存瓶颈问题，在保持准确率的同时显著提升了能效和鲁棒性，特别适合资源受限的边缘计算场景。

Abstract: Hyperdimensional computing (HDC) suits memory, energy, and
reliability-constrained systems, yet the standard "one prototype per class"
design requires $O(CD)$ memory (with $C$ classes and dimensionality $D$). Prior
compaction reduces $D$ (feature axis), improving storage/compute but weakening
robustness. We introduce LogHD, a logarithmic class-axis reduction that
replaces the $C$ per-class prototypes with $n\!\approx\!\lceil\log_k C\rceil$
bundle hypervectors (alphabet size $k$) and decodes in an $n$-dimensional
activation space, cutting memory to $O(D\log_k C)$ while preserving $D$. LogHD
uses a capacity-aware codebook and profile-based decoding, and composes with
feature-axis sparsification. Across datasets and injected bit flips, LogHD
attains competitive accuracy with smaller models and higher resilience at
matched memory. Under equal memory, it sustains target accuracy at roughly
$2.5$-$3.0\times$ higher bit-flip rates than feature-axis compression; an ASIC
instantiation delivers $498\times$ energy efficiency and $62.6\times$ speedup
over an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X and $24.3\times$/$6.58\times$ over an NVIDIA RTX
4090, and is $4.06\times$ more energy-efficient and $2.19\times$ faster than a
feature-axis HDC ASIC baseline.

Result: 建立了参数空间中的有限时间收敛界，并推导了非渐近泛化界，发现高斯-牛顿矩阵最小特征值较大时能获得更紧的稳定性界。

Conclusion: 识别了SGN的有利泛化机制，其中优化路径上高斯-牛顿矩阵的最小特征值越大，泛化性能越好。

Abstract: An important question in deep learning is how higher-order optimization
methods affect generalization. In this work, we analyze a stochastic
Gauss-Newton (SGN) method with Levenberg-Marquardt damping and mini-batch
sampling for training overparameterized deep neural networks with smooth
activations in a regression setting. Our theoretical contributions are twofold.
First, we establish finite-time convergence bounds via a variable-metric
analysis in parameter space, with explicit dependencies on the batch size,
network width and depth. Second, we derive non-asymptotic generalization bounds
for SGN using uniform stability in the overparameterized regime, characterizing
the impact of curvature, batch size, and overparameterization on generalization
performance. Our theoretical results identify a favorable generalization regime
for SGN in which a larger minimum eigenvalue of the Gauss-Newton matrix along
the optimization path yields tighter stability bounds.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) form the cornerstone of modern AI services,
supporting a wide range of applications, including autonomous driving,
chatbots, and recommendation systems. As models increase in size and
complexity, DNN workloads like training and inference tasks impose
unprecedented demands on distributed computing resources, making the accurate
prediction of runtime essential for optimizing development and resource
allocation. Traditional methods rely on additive computational unit models,
limiting their accuracy and generalizability. In contrast, graph-enhanced
modeling improves performance but significantly increases data collection
costs. Therefore, there is a critical need for a method that strikes a balance
between accuracy, generalizability, and the costs of data collection. To
address these challenges, we propose ScaleDL, a novel runtime prediction
framework that combines nonlinear layer-wise modeling with graph neural network
(GNN)-based cross-layer interaction mechanism, enabling accurate DNN runtime
prediction and hierarchical generalizability across different network
architectures. Additionally, we employ the D-optimal method to reduce data
collection costs. Experiments on the workloads of five popular DNN models prove
that ScaleDL enhances runtime prediction accuracy and generalizability,
achieving 6$\times$ lower MRE and 5$\times$ lower RMSE compared to baseline
models.

Abstract: Algorithmic fairness has grown rapidly as a research area, yet key concepts
remain unsettled, especially in criminal justice. We review group, individual,
and process fairness and map the conditions under which they conflict. We then
develop a simple modification to standard group fairness. Rather than exact
parity across protected groups, we minimize a weighted error loss while keeping
differences in false negative rates within a small tolerance. This makes
solutions easier to find, can raise predictive accuracy, and surfaces the
ethical choice of error costs. We situate this proposal within three classes of
critique: biased and incomplete data, latent affirmative action, and the
explosion of subgroup constraints. Finally, we offer a practical framework for
deployment in public decision systems built on three pillars: need-based
decisions, Transparency and accountability, and narrowly tailored definitions
and solutions. Together, these elements link technical design to legitimacy and
provide actionable guidance for agencies that use risk assessment and related

Conclusion: 自适应可解释性是维持数据驱动信用系统透明性、问责制和伦理可靠性的实用机制，可推广到任何决策模型随人口变化而演化的领域。

Abstract: Evolving borrower behaviors, shifting economic conditions, and changing
regulatory landscapes continuously reshape the data distributions underlying
modern credit-scoring systems. Conventional explainability techniques, such as
SHAP, assume static data and fixed background distributions, making their
explanations unstable and potentially unfair when concept drift occurs. This
study addresses that challenge by developing adaptive explanation frameworks
that recalibrate interpretability and fairness in dynamically evolving credit
models. Using a multi-year credit dataset, we integrate predictive modeling via
XGBoost with three adaptive SHAP variants: (A) per-slice explanation
reweighting that adjusts for feature distribution shifts, (B) drift-aware SHAP
rebaselining with sliding-window background samples, and (C) online surrogate
calibration using incremental Ridge regression. Each method is benchmarked
against static SHAP explanations using metrics of predictive performance (AUC,
F1), directional and rank stability (cosine, Kendall tau), and fairness
(demographic parity and recalibration). Results show that adaptive methods,
particularly rebaselined and surrogate-based explanations, substantially
improve temporal stability and reduce disparate impact across demographic
groups without degrading predictive accuracy. Robustness tests, including
counterfactual perturbations, background sensitivity analysis, and
proxy-variable detection, confirm the resilience of adaptive explanations under
real-world drift conditions. These findings establish adaptive explainability
as a practical mechanism for sustaining transparency, accountability, and
ethical reliability in data-driven credit systems, and more broadly, in any
domain where decision models evolve with population change.

Result: 轻量级架构获得45-62%训练加速和1-7%精度提升；ResNet-18精度提升2.4-4.0%，加速36-43%；ResNet-50表现高方差；ViT-B16仅6%加速。滑动窗口统计和充分冷却期是关键设计选择。

Conclusion: 自适应批量方法不能跨架构通用，需要架构感知设计。梯度稳定性指标可预测哪些架构会受益。

Abstract: Adaptive batch size methods aim to accelerate neural network training, but
existing approaches apply identical adaptation strategies across all
architectures, assuming a one-size-fits-all solution. We introduce DEBA
(Dynamic Efficient Batch Adaptation), an adaptive batch scheduler that monitors
gradient variance, gradient norm variation and loss variation to guide batch
size adaptations. Through systematic evaluation across six architectures
(ResNet-18/50, DenseNet-121, EfficientNet-B0, MobileNet-V3, ViT-B16) on
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, with five random seeds per configuration, we
demonstrate that the architecture fundamentally determines adaptation efficacy.
Our findings reveal that: (1) lightweight and medium-depth architectures
(MobileNet-V3, DenseNet-121, EfficientNet-B0) achieve a 45-62% training speedup
with simultaneous accuracy improvements of 1-7%; (2) shallow residual networks
(ResNet-18) show consistent gains of +2.4 - 4.0% in accuracy, 36 - 43% in
speedup, while deep residual networks (ResNet-50) exhibit high variance and
occasional degradation; (3) already-stable architectures (ViT-B16) show minimal
speedup (6%) despite maintaining accuracy, indicating that adaptation benefits
vary with baseline optimization characteristics. We introduce a baseline
characterization framework using gradient stability metrics (stability score,
gradient norm variation) that predicts which architectures will benefit from
adaptive scheduling. Our ablation studies reveal critical design choices often
overlooked in prior work: sliding window statistics (vs. full history) and
sufficient cooldown periods (5+ epochs) between adaptations are essential for
success. This work challenges the prevailing assumption that adaptive methods
generalize across architectures and provides the first systematic evidence that
batch size adaptation requires an architecture-aware design.

Conclusion: 该方法在高维马尔可夫模型中实现了理论和实践可行的得分变化检测，无需显式似然评估。

Abstract: We address the problem of quickest change detection in Markov processes with
unknown transition kernels. The key idea is to learn the conditional score
$\nabla_{\mathbf{y}} \log p(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x})$ directly from sample pairs
$( \mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$, where both $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ are
high-dimensional data generated by the same transition kernel. In this way, we
avoid explicit likelihood evaluation and provide a practical way to learn the
transition dynamics. Based on this estimation, we develop a score-based CUSUM
procedure that uses conditional Hyvarinen score differences to detect changes
in the kernel. To ensure bounded increments, we propose a truncated version of
the statistic. With Hoeffding's inequality for uniformly ergodic Markov
processes, we prove exponential lower bounds on the mean time to false alarm.
We also prove asymptotic upper bounds on detection delay. These results give
both theoretical guarantees and practical feasibility for score-based detection
in high-dimensional Markov models.

Abstract: Since its emergence, SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated a rapid and unpredictable
evolutionary trajectory, characterized by the continual emergence of
immune-evasive variants. This poses persistent challenges to public health and
vaccine development.
  While large-scale generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) have
revolutionized the modeling of sequential data, their direct applications to
noisy viral genomic sequences are limited. In this paper, we introduce
PETRA(Pretrained Evolutionary TRAnsformer), a novel transformer approach based

RNA sequences. This method effectively mitigates sequencing noise and captures
the hierarchical structure of viral evolution.
  With a weighted training framework to address substantial geographical and
temporal imbalances in global sequence data, PETRA excels in predicting future
SARS-CoV-2 mutations, achieving a weighted recall@1 of 9.45% for nucleotide
mutations and 17.10\% for spike amino-acid mutations, compared to 0.49% and
6.64% respectively for the best baseline. PETRA also demonstrates its ability

Abstract: Deep ensembles are a powerful tool in machine learning, improving both model
performance and uncertainty calibration. While ensembles are typically formed
by training and tuning models individually, evidence suggests that jointly

impact of jointly tuning weight decay, temperature scaling, and early stopping
on both predictive performance and uncertainty quantification. Additionally, we
propose a partially overlapping holdout strategy as a practical compromise
between enabling joint evaluation and maximizing the use of data for training.
Our results demonstrate that jointly tuning the ensemble generally matches or
improves performance, with significant variation in effect size across
different tasks and metrics. We highlight the trade-offs between individual and
joint optimization in deep ensemble training, with the overlapping holdout
strategy offering an attractive practical solution. We believe our findings

propose a novel approach, STELLE (Signal Temporal logic Embedding for
Logically-grounded Learning and Explanation), a neuro-symbolic framework that
unifies classification and explanation through direct embedding of trajectories
into a space of temporal logic concepts. By introducing a novel STL-inspired
kernel that maps raw time series to their alignment with predefined STL
formulae, our model jointly optimises accuracy and interpretability, as each
prediction is accompanied by the most relevant logical concepts that
characterise it. This yields (i) local explanations as human-readable STL
conditions justifying individual predictions, and (ii) global explanations as
class-characterising formulae. Experiments demonstrate that STELLE achieves
competitive accuracy while providing logically faithful explanations, validated
on diverse real-world benchmarks.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is essential across domains from finance to supply
chain management. This paper introduces ForecastGAN, a novel decomposition
based adversarial framework addressing limitations in existing approaches for
multi-horizon predictions. Although transformer models excel in long-term
forecasting, they often underperform in short-term scenarios and typically
ignore categorical features. ForecastGAN operates through three integrated
modules: a Decomposition Module that extracts seasonality and trend components;
a Model Selection Module that identifies optimal neural network configurations
based on forecasting horizon; and an Adversarial Training Module that enhances
prediction robustness through Conditional Generative Adversarial Network
training. Unlike conventional approaches, ForecastGAN effectively integrates
both numerical and categorical features. We validate our framework on eleven
benchmark multivariate time series datasets that span various forecasting
horizons. The results show that ForecastGAN consistently outperforms

TL;DR: 提出了两种联邦学习中的非凸-PL极小极大优化算法Fed-NSGDA-M和FedMuon-DA，用于处理重尾噪声，并建立了理论收敛保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重尾噪声在非凸随机优化中日益受到关注，因为实证研究表明它比标准有界方差假设更符合实际情况。本文旨在解决联邦学习环境下非凸-PL极小极大优化中的重尾梯度噪声问题。

Method: 提出了两种新算法：Fed-NSGDA-M（集成归一化梯度）和FedMuon-DA（利用Muon优化器进行局部更新）。两种算法都在较温和的条件下有效处理联邦极小极大优化中的重尾噪声。

Result: 理论上证明两种算法都达到了$O({1}/{(TNp)^{\frac{s-1}{2s}}})$的收敛速率。据我们所知，这是首个在重尾噪声下具有严格理论保证的联邦极小极大优化算法。大量实验进一步验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的Fed-NSGDA-M和FedMuon-DA算法成功解决了联邦学习中非凸-PL极小极大优化在重尾噪声下的挑战，并提供了理论收敛保证。

Abstract: Heavy-tailed noise has attracted growing attention in nonconvex stochastic
optimization, as numerous empirical studies suggest it offers a more realistic
assumption than standard bounded variance assumption. In this work, we
investigate nonconvex-PL minimax optimization under heavy-tailed gradient noise
in federated learning. We propose two novel algorithms: Fed-NSGDA-M, which
integrates normalized gradients, and FedMuon-DA, which leverages the Muon
optimizer for local updates. Both algorithms are designed to effectively
address heavy-tailed noise in federated minimax optimization, under a milder
condition. We theoretically establish that both algorithms achieve a
convergence rate of $O({1}/{(TNp)^{\frac{s-1}{2s}}})$. To the best of our
knowledge, these are the first federated minimax optimization algorithms with
rigorous theoretical guarantees under heavy-tailed noise. Extensive experiments
further validate their effectiveness.

Conclusion: TNCM-VAE能够生成尊重底层因果机制的可信反事实市场轨迹，支持金融压力测试、情景分析和增强回测。

Abstract: Market generators using deep generative models have shown promise for
synthetic financial data generation, but existing approaches lack causal
reasoning capabilities essential for counterfactual analysis and risk
assessment. We propose a Time-series Neural Causal Model VAE (TNCM-VAE) that
combines variational autoencoders with structural causal models to generate
counterfactual financial time series while preserving both temporal
dependencies and causal relationships. Our approach enforces causal constraints
through directed acyclic graphs in the decoder architecture and employs the
causal Wasserstein distance for training. We validate our method on synthetic
autoregressive models inspired by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, demonstrating
superior performance in counterfactual probability estimation with L1 distances
as low as 0.03-0.10 compared to ground truth. The model enables financial
stress testing, scenario analysis, and enhanced backtesting by generating
plausible counterfactual market trajectories that respect underlying causal
mechanisms.

Motivation: 传统神经网络压缩方法通常在权重空间中寻找低秩近似，但这种方法忽略了数据分布的影响。作者希望开发一种数据感知的压缩方法，直接最小化函数空间中的误差，提高压缩效果并减少对微调的依赖。

Method: 提出新的交替最小二乘算法，针对Tucker-2和CPD张量分解，直接优化基于数据协方差矩阵调整的Frobenius范数：‖(W-Ŵ)Σ¹ᐟ²‖F，其中Σ¹ᐟ²是层输入协方差矩阵的平方根。

Result: 在多个CNN架构（ResNet-18/50、GoogLeNet）和数据集（ImageNet、FGVC-Aircraft、Cifar10、Cifar100）上的实验表明，该方法无需微调即可达到竞争性精度，且协方差范数可在不同数据集间迁移。

Conclusion: 数据感知的压缩方法比传统权重空间方法更有效，能够在不依赖原始训练数据的情况下实现高质量压缩，为神经网络部署提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural networks are widely used for image-related tasks but typically demand
considerable computing power. Once a network has been trained, however, its
memory- and compute-footprint can be reduced by compression. In this work, we
focus on compression through tensorization and low-rank representations.
Whereas classical approaches search for a low-rank approximation by minimizing
an isotropic norm such as the Frobenius norm in weight-space, we use
data-informed norms that measure the error in function space. Concretely, we
minimize the change in the layer's output distribution, which can be expressed
as $\lVert (W - \widetilde{W}) \Sigma^{1/2}\rVert_F$ where $\Sigma^{1/2}$ is
the square root of the covariance matrix of the layer's input and $W$,
$\widetilde{W}$ are the original and compressed weights. We propose new
alternating least square algorithms for the two most common tensor
decompositions (Tucker-2 and CPD) that directly optimize the new norm. Unlike
conventional compression pipelines, which almost always require
post-compression fine-tuning, our data-informed approach often achieves
competitive accuracy without any fine-tuning. We further show that the same
covariance-based norm can be transferred from one dataset to another with only
a minor accuracy drop, enabling compression even when the original training
dataset is unavailable. Experiments on several CNN architectures (ResNet-18/50,
and GoogLeNet) and datasets (ImageNet, FGVC-Aircraft, Cifar10, and Cifar100)
confirm the advantages of the proposed method.

Abstract: Reduced-order models (ROMs) can efficiently simulate high-dimensional
physical systems, but lack robust uncertainty quantification methods. Existing
approaches are frequently architecture- or training-specific, which limits
flexibility and generalization. We introduce a post hoc, model-agnostic
framework for predictive uncertainty quantification in latent space ROMs that
requires no modification to the underlying architecture or training procedure.
Using conformal prediction, our approach estimates statistical prediction
intervals for multiple components of the ROM pipeline: latent dynamics,
reconstruction, and end-to-end predictions. We demonstrate the method on a
latent space dynamical model for cloud microphysics, where it accurately
predicts the evolution of droplet-size distributions and quantifies uncertainty
across the ROM pipeline.

Conclusion: RGP通过有效整合时空上下文和支持多任务学习，为复杂关系数据建模提供了强大框架。

Abstract: In domains such as healthcare, finance, and e-commerce, the temporal dynamics
of relational data emerge from complex interactions-such as those between
patients and providers, or users and products across diverse categories. To be
broadly useful, models operating on these data must integrate long-range
spatial and temporal dependencies across diverse types of entities, while also
supporting multiple predictive tasks. However, existing graph models for
relational data primarily focus on spatial structure, treating temporal
information merely as a filtering constraint to exclude future events rather
than a modeling signal, and are typically designed for single-task prediction.
To address these gaps, we introduce a temporal subgraph sampler that enhances
global context by retrieving nodes beyond the immediate neighborhood to capture
temporally relevant relationships. In addition, we propose the Relational Graph
Perceiver (RGP), a graph transformer architecture for relational deep learning
that leverages a cross-attention-based latent bottleneck to efficiently
integrate information from both structural and temporal contexts. This latent
bottleneck integrates signals from different node and edge types into a common
latent space, enabling the model to build global context across the entire
relational system. RGP also incorporates a flexible cross-attention decoder
that supports joint learning across tasks with disjoint label spaces within a
single model. Experiments on RelBench, SALT, and CTU show that RGP delivers
state-of-the-art performance, offering a general and scalable solution for
relational deep learning with support for diverse predictive tasks.

Conclusion: 通过恢复具有物理一致性的完整三维动力学，为极端降水的熟练可靠临近预报提供了可扩展且稳健的途径。

Abstract: Extreme precipitation nowcasting demands high spatiotemporal fidelity and
extended lead times, yet existing approaches remain limited. Numerical Weather
Prediction (NWP) and its deep-learning emulations are too slow and coarse for
rapidly evolving convection, while extrapolation and purely data-driven models
suffer from error accumulation and excessive smoothing. Hybrid 2D radar-based
methods discard crucial vertical information, preventing accurate
reconstruction of height-dependent dynamics. We introduce a gray-box, fully
three-dimensional nowcasting framework that directly processes volumetric radar
reflectivity and couples physically constrained neural operators with
datadriven learning. The model learns vertically varying 3D advection fields
under a conservative advection operator, parameterizes spatially varying
diffusion, and introduces a Brownian-motion--inspired stochastic term to
represent unresolved motions. A residual branch captures small-scale convective
initiation and microphysical variability, while a diffusion-based stochastic
module estimates uncertainty. The framework achieves more accurate forecasts up
to three-hour lead time across precipitation regimes and ranked first in 57\%
of cases in a blind evaluation by 160 meteorologists. By restoring full 3D
dynamics with physical consistency, it offers a scalable and robust pathway for
skillful and reliable nowcasting of extreme precipitation.

Conclusion: 提出的框架为部分可观测动态系统提供了有效的贝叶斯实验设计解决方案，能够处理非线性状态空间模型中的计算挑战。

Abstract: Bayesian experimental design (BED) provides a principled framework for
optimizing data collection, but existing approaches do not apply to crucial
real-world settings such as dynamical systems with partial observability, where
only noisy and incomplete observations are available. These systems are
naturally modeled as state-space models (SSMs), where latent states mediate the
link between parameters and data, making the likelihood -- and thus
information-theoretic objectives like the expected information gain (EIG) --
intractable. In addition, the dynamical nature of the system requires online
algorithms that update posterior distributions and select designs sequentially
in a computationally efficient manner. We address these challenges by deriving
new estimators of the EIG and its gradient that explicitly marginalize latent
states, enabling scalable stochastic optimization in nonlinear SSMs. Our
approach leverages nested particle filters (NPFs) for efficient online
inference with convergence guarantees. Applications to realistic models, such
as the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) and a moving source location task,
show that our framework successfully handles both partial observability and
online computation.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks learn on graph-structured data by iteratively
aggregating local neighborhood information. While this local message passing
paradigm imparts a powerful inductive bias and exploits graph sparsity, it also
yields three key challenges: (i) oversquashing of long-range information, (ii)
oversmoothing of node representations, and (iii) limited expressive power. In
this work we inject randomized global embeddings of node features, which we
term \textit{Sketched Random Features}, into standard GNNs, enabling them to
efficiently capture long-range dependencies. The embeddings are unique,
distance-sensitive, and topology-agnostic -- properties which we analytically
and empirically show alleviate the aforementioned limitations when injected
into GNNs. Experimental results on real-world graph learning tasks confirm that
this strategy consistently improves performance over baseline GNNs, offering
both a standalone solution and a complementary enhancement to existing
techniques such as graph positional encodings. Our source code is available at

Abstract: Social and collaborative platforms emit multivariate time-series traces in
which early interactions-such as views, likes, or downloads-are followed,
sometimes months or years later, by higher impact like citations, sales, or
reviews. We formalize this setting as Lead-Lag Forecasting (LLF): given an
early usage channel (the lead), predict a correlated but temporally shifted
outcome channel (the lag). Despite the ubiquity of such patterns, LLF has not
been treated as a unified forecasting problem within the time-series community,
largely due to the absence of standardized datasets. To anchor research in LLF,
here we present two high-volume benchmark datasets-arXiv (accesses -> citations
of 2.3M papers) and GitHub (pushes/stars -> forks of 3M repositories)-and
outline additional domains with analogous lead-lag dynamics, including
Wikipedia (page views -> edits), Spotify (streams -> concert attendance),
e-commerce (click-throughs -> purchases), and LinkedIn profile (views ->
messages). Our datasets provide ideal testbeds for lead-lag forecasting, by
capturing long-horizon dynamics across years, spanning the full spectrum of
outcomes, and avoiding survivorship bias in sampling. We documented all
technical details of data curation and cleaning, verified the presence of
lead-lag dynamics through statistical and classification tests, and benchmarked
parametric and non-parametric baselines for regression. Our study establishes
LLF as a novel forecasting paradigm and lays an empirical foundation for its
systematic exploration in social and usage data. Our data portal with downloads

Abstract: The need to remove specific student data from cognitive diagnosis (CD) models
has become a pressing requirement, driven by users' growing assertion of their
"right to be forgotten". However, existing CD models are largely designed
without privacy considerations and lack effective data unlearning mechanisms.
Directly applying general purpose unlearning algorithms is suboptimal, as they
struggle to balance unlearning completeness, model utility, and efficiency when
confronted with the unique heterogeneous structure of CD models. To address
this, our paper presents the first systematic study of the data unlearning
problem for CD models, proposing a novel and efficient algorithm: hierarchical
importanceguided forgetting (HIF). Our key insight is that parameter importance
in CD models exhibits distinct layer wise characteristics. HIF leverages this
via an innovative smoothing mechanism that combines individual and layer, level
importance, enabling a more precise distinction of parameters associated with
the data to be unlearned. Experiments on three real world datasets show that
HIF significantly outperforms baselines on key metrics, offering the first
effective solution for CD models to respond to user data removal requests and

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) offers new opportunities in machine learning,
particularly in addressing data privacy concerns. In contrast to conventional
event-based federated learning, time-triggered federated learning (TT-Fed), as
a general form of both asynchronous and synchronous FL, clusters users into
different tiers based on fixed time intervals. However, the FL network consists
of a growing number of user devices with limited wireless bandwidth,
consequently magnifying issues such as stragglers and communication overhead.
In this paper, we introduce adaptive model pruning to wireless TT-Fed systems
and study the problem of jointly optimizing the pruning ratio and bandwidth
allocation to minimize the training loss while ensuring minimal learning
latency. To answer this question, we perform convergence analysis on the
gradient l_2 norm of the TT-Fed model based on model pruning. Based on the
obtained convergence upper bound, a joint optimization problem of pruning ratio
and wireless bandwidth is formulated to minimize the model training loss under
a given delay threshold. Then, we derive closed-form solutions for wireless
bandwidth and pruning ratio using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker(KKT) conditions. The
simulation results show that model pruning could reduce the communication cost
by 40% while maintaining the model performance at the same level.

Abstract: We introduce a density-power weighted variant for the Stein operator, called
the $\gamma$-Stein operator. This is a novel class of operators derived from
the $\gamma$-divergence, designed to build robust inference methods for
unnormalized probability models. The operator's construction (weighting by the
model density raised to a positive power $\gamma$ inherently down-weights the
influence of outliers, providing a principled mechanism for robustness.
Applying this operator yields a robust generalization of score matching that
retains the crucial property of being independent of the model's normalizing
constant. We extend this framework to develop two key applications: the
$\gamma$-kernelized Stein discrepancy for robust goodness-of-fit testing, and
$\gamma$-Stein variational gradient descent for robust Bayesian posterior
approximation. Empirical results on contaminated Gaussian and quartic potential
models show our methods significantly outperform standard baselines in both
robustness and statistical efficiency.

Abstract: Leveraging data symmetries has been a key driver of performance gains in
geometric deep learning and geometric and equivariant quantum machine learning.
While symmetrization appears to be a promising method, its practical overhead,
such as additional gates, reduced expressibility, and other factors, is not
well understood in quantum machine learning. In this work, we develop an
automated pipeline to measure various characteristics of quantum machine
learning ansatzes with respect to symmetries that can appear in the learning
task. We define the degree of symmetry in the learning problem as the size of
the subgroup it admits. Subgroups define partial symmetries, which have not
been extensively studied in previous research, which has focused on symmetries
defined by whole groups. Symmetrizing the 19 common ansatzes with respect to
these varying-sized subgroup representations, we compute three classes of
metrics that describe how the common ansatz structures behave under varying
amounts of symmetries. The first metric is based on the norm of the difference
between the original and symmetrized generators, while the second metric counts
depth, size, and other characteristics from the symmetrized circuits. The third
class of metrics includes expressibility and entangling capability. The results
demonstrate varying gate overhead across the studied ansatzes and confirm that
increased symmetry reduces expressibility of the circuits. In most cases,
increased symmetry increases entanglement capability. These results help select
sufficiently expressible and computationally efficient ansatze patterns for
geometric quantum machine learning applications.

Abstract: Conformal prediction has emerged as a powerful framework for constructing
distribution-free prediction sets with guaranteed coverage assuming only the
exchangeability assumption. However, this assumption is often violated in
online environments where data distributions evolve over time. Several recent
approaches have been proposed to address this limitation, but, typically, they
slowly adapt to distribution shifts because they update predictions only in a
forward manner, that is, they generate a prediction for a newly observed data
point while previously computed predictions are not updated. In this paper, we
propose a novel online conformal inference method with retrospective
adjustment, which is designed to achieve faster adaptation to distributional
shifts. Our method leverages regression approaches with efficient leave-one-out
update formulas to retroactively adjust past predictions when new data arrive,
thereby aligning the entire set of predictions with the most recent data
distribution. Through extensive numerical studies performed on both synthetic
and real-world data sets, we show that the proposed approach achieves faster
coverage recalibration and improved statistical efficiency compared to existing
online conformal prediction methods.

Abstract: Causal structure learning has long been the central task of inferring causal
insights from data. Despite the abundance of real-world processes exhibiting
higher-order mechanisms, however, an explicit treatment of interactions in
causal discovery has received little attention. In this work, we focus on
extending the causal additive model (CAM) to additive models with higher-order
interactions. This second level of modularity we introduce to the structure
learning problem is most easily represented by a directed acyclic hypergraph
which extends the DAG. We introduce the necessary definitions and theoretical
tools to handle the novel structure we introduce and then provide
identifiability results for the hyper DAG, extending the typical Markov
equivalence classes. We next provide insights into why learning the more
complex hypergraph structure may actually lead to better empirical results. In
particular, more restrictive assumptions like CAM correspond to easier-to-learn
hyper DAGs and better finite sample complexity. We finally develop an extension
of the greedy CAM algorithm which can handle the more complex hyper DAG search
space and demonstrate its empirical usefulness in synthetic experiments.

TL;DR: Decomposition-based方法压缩超维计算(HDC)模型，通过层间乘法绑定和最终捆绑操作，在保持纯HDC推理的同时实现极端内存节省和能效提升


<details>

Motivation: 传统HDC压缩方法会缩小特征维度并损害模型集中性和鲁棒性，需要一种新的分解方法在压缩的同时保持HDC的固有优势

Method: 提出DecoHD方法，直接在分解的HDC参数化中学习：使用少量共享的每层通道，通过层间乘法绑定和最终捆绑操作，从紧凑因子生成大表示空间

Result: 在严格部署预算下仅轻微精度损失(平均0.1-0.15%，最差5.7%)，对随机比特翻转噪声更鲁棒，训练参数减少高达97%，硬件上相比CPU/GPU/ASIC分别实现277x/35x、13.5x/3.7x、2.0x/2.4x的能效/速度提升

Conclusion: DecoHD证明了在HDC中通过分解实现极端压缩的可行性，同时保持模型性能和鲁棒性，为内存受限环境下的高效部署提供了解决方案

Abstract: Decomposition is a proven way to shrink deep networks without changing I/O.
We bring this idea to hyperdimensional computing (HDC), where footprint cuts
usually shrink the feature axis and erode concentration and robustness. Prior
HDC decompositions decode via fixed atomic hypervectors, which are ill-suited
for compressing learned class prototypes. We introduce DecoHD, which learns
directly in a decomposed HDC parameterization: a small, shared set of per-layer
channels with multiplicative binding across layers and bundling at the end,
yielding a large representational space from compact factors. DecoHD compresses
along the class axis via a lightweight bundling head while preserving native
bind-bundle-score; training is end-to-end, and inference remains pure HDC,
aligning with in/near-memory accelerators. In evaluation, DecoHD attains
extreme memory savings with only minor accuracy degradation under tight
deployment budgets. On average it stays within about 0.1-0.15% of a strong
non-reduced HDC baseline (worst case 5.7%), is more robust to random bit-flip
noise, reaches its accuracy plateau with up to ~97% fewer trainable parameters,
and -- in hardware -- delivers roughly 277x/35x energy/speed gains over a CPU
(AMD Ryzen 9 9950X), 13.5x/3.7x over a GPU (NVIDIA RTX 4090), and 2.0x/2.4x

Abstract: Filtered Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search retrieves the closest
vectors for a query vector from a dataset. It enforces that a specified set of
discrete labels $S$ for the query must be included in the labels of each
retrieved vector. Existing graph-based methods typically incorporate filter
awareness by assigning fixed penalties or prioritizing nodes based on filter
satisfaction. However, since these methods use fixed, data in- dependent
penalties, they often fail to generalize across datasets with diverse label and
vector distributions. In this work, we propose a principled alternative that
learns the optimal trade-off between vector distance and filter match directly
from the data, rather than relying on fixed penalties. We formulate this as a
constrained linear optimization problem, deriving weights that better reflect
the underlying filter distribution and more effectively address the filtered
ANN search problem. These learned weights guide both the search process and
index construction, leading to graph structures that more effectively capture
the underlying filter distribution and filter semantics. Our experiments
demonstrate that adapting the distance function to the data significantly im-
proves accuracy by 5-10% over fixed-penalty methods, providing a more flexible
and generalizable framework for the filtered ANN search problem.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of graph-structured data in critical domains,
unsupervised graph-level anomaly detection (UGAD) has become a pivotal task.
UGAD seeks to identify entire graphs that deviate from normal behavioral
patterns. However, most Graph Neural Network (GNN) approaches implicitly assume
that the training set is clean, containing only normal graphs, which is rarely
true in practice. Even modest contamination by anomalous graphs can distort
learned representations and sharply degrade performance. To address this
challenge, we propose DeNoise, a robust UGAD framework explicitly designed for
contaminated training data. It jointly optimizes a graph-level encoder, an
attribute decoder, and a structure decoder via an adversarial objective to
learn noise-resistant embeddings. Further, DeNoise introduces an encoder
anchor-alignment denoising mechanism that fuses high-information node
embeddings from normal graphs into all graph embeddings, improving
representation quality while suppressing anomaly interference. A contrastive
learning component then compacts normal graph embeddings and repels anomalous
ones in the latent space. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets
demonstrate that DeNoise consistently learns reliable graph-level
representations under varying noise intensities and significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art UGAD baselines.

large language models, namely using the chatGPT Application Programming
Interface. This R package integrates all steps of the data extraction and
validation process, from Optical Character Recognition to detection of outliers
and output in tabular format. Furthermore, we validate ARETE through systematic
comparison between what is modelled and the work of human annotators. 3. We
demonstrate the usefulness of the approach by comparing range maps produced
using GBIF data and with those automatically extracted for 100 species of
spiders. Newly extracted data allowed to expand the known Extent of Occurrence
by a mean three orders of magnitude, revealing new areas where the species were
found in the past, which mayhave important implications for spatial
conservation planning and extinction risk assessments. 4. ARETE allows faster

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) are central to applications such as swarm robotics
and traffic routing, where agents must coordinate in a decentralized manner to
achieve a common objective. Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problems provide a
natural framework for modeling decentralized control in such settings. While
the problem of learning in SSP has been extensively studied in single-agent
settings, the decentralized multi-agent variant remains largely unexplored. In
this work, we take a step towards addressing that gap. We study decentralized
multi-agent SSPs (Dec-MASSPs) under linear function approximation, where the
transition dynamics and costs are represented using linear models. Applying
novel symmetry-based arguments, we identify the structure of optimal policies.
Our main contribution is the first regret lower bound for this setting based on
the construction of hard-to-learn instances for any number of agents, $n$. Our
regret lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{K})$, over $K$ episodes, highlights the
inherent learning difficulty in Dec-MASSPs. These insights clarify the learning
complexity of decentralized control and can further guide the design of
efficient learning algorithms in multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Modern power systems with high penetration of inverter-based resources
exhibit complex dynamic behaviors that challenge the scalability and
generalizability of traditional stability assessment methods. This paper
presents a dynamic recurrent adjacency memory network (DRAMN) that combines
physics-informed analysis with deep learning for real-time power system
stability forecasting. The framework employs sliding-window dynamic mode
decomposition to construct time-varying, multi-layer adjacency matrices from
phasor measurement unit and sensor data to capture system dynamics such as
modal participation factors, coupling strengths, phase relationships, and
spectral energy distributions. As opposed to processing spatial and temporal
dependencies separately, DRAMN integrates graph convolution operations directly
within recurrent gating mechanisms, enabling simultaneous modeling of evolving
dynamics and temporal dependencies. Extensive validations on modified IEEE
9-bus, 39-bus, and a multi-terminal HVDC network demonstrate high performance,
achieving 99.85\%, 99.90\%, and 99.69\% average accuracies, respectively,
surpassing all tested benchmarks, including classical machine learning
algorithms and recent graph-based models. The framework identifies optimal
combinations of measurements that reduce feature dimensionality by 82\% without
performance degradation. Correlation analysis between dominant measurements for
small-signal and transient stability events validates generalizability across
different stability phenomena. DRAMN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while
providing enhanced interpretability for power system operators, making it
suitable for real-time deployment in modern control centers.

which encourage smoothness of the corresponding velocities. We present a

Abstract: Inferring sociodemographic attributes from mobility data could help
transportation planners better leverage passively collected datasets, but this
task remains difficult due to weak and inconsistent relationships between
mobility patterns and sociodemographic traits, as well as limited
generalization across contexts. We address these challenges from three angles.
First, to improve predictive accuracy while retaining interpretability, we
introduce a behaviorally grounded set of higher-order mobility descriptors
based on directed mobility graphs. These features capture structured patterns
in trip sequences, travel modes, and social co-travel, and significantly
improve prediction of age, gender, income, and household structure over
baselines features. Second, we introduce metrics and visual diagnostic tools
that encourage evenness between model confidence and accuracy, enabling
planners to quantify uncertainty. Third, to improve generalization and sample
efficiency, we develop a multitask learning framework that jointly predicts
multiple sociodemographic attributes from a shared representation. This
approach outperforms single-task models, particularly when training data are
limited or when applying models across different time periods (i.e., when the
test set distribution differs from the training set).

Abstract: Network anomaly detection systems encounter several challenges with
traditional detectors trained offline. They become susceptible to concept drift
and new threats such as zero-day or polymorphic attacks. To address this
limitation, we propose a Ca$^{2+}$-modulated learning framework that draws
inspiration from astrocytic Ca$^{2+}$ signaling in the brain, where rapid,
context-sensitive adaptation enables robust information processing. Our
approach couples a multicellular astrocyte dynamics simulator with a deep
neural network (DNN). The simulator models astrocytic Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics
through three key mechanisms: IP$_3$-mediated Ca$^{2+}$ release, SERCA pump
uptake, and conductance-aware diffusion through gap junctions between cells.
Evaluation of our proposed network on CTU-13 (Neris) network traffic data
demonstrates the effectiveness of our biologically plausible approach. The
Ca$^{2+}$-gated model outperforms a matched baseline DNN, achieving up to
$\sim$98\% accuracy with reduced false positives and negatives across multiple
train/test splits. Importantly, this improved performance comes with negligible
runtime overhead once Ca$^{2+}$ trajectories are precomputed. While
demonstrated here for cybersecurity applications, this Ca$^{2+}$-modulated
learning framework offers a generic solution for streaming detection tasks that
require rapid, biologically grounded adaptation to evolving data patterns.

Abstract: A formal link between regression and classification has been tenuous. Even
though the margin maximization term $\|w\|$ is used in support vector
regression, it has at best been justified as a regularizer. We show that a
regression problem with $M$ samples lying on a hyperplane has a one-to-one
equivalence with a linearly separable classification task with $2M$ samples. We
show that margin maximization on the equivalent classification task leads to a
different regression formulation than traditionally used. Using the
equivalence, we demonstrate a ``regressability'' measure, that can be used to
estimate the difficulty of regressing a dataset, without needing to first learn
a model for it. We use the equivalence to train neural networks to learn a
linearizing map, that transforms input variables into a space where a linear
regressor is adequate.

all numerical experiments, we assume observability of only a few realistically

Koopman eNMPC, which generates small economic savings but frequently violates

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个结合Vision Transformer、ConvLSTM和GeoStaNet的集成降尺度框架，用于北欧地区高分辨率温度预测，在SSP5-8.5情景下预测到2100年Dfc和Dfb气候区将分别升温4.8°C和3.9°C。


<details>

Motivation: 北欧地区气候变化迅速且变异性增加，区域规划需要高分辨率温度预测来支持适应措施。

Method: 集成降尺度框架结合Vision Transformer、ConvLSTM和GeoStaNet模型，使用DL-TOPSIS多准则决策系统评估，基于NorESM2-LM CMIP6输出进行偏差校正。

Result: ViT表现最佳（RMSE：1.01°C；R²：0.92），Dfc和Dfb气候区到2100年分别升温4.8°C和3.9°C，昼夜温度范围扩大超过1.5°C，亚北极冬季最早出现信号（约2032年）。

Conclusion: 该框架为高纬度快速环境变化地区提供了基于站点的高分辨率不确定性和极端值估计，对适应政策具有直接应用价值。

Abstract: Rapid changes and increasing climatic variability across the widely varied
Koppen-Geiger regions of northern Europe generate significant needs for
adaptation. Regional planning needs high-resolution projected temperatures.
This work presents an integrative downscaling framework that incorporates
Vision Transformer (ViT), Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM), and
Geospatial Spatiotemporal Transformer with Attention and Imbalance-Aware
Network (GeoStaNet) models. The framework is evaluated with a multicriteria
decision system, Deep Learning-TOPSIS (DL-TOPSIS), for ten strategically chosen
meteorological stations encompassing the temperate oceanic (Cfb), subpolar
oceanic (Cfc), warm-summer continental (Dfb), and subarctic (Dfc) climate
regions. Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM2-LM) Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) outputs were bias-corrected during the
1951-2014 period and subsequently validated against earlier observations of
day-to-day temperature metrics and diurnal range statistics. The ViT showed
improved performance (Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 1.01 degrees C; R^2:
0.92), allowing for production of credible downscaled projections. Under the
SSP5-8.5 scenario, the Dfc and Dfb climate zones are projected to warm by 4.8
degrees C and 3.9 degrees C, respectively, by 2100, with expansion in the
diurnal temperature range by more than 1.5 degrees C. The Time of Emergence
signal first appears in subarctic winter seasons (Dfc: approximately 2032),
signifying an urgent need for adaptation measures. The presented framework
offers station-based, high-resolution estimates of uncertainties and extremes,
with direct uses for adaptation policy over high-latitude regions with fast
environmental change.

TL;DR: 本文为带Polyak动量的随机梯度下降(SGD-M)和自适应步长建立了高维缩放极限，提供了一个严格比较在线SGD及其变体的框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是提供一个严格的框架来比较在线SGD及其流行变体（如SGD-M和自适应步长SGD）的性能，特别是在高维设置下理解这些算法的动态行为。

Method: 开发了SGD-M和自适应步长的高维缩放极限理论框架，通过时间重缩放和特定步长选择来分析算法动态。在尖峰张量PCA和单指标模型两个学习问题上进行了验证。

Result: 发现SGD-M在适当时间重缩放和特定步长下与在线SGD有相同缩放极限，但若步长相同，SGD-M会放大高维效应。自适应步长SGD在高维情况下具有多个优势：动态允许更接近总体最小值的固定点，并扩大收敛步长范围。

Conclusion: 为早期预处理器如何稳定和改进在线SGD失败场景下的动态提供了严格解释，与实证动机一致。

Abstract: We develop a high-dimensional scaling limit for Stochastic Gradient Descent
with Polyak Momentum (SGD-M) and adaptive step-sizes. This provides a framework
to rigourously compare online SGD with some of its popular variants. We show
that the scaling limits of SGD-M coincide with those of online SGD after an
appropriate time rescaling and a specific choice of step-size. However, if the
step-size is kept the same between the two algorithms, SGD-M will amplify
high-dimensional effects, potentially degrading performance relative to online
SGD. We demonstrate our framework on two popular learning problems: Spiked
Tensor PCA and Single Index Models. In both cases, we also examine online SGD
with an adaptive step-size based on normalized gradients. In the
high-dimensional regime, this algorithm yields multiple benefits: its dynamics
admit fixed points closer to the population minimum and widens the range of
admissible step-sizes for which the iterates converge to such solutions. These
examples provide a rigorous account, aligning with empirical motivation, of how
early preconditioners can stabilize and improve dynamics in settings where
online SGD fails.

Abstract: This study presents a federated learning (FL) framework for
privacy-preserving electrocardiogram (ECG) classification in Internet of Things
(IoT) healthcare environments. By transforming 1D ECG signals into 2D Gramian
Angular Field (GAF) images, the proposed approach enables efficient feature
extraction through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) while ensuring that
sensitive medical data remain local to each device. This work is among the
first to experimentally validate GAF-based federated ECG classification across
heterogeneous IoT devices, quantifying both performance and communication
efficiency. To evaluate feasibility in realistic IoT settings, we deployed the
framework across a server, a laptop, and a resource-constrained Raspberry Pi 4,
reflecting edge-cloud integration in IoT ecosystems. Experimental results
demonstrate that the FL-GAF model achieves a high classification accuracy of
95.18% in a multi-client setup, significantly outperforming a single-client
baseline in both accuracy and training time. Despite the added computational
complexity of GAF transformations, the framework maintains efficient resource
utilization and communication overhead. These findings highlight the potential

Abstract: Multimodal protein features play a crucial role in protein function
prediction. However, these features encompass a wide range of information,
ranging from structural data and sequence features to protein attributes and
interaction networks, making it challenging to decipher their complex
interconnections. In this work, we propose a multimodal protein function
prediction method (DSRPGO) by utilizing dynamic selection and reconstructive
pre-training mechanisms. To acquire complex protein information, we introduce
reconstructive pre-training to mine more fine-grained information with low
semantic levels. Moreover, we put forward the Bidirectional Interaction Module
(BInM) to facilitate interactive learning among multimodal features.
Additionally, to address the difficulty of hierarchical multi-label
classification in this task, a Dynamic Selection Module (DSM) is designed to
select the feature representation that is most conducive to current protein
function prediction. Our proposed DSRPGO model improves significantly in BPO,
MFO, and CCO on human datasets, thereby outperforming other benchmark models.

Abstract: Dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) are increasingly used in healthcare due to
their ability to model complex temporal relationships in patient data while
maintaining interpretability, an essential feature for clinical
decision-making. However, existing approaches to handling missing data in
longitudinal clinical datasets are largely derived from static Bayesian
networks literature, failing to properly account for the temporal nature of the
data. This gap limits the ability to quantify uncertainty over time, which is
particularly critical in settings such as intensive care, where understanding
the temporal dynamics is fundamental for model trustworthiness and
applicability across diverse patient groups. Despite the potential of DBNs, a
full Bayesian framework that integrates missing data handling remains
underdeveloped. In this work, we propose a novel Gibbs sampling-based method
for learning DBNs from incomplete data. Our method treats each missing value as
an unknown parameter following a Gaussian distribution. At each iteration, the
unobserved values are sampled from their full conditional distributions,
allowing for principled imputation and uncertainty estimation. We evaluate our
method on both simulated datasets and real-world intensive care data from
critically ill patients. Compared to standard model-agnostic techniques such as
MICE, our Bayesian approach demonstrates superior reconstruction accuracy and
convergence properties. These results highlight the clinical relevance of
incorporating full Bayesian inference in temporal models, providing more
reliable imputations and offering deeper insight into model behavior. Our
approach supports safer and more informed clinical decision-making,
particularly in settings where missing data are frequent and potentially
impactful.

Abstract: The classification of diabetes and prediabetes by static glucose thresholds
obscures the pathophysiological dysglycemia heterogeneity, primarily driven by
insulin resistance (IR), beta-cell dysfunction, and incretin deficiency. This
review demonstrates that continuous glucose monitoring and wearable
technologies enable a paradigm shift towards non-invasive, dynamic metabolic
phenotyping. We show evidence that machine learning models can leverage
high-resolution glucose data from at-home, CGM-enabled oral glucose tolerance
tests to accurately predict gold-standard measures of muscle IR and beta-cell
function. This personalized characterization extends to real-world nutrition,
where an individual's unique postprandial glycemic response (PPGR) to
standardized meals, such as the relative glucose spike to potatoes versus
grapes, could serve as a biomarker for their metabolic subtype. Moreover,
integrating wearable data reveals that habitual diet, sleep, and physical
activity patterns, particularly their timing, are uniquely associated with
specific metabolic dysfunctions, informing precision lifestyle interventions.
The efficacy of dietary mitigators in attenuating PPGR is also shown to be
phenotype-dependent. Collectively, this evidence demonstrates that CGM can
deconstruct the complexity of early dysglycemia into distinct, actionable
subphenotypes. This approach moves beyond simple glycemic control, paving the
way for targeted nutritional, behavioral, and pharmacological strategies
tailored to an individual's core metabolic defects, thereby paving the way for
a new era of precision diabetes prevention.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the left atrium (LA) from cardiac MRI is critical

Abstract: This study evaluates a 40-item mathematics placement examination administered

reveals that 55\% of items achieve excellent discrimination ($D \geq 0.40$)
while 30\% demonstrate poor discrimination ($D < 0.20$) requiring replacement.
Question 6 (Graph Interpretation) emerges as the examination's most powerful
discriminator, achieving perfect discrimination ($D = 1.000$), highest ANOVA
F-statistic ($F = 4609.1$), and maximum Random Forest feature importance
(0.206), accounting for 20.6\% of predictive power. Machine learning algorithms
demonstrate exceptional performance, with Random Forest and Gradient Boosting
achieving 97.5\% and 96.0\% cross-validation accuracy. K-means clustering
identifies a natural binary competency structure with a boundary at 42.5\%,
diverging from the institutional threshold of 55\% and suggesting potential
overclassification into remedial categories. The two-cluster solution exhibits
exceptional stability (bootstrap ARI = 0.855) with perfect lower-cluster
purity. Convergent evidence across methods supports specific refinements:
replace poorly discriminating items, implement a two-stage assessment, and
integrate Random Forest predictions with transparency mechanisms. These

Conclusion: BF-KLE-AL框架能够有效构建准确且计算高效的代理模型，特别适用于计算成本高昂的场值QoIs预测问题。

Abstract: We present a bifidelity Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion (KLE) surrogate model for
field-valued quantities of interest (QoIs) under uncertain inputs. The approach
combines the spectral efficiency of the KLE with polynomial chaos expansions
(PCEs) to preserve an explicit mapping between input uncertainties and output
fields. By coupling inexpensive low-fidelity (LF) simulations that capture
dominant response trends with a limited number of high-fidelity (HF)
simulations that correct for systematic bias, the proposed method enables
accurate and computationally affordable surrogate construction. To further
improve surrogate accuracy, we form an active learning strategy that adaptively
selects new HF evaluations based on the surrogate's generalization error,
estimated via cross-validation and modeled using Gaussian process regression.
New HF samples are then acquired by maximizing an expected improvement
criterion, targeting regions of high surrogate error. The resulting BF-KLE-AL
framework is demonstrated on three examples of increasing complexity: a
one-dimensional analytical benchmark, a two-dimensional convection-diffusion
system, and a three-dimensional turbulent round jet simulation based on
Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) and enhanced delayed detached-eddy
simulations (EDDES). Across these cases, the method achieves consistent
improvements in predictive accuracy and sample efficiency relative to
single-fidelity and random-sampling approaches.

Result: 证明了min-vol NMF在噪声存在下能够识别真实因子，前提是满足扩展充分分散条件。

Conclusion: min-vol NMF在特定条件下对噪声具有鲁棒性，解决了长期存在的开放问题。

Abstract: Minimum-volume nonnegative matrix factorization (min-vol NMF) has been used
successfully in many applications, such as hyperspectral imaging, chemical
kinetics, spectroscopy, topic modeling, and audio source separation. However,
its robustness to noise has been a long-standing open problem. In this paper,
we prove that min-vol NMF identifies the groundtruth factors in the presence of
noise under a condition referred to as the expanded sufficiently scattered
condition which requires the data points to be sufficiently well scattered in
the latent simplex generated by the basis vectors.

Conclusion: 基于ResNet的深度学习模型能够有效学习判别性空间特征，克服儿科影像中低对比度、斑点噪声和解剖变异等挑战，为小儿阑尾炎诊断提供了可靠的自动化工具。

Abstract: Pediatric appendicitis remains one of the most common causes of acute
abdominal pain in children, and its diagnosis continues to challenge clinicians
due to overlapping symptoms and variable imaging quality. This study aims to
develop and evaluate a deep learning model based on a pretrained ResNet
architecture for automated detection of appendicitis from ultrasound images. We
used the Regensburg Pediatric Appendicitis Dataset, which includes ultrasound
scans, laboratory data, and clinical scores from pediatric patients admitted
with abdominal pain to Children Hospital. Hedwig in Regensburg, Germany. Each
subject had 1 to 15 ultrasound views covering the right lower quadrant,
appendix, lymph nodes, and related structures. For the image based
classification task, ResNet was fine tuned to distinguish appendicitis from
non-appendicitis cases. Images were preprocessed by normalization, resizing,
and augmentation to enhance generalization. The proposed ResNet model achieved
an overall accuracy of 93.44, precision of 91.53, and recall of 89.8,
demonstrating strong performance in identifying appendicitis across
heterogeneous ultrasound views. The model effectively learned discriminative
spatial features, overcoming challenges posed by low contrast, speckle noise,
and anatomical variability in pediatric imaging.

Motivation: 为韩国企业避税研究提供标准化的长期面板数据集，填补现有数据空白，支持跨学科研究，并考虑韩国特有的制度特征如股权集中度高等。

Method: 构建包含12,653个公司年度观测值、1,754家公司的平衡面板数据集，使用现金有效税率(CETR)、GAAP有效税率(GETR)和账面税差异(TSTA, TSDA)等多种指标衡量避税行为。

Conclusion: KoTaP是会计、金融和跨学科研究的重要开放资源，支持政策评估、审计规划和投资分析。

Abstract: This study introduces the Korean Tax Avoidance Panel (KoTaP), a long-term
panel dataset of non-financial firms listed on KOSPI and KOSDAQ between 2011
and 2024. After excluding financial firms, firms with non-December fiscal year
ends, capital impairment, and negative pre-tax income, the final dataset
consists of 12,653 firm-year observations from 1,754 firms. KoTaP is designed
to treat corporate tax avoidance as a predictor variable and link it to
multiple domains, including earnings management (accrual- and activity-based),
profitability (ROA, ROE, CFO, LOSS), stability (LEV, CUR, SIZE, PPE, AGE,
INVREC), growth (GRW, MB, TQ), and governance (BIG4, FORN, OWN). Tax avoidance
itself is measured using complementary indicators cash effective tax rate
(CETR), GAAP effective tax rate (GETR), and book-tax difference measures (TSTA,
TSDA) with adjustments to ensure interpretability. A key strength of KoTaP is
its balanced panel structure with standardized variables and its consistency
with international literature on the distribution and correlation of core
indicators. At the same time, it reflects distinctive institutional features of
Korean firms, such as concentrated ownership, high foreign shareholding, and
elevated liquidity ratios, providing both international comparability and
contextual uniqueness. KoTaP enables applications in benchmarking econometric
and deep learning models, external validity checks, and explainable AI
analyses. It further supports policy evaluation, audit planning, and investment
analysis, making it a critical open resource for accounting, finance, and
interdisciplinary research.

Method: B-EPGP利用特征变体导出的指数多项式基精确强制PDE和边界条件，使用惩罚最小二乘法估计系数；引入自由度匹配协议确保公平比较

Result: 在匹配自由度条件下，B-EPGP始终获得比CN-FEM更低的时空L²误差和最大时间空间L²误差，精度提高约两个数量级

Conclusion: B-EPGP方法在求解二维波动方程时相比传统有限元方法具有显著精度优势

Abstract: We present a new benchmarking study comparing a boundary-constrained
Ehrenpreis--Palamodov Gaussian Process (B-EPGP) surrogate with a classical
finite element method combined with Crank--Nicolson time stepping (CN-FEM) for
solving the two-dimensional wave equation with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary
conditions. The B-EPGP construction leverages exponential-polynomial bases
derived from the characteristic variety to enforce the PDE and boundary
conditions exactly and employs penalized least squares to estimate the
coefficients. To ensure fairness across paradigms, we introduce a
degrees-of-freedom (DoF) matching protocol. Under matched DoF, B-EPGP
consistently attains lower space-time $L^2$-error and maximum-in-time
$L^{2}$-error in space than CN-FEM, improving accuracy by roughly two orders of
magnitude.

Abstract: This paper is concerned with probabilistic techniques for forecasting

progressive distillation, adversarial diffusion distillation, Wasserstein GANs
and rectified flows. Moreover, experiments are conducted on a set of
challenging systems. In particular, we also address the challenge of directly
predicting 2D slices of large-scale 3D simulations, paving the way for
efficient inflow generation for solvers.

Conclusion: 生成建模在摩擦界面逆向设计中具有潜力，但需要在多个目标之间权衡，为定制表面拓扑控制摩擦行为提供了新途径。

Abstract: Designing frictional interfaces to exhibit prescribed macroscopic behavior is
a challenging inverse problem, made difficult by the non-uniqueness of
solutions and the computational cost of contact simulations. Traditional
approaches rely on heuristic search over low-dimensional parameterizations,
which limits their applicability to more complex or nonlinear friction laws. We
introduce a generative modeling framework using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
to infer surface topographies from target friction laws. Trained on a synthetic
dataset composed of 200 million samples constructed from a parameterized
contact mechanics model, the proposed method enables efficient, simulation-free
generation of candidate topographies. We examine the potential and limitations
of generative modeling for this inverse design task, focusing on balancing
accuracy, throughput, and diversity in the generated solutions. Our results
highlight trade-offs and outline practical considerations when balancing these
objectives. This approach paves the way for near-real-time control of
frictional behavior through tailored surface topographies.

Abstract: The weighted Euler characteristic transform (WECT) and Euler characteristic
function (ECF) have proven to be useful tools in a variety of applications.
However, current methods for computing these functions are neither optimized

present a vectorized framework for computing such topological transforms using
tensor operations, which is highly optimized for GPU architectures and works in
full generality across geometric simplicial complexes (or cubical complexes) of
arbitrary dimension. Experimentally, the framework demonstrates significant
speedups (up to $180 \times$) over existing methods when computing the WECT and
ECF across a variety of image datasets. Computation of these transforms is
implemented in a publicly available Python package called pyECT.

Abstract: We introduce Complexity as Advantage (CAA), a framework that defines the
complexity of a system relative to a family of observers. Instead of measuring
complexity as an intrinsic property, we evaluate how much predictive regret a
system induces for different observers attempting to model it. A system is
complex when it is easy for some observers and hard for others, creating an
information advantage. We show that this formulation unifies several notions of
emergent behavior, including multiscale entropy, predictive information, and
observer-dependent structure. The framework suggests that "interesting" systems
are those positioned to create differentiated regret across observers,
providing a quantitative grounding for why complexity can be functionally
valuable. We demonstrate the idea through simple dynamical models and discuss
implications for learning, evolution, and artificial agents.

Abstract: A canonical step in quantifying a system is to measure its entropy. Shannon
entropy and other traditional entropy measures capture only the information
encoded in the frequencies of a system's elements. Recently, Leinster, Cobbold,
and Reeve (LCR) introduced a method that also captures the rich information
encoded in the similarities and differences among elements, yielding
similarity-sensitive entropy. More recently, the Vendi score (VS) was
introduced as an alternative, raising the question of how LCR and VS compare,
and which is preferable. Here we address these questions conceptually,
analytically, and experimentally, using 53 machine-learning datasets. We show
that LCR and VS can differ by orders of magnitude and can capture complementary
information about a system, except in limiting cases. We demonstrate that both
LCR and VS depend on how similarities are scaled and introduce the concept of
``half distance'' to parameterize this dependence. We prove that VS provides an
upper bound on LCR for several values of the R\'enyi-Hill order parameter and
conjecture that this bound holds for all values. We conclude that VS is
preferable only when interpreting elements as linear combinations of a more
fundamental set of ``ur-elements'' or when the system or dataset possesses a
quantum-mechanical character. In the broader circumstance where one seeks
simply to capture the rich information encoded by similarity, LCR is favored;
nevertheless, for certain half-distances the two methods can complement each
other.

Abstract: We present simple, user-friendly bounds for the expected operator norm of a
random kernel matrix under general conditions on the kernel function
$k(\cdot,\cdot)$. Our approach uses decoupling results for U-statistics and the
non-commutative Khintchine inequality to obtain upper and lower bounds
depending only on scalar statistics of the kernel function and a ``correlation
kernel'' matrix corresponding to $k(\cdot,\cdot)$. We then apply our method to
provide new, tighter approximations for inner-product kernel matrices on
general high-dimensional data, where the sample size and data dimension are
polynomially related. Our method obtains simplified proofs of existing results
that rely on the moment method and combinatorial arguments while also providing
novel approximation results for the case of anisotropic Gaussian data. Finally,
using similar techniques to our approximation result, we show a tighter lower
bound on the bias of kernel regression with anisotropic Gaussian data.
