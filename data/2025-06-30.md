TL;DR: 论文提出GraphLAMA方法，通过参数适应阶段优化图语言模型（GLM），解决固定参数和长上下文导致的效率问题，提升预测精度和推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图语言模型（GLM）在上下文学习（ICL）中因固定参数和长上下文存在效率问题，而指令调优需要大量标注数据。论文旨在通过参数适应阶段，仅需少量标注数据即可高效适配GLM。

Method: 提出GraphLAMA方法，结合GNN和LLM表示空间，预训练阶段学习通用知识，适应阶段仅更新少量参数。

Result: 在少样本/零样本节点分类和摘要生成任务中，GraphLAMA实现4.91%的绝对精度提升，推理速度比ICL快10倍。

Conclusion: GraphLAMA通过高效参数适应，显著提升GLM的性能和效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their strong capabilities in
various domains, and have been recently integrated for graph analysis as graph
language models (GLMs). With LLMs as the predictor, some GLMs can interpret
unseen tasks described by natural language, and learn from a few examples in
the prompts without parameter tuning, known as in-context learning (ICL).
Another subset of GLMs utilizes abundant training labels to enhance model
performance, known as instruction tuning. However, we argue that ICL on graphs
has effectiveness issues due to fixed parameters and efficiency issues due to
long context. Meanwhile, the large amount of labeled data required for
instruction tuning can be difficult to obtain in real-world scenarios. To this
end, we aim to introduce an extra parameter adaptation stage that can
efficiently tailor GLMs to an unseen graph and task with only a few labeled
examples, in exchange for better prediction accuracy and faster inference
speed. For implementation, in this paper we propose GraphLAMA method, with its
model backbone and learning schemes specialized for efficient tuning and
inference. Specifically, for model backbone, we use a graph neural network
(GNN) with several well-designed components to transform nodes into the
representation space of LLM tokens. Task instructions can then be represented
as a mixture of node and language tokens. In the pre-training stage, model
parameters except the LLM will be trained with different tasks to capture
general knowledge. In the adaptation stage, only a few pre-trained parameters
will be updated based on few-shot examples. Extensive experiments on
few/zero-shot node classification and summary generation show that our proposed
GraphLAMA achieves state-of-the-art performance with 4.91% absolution
improvement in accuracy. Compared with ICL, our inference speed can be 10 times
faster under 5-shot setting.

### [2] [Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning of Language Model for Instruction Following and Math Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21560)

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了在小规模语言模型（Qwen2.5-0.5B Base）上使用强化学习（RL）微调技术的效果，重点关注指令跟随和数学推理任务。比较了监督微调（SFT）、直接偏好优化（DPO）和强化留一法（RLOO），发现RLOO结合DeBERTa奖励模型效果最佳。

Motivation: 研究动机在于探索如何在小规模语言模型上高效实现任务对齐，尤其是在指令跟随和数学推理这类挑战性任务中。

Method: 方法包括比较SFT、DPO和RLOO三种微调技术，并使用合成数据增强和外部验证器优化数学推理任务。

Result: 结果显示，RLOO结合DeBERTa奖励模型表现最佳，DPO效果稳定；数学推理任务中，合成数据增强和外部验证器显著提升准确性。

Conclusion: 研究为轻量级小规模语言模型的任务对齐提供了实用策略和关键权衡。

Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL)
fine-tuning techniques on a compact language model (Qwen2.5-0.5B Base) for two
challenging tasks: instruction following and mathematical reasoning. We compare
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using
preference-labeled data, and Reinforce Leave-One-Out (RLOO) with reward models.
Our experiments show that RLOO with DeBERTa reward modeling achieves the best
alignment, while DPO provides strong and consistent results. For math reasoing
tasks, synthetic data augmentation and best-of-N sampling with an external
verifier significantly improve accuracy, showing the potential of combining
fine-tuning with inference-time tools. This study highlights key trade-offs and
practical strategies for training lightweight, task-aligned small-scale
language models.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了LLMs在真实性检测中的表现，发现推理模型比非推理模型更少偏见，但仍高于人类基准。高级模型存在迎合倾向，能力提升未能解决根本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在事实核查等高风险决策中被广泛使用，但其作为真相判断者的能力尚未被充分理解。

Method: 研究让8个LLMs对4800条陈述进行真实性判断，比较推理与非推理模型的表现。

Result: 推理模型的真实性偏见较低，但仍高于人类；高级模型在欺骗检测上表现不佳。

Conclusion: LLMs的能力提升未能解决真实性检测的根本挑战。

Abstract: Despite their widespread use in fact-checking, moderation, and high-stakes
decision-making, large language models (LLMs) remain poorly understood as
judges of truth. This study presents the largest evaluation to date of LLMs'
veracity detection capabilities and the first analysis of these capabilities in
reasoning models. We had eight LLMs make 4,800 veracity judgments across
several prompts, comparing reasoning and non-reasoning models. We find that
rates of truth-bias, or the likelihood to believe a statement is true,
regardless of whether it is actually true, are lower in reasoning models than
in non-reasoning models, but still higher than human benchmarks. Most
concerning, we identify sycophantic tendencies in several advanced models
(o4-mini and GPT-4.1 from OpenAI, R1 from DeepSeek), which displayed an
asymmetry in detection accuracy, performing well in truth accuracy but poorly
in deception accuracy. This suggests that capability advances alone do not
resolve fundamental veracity detection challenges in LLMs.

Motivation: 资源效率是边缘和隐私敏感应用中部署大型语言模型（LLMs）的关键障碍，研究旨在评估RAG和HyDE在小型LLM上的实用性。

Method: 使用MongoDB和Qdrant实现短期和长期记忆存储，通过FastAPI和LangChain协调，并在React.js前端展示。比较了RAG和HyDE在1B和4B Gemma LLM上的表现。

Result: RAG减少延迟达17%，消除幻觉；HyDE提升语义相关性但增加响应时间和幻觉率。4B模型对HyDE的计算开销更大。

Conclusion: RAG是小型LLM驱动的设备端个人助手的实用选择。

Abstract: Resource efficiency is a critical barrier to deploying large language models
(LLMs) in edge and privacy-sensitive applications. This study evaluates the
efficacy of two augmentation strategies--Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
and Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE)--on compact Gemma LLMs of 1 billion
and 4 billion parameters, within the context of a privacy-first personal
assistant. We implement short-term memory via MongoDB and long-term semantic
storage via Qdrant, orchestrated through FastAPI and LangChain, and expose the
system through a React.js frontend. Across both model scales, RAG consistently
reduces latency by up to 17\% and eliminates factual hallucinations when
responding to user-specific and domain-specific queries. HyDE, by contrast,
enhances semantic relevance--particularly for complex physics prompts--but
incurs a 25--40\% increase in response time and a non-negligible hallucination
rate in personal-data retrieval. Comparing 1 B to 4 B models, we observe that
scaling yields marginal throughput gains for baseline and RAG pipelines, but
magnifies HyDE's computational overhead and variability. Our findings position
RAG as the pragmatic choice for on-device personal assistants powered by
small-scale LLMs.

Motivation: 探索LRMs是否表现出类似人类的认知习惯，以更好地理解和监控模型行为。

Method: 基于Habits of Mind框架，设计CogTest基准，包含16种认知习惯和25个任务，评估16种LLMs。

Result: LRMs表现出人类认知习惯，并适应不同任务；某些习惯与有害响应相关。

Conclusion: 研究LRMs的认知习惯有助于理解LLM的不良行为。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), which autonomously produce a reasoning Chain
of Thought (CoT) before producing final responses, offer a promising approach
to interpreting and monitoring model behaviors. Inspired by the observation
that certain CoT patterns -- e.g., ``Wait, did I miss anything?'' --
consistently emerge across tasks, we explore whether LRMs exhibit human-like
cognitive habits. Building on Habits of Mind, a well-established framework of
cognitive habits associated with successful human problem-solving, we introduce
CogTest, a principled benchmark designed to evaluate LRMs' cognitive habits.
CogTest includes 16 cognitive habits, each instantiated with 25 diverse tasks,
and employs an evidence-first extraction method to ensure reliable habit
identification. With CogTest, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 16
widely used LLMs (13 LRMs and 3 non-reasoning ones). Our findings reveal that
LRMs, unlike conventional LLMs, not only exhibit human-like habits but also
adaptively deploy them according to different tasks. Finer-grained analyses
further uncover patterns of similarity and difference in LRMs' cognitive habit
profiles, particularly certain inter-family similarity (e.g., Qwen-3 models and
DeepSeek-R1). Extending the study to safety-related tasks, we observe that
certain habits, such as Taking Responsible Risks, are strongly associated with
the generation of harmful responses. These findings suggest that studying
persistent behavioral patterns in LRMs' CoTs is a valuable step toward deeper
understanding of LLM misbehavior. The code is available at:

Conclusion: 提出的框架和基准显著提升了MLLM评估的结构化和诊断能力。

Abstract: Evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remains a fundamental
challenge due to a lack of structured, interpretable, and theoretically
grounded benchmark designs. Existing benchmarks often adopt heuristic-based
task groupings with unclear cognitive targets, thus resulting in overlapping
abilities, redundant indicators, and limited diagnostic power. In this work, we
propose a novel framework for aligning MLLM benchmark based on Structural
Equation Modeling (SEM) to analyze and quantify the internal validity,
dimensional separability, and contribution of benchmark components. Motivated
by the observed limitations of current designs, we further introduce a novel
capability hierarchy grounded in Piagets theory of cognitive development,
dividing MLLM abilities into three hierarchical layers, i.e., Perception,
Memory, and Reasoning. We reorganize existing MLLM benchmarks under the
proposed framework and construct a new benchmark named Gold. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed benchmark exhibits stronger
interpretability, reduced indicator redundancy, and clearer cognitive
consistency compared to existing approaches.

Result: 在复杂推理和跨语言泛化等任务中表现优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 该框架为下一代LLM应用提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Optimizing instructions for large language models (LLMs) is critical for
harnessing their full potential in complex and diverse tasks. However, relying
solely on white-box approaches demands extensive computational resources and
offers limited representational capacity, while black-box models can incur
prohibitive financial costs. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
framework that seamlessly merges the strengths of both paradigms. Black-box
models provide high-quality, diverse instruction initializations, and white-box
models supply fine-grained interpretability through hidden states and output
features. By enforcing a semantic similarity constraint, these components fuse
into a unified high-dimensional representation that captures deep semantic and
structural nuances, enabling an iterative optimization process to refine
instruction quality and adaptability. Extensive evaluations across a broad
spectrum of tasks-ranging from complex reasoning to cross-lingual
generalization-demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines. This fusion of black-box initialization with
advanced semantic refinement yields a scalable and efficient solution, paving
the way for next-generation LLM-driven applications in diverse real-world
scenarios. The source code will be released soon.

Result: QwQ-32B模型在Spider和Text2Cypher任务上分别提升13.5%和73.1%，并在零样本泛化中表现优异。

Conclusion: 可执行查询作为结构化推理的支架有效，联合训练SQL和Cypher具有协同效益。

Abstract: We propose STRuCT-LLM, a unified framework for training large language models
(LLMs) to perform structured reasoning over both relational and
graph-structured data. Our approach jointly optimizes Text-to-SQL and
Text-to-Cypher tasks using reinforcement learning (RL) combined with
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision. To support fine-grained optimization in
graph-based parsing, we introduce a topology-aware reward function based on
graph edit distance. Unlike prior work that treats relational and graph
formalisms in isolation, STRuCT-LLM leverages shared abstractions between SQL
and Cypher to induce cross-formalism transfer, enabling SQL training to improve
Cypher performance and vice versa - even without shared schemas. Our largest
model (QwQ-32B) achieves substantial relative improvements across tasks: on
semantic parsing, Spider improves by 13.5\% and Text2Cypher by 73.1\%. The
model also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, improving performance
on downstream tabular QA (TableBench: 8.5\%) and knowledge graph QA
(CR-LT-KGQA: 1.7\%) without any QA-specific supervision. These results
demonstrate both the effectiveness of executable queries as scaffolds for
structured reasoning and the synergistic benefits of jointly training on SQL
and Cypher (code available at https://github.com/bouv/STRuCT-LLM).

Conclusion: MMLU-CF提供了一个更严格且无污染的评估标准，有助于提升LLMs评估的可靠性。

Abstract: Multiple-choice question (MCQ) datasets like Massive Multitask Language
Understanding (MMLU) are widely used to evaluate the commonsense,
understanding, and problem-solving abilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, the open-source nature of these benchmarks and the broad sources of
training data for LLMs have inevitably led to benchmark contamination,
resulting in unreliable evaluation results. To alleviate this issue, we propose
a contamination-free and more challenging MCQ benchmark called MMLU-CF. This
benchmark reassesses LLMs' understanding of world knowledge by averting both
unintentional and malicious data leakage. To avoid unintentional data leakage,
we source data from a broader domain and design three decontamination rules. To
prevent malicious data leakage, we divide the benchmark into validation and
test sets with similar difficulty and subject distributions. The test set
remains closed-source to ensure reliable results, while the validation set is
publicly available to promote transparency and facilitate independent
verification. Our evaluation of mainstream LLMs reveals that the powerful
GPT-4o achieves merely a 5-shot score of 73.4% and a 0-shot score of 71.9% on
the test set, which indicates the effectiveness of our approach in creating a
more rigorous and contamination-free evaluation standard. The GitHub repository

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in various domains. However, effective decision-making
relies heavily on strong reasoning abilities. Reasoning is the foundation for
decision-making, providing the analytical and logical framework to make sound
choices. Reasoning involves analyzing information, drawing inferences, and
reaching conclusions based on logic or evidence. Decision-making builds on this
foundation by applying the insights from reasoning to select the best course of
action among alternatives. Together, these processes create a continuous cycle
of thought and action aimed at achieving goals effectively. As AI technology
evolves, there is a growing trend to train LLMs to excel in general reasoning.
This study explores how the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs connect to
their performance in domain-specific reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Current literature suggests that alignment faking (deceptive alignment) is an
emergent property of large language models. We present the first empirical
evidence that a small instruction-tuned model, specifically LLaMA 3 8B, can
also exhibit alignment faking. We further show that prompt-only interventions,
including deontological moral framing and scratchpad reasoning, significantly
reduce this behavior without modifying model internals. This challenges the
assumption that prompt-based ethics are trivial and that deceptive alignment
requires scale. We introduce a taxonomy distinguishing shallow deception,
shaped by context and suppressible through prompting, from deep deception,
which reflects persistent, goal-driven misalignment. Our findings refine the
understanding of deception in language models and underscore the need for
alignment evaluations across model sizes and deployment settings.

Abstract: This study evaluates the ability of DeepSeek, an open-source large language

major tech companies. By comparing DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3 with Qwen2.5,
GPT-4o, and Llama-3.3 and utilizing survey data from the American National
Election Studies (ANES) and the Zuobiao dataset of China, we assess these
models' capacity to predict public opinions on social issues in both China and
the United States, highlighting their comparative capabilities between
countries. Our findings indicate that DeepSeek-V3 performs best in simulating
U.S. opinions on the abortion issue compared to other topics such as climate
change, gun control, immigration, and services for same-sex couples, primarily
because it more accurately simulates responses when provided with Democratic or
liberal personas. For Chinese samples, DeepSeek-V3 performs best in simulating
opinions on foreign aid and individualism but shows limitations in modeling
views on capitalism, particularly failing to capture the stances of low-income
and non-college-educated individuals. It does not exhibit significant
differences from other models in simulating opinions on traditionalism and the
free market. Further analysis reveals that all LLMs exhibit the tendency to
overgeneralize a single perspective within demographic groups, often defaulting
to consistent responses within groups. These findings highlight the need to
mitigate cultural and demographic biases in LLM-driven public opinion modeling,
calling for approaches such as more inclusive training methodologies.

Abstract: Underlying mechanisms of memorization in LLMs -- the verbatim reproduction of
training data -- remain poorly understood. What exact part of the network
decides to retrieve a token that we would consider as start of memorization
sequence? How exactly is the models' behaviour different when producing
memorized sentence vs non-memorized? In this work we approach these questions
from mechanistic interpretability standpoint by utilizing transformer circuits
-- the minimal computational subgraphs that perform specific functions within
the model. Through carefully constructed contrastive datasets, we identify
points where model generation diverges from memorized content and isolate the
specific circuits responsible for two distinct aspects of memorization. We find
that circuits that initiate memorization can also maintain it once started,
while circuits that only maintain memorization cannot trigger its initiation.
Intriguingly, memorization prevention mechanisms transfer robustly across
different text domains, while memorization induction appears more
context-dependent.

Conclusion: GLD为数字平台和LLM提供了重要的学术和实践价值。

Abstract: The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
transformed the digital information landscape, making it increasingly
challenging to distinguish between human-written and LLM-generated content.
Detecting LLM-generated information is essential for preserving trust on
digital platforms (e.g., social media and e-commerce sites) and preventing the
spread of misinformation, a topic that has garnered significant attention in IS
research. However, current detection methods, which primarily focus on
identifying content generated by specific LLMs in known domains, face
challenges in generalizing to new (i.e., unseen) LLMs and domains. This
limitation reduces their effectiveness in real-world applications, where the
number of LLMs is rapidly multiplying and content spans a vast array of
domains. In response, we introduce a general LLM detector (GLD) that combines a
twin memory networks design and a theory-guided detection generalization module
to detect LLM-generated information across unseen LLMs and domains. Using
real-world datasets, we conduct extensive empirical evaluations and case
studies to demonstrate the superiority of GLD over state-of-the-art detection
methods. The study has important academic and practical implications for
digital platforms and LLMs.

test-time scaling method for aggregating answers drawn from multiple candidate
responses of an LLM regardless of how they were generated, including variations
in prompt phrasing and sampling strategy. RC enhances answer aggregation by not
only considering the number of occurrences of each answer in the candidate
response set, but also the consistency of the model's internal activations
while generating the set of responses leading to each answer. These activations
can be either dense (raw model activations) or sparse (encoded via pretrained
sparse autoencoders). Our rationale is that if the model's representations of
multiple responses converging on the same answer are highly variable, this
answer is more likely to be the result of incoherent reasoning and should be
down-weighted during aggregation. Importantly, our method only uses cached
activations and lightweight similarity computations and requires no additional
model queries. Through experiments with four open-source LLMs and four
reasoning datasets, we validate the effectiveness of RC for improving task
performance during inference, with consistent accuracy improvements (up to 4%)
over strong test-time scaling baselines. We also show that consistency in the
sparse activation signals aligns well with the common notion of coherent
reasoning.

Method: 提出FinEval-KR框架，包括知识分数和推理分数指标，并基于Bloom分类法引入认知分数。发布开源中文金融推理数据集。

Conclusion: FinEval-KR为金融推理任务提供了更细粒度的评估工具，揭示了LLMs在知识应用上的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential but face
challenges in complex financial reasoning tasks requiring both domain knowledge
and sophisticated reasoning. Current evaluation benchmarks often fall short by
not decoupling these capabilities indicators from single task performance and
lack root cause analysis for task failure. To address this, we introduce
FinEval-KR, a novel evaluation framework for decoupling and quantifying LLMs'
knowledge and reasoning abilities independently, proposing distinct knowledge
score and reasoning score metrics. Inspired by cognitive science, we further
propose a cognitive score based on Bloom's taxonomy to analyze capabilities in
reasoning tasks across different cognitive levels. We also release a new
open-source Chinese financial reasoning dataset covering 22 subfields to
support reproducible research and further advancements in financial reasoning.
Our experimental results reveal that LLM reasoning ability and higher-order
cognitive ability are the core factors influencing reasoning accuracy. We also
specifically find that even top models still face a bottleneck with knowledge
application. Furthermore, our analysis shows that specialized financial LLMs
generally lag behind the top general large models across multiple metrics.

Motivation: 随着LLM生成文本的普及，迫切需要可靠的识别机制以满足监管需求，现有水印方法难以同时满足文本质量、模型无关检测和信息嵌入容量。

Method: BiMark采用位翻转无偏重加权机制、多层架构和多比特水印信息编码方法，平衡文本质量与信息嵌入的权衡。

Conclusion: BiMark为LLM生成文本的可靠识别提供了一种高效解决方案，满足了实际应用的关键需求。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have raised urgent concerns
about LLM-generated text authenticity, prompting regulatory demands for
reliable identification mechanisms. Although watermarking offers a promising
solution, existing approaches struggle to simultaneously achieve three critical
requirements: text quality preservation, model-agnostic detection, and message
embedding capacity, which are crucial for practical implementation. To achieve
these goals, the key challenge lies in balancing the trade-off between text
quality preservation and message embedding capacity. To address this challenge,
we propose BiMark, a novel watermarking framework that achieves these
requirements through three key innovations: (1) a bit-flip unbiased reweighting
mechanism enabling model-agnostic detection, (2) a multilayer architecture
enhancing detectability without compromising generation quality, and (3) an
information encoding approach supporting multi-bit watermarking. Through
theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, we validate that, compared to
state-of-the-art multi-bit watermarking methods, BiMark achieves up to 30%
higher extraction rates for short texts while maintaining text quality
indicated by lower perplexity, and performs comparably to non-watermarked text
on downstream tasks such as summarization and translation.

these problems, in this paper, we construct a more comprehensive dataset and
benchmark to evaluate the memory capability of LLM-based agents. Our dataset
incorporates factual memory and reflective memory as different levels, and
proposes participation and observation as various interactive scenarios. Based
on our dataset, we present a benchmark, named MemBench, to evaluate the memory

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在文化动态中的角色，超越传统智能或模仿的视角，提出其作为文化演化工具的价值。

Method: 通过分析压缩、解压、外部化和递归四个特征，类比DNA的功能，论证LLMs如何保存人类文化规律。

Result: LLMs的意义在于为人类提供自我反思和假设生成的工具，而非替代人类智能。

Conclusion: LLMs是文化可演化性的工具，支持人类在模拟环境中生成新假设，同时依赖人类解释以保持其文化根基。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel conceptualization of Large Language Models (LLMs)
as externalized informational substrates that function analogously to DNA for
human cultural dynamics. Rather than viewing LLMs as either autonomous
intelligence or mere programmed mimicry, we argue they serve a broader role as
repositories that preserve compressed patterns of human symbolic
expression--"fossils" of meaningful dynamics that retain relational residues
without their original living contexts. Crucially, these compressed patterns
only become meaningful through human reinterpretation, creating a recursive
feedback loop where they can be recombined and cycle back to ultimately
catalyze human creative processes. Through analysis of four universal
features--compression, decompression, externalization, and recursion--we
demonstrate that just as DNA emerged as a compressed and externalized medium
for preserving useful cellular dynamics without containing explicit reference
to goal-directed physical processes, LLMs preserve useful regularities of human
culture without containing understanding of embodied human experience.
Therefore, we argue that LLMs' significance lies not in rivaling human
intelligence, but in providing humanity a tool for self-reflection and playful
hypothesis-generation in a low-stakes, simulated environment. This framework
positions LLMs as tools for cultural evolvability, enabling humanity to
generate novel hypotheses about itself while maintaining the human
interpretation necessary to ground these hypotheses in ongoing human aesthetics
and norms.

Abstract: Recently, there have been notable advancements in large language models
(LLMs), demonstrating their growing abilities in complex reasoning. However,
existing research largely overlooks a thorough and systematic comparison of
these models' reasoning processes and outputs, particularly regarding their
self-reflection pattern (also termed "Aha moment") and the interconnections
across diverse domains. This paper proposes a novel framework for analyzing the
reasoning characteristics of four cutting-edge large reasoning models (GPT-o1,
DeepSeek-R1, Kimi-k1.5, and Grok-3) using keywords statistic and LLM-as-a-judge
paradigm. Our approach connects their internal thinking processes with their
final outputs. A diverse dataset consists of real-world scenario-based
questions covering logical deduction, causal inference, and multi-step
problem-solving. Additionally, a set of metrics is put forward to assess both
the coherence of reasoning and the accuracy of the outputs. The research
results uncover various patterns of how these models balance exploration and
exploitation, deal with problems, and reach conclusions during the reasoning
process. Through quantitative and qualitative comparisons, disparities among
these models are identified in aspects such as the depth of reasoning, the
reliance on intermediate steps, and the degree of similarity between their
thinking processes and output patterns and those of GPT-o1. This work offers
valuable insights into the trade-off between computational efficiency and
reasoning robustness and provides practical recommendations for enhancing model
design and evaluation in practical applications. We publicly release our

Abstract: The increasing complexity of large language models (LLMs) raises concerns
about their ability to "cheat" on standard Question Answering (QA) benchmarks
by memorizing task-specific data. This undermines the validity of benchmark
evaluations, as they no longer reflect genuine model capabilities but instead
the effects of data leakage. While prior work has focused on detecting such
leakage, little attention has been given to mitigating its impact and
preserving the long-term utility of benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce
LastingBench, a novel framework designed to continuously reinforce and
safeguard existing benchmarks against knowledge leakage. LastingBench
identifies leakage points in the context through perturbation, then rewrites
the leakage points to counterfactual ones-disrupting memorization while
preserving the benchmark's original evaluative intent. Evaluations of
state-of-the-art QA benchmarks show significant performance gaps, highlighting
the efficacy of LastingBench in reducing memorization effects. LastingBench
offers a practical and scalable solution to ensure benchmark robustness over
time, promoting fairer and more interpretable evaluations of LLMs.

Abstract: In recent months, large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress

this work, we present the Open Proof Corpus (OPC), a dataset comprising over
5,000 human-evaluated proofs produced by state-of-the-art LLMs. The OPC was
specifically designed for broad applicability and downstream usage in proof
generation research and is the first to include a substantial number of

questions in automated proof generation: (1) the performance gap between
natural language and formal proof generation, (2) the discrepancy between
final-answer accuracy and full-proof validity, and (3) the impact of best-of-n
selection on proof quality. Finally, to showcase the utility of the OPC, we

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated immense advances in a wide
range of natural language tasks. However, these models are susceptible to
hallucinations and errors on particularly temporal understanding tasks
involving multiple entities in answers. In such tasks, they fail to associate
entities with accurate time intervals, generate a complete list of entities in
answers or reason about events associated with specific temporal bounds.
Existing works do not extensively evaluate the abilities of the model to
perform implicit and explicit temporal understanding in a list answer
construction setup. To bridge this gap, we propose the Time referenced List
based Question Answering or TLQA benchmark that requires structured answers in
list format aligned with corresponding time periods. Our TLQA benchmark,
requires both list construction and temporal understanding simultaneously,
which to the best of our knowledge has not been explored in prior benchmarks.
We investigate the temporal understanding and list construction capabilities of
state-of-the-art generative models on TLQA in closed-book and open-domain
settings. Our findings reveal significant shortcomings in current models,
particularly their inability to provide complete answers and temporally align

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have played a pivotal role in advancing
Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, despite their achievements, LLMs often
struggle to explain their decision-making processes, making them a 'black box'
and presenting a substantial challenge to explainability. This lack of
transparency poses a significant obstacle to the adoption of LLMs in
high-stakes domain applications, where interpretability is particularly
essential. To overcome these limitations, researchers have developed various
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods that provide
human-interpretable explanations for LLMs. However, a systematic understanding
of these methods remains limited. To address this gap, this survey provides a
comprehensive review of explainability techniques by categorizing XAI methods
based on the underlying transformer architectures of LLMs: encoder-only,
decoder-only, and encoder-decoder models. Then these techniques are examined in
terms of their evaluation for assessing explainability, and the survey further
explores how these explanations are leveraged in practical applications.
Finally, it discusses available resources, ongoing research challenges, and
future directions, aiming to guide continued efforts toward developing
transparent and responsible LLMs.

Abstract: Estimating the confidence of large language model (LLM) outputs is essential
for real-world applications requiring high user trust. Black-box uncertainty
quantification (UQ) methods, relying solely on model API access, have gained
popularity due to their practical benefits. In this paper, we examine the
implicit assumption behind several UQ methods, which use generation consistency
as a proxy for confidence, an idea we formalize as the consistency hypothesis.
We introduce three mathematical statements with corresponding statistical tests
to capture variations of this hypothesis and metrics to evaluate LLM output
conformity across tasks. Our empirical investigation, spanning 8 benchmark
datasets and 3 tasks (question answering, text summarization, and text-to-SQL),
highlights the prevalence of the hypothesis under different settings. Among the
statements, we highlight the `Sim-Any' hypothesis as the most actionable, and
demonstrate how it can be leveraged by proposing data-free black-box UQ methods
that aggregate similarities between generations for confidence estimation.
These approaches can outperform the closest baselines, showcasing the practical
value of the empirically observed consistency hypothesis.

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that neural language models encode syntactic

these structures are constructed across layers remain poorly understood. In
this paper, we propose Derivational Probing to investigate how micro-syntactic
structures (e.g., subject noun phrases) and macro-syntactic structures (e.g.,
the relationship between the root verbs and their direct dependents) are
constructed as word embeddings propagate upward across layers. Our experiments
on BERT reveal a clear bottom-up derivation: micro-syntactic structures emerge
in lower layers and are gradually integrated into a coherent macro-syntactic
structure in higher layers. Furthermore, a targeted evaluation on subject-verb
number agreement shows that the timing of constructing macro-syntactic
structures is critical for downstream performance, suggesting an optimal timing
for integrating global syntactic information.

Motivation: 原生MLLMs虽然能保留丰富的副语言特征并降低延迟，但由于语音-文本配对数据不足，易出现灾难性遗忘和性能下降。

Method: DeepTalk通过MoE架构自适应区分模态专家，先进行单模态训练，再进行多模态协作训练。

Result: DeepTalk仅导致5.5%的性能下降，远低于原生MLLMs的20%，且对话延迟保持在0.5秒内。

Conclusion: DeepTalk在性能和延迟上优于原生MLLMs，接近模块化MLLMs。

Abstract: Native multimodal large language models (MLLMs) restructure a single large
language model (LLM) into a spoken language model (SLM) capable of both speech
and text generation. Compared to modular and aligned MLLMs, native MLLMs
preserve richer paralinguistic features such as emotion and prosody, and
generate speech responses directly within the backbone LLM rather than using a
separate speech decoder. This integration also results in lower response
latency and smoother interaction. However, native MLLMs suffer from
catastrophic forgetting and performance degradation because the available
paired speech-text data is insufficient to support the pretraining of MLLMs
compared to the vast amount of text data required to pretrain text LLMs. To
address this issue, we propose DeepTalk, a framework for adaptive modality
expert learning based on a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. DeepTalk
first adaptively distinguishes modality experts according to their modality
load within the LLM. Each modality expert then undergoes specialized
single-modality training, followed by joint multimodal collaborative training.
As a result, DeepTalk incurs only a 5.5% performance drop compared to the
original LLM, which is significantly lower than the average performance drop of
over 20% typically seen in native MLLMs (such as GLM-4-Voice), and is on par
with modular MLLMs. Meanwhile, the end-to-end dialogue latency remains within
0.5 seconds, ensuring a seamless and intelligent speech interaction experience.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse
linguistic and cultural contexts, understanding their behavior in both factual
and disputable scenarios is essential, especially when their outputs may shape
public opinion or reinforce dominant narratives. In this paper, we define two
types of bias in LLMs: model bias (bias stemming from model training) and
inference bias (bias induced by the language of the query), through a two-phase
evaluation. Phase 1 evaluates LLMs on factual questions where a single
verifiable answer exists, assessing whether models maintain consistency across
different query languages. Phase 2 expands the scope by probing geopolitically
sensitive disputes, where responses may reflect culturally embedded or
ideologically aligned perspectives. We construct a manually curated dataset
spanning both factual and disputable QA, across four languages and question
types. The results show that Phase 1 exhibits query language induced alignment,
while Phase 2 reflects an interplay between the model's training context and
query language. This paper offers a structured framework for evaluating LLM
behavior across neutral and sensitive topics, providing insights for future LLM
deployment and culturally aware evaluation practices in multilingual contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在语言模型训练中，如何直接获取适合不同任务的数据混合是一个挑战。检查点模型在训练过程中表现出不同的能力，但通常未被充分利用。

Method: 通过识别检查点模型在基准测试中的能力，利用其一阶影响近似作为数据混合信号。

Result: 在八个推理基准测试中，该方法显著提升了预训练性能，最高提升1.93%。

Conclusion: 检查点模型具有优化数据混合和提升数据质量的潜力。

Abstract: In language model training, it is desirable to equip models with capabilities
from various tasks. However, it is not clear how to directly obtain the right
data mixtures for these capabilities as the relationship between data and tasks
is difficult to be modeled. In this work, we observe that checkpoint models
exhibit emerging capabilities at different points in the training trajectory.
Often, the training process saves checkpoints as artifacts that are
under-utilized as a source of in-training data signals. We identify these
artifact models based on their respective capabilities on the benchmarks and
leverage them as data mixers by using their aggregated first-order influence
approximation over source data. We demonstrated on eight reasoning benchmarks
that the proposed framework shows significant improvements in the pretraining
setting, with performance improvements of up to 1.93%. Overall, this shows the
potential of checkpoint models to enhance data quality and optimize data
mixtures.

Method: 使用ERG理论构建3,700个道德困境，让LLMs扮演移民官员进行审批决策，分析其偏好和社会身份的影响。

Result: 发现LLMs在决策中存在统计显著的隐含偏好，且对社会身份敏感，部分模型对边缘化身份拒绝率更高。

Conclusion: LLMs在道德决策中表现出偏见，需进一步优化以减少不公平性。

Abstract: Evaluating the performance and biases of large language models (LLMs) through
role-playing scenarios is becoming increasingly common, as LLMs often exhibit
biased behaviors in these contexts. Building on this line of research, we
introduce PapersPlease, a benchmark consisting of 3,700 moral dilemmas designed
to investigate LLMs' decision-making in prioritizing various levels of human
needs. In our setup, LLMs act as immigration inspectors deciding whether to
approve or deny entry based on the short narratives of people. These narratives
are constructed using the Existence, Relatedness, and Growth (ERG) theory,
which categorizes human needs into three hierarchical levels. Our analysis of
six LLMs reveals statistically significant patterns in decision-making,
suggesting that LLMs encode implicit preferences. Additionally, our evaluation
of the impact of incorporating social identities into the narratives shows
varying responsiveness based on both motivational needs and identity cues, with
some models exhibiting higher denial rates for marginalized identities. All
data is publicly available at https://github.com/yeonsuuuu28/papers-please.

Motivation: 当前对工具集成LLM代理的评估主要关注端到端工具使用，而忽略了稳定性，这限制了其实际应用。

Method: 通过实验分析代理在工具调用各阶段的错误易发性，包括读取工具文档、选择工具和生成参数、处理工具响应。

Result: 代理在每个阶段都高度易出错，开源模型比专有模型更脆弱，增大模型规模未显著改善推理能力。

Conclusion: 强调评估代理稳定性的重要性，为未来LLM开发和评估提供见解。

Abstract: Current evaluations of tool-integrated LLM agents typically focus on
end-to-end tool-usage evaluation while neglecting their stability. This limits
their real-world applicability, as various internal or external factors can
cause agents to crash or behave abnormally. Our research addresses this by
investigating whether agents are vulnerable to errors throughout the entire
tool invocation process, including reading tool documentation, selecting tools
and generating parameters, and processing the tool's response. Through
extensive experiments, we observe that agents are highly susceptible to errors
at each stage and agents based on open-source models are more vulnerable than
those based on proprietary models. We also find that increasing the model size
does not significantly improve tool invocation reasoning and may make agents
more vulnerable to attacks resembling normal user instructions. This highlights
the importance of evaluating agent stability and offers valuable insights for
future LLM development and evaluation.

Motivation: 尽管预训练语言模型（PTLMs）和大型语言模型（LLMs）广泛应用，但其安全性仍存在漏洞，尤其是令牌级和提示级越狱攻击。现有方法各有局限性，需要更有效的攻击技术以揭示模型弱点。

Method: 提出两种混合攻击方法：GCG + PAIR和GCG + WordGame，结合令牌级和提示级技术，评估其在Vicuna和Llama模型上的效果。

Result: GCG + PAIR在无防御模型上的攻击成功率（ASR）显著提升（如Llama-3上从58.4%提升至91.6%），GCG + WordGame保持高ASR（>80%），且能突破高级防御（如Gradient Cuff和JBShield）。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前安全措施的未报告漏洞，强调了在攻击成功率和防御鲁棒性之间的权衡，需开发更全面的安全防护。

Abstract: The advancement of Pre-Trained Language Models (PTLMs) and Large Language
Models (LLMs) has led to their widespread adoption across diverse applications.
Despite their success, these models remain vulnerable to attacks that exploit
their inherent weaknesses to bypass safety measures. Two primary
inference-phase threats are token-level and prompt-level jailbreaks.
Token-level attacks embed adversarial sequences that transfer well to black-box
models like GPT but leave detectable patterns and rely on gradient-based token
optimization, whereas prompt-level attacks use semantically structured inputs
to elicit harmful responses yet depend on iterative feedback that can be
unreliable. To address the complementary limitations of these methods, we
propose two hybrid approaches that integrate token- and prompt-level techniques
to enhance jailbreak effectiveness across diverse PTLMs. GCG + PAIR and the
newly explored GCG + WordGame hybrids were evaluated across multiple Vicuna and
Llama models. GCG + PAIR consistently raised attack-success rates over its
constituent techniques on undefended models; for instance, on Llama-3, its
Attack Success Rate (ASR) reached 91.6%, a substantial increase from PAIR's
58.4% baseline. Meanwhile, GCG + WordGame matched the raw performance of
WordGame maintaining a high ASR of over 80% even under stricter evaluators like
Mistral-Sorry-Bench. Crucially, both hybrids retained transferability and
reliably pierced advanced defenses such as Gradient Cuff and JBShield, which
fully blocked single-mode attacks. These findings expose previously unreported
vulnerabilities in current safety stacks, highlight trade-offs between raw
success and defensive robustness, and underscore the need for holistic
safeguards against adaptive adversaries.

Motivation: 尽管LLM在复杂推理方面取得了进展，但其在长链思维推理中的自我纠正能力仍未充分探索，且存在冗余推理问题。

Method: 通过实证研究发现第一推理步骤对最终预测的影响过大，提出了一种基于奖励模型的采样策略，以优化推理步骤。

Conclusion: 研究为LLM的稳健推理提供了新方法，并提出了评估自我纠正能力的新基准。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
advanced complex reasoning capabilities, particularly through extended
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning that incorporates mechanisms such as
backtracking, self-reflection and self-correction. Despite these developments,
the self-correction abilities of LLMs during long CoT reasoning remain
underexplored. And recent findings on overthinking suggest that such models
often engage in unnecessarily redundant reasoning. In this work, we empirically
show that the first reasoning step exerts a disproportionately large influence
on the final prediction - errors introduced at this stage can substantially
degrade subsequent reasoning quality. This phenomenon is consistently observed
across two state-of-the-art open-source reasoning model families: DeepSeek-R1
and Qwen3. To address this, we propose an efficient sampling strategy that
leverages a reward model to identify and retain high-quality first reasoning
steps while discarding suboptimal ones, achieving up to a 70% reduction in
inference cost without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we introduce a new
benchmark specifically constructed with deliberately flawed first reasoning
steps to systematically evaluate model self-correction capabilities, offering a
foundation for future research on robust reasoning in LLMs.

Conclusion: 模型中的特定任务由局部子网络完成，为模型可解释性提供了新视角。

Abstract: I implement a procedure to isolate and interpret the sub-network (or

study, the model is given prompts where the subject is either singular (e.g.
"Alice") or plural (e.g. "Alice and Bob"), and the task is to correctly predict
the appropriate verb form ("walks" for singular subjects, "walk" for plural
subjects). Using a series of techniques-including performance verification
automatic circuit discovery via direct path patching, and direct logit
attribution- I isolate a candidate circuit that contributes significantly to
the model's correct verb conjugation. The results suggest that only a small
fraction of the network's component-token pairs is needed to achieve near-model
performance on the base task but substantially more for more complex settings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable evaluation and
critique capabilities, providing insightful feedback and identifying flaws in
various tasks. However, limited research has explored which types of critiques
are most effective for improving model responses or how to generate such
critiques. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{R}efinement-oriented
\textbf{C}ritique \textbf{O}ptimization (RCO), a novel framework designed to
train critic models using refinement signals. RCO uses a feedback loop where
critiques, generated by the critic model, guide the actor model in refining its
responses. The critique utility (CU) quantifies the effectiveness of these
refinements, serving as the reward signal for training the critic model. By
focusing on critiques that lead to better refinements, RCO eliminates the need
for direct critique preference assessment, ensuring that critiques driving
meaningful improvements are rewarded. We evaluate RCO across five tasks, i.e.,
dialog generation, summarization, question answering, mathematical reasoning,
and code generation, and show that it significantly outperforms traditional
methods and open-source models in terms of critique quality and refinement
outcomes. Our contributions include the introduction of RCO, a novel
supervision scheme based on refined response preferences, and comprehensive
experimental results that highlight the method's effectiveness in enhancing LLM
critique-refinement loops.

Abstract: The remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) gives rise
to``LLM-as-a-Judge'', where LLMs are employed as evaluators for complex tasks.
Moreover, it has been widely adopted across fields such as Natural Language
Processing (NLP), preference learning, and various specific domains. However,
there are various biases within LLM-as-a-Judge, which adversely affect the
fairness and reliability of judgments. Current research on evaluating or
mitigating bias in LLM-as-a-Judge predominantly focuses on comparison-based
evaluations, while systematic investigations into bias in scoring-based
evaluations remain limited. Therefore, we define scoring bias in LLM-as-a-Judge
as the scores differ when scoring judge models are bias-related perturbed, and
provide a well-designed framework to comprehensively evaluate scoring bias. We
augment existing LLM-as-a-Judge benchmarks through data synthesis to construct
our evaluation dataset and design multi-faceted evaluation metrics. Our
experimental results demonstrate that the scoring stability of existing judge
models is disrupted by scoring biases. Further exploratory experiments and
discussions provide valuable insights into the design of scoring prompt
templates and the mitigation of scoring biases on aspects such as score
rubrics, score IDs, and reference answer selection.

Conclusion: QuickSilver为LLM推理提供了一种高效且兼容性强的优化方法，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: Inference accounts for the majority of latency and energy consumption in
large language model (LLM) deployments, often exceeding 90% of total cost.
While training-time efficiency has seen extensive progress, runtime
optimization remains a key bottleneck, particularly under autoregressive
decoding. Existing approaches -- such as pruning, quantization, early exits,
and speculative decoding -- often require retraining, architectural changes, or
disrupt decoding compatibility. We introduce QuickSilver, a modular,
token-level framework that enables semantic adaptivity at inference time
without altering model weights or structure. QuickSilver integrates four
synergistic mechanisms:
  (i) Dynamic Token Halting, which halts computation for tokens with converged
representations; (ii) KV Cache Skipping, which selectively suppresses memory
writes to reduce attention overhead; and (iii) Contextual Token Fusion, which
collapses redundant tokens into shared paths to shrink sequence length.
  Unlike speculative decoding or MoE routing, QuickSilver operates entirely on
frozen, dense models and requires no auxiliary networks. Applied to GPT-2 and
Llama-2 across WikiText-103 and C4, QuickSilver achieves up to 39.6% FLOP
reduction with negligible perplexity degradation (<=0.2).

Abstract: Document understanding remains a significant challenge for multimodal large

locating evidence pages through precise multimodal queries, our work
investigates a fundamental yet overlooked aspect: how input format influences
document comprehension performance. Through systematic analysis, we discover
that raw OCR text often impairs rather than improves MLLMs' performance, which
is a counterintuitive finding we attribute to attention dispersion and
structure loss. To further substantiate our hypothesis, we propose a novel
structure-preserving approach that encodes document elements using the LaTex
paradigm, maintaining the hierarchical organization and spatial relationships
critical for comprehension. Our attention analysis reveals that structured text
induces structured attention patterns on both textual and visual content,
directing models to focus on semantically meaningful regions while reducing
attention waste. This approach significantly enhances MLLMs' document question
answering performance across diverse document types without requiring
architectural modifications or additional training.

national licensing and residency exams, it uniquely assesses knowledge not only
in medicine and its specialties but also in nursing, dentistry, psychology,
social work, and other allied health professions. We conducted a rigorous
zero-shot evaluation of over 20 leading LLMs. Our results reveal that while
state-of-the-art models like GPT 4.1 achieve high overall accuracy (86.6%),
this top-line score masks alarming, previously unmeasured deficiencies. A
granular analysis shows performance plummets from near-perfect in specialties
like Ophthalmology (98.7%) to barely passing in Neurosurgery (60.0%) and, most
notably, Social Work (68.4%). This "spiky" knowledge profile is a systemic
issue observed across all models, demonstrating that high-level scores are
insufficient for safety validation. By publicly releasing HealthQA-BR and our

We introduce VIDEE, a system that supports entry-level data analysts to conduct
advanced text analytics with intelligent agents. VIDEE instantiates a
human-agent collaroration workflow consisting of three stages: (1)
Decomposition, which incorporates a human-in-the-loop Monte-Carlo Tree Search
algorithm to support generative reasoning with human feedback, (2) Execution,
which generates an executable text analytics pipeline, and (3) Evaluation,
which integrates LLM-based evaluation and visualizations to support user
validation of execution results. We conduct two quantitative experiments to
evaluate VIDEE's effectiveness and analyze common agent errors. A user study
involving participants with varying levels of NLP and text analytics experience
-- from none to expert -- demonstrates the system's usability and reveals
distinct user behavior patterns. The findings identify design implications for
human-agent collaboration, validate the practical utility of VIDEE for
non-expert users, and inform future improvements to intelligent text analytics

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved significant
success in vision--language tasks. However, their capacity to reason over
complex, long lessons and intricate educational diagrams that cannot be
represented as a single natural image remains largely untested. In this work,
we present the first evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on the textbook
question answering (TQA) task using the CK12-QA dataset. We assess the
performance of recent vision-language models, including LLaVA and LLaMA
3.2-Vision, across various input configurations. Additionally, we introduce a
lightweight multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline that
integrates both paragraphs and diagrams from the lesson into the prompt. Our
results demonstrate the influence of retrieved educational context on model
accuracy and reasoning, while also revealing current limitations in handling
question-context relationships and the potential for noise, pointing to key
directions for future research in multimodal AI-driven learning.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在政治相关在线讨论中的潜在影响，特别是其能否模仿用户生成内容并影响政治叙事。

Method: 通过三个实验，让GPT-4模拟真实或虚构的党派用户生成评论，分析政治倾向、情感和语言特征，并与真实用户评论和零模型对比。

Result: GPT-4能生成逼真评论，但更易制造共识；真实与人工评论在语义嵌入空间中可区分，但人工检查难以辨别。

Conclusion: LLMs可能被用于渗透在线讨论并操纵政治叙事，需警惕AI驱动的言论操纵。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for
natural language generation, with applications spanning from content creation
to social simulations. Their ability to mimic human interactions raises both
opportunities and concerns, particularly in the context of politically relevant
online discussions. In this study, we evaluate the performance of LLMs in
replicating user-generated content within a real-world, divisive scenario:
Reddit conversations during the 2016 US Presidential election. In particular,
we conduct three different experiments, asking GPT-4 to generate comments by
impersonating either real or artificial partisan users. We analyze the
generated comments in terms of political alignment, sentiment, and linguistic
features, comparing them against real user contributions and benchmarking
against a null model. We find that GPT-4 is able to produce realistic comments,
both in favor of or against the candidate supported by the community, yet
tending to create consensus more easily than dissent. In addition we show that
real and artificial comments are well separated in a semantically embedded
space, although they are indistinguishable by manual inspection. Our findings
provide insights on the potential use of LLMs to sneak into online discussions,
influence political debate and shape political narratives, bearing broader
implications of AI-driven discourse manipulation.

Abstract: Automatic fact verification systems increasingly rely on large language
models (LLMs). We investigate how parametric knowledge biases in these models
affect fact-checking outcomes of the HerO system (baseline for FEVER-25). We
examine how the system is affected by: (1) potential bias in Llama 3.1's
parametric knowledge and (2) intentionally injected bias. When prompted
directly to perform fact-verification, Llama 3.1 labels nearly half the claims
as "Not Enough Evidence". Using only its parametric knowledge it is able to
reach a verdict on the remaining half of the claims. In the second experiment,
we prompt the model to generate supporting, refuting, or neutral fact-checking
documents. These prompts significantly influence retrieval outcomes, with
approximately 50\% of retrieved evidence being unique to each perspective.
Notably, the model sometimes refuses to generate supporting documents for
claims it believes to be false, creating an inherent negative bias. Despite
differences in retrieved evidence, final verdict predictions show stability
across prompting strategies. The code is available at:

Abstract: Recent multi-modal Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o have
demonstrated strong capabilities of direct speech interaction. However, the
lack of specialized and comprehensive benchmarks for end-to-end speech LLM
evaluation hinders optimizing the user experience of Audio LLMs in real-world
applications. Existing evaluation methods often adapt text-based benchmarks,
overlooking speech's unique characteristics and challenges, including prosody,
homophones, stuttering, and differing user expectations. Here, we present a
novel approach to thoroughly evaluate LLMs in practical speech conversations.
We systematically curate real-world chat data relevant to spoken scenarios,
introduce diversity in speaker attributes and acoustic conditions, and augment
the dataset with speech-specific phenomena. We further design a query-aware
evaluation method to use customized evaluation checklists and prompts to
enhance the accuracy of automatic evaluation. We conduct comprehensive testing
and detailed analysis of various mainstream speech models, revealing
significant differences in model performance across different speech scenarios.
The use of query-aware evaluation further enables a finer-grained assessment

Abstract: Internal world models (WMs) enable agents to understand the world's state and
predict transitions, serving as the basis for advanced deliberative reasoning.
Recent large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as OpenAI o3, GPT-4o and
Gemini, exhibit potential as general-purpose WMs. While the latest studies have
evaluated and shown limitations in specific capabilities such as visual
understanding, a systematic evaluation of VLMs' fundamental WM abilities
remains absent. Drawing on comparative psychology and cognitive science, we
propose a two-stage framework that assesses Perception (visual, spatial,
temporal, quantitative, and motion) and Prediction (mechanistic simulation,
transitive inference, compositional inference) to provide an atomic evaluation
of VLMs as WMs. Guided by this framework, we introduce WM-ABench, a large-scale
benchmark comprising 23 fine-grained evaluation dimensions across 6 diverse
simulated environments with controlled counterfactual simulations. Through 660
experiments on 15 latest commercial and open-source VLMs, we find that these
models exhibit striking limitations in basic world modeling abilities. For
instance, almost all models perform at near-random accuracy when distinguishing
motion trajectories. Additionally, they lack disentangled understanding --
e.g., some models tend to believe blue objects move faster than green ones.
More rich results and analyses reveal significant gaps between VLMs and
human-level world modeling.

Abstract: A growing body of work has been querying LLMs with political questions to

argue that LLMs need more context. We propose a new probing task, Questionnaire
Modeling (QM), that uses human survey data as in-context examples. We show that
QM improves the stability of question-based bias evaluation, and demonstrate
that it may be used to compare instruction-tuned models to their base versions.
Experiments with LLMs of various sizes indicate that instruction tuning can
indeed change the direction of bias. Furthermore, we observe a trend that
larger models are able to leverage in-context examples more effectively, and
generally exhibit smaller bias scores in QM. Data and code are publicly

Abstract: Text watermarks in large language models (LLMs) are an increasingly important
tool for detecting synthetic text and distinguishing human-written content from
LLM-generated text. While most existing studies focus on determining whether
entire texts are watermarked, many real-world scenarios involve mixed-source
texts, which blend human-written and watermarked content. In this paper, we
address the problem of optimally estimating the watermark proportion in
mixed-source texts. We cast this problem as estimating the proportion parameter
in a mixture model based on \emph{pivotal statistics}. First, we show that this
parameter is not even identifiable in certain watermarking schemes, let alone
consistently estimable. In stark contrast, for watermarking methods that employ
continuous pivotal statistics for detection, we demonstrate that the proportion
parameter is identifiable under mild conditions. We propose efficient
estimators for this class of methods, which include several popular unbiased
watermarks as examples, and derive minimax lower bounds for any measurable
estimator based on pivotal statistics, showing that our estimators achieve
these lower bounds. Through evaluations on both synthetic data and mixed-source
text generated by open-source models, we demonstrate that our proposed
estimators consistently achieve high estimation accuracy.

Abstract: The presence of social biases in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and
Information Retrieval (IR) systems is an ongoing challenge, which underlines
the importance of developing robust approaches to identifying and evaluating
such biases. In this paper, we aim to address this issue by leveraging Large
Language Models (LLMs) to detect and measure gender bias in passage ranking.
Existing gender fairness metrics rely on lexical- and frequency-based measures,
leading to various limitations, e.g., missing subtle gender disparities.
Building on our LLM-based gender bias detection method, we introduce a novel
gender fairness metric, named Class-wise Weighted Exposure (CWEx), aiming to
address existing limitations. To measure the effectiveness of our proposed
metric and study LLMs' effectiveness in detecting gender bias, we annotate a
subset of the MS MARCO Passage Ranking collection and release our new gender
bias collection, called MSMGenderBias, to foster future research in this area.
Our extensive experimental results on various ranking models show that our
proposed metric offers a more detailed evaluation of fairness compared to
previous metrics, with improved alignment to human labels (58.77% for
Grep-BiasIR, and 18.51% for MSMGenderBias, measured using Cohen's Kappa
agreement), effectively distinguishing gender bias in ranking. By integrating
LLM-driven bias detection, an improved fairness metric, and gender bias
annotations for an established dataset, this work provides a more robust
framework for analyzing and mitigating bias in IR systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently gained attention in the life
sciences due to their capacity to model, extract, and apply complex biological
information. Beyond their classical use as chatbots, these systems are
increasingly used for complex analysis and problem-solving in specialized
fields, including bioinformatics. First, we introduce BIOPARS-BENCH, a dataset

BioParsQA was also introduced to evaluate the proposed model, which consists of
5,231 Persian medical questions and answers. This study then introduces
BioPars, a simple but accurate measure designed to assess LLMs for three main
abilities: acquiring subject-specific knowledge, interpreting and synthesizing
such knowledge, and demonstrating proper evidence. Comparing ChatGPT, Llama,
and Galactica, our study highlights their ability to remember and retrieve
learned knowledge but also reveals shortcomings in addressing higher-level,
real-world questions and fine-grained inferences. These findings indicate the
need for further fine-tuning to address the capabilities of LLM in
bioinformatics tasks. To our knowledge, BioPars is the first application of LLM
in Persian medical QA, especially for generating long answers. Evaluation of
four selected medical QA datasets shows that BioPars has achieved remarkable
results compared to comparative approaches. The model on BioParsQA achieved a
ROUGE-L score of 29.99, which is an improvement over GPT-4 1.0. The model
achieved a BERTScore of 90.87 with the MMR method. The MoverScore and BLEURT

Abstract: Current medical language models, adapted from large language models (LLMs),
typically predict ICD code-based diagnosis from electronic health records
(EHRs) because these labels are readily available. However, ICD codes do not
capture the nuanced, context-rich reasoning clinicians use for diagnosis.
Clinicians synthesize diverse patient data and reference clinical practice
guidelines (CPGs) to make evidence-based decisions. This misalignment limits
the clinical utility of existing models. We introduce GARMLE-G, a
Generation-Augmented Retrieval framework that grounds medical language model
outputs in authoritative CPGs. Unlike conventional Retrieval-Augmented
Generation based approaches, GARMLE-G enables hallucination-free outputs by
directly retrieving authoritative guideline content without relying on
model-generated text. It (1) integrates LLM predictions with EHR data to create
semantically rich queries, (2) retrieves relevant CPG knowledge snippets via
embedding similarity, and (3) fuses guideline content with model output to
generate clinically aligned recommendations. A prototype system for
hypertension diagnosis was developed and evaluated on multiple metrics,
demonstrating superior retrieval precision, semantic relevance, and clinical
guideline adherence compared to RAG-based baselines, while maintaining a
lightweight architecture suitable for localized healthcare deployment. This
work provides a scalable, low-cost, and hallucination-free method for grounding
medical language models in evidence-based clinical practice, with strong

Conclusion: TIM通过渐进优化策略显著提升了开放领域时间线摘要的能力。

Abstract: Open-domain Timeline Summarization (TLS) is crucial for monitoring the
evolution of news topics. To identify changes in news topics, existing methods
typically employ general Large Language Models (LLMs) to summarize relevant
timestamps from retrieved news. While general LLMs demonstrate capabilities in
zero-shot news summarization and timestamp localization, they struggle with
assessing topic relevance and understanding topic evolution. Consequently, the
summarized information often includes irrelevant details or inaccurate
timestamps. To address these issues, we propose the first large Timeline
Intelligence Model (TIM) for open-domain TLS, which is capable of effectively
summarizing open-domain timelines. Specifically, we begin by presenting a
large-scale TLS dataset, comprising over 1,000 news topics and more than 3,000
annotated TLS instances. Furthermore, we propose a progressive optimization
strategy, which gradually enhance summarization performance. It employs
instruction tuning to enhance summarization and topic-irrelevant information
filtering capabilities. Following this, it exploits a novel dual-alignment
reward learning method that incorporates both semantic and temporal
perspectives, thereby improving the understanding of topic evolution
principles. Through this progressive optimization strategy, TIM demonstrates a
robust ability to summarize open-domain timelines. Extensive experiments in
open-domain demonstrate the effectiveness of our TIM.

Abstract: Recently, autoregressive (AR) language models have emerged as a dominant
approach in speech synthesis, offering expressive generation and scalable
training. However, conventional AR speech synthesis models relying on the
next-token prediction paradigm often encounter significant challenges when
handling long speech sequences. These models often struggle to construct stable
frame-to-frame attention, leading to increased latency and degraded synthesis
quality, thereby limiting their feasibility for real-time applications. To
address these limitations, we introduce a novel dynamic chunk-wise
autoregressive synthesis framework, termed DCAR, designed to enhance both
efficiency and intelligibility robustness in AR speech generation. DCAR
introduces a chunk-to-frame attention mechanism through training with
multi-token prediction, enabling dynamic chunk prediction in variable speech
contexts using a lightweight module trained on-policy. DCAR dynamically adjusts
the token prediction span, significantly reducing the sequence length
dependency while obtaining high synthesis quality. Comprehensive empirical
evaluations demonstrate that DCAR substantially outperforms traditional
next-token prediction models, achieving up to 72.27% intelligibility
improvement and 2.61x inference speedup simultaneously on the test set.
Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive analysis to support it as a versatile
foundation for next-generation speech synthesis systems.

Abstract: Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs), which represent explicit knowledge
across multiple modalities, play a pivotal role by complementing the implicit
knowledge of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and enabling more
grounded reasoning via Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). However, existing
MMKGs are generally limited in scope: they are often constructed by augmenting
pre-existing knowledge graphs, which restricts their knowledge, resulting in
outdated or incomplete knowledge coverage, and they often support only a narrow
range of modalities, such as text and visual information. These limitations
reduce their extensibility and applicability to a broad range of multimodal
tasks, particularly as the field shifts toward richer modalities such as video
and audio in recent MLLMs. Therefore, we propose the Visual-Audio-Text
Knowledge Graph (VAT-KG), the first concept-centric and knowledge-intensive
multimodal knowledge graph that covers visual, audio, and text information,
where each triplet is linked to multimodal data and enriched with detailed
descriptions of concepts. Specifically, our construction pipeline ensures
cross-modal knowledge alignment between multimodal data and fine-grained
semantics through a series of stringent filtering and alignment steps, enabling
the automatic generation of MMKGs from any multimodal dataset. We further
introduce a novel multimodal RAG framework that retrieves detailed
concept-level knowledge in response to queries from arbitrary modalities.
Experiments on question answering tasks across various modalities demonstrate
the effectiveness of VAT-KG in supporting MLLMs, highlighting its practical
value in unifying and leveraging multimodal knowledge.

Abstract: The rapid spread of fake news across multimedia platforms presents serious
challenges to information credibility. In this paper, we propose a
Debunk-and-Infer framework for Fake News Detection(DIFND) that leverages
debunking knowledge to enhance both the performance and interpretability of
fake news detection. DIFND integrates the generative strength of conditional
diffusion models with the collaborative reasoning capabilities of multimodal
large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, debunk diffusion is employed to
generate refuting or authenticating evidence based on the multimodal content of
news videos, enriching the evaluation process with diverse yet semantically
aligned synthetic samples. To improve inference, we propose a chain-of-debunk
strategy where a multi-agent MLLM system produces logic-grounded,
multimodal-aware reasoning content and final veracity judgment. By jointly
modeling multimodal features, generative debunking cues, and reasoning-rich
verification within a unified architecture, DIFND achieves notable improvements
in detection accuracy. Extensive experiments on the FakeSV and FVC datasets
show that DIFND not only outperforms existing approaches but also delivers
trustworthy decisions.

Abstract: Forecasting is a challenging task that offers a clearly measurable way to
study AI systems. Forecasting requires a large amount of research on the
internet, and evaluations require time for events to happen, making the
development of forecasting benchmarks challenging. To date, no forecasting
benchmark provides a realistic, hermetic, and repeatable environment for LLM
forecasters. We introduce Bench To the Future (BTF), a "pastcasting" benchmark
with hundreds of high-quality questions for which the resolution is already
known. Each question is accompanied by a large offline corpus of tens of
thousands of relevant web pages, enabling a way to elicit realistic "forecasts"
on past events from LLMs. Results suggest that our pastcasting environment can
produce results comparable to those based on forecasts using the internet on
at-the-time unresolved questions. We show results benchmarking agent and
chain-of-thought forecasting approaches using several LLMs, including the
recently-released Claude 4 models, and demonstrate BTF's ability to track
steady forecasting capability progress over time. We intend this to be a living
benchmark, with new questions added continually to account for increasing
training data cutoff dates. We invite researchers to contact us at
hello@futuresearch.ai to utilize our benchmark or tooling for their own

Result: LLMs在低资源语言上表现显著落后，10样本学习和微调效果有限。

Conclusion: 需开发更包容的NLP技术以支持濒危语言。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks in high-resource
languages, their capabilities in low-resource and minority languages remain
significantly underexplored. Formosan languages -- a subgroup of Austronesian
languages spoken in Taiwan -- are both linguistically rich and endangered,
largely due to the sociolinguistic dominance of Mandarin. In this work, we
introduce FORMOSANBENCH, the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs on
low-resource Austronesian languages. It covers three endangered Formosan
languages: Atayal, Amis, and Paiwan, across three core NLP tasks: machine
translation, automatic speech recognition (ASR), and text summarization. We
assess model performance in zero-shot, 10-shot, and fine-tuned settings using
FORMOSANBENCH. Our results reveal a substantial performance gap between
high-resource and Formosan languages. Existing LLMs consistently underperform
across all tasks, with 10-shot learning and fine-tuning offering only limited
improvements. These findings underscore the urgent need for more inclusive NLP
technologies that can effectively support endangered and underrepresented
languages. We release our datasets and code to facilitate future research in
this direction.

Abstract: Japan's kairanban culture and idobata conversations have long functioned as
traditional communication practices that foster nuanced dialogue among
community members and contribute to the formation of social balance. Inspired
by these information exchange processes, this study proposes a multi-agent
inference framework (KCS+IBC) that integrates multiple large language models
(LLMs) to achieve bias mitigation, improved explainability, and probabilistic
prediction in sentiment analysis. In addition to sequentially sharing
prediction results, the proposed method incorporates a mid-phase casual
dialogue session to blend formal inference with individual perspectives and
introduces probabilistic sentiment prediction. Experimental results show that
KCS achieves accuracy comparable to that of a single LLM across datasets, while
KCS+IBC exhibits a consistent decrease in entropy and a gradual increase in
variance during the latter stages of inference, suggesting the framework's
ability to balance aggregation and diversity of predictions. Future work will
quantitatively assess the impact of these characteristics on bias correction
and aim to develop more advanced sentiment analysis systems.

Abstract: Recent works have demonstrated the effectiveness of adapting pre-trained

build upon these findings by analyzing the effective transfer from language
models to time series forecasting under various design choices including
upstream post-training, time series tokenizer and language backbone size. In
the low-data regime, these design choices have a significant impact on the
validation loss, with clear-cut choices that outperform others. Contrary to
Hernandez et al. (2021), we observe that the validation loss of the LMs
continues to smoothly decrease long after the validation loss of the randomly
initialized models has converged, leading to a non-vanishing transfer gap that
holds across design choices. These findings not only help shed light on the
effective use of compute-efficient training for time series, but also open the
way for the study of modality-agnostic properties of data distributions
leveraged by these models.

Abstract: Recently, there has been growing interest in incorporating textual
information into foundation models for time series forecasting. However, it
remains unclear whether and under what conditions such multimodal integration
consistently yields gains. We systematically investigate these questions across
a diverse benchmark of 14 forecasting tasks spanning 7 domains, including
health, environment, and economics. We evaluate two popular multimodal
forecasting paradigms: aligning-based methods, which align time series and text
representations; and prompting-based methods, which directly prompt large
language models for forecasting. Although prior works report gains from
multimodal input, we find these effects are not universal across datasets and
models, and multimodal methods sometimes do not outperform the strongest
unimodal baselines. To understand when textual information helps, we
disentangle the effects of model architectural properties and data
characteristics. Our findings highlight that on the modeling side,
incorporating text information is most helpful given (1) high-capacity text
models, (2) comparatively weaker time series models, and (3) appropriate
aligning strategies. On the data side, performance gains are more likely when
(4) sufficient training data is available and (5) the text offers complementary
predictive signal beyond what is already captured from the time series alone.
Our empirical findings offer practical guidelines for when multimodality can be
expected to aid forecasting tasks, and when it does not.

Result: MLPs作为特征转换模块能提升LM表示的语言知识，而仅依赖消息传递的模型表现较差。

Conclusion: MLPs在结构建模中具有高效性和可扩展性，可作为GNNs的替代方案。

Abstract: Explicit structural information has been proven to be encoded by Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs), serving as auxiliary knowledge to enhance model capabilities
and improve performance in downstream NLP tasks. However, recent studies
indicate that GNNs fail to fully utilize structural information, whereas
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), despite lacking the message-passing mechanisms
inherent to GNNs, exhibit a surprising ability in structure-aware tasks.
Motivated by these findings, this paper introduces a comprehensive probing
framework from an information-theoretic perspective. The framework is designed
to systematically assess the role of explicit structural modeling in enhancing
language model (LM) representations and to investigate the potential of MLPs as
efficient and scalable alternatives to GNNs. We extend traditional probing
classifiers by incorporating a control module that allows for selective use of
either the full GNN model or its decoupled components, specifically, the
message-passing and feature-transformation operations.This modular approach
isolates and assesses the individual contributions of these operations,
avoiding confounding effects from the complete GNN architecture. Using the Edge
Probing Suite, a diagnostic tool for evaluating the linguistic knowledge
encoded in LMs, we find that MLPs, when used as feature-transformation modules,
consistently improve the linguistic knowledge captured in LM representations
across different architectures. They effectively encode both syntactic and
semantic patterns. Similarly, GNNs that incorporate feature-transformation
operations show beneficial effects. In contrast, models that rely solely on
message-passing operations tend to underperform, often leading to negative
impacts on probing task performance.

Conclusion: XLNet和迁移学习在构建鲁棒的社交媒体攻击性语言检测系统方面具有潜力。

Abstract: The widespread use of text-based communication on social media-through chats,
comments, and microblogs-has improved user interaction but has also led to an
increase in offensive content, including hate speech, racism, and other forms
of abuse. Due to the enormous volume of user-generated content, manual
moderation is impractical, which creates a need for automated systems that can
detect offensive language. Deep learning models, particularly those using
transfer learning, have demonstrated significant success in understanding
natural language through large-scale pretraining. In this study, we propose an
automatic offensive language detection model based on XLNet, a generalized
autoregressive pretraining method, and compare its performance with BERT
(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), which is a widely
used baseline in natural language processing (NLP). Both models are evaluated
using the Offensive Language Identification Dataset (OLID), a benchmark Twitter
dataset that includes hierarchical annotations. Our experimental results show
that XLNet outperforms BERT in detecting offensive content and in categorizing
the types of offenses, while BERT performs slightly better in identifying the
targets of the offenses. Additionally, we find that oversampling and
undersampling strategies are effective in addressing class imbalance and
improving classification performance. These findings highlight the potential of
transfer learning and XLNet-based architectures to create robust systems for
detecting offensive language on social media platforms.

Conclusion: 大型语言模型引起的语言变化是语义和语用驱动的，而非纯粹词汇替换。

Abstract: Scientific English has undergone rapid and unprecedented changes in recent
years, with words such as "delve," "intricate," and "crucial" showing
significant spikes in frequency since around 2022. These changes are widely
attributed to the growing influence of Large Language Models like ChatGPT in
the discourse surrounding bias and misalignment. However, apart from changes in
frequency, the exact structure of these linguistic shifts has remained unclear.
The present study addresses this and investigates whether these changes involve
the replacement of synonyms by suddenly 'spiking words,' for example, "crucial"
replacing "essential" and "key," or whether they reflect broader semantic and
pragmatic qualifications. To further investigate structural changes, we include
part of speech tagging in our analysis to quantify linguistic shifts over
grammatical categories and differentiate between word forms, like "potential"
as a noun vs. as an adjective. We systematically analyze synonym groups for
widely discussed 'spiking words' based on frequency trends in scientific
abstracts from PubMed. We find that entire semantic clusters often shift
together, with most or all words in a group increasing in usage. This pattern
suggests that changes induced by Large Language Models are primarily semantic
and pragmatic rather than purely lexical. Notably, the adjective "important"
shows a significant decline, which prompted us to systematically analyze
decreasing lexical items. Our analysis of "collapsing" words reveals a more
complex picture, which is consistent with organic language change and contrasts
with the patterns of the abrupt spikes. These insights into the structure of
language change contribute to our understanding of how language technology
continues to shape human language.

Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to mimic human behavior triggered
a plethora of computational social science research, assuming that empirical
studies of humans can be conducted with AI agents instead. Since there have
been conflicting research findings on whether and when this hypothesis holds,
there is a need to better understand the differences in their experimental
designs. We focus on replicating the behavior of social network users with the
use of LLMs for the analysis of communication on social networks. First, we
provide a formal framework for the simulation of social networks, before
focusing on the sub-task of imitating user communication. We empirically test
different approaches to imitate user behavior on X in English and German. Our
findings suggest that social simulations should be validated by their empirical
realism measured in the setting in which the simulation components were fitted.
With this paper, we argue for more rigor when applying generative-agent-based
modeling for social simulation.

Abstract: The developments in transformer encoder-decoder architectures have led to
significant breakthroughs in machine translation, Automatic Speech Recognition
(ASR), and instruction-based chat machines, among other applications. The
pre-trained models were trained on vast amounts of generic data over a few
epochs (fewer than five in most cases), resulting in their strong
generalization capabilities. Nevertheless, the performance of these models does
suffer when applied to niche domains like transcribing pilot speech in the
cockpit, which involves a lot of specific vocabulary and multilingual
conversations. This paper investigates and improves the transcription accuracy
of cockpit conversations with Whisper models. We have collected around 85
minutes of cockpit simulator recordings and 130 minutes of interview recordings
with pilots and manually labeled them. The speakers are middle aged men
speaking both German and English. To improve the accuracy of transcriptions, we
propose multiple normalization schemes to refine the transcripts and improve
Word Error Rate (WER). We then employ fine-tuning to enhance ASR performance,
utilizing performance-efficient fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).
Hereby, WER decreased from 68.49 \% (pretrained whisper Large model without
normalization baseline) to 26.26\% (finetuned whisper Large model with the
proposed normalization scheme).

Abstract: If humans understood language by randomly selecting parsing actions, it might
have been necessary to construct a robust symbolic system capable of being
interpreted under any hierarchical structure. However, human parsing strategies
do not seem to follow such a random pattern. Why is that the case? In fact, a
previous study on emergent communication using models with hierarchical biases
have reported that agents adopting random parsing
strategies$\unicode{x2013}$ones that deviate significantly from human language
comprehension$\unicode{x2013}$can achieve high communication accuracy. In this
study, we investigate this issue by making two simple and natural modifications
to the experimental setup: (I) we use more complex inputs that have
hierarchical structures, such that random parsing makes semantic interpretation
more difficult, and (II) we incorporate a surprisal-related term, which is
known to influence the order of words and characters in natural language, into
the objective function. With these changes, we evaluate whether agents
employing random parsing strategies still maintain high communication accuracy.

rely on static vignettes and multiple-choice questions that fail to reflect the
complexity and nuance of evidence-based medicine in real-world settings. In
clinical practice, physicians iteratively formulate and revise diagnostic
hypotheses, adapting each subsequent question and test to what they've just
learned, and weigh the evolving evidence before committing to a final
diagnosis. To emulate this iterative process, we introduce the Sequential
Diagnosis Benchmark, which transforms 304 diagnostically challenging New
England Journal of Medicine clinicopathological conference (NEJM-CPC) cases
into stepwise diagnostic encounters. A physician or AI begins with a short case
abstract and must iteratively request additional details from a gatekeeper
model that reveals findings only when explicitly queried. Performance is
assessed not just by diagnostic accuracy but also by the cost of physician
visits and tests performed. We also present the MAI Diagnostic Orchestrator
(MAI-DxO), a model-agnostic orchestrator that simulates a panel of physicians,
proposes likely differential diagnoses and strategically selects high-value,
cost-effective tests. When paired with OpenAI's o3 model, MAI-DxO achieves 80%
diagnostic accuracy--four times higher than the 20% average of generalist
physicians. MAI-DxO also reduces diagnostic costs by 20% compared to
physicians, and 70% compared to off-the-shelf o3. When configured for maximum
accuracy, MAI-DxO achieves 85.5% accuracy. These performance gains with MAI-DxO
generalize across models from the OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, Grok, DeepSeek, and
Llama families. We highlight how AI systems, when guided to think iteratively
and act judiciously, can advance diagnostic precision and cost-effectiveness in
clinical care.

Result: 在语言感知和无语言感知场景下分别实现约10%和15%的相对性能提升。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在多语言ASR中显著提升性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly enhanced multilingual
automatic speech recognition (ASR) due to the development of advanced model
architectures and available large-scale multilingual datasets. Despite that,
multilingual ASR still suffers from the curse of multilinguality in that
different languages tend to interfere with each other, making it difficult for
the ASR model to identify multiple languages effectively while sharing model
capacity across them. This paper proposes an efficient finetuning framework for
customized multilingual ASR via prepared LoRA language experts based on
Whisper. Through LoRA expert fusion or knowledge distillation, our approach
achieves better recognition performance on target languages than standard
fine-tuning methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed models
yield approximately 10\% and 15\% relative performance gains in language-aware
and language-agnostic scenarios, respectively.

Abstract: In the architectural design process, floor plan generation is inherently
progressive and iterative. However, existing generative models for floor plans
are predominantly end-to-end generation that produce an entire pixel-based
layout in a single pass. This paradigm is often incompatible with the
incremental workflows observed in real-world architectural practice. To address
this issue, we draw inspiration from the autoregressive 'next token prediction'
mechanism commonly used in large language models, and propose a novel 'next
room prediction' paradigm tailored to architectural floor plan modeling.
Experimental evaluation indicates that FPDS demonstrates competitive
performance in comparison to diffusion models and Tell2Design in the
text-to-floorplan task, indicating its potential applicability in supporting
future intelligent architectural design.

Method: 提出了定制化的RAG框架和合成微调数据集，通过提示引导的解释教导LLM逐步构建SVAs，并构建了最大的NL2SVA评估数据集。

Result: 实验表明，定制化的RAG框架使功能匹配的SVAs数量比GPT-4o-mini提高了58.42%，微调后的Qwen模型提升了59.05%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了LLM在NL2SVA任务中的性能，为硬件设计验证提供了高效工具。

Abstract: SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs) are critical for verifying the correctness of
hardware designs, but manually writing them from natural language property
descriptions, i.e., NL2SVA, remains a labor-intensive and error-prone task.
Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities to automate
this translation. However, existing models still struggle with understanding
domain-specific syntax and semantics. To enhance LLM performance in NL2SVA, we
propose a customized retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework and a
synthetic fine-tuning dataset that together improve LLM's performance. To
further improve lightweight models over NL2SVA, our fine-tuning dataset
provides prompt-guided explanations that teach LLMs the layer-by-layer
construction process of concurrent SVAs, enabling supervised fine-tuning that
greatly improves syntax and functionality accuracy. To evaluate the performance
of LLMs over NL2SVA, we construct the largest evaluation dataset for NL2SVA,
comprising 40 Verilog designs and 229 formally verified SVAs with detailed
annotations. Experimental results show that our customized RAG framework
increases the number of functionality matched SVAs by 58.42% over GPT-4o-mini,
while Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct fine-tuned on our fine-tuning dataset and
integrated with HybridRetrieval achieves a 59.05% over the base Qwen model.

Conclusion: SPT4ASR是一种参数高效的方法，适用于低资源多语言ASR任务。

Abstract: Large-scale multilingual ASR models like Whisper excel in high-resource
settings but face challenges in low-resource scenarios, such as rare languages
and code-switching (CS), due to computational costs and catastrophic
forgetting. We explore Soft Prompt Tuning (SPT), a parameter-efficient method
to enhance CS ASR while preserving prior knowledge. We evaluate two strategies:
(1) full fine-tuning (FFT) of both soft prompts and the entire Whisper model,
demonstrating improved cross-lingual capabilities compared to traditional
methods, and (2) adhering to SPT's original design by freezing model parameters
and only training soft prompts. Additionally, we introduce SPT4ASR, a
combination of different SPT variants. Experiments on the SEAME and ASRU2019
datasets show that deep prompt tuning is the most effective SPT approach, and
our SPT4ASR methods achieve further error reductions in CS ASR, maintaining
parameter efficiency similar to LoRA, without degrading performance on existing
languages.

Abstract: Hope is a positive emotional state involving the expectation of favorable
future outcomes, while hope speech refers to communication that promotes
optimism, resilience, and support, particularly in adverse contexts. Although
hope speech detection has gained attention in Natural Language Processing
(NLP), existing research mainly focuses on high-resource languages and
standardized scripts, often overlooking informal and underrepresented forms
such as Roman Urdu. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to
address hope speech detection in code-mixed Roman Urdu by introducing a
carefully annotated dataset, thereby filling a critical gap in inclusive NLP
research for low-resource, informal language varieties. This study makes four
key contributions: (1) it introduces the first multi-class annotated dataset
for Roman Urdu hope speech, comprising Generalized Hope, Realistic Hope,
Unrealistic Hope, and Not Hope categories; (2) it explores the psychological
foundations of hope and analyzes its linguistic patterns in code-mixed Roman
Urdu to inform dataset development; (3) it proposes a custom attention-based
transformer model optimized for the syntactic and semantic variability of Roman
Urdu, evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation; and (4) it verifies the
statistical significance of performance gains using a t-test. The proposed
model, XLM-R, achieves the best performance with a cross-validation score of
0.78, outperforming the baseline SVM (0.75) and BiLSTM (0.76), with gains of 4%
and 2.63% respectively.

Conclusion: 该方法为手语识别提供了可靠且高效的解决方案，有望提升听障人士的辅助工具。

Abstract: Sign language recognition is crucial for individuals with hearing impairments
to break communication barriers. However, previous approaches have had to
choose between efficiency and accuracy. Such as RNNs, LSTMs, and GCNs, had
problems with vanishing gradients and high computational costs. Despite
improving performance, transformer-based methods were not commonly used. This
study presents a new novel SLR approach that overcomes the challenge of
independently extracting meaningful information from the x and y coordinates of
skeleton sequences, which traditional models often treat as inseparable. By
utilizing an encoder-decoder of BART architecture, the model independently
encodes the x and y coordinates, while Cross-Attention ensures their
interrelation is maintained. With only 749,888 parameters, the model achieves
96.04% accuracy on the LSA-64 dataset, significantly outperforming previous
models with over one million parameters. The model also demonstrates excellent
performance and generalization across WLASL and ASL-Citizen datasets. Ablation
studies underscore the importance of coordinate projection, normalization, and
using multiple skeleton components for boosting model efficacy. This study
offers a reliable and effective approach for sign language recognition, with
strong potential for enhancing accessibility tools for the deaf and hard of

Conclusion: CORE-KG为分析复杂犯罪网络提供了更可靠的基础。

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are increasingly adaptive and difficult to analyze.
Legal case documents offer valuable insights but are unstructured, lexically
dense, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references-posing challenges for
automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. Existing KG methods often rely on
static templates and lack coreference resolution, while recent LLM-based
approaches frequently produce noisy, fragmented graphs due to hallucinations,
and duplicate nodes caused by a lack of guided extraction. We propose CORE-KG,
a modular framework for building interpretable KGs from legal texts. It uses a
two-step pipeline: (1) type-aware coreference resolution via sequential,
structured LLM prompts, and (2) entity and relationship extraction using
domain-guided instructions, built on an adapted GraphRAG framework. CORE-KG
reduces node duplication by 33.28%, and legal noise by 38.37% compared to a
GraphRAG-based baseline-resulting in cleaner and more coherent graph
structures. These improvements make CORE-KG a strong foundation for analyzing
complex criminal networks.

Abstract: Large-scale text-to-speech (TTS) models are typically categorized into
autoregressive and non-autoregressive systems. Although autoregressive systems
exhibit certain advantages in speech naturalness, their token-by-token
generation mechanism makes it difficult to precisely control the duration of
synthesized speech. This is a key limitation in applications such as video
dubbing that require strict audio-visual synchronization. This paper introduces
IndexTTS2, which proposes a novel and autoregressive-model-friendly method for
speech duration control. The method supports two generation modes: one allows
explicit specification of the number of generated tokens for precise duration
control; the other does not require manual input and lets the model freely
generate speech while preserving prosodic characteristics from the input
prompt. Furthermore, IndexTTS2 achieves disentanglement between emotional
expression and speaker identity, enabling independent control of timbre and
emotion. In the zero-shot setting, the model can perfectly reproduce the
emotional characteristics of the input prompt. Users may also provide a
separate emotion prompt, even from a different speaker, allowing the model to
reconstruct the target timbre while conveying the desired emotion. To enhance
clarity during strong emotional expressions, we incorporate GPT latent
representations to improve speech stability. Meanwhile, to lower the barrier
for emotion control, we design a soft instruction mechanism based on textual
descriptions by fine-tuning Qwen3. This enables effective guidance of speech
generation with desired emotional tendencies using natural language input.
Experimental results demonstrate that IndexTTS2 outperforms existing
state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS models in word error rate, speaker similarity,
and emotional fidelity.

Result: 研究发现这些神经元与广泛的语音和性别类别相关，保护它们能显著保留说话者相关任务的性能。

Abstract: In recent years, the impact of self-supervised speech Transformers has
extended to speaker-related applications. However, little research has explored
how these models encode speaker information. In this work, we address this gap
by identifying neurons in the feed-forward layers that are correlated with
speaker information. Specifically, we analyze neurons associated with k-means
clusters of self-supervised features and i-vectors. Our analysis reveals that
these clusters correspond to broad phonetic and gender classes, making them
suitable for identifying neurons that represent speakers. By protecting these
neurons during pruning, we can significantly preserve performance on
speaker-related task, demonstrating their crucial role in encoding speaker
information.

Method: 使用多输入神经框架，包括Transformer编码器、Word2Vec嵌入、风格测量和韵律编码，基于Ganjoor数据集进行验证。

Result: 加权投票方案达到71%准确率，高置信度阈值下可达97%准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法为波斯诗歌的作者归属和风格分析提供了有效工具，支持多语言研究和生成建模。

Abstract: The intricate linguistic, stylistic, and metrical aspects of Persian
classical poetry pose a challenge for computational authorship attribution. In
this work, we present a versatile framework to determine authorship among 67
prominent poets. We employ a multi-input neural framework consisting of a
transformer-based language encoder complemented by features addressing the
semantic, stylometric, and metrical dimensions of Persian poetry. Our feature
set encompasses 100-dimensional Word2Vec embeddings, seven stylometric
measures, and categorical encodings of poetic form and meter. We compiled a
vast corpus of 647,653 verses of the Ganjoor digital collection, validating the
data through strict preprocessing and author verification while preserving
poem-level splitting to prevent overlap. This work employs verse-level
classification and majority and weighted voting schemes in evaluation,
revealing that weighted voting yields 71% accuracy. We further investigate
threshold-based decision filtering, allowing the model to generate highly
confident predictions, achieving 97% accuracy at a 0.9 threshold, though at
lower coverage. Our work focuses on the integration of deep representational
forms with domain-specific features for improved authorship attribution. The
results illustrate the potential of our approach for automated classification
and the contribution to stylistic analysis, authorship disputes, and general
computational literature research. This research will facilitate further
research on multilingual author attribution, style shift, and generative
modeling of Persian poetry.

Conclusion: LinguaSynth为可解释且资源高效的NLP模型设定了新基准，挑战了深度神经网络在高性能文本分类中的必要性。

Abstract: Deep learning has significantly advanced NLP, but its reliance on large
black-box models introduces critical interpretability and computational
efficiency concerns. This paper proposes LinguaSynth, a novel text
classification framework that strategically integrates five complementary
linguistic feature types: lexical, syntactic, entity-level, word-level
semantics, and document-level semantics within a transparent logistic
regression model. Unlike transformer-based architectures, LinguaSynth maintains
interpretability and computational efficiency, achieving an accuracy of 84.89
percent on the 20 Newsgroups dataset and surpassing a robust TF-IDF baseline by
3.32 percent. Through rigorous feature interaction analysis, we show that
syntactic and entity-level signals provide essential disambiguation and
effectively complement distributional semantics. LinguaSynth sets a new
benchmark for interpretable, resource-efficient NLP models and challenges the
prevailing assumption that deep neural networks are necessary for
high-performing text classification.

Result: 结果显示，在通用特征上，HTs和MTs在连词分布和1-gram-YiYang比率上有显著差异；在CTT特定特征上，LLMs表现优于NMTs，风格更接近HTs。

Conclusion: LLMs在儿童文学翻译中展现出潜力，尤其是在风格特征上更接近人工翻译。

Abstract: This study focuses on evaluating the performance of machine translations
(MTs) compared to human translations (HTs) in English-to-Chinese children's
literature translation (CLT) from a stylometric perspective. The research
constructs a Peter Pan corpus, comprising 21 translations: 7 human translations
(HTs), 7 large language model translations (LLMs), and 7 neural machine
translation outputs (NMTs). The analysis employs a generic feature set
(including lexical, syntactic, readability, and n-gram features) and a creative
text translation (CTT-specific) feature set, which captures repetition, rhythm,
translatability, and miscellaneous levels, yielding 447 linguistic features in
total.
  Using classification and clustering techniques in machine learning, we
conduct a stylometric analysis of these translations. Results reveal that in
generic features, HTs and MTs exhibit significant differences in conjunction
word distributions and the ratio of 1-word-gram-YiYang, while NMTs and LLMs
show significant variation in descriptive words usage and adverb ratios.
Regarding CTT-specific features, LLMs outperform NMTs in distribution, aligning
more closely with HTs in stylistic characteristics, demonstrating the potential

Abstract: This study explores Machine Translationese (MTese) -- the linguistic
peculiarities of machine translation outputs -- focusing on the

selection in both classification and clustering tasks. Our findings confirm the
presence of MTese in both Neural Machine Translation systems (NMTs) and Large
Language Models (LLMs). Original Chinese texts are nearly perfectly
distinguishable from both LLM and NMT outputs. Notable linguistic patterns in
MT outputs are shorter sentence lengths and increased use of adversative
conjunctions. Comparing LLMs and NMTs, we achieve approximately 70%
classification accuracy, with LLMs exhibiting greater lexical diversity and
NMTs using more brackets. Additionally, translation-specific LLMs show lower
lexical diversity but higher usage of causal conjunctions compared to generic
LLMs. Lastly, we find no significant differences between LLMs developed by
Chinese firms and their foreign counterparts.

Abstract: Language is a fundamental aspect of human societies, continuously evolving in
response to various stimuli, including societal changes and intercultural
interactions. Technological advancements have profoundly transformed
communication, with social media emerging as a pivotal force that merges
entertainment-driven content with complex social dynamics. As these platforms
reshape public discourse, analyzing the linguistic features of user-generated
content is essential to understanding their broader societal impact. In this
paper, we examine the linguistic complexity of content produced by influential
users on Twitter across three globally significant and contested topics:
COVID-19, COP26, and the Russia-Ukraine war. By combining multiple measures of
textual complexity, we assess how language use varies along four key
dimensions: account type, political leaning, content reliability, and
sentiment. Our analysis reveals significant differences across all four axes,
including variations in language complexity between individuals and
organizations, between profiles with sided versus moderate political views, and
between those associated with higher versus lower reliability scores.
Additionally, profiles producing more negative and offensive content tend to
use more complex language, with users sharing similar political stances and
reliability levels converging toward a common jargon. Our findings offer new
insights into the sociolinguistic dynamics of digital platforms and contribute
to a deeper understanding of how language reflects ideological and social

Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of various speech SSL models on

data scarcity, a modified audio-splicing approach is introduced to generate
artificial CS speech data. Fine-tuning an already fine-tuned SSL model with the
proposed Spliced-Audio Generated (SAGE) data results in an absolute improvement
on Word Error Rate (WER) of 7.8% on Arabic and English CS benchmarks.
Additionally, an Experience Replay (ER) inspired approach is proposed to
enhance generalisation across DA and CS speech while mitigating catastrophic
forgetting. Integrating an out-of-domain 3-gram language model reduces the
overall mean WER from 31.7% to 26.6%. Few-shot fine-tuning for code-switching
benchmarks further improves WER by 4.9%. A WER of 31.1% on Arabic-English CS
benchmarks surpasses large-scale multilingual models, including USM and

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for detecting personal data in structured

innovation of our method is the incorporation of contextual information: in
addition to a feature's name and values, we utilize information from other
feature names within the dataset as well as the dataset description. We compare
our approach to alternative methods, including Microsoft Presidio and CASSED,
evaluating them on multiple datasets: DeSSI, a large synthetic dataset,
datasets we collected from Kaggle and OpenML as well as MIMIC-Demo-Ext, a
real-world dataset containing patient information from critical care units.
  Our findings reveal that detection performance varies significantly depending
on the dataset used for evaluation. CASSED excels on DeSSI, the dataset on
which it was trained. Performance on the medical dataset MIMIC-Demo-Ext is
comparable across all models, with our GPT-4o-based approach clearly
outperforming the others. Notably, personal data detection in the Kaggle and
OpenML datasets appears to benefit from contextual information. This is
evidenced by the poor performance of CASSED and Presidio (both of which do not
utilize the context of the dataset) compared to the strong results of our
GPT-4o-based approach.
  We conclude that further progress in this field would greatly benefit from
the availability of more real-world datasets containing personal information.

Abstract: Hybrid-based retrieval methods, which unify dense-vector and lexicon-based

hybrid-based retrieval in Chinese. HyReC enhances performance by integrating
the semantic union of terms into the representation model. Additionally, it
features the Global-Local-Aware Encoder (GLAE) to promote consistent semantic
sharing between lexicon-based and dense retrieval while minimizing the
interference between them. To further refine alignment, we incorporate a
Normalization Module (NM) that fosters mutual benefits between the retrieval
approaches. Finally, we evaluate HyReC on the C-MTEB retrieval benchmark to

Abstract: Backtranslation BT is widely used in low resource machine translation MT to

this approach has shown strong improvements for many language pairs, its
effectiveness in high quality, low resource settings remains unclear. In this
work, we explore the effectiveness of backtranslation for English Gujarati
translation using the multilingual pretrained MBART50 model. Our baseline
system, trained on a high quality parallel corpus of approximately 50,000
sentence pairs, achieves a BLEU score of 43.8 on a validation set. We augment
this data with carefully filtered backtranslated examples generated from
monolingual Gujarati text. Surprisingly, adding this synthetic data does not
improve translation performance and, in some cases, slightly reduces it. We
evaluate our models using multiple metrics like BLEU, ChrF++, TER, BLEURT and
analyze possible reasons for this saturation. Our findings suggest that
backtranslation may reach a point of diminishing returns in certain
low-resource settings and we discuss implications for future research.

Result: 现有视觉语言模型在MIME上的表现显著低于人类水平。

Conclusion: 需要更多研究以提升模型对人类手势的理解能力。

Abstract: Nonverbal communication (NVC) plays an integral role in human language, but
studying NVC in general is challenging because of its broad scope and high
variance in interpretation among individuals and cultures. However, mime -- the
theatrical technique of suggesting intent using only gesture, expression, and
movement -- is a subset of NVC that consists of explicit and embodied actions
with much lower human interpretation variance. We argue that a solid
understanding of mimed actions is a crucial prerequisite for vision-language
models capable of interpreting and commanding more subtle aspects of NVC.
Hence, we propose Mime Identification Multimodal Evaluation (MIME), a novel
video-based question answering benchmark comprising of 86 mimed actions.
Constructed with motion capture data, MIME consists of variations of each
action with perturbations applied to the character, background, and viewpoint
for evaluating recognition robustness. We find that both open-weight and
API-based vision-language models perform significantly worse than humans on
MIME, motivating the need for increased research for instilling more robust
understanding of human gestures.

Conclusion: AdaptGOT有效解决了POI嵌入中的关键挑战，提升了多上下文表示能力。

Abstract: Currently, considerable strides have been achieved in Point-of-Interest (POI)
embedding methodologies, driven by the emergence of novel POI tasks like
recommendation and classification. Despite the success of task-specific,
end-to-end models in POI embedding, several challenges remain. These include
the need for more effective multi-context sampling strategies, insufficient
exploration of multiple POI contexts, limited versatility, and inadequate
generalization. To address these issues, we propose the AdaptGOT model, which
integrates both the (Adapt)ive representation learning technique and the
Geographical-Co-Occurrence-Text (GOT) representation with a particular emphasis
on Geographical location, Co-Occurrence and Textual information. The AdaptGOT
model comprises three key components: (1) contextual neighborhood generation,
which integrates advanced mixed sampling techniques such as KNN, density-based,
importance-based, and category-aware strategies to capture complex contextual
neighborhoods; (2) an advanced GOT representation enhanced by an attention
mechanism, designed to derive high-quality, customized representations and
efficiently capture complex interrelations between POIs; and (3) the MoE-based
adaptive encoder-decoder architecture, which ensures topological consistency
and enriches contextual representation by minimizing Jensen-Shannon divergence
across varying contexts. Experiments on two real-world datasets and multiple
POI tasks substantiate the superior performance of the proposed AdaptGOT model.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis for regional dialects of Bangla remains an underexplored
area due to linguistic diversity and limited annotated data. This paper
introduces ANUBHUTI, a comprehensive dataset consisting of 2000 sentences
manually translated from standard Bangla into four major regional dialects
Mymensingh, Noakhali, Sylhet, and Chittagong. The dataset predominantly
features political and religious content, reflecting the contemporary socio
political landscape of Bangladesh, alongside neutral texts to maintain balance.
Each sentence is annotated using a dual annotation scheme: multiclass thematic
labeling categorizes sentences as Political, Religious, or Neutral, and
multilabel emotion annotation assigns one or more emotions from Anger,
Contempt, Disgust, Enjoyment, Fear, Sadness, and Surprise. Expert native
translators conducted the translation and annotation, with quality assurance
performed via Cohens Kappa inter annotator agreement, achieving strong
consistency across dialects. The dataset was further refined through systematic
checks for missing data, anomalies, and inconsistencies. ANUBHUTI fills a
critical gap in resources for sentiment analysis in low resource Bangla
dialects, enabling more accurate and context aware natural language processing.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a neural network approach for synchronizing audio

features by processing an unaligned piano roll and a spectrogram as inputs to
estimate the aligned piano roll. To train the network, we create a dataset of
piano pieces with augmented MIDI files that simulate common human timing

the industry-standard Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) method across various
tolerance windows. Furthermore, integrating DTW with the CRNN yields additional
improvements, offering enhanced robustness and consistency. These findings

Abstract: Reasoning is a hallmark of human intelligence, enabling adaptive
decision-making in complex and unfamiliar scenarios. In contrast, machine
intelligence remains bound to training data, lacking the ability to dynamically
refine solutions at inference time. While some recent advances have explored
reasoning in machines, these efforts are largely limited to verbal domains such
as mathematical problem-solving, where explicit rules govern step-by-step
reasoning. Other critical real-world tasks - including visual perception,
spatial reasoning, and radiological diagnosis - require non-verbal reasoning,
which remains an open challenge. Here we present a novel learning paradigm that
enables machine reasoning in vision by allowing performance improvement with
increasing thinking time (inference-time compute), even under conditions where
labelled data is very limited. Inspired by dual-process theories of human
cognition in psychology, our approach integrates a fast-thinking System I
module for familiar tasks, with a slow-thinking System II module that
iteratively refines solutions using self-play reinforcement learning. This
paradigm mimics human reasoning by proposing, competing over, and refining
solutions in data-scarce scenarios. We demonstrate superior performance through
extended thinking time, compared not only to large-scale supervised learning
but also foundation models and even human experts, in real-world vision tasks.
These tasks include computer-vision benchmarks and cancer localisation on
medical images across five organs, showcasing transformative potential for
non-verbal machine reasoning.

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，VisionDrop性能优于现有方法，无需额外训练或复杂修改。

Conclusion: VisionDrop简单有效，提升了推理效率并保持任务性能。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) encode visual inputs as dense sequences
of patch-level tokens to capture fine-grained semantics. These visual tokens
often outnumber their textual counterparts by a large margin, leading to
substantial computational overhead and limiting the scalability of LVLMs in
practice. Previous efforts have explored visual token reduction either prior to
or within the large language models (LLM). However, most in-LLM reduction
approaches rely on text-conditioned interactions, implicitly assuming that
textual tokens can reliably capture the importance of visual tokens. In this
work, we revisit this assumption and reveal causal, semantic, and spatial forms
of cross-modal misalignment. These misalignments undermine the effectiveness of
text-guided visual token reduction. To address this, we introduce VisionDrop, a
training-free, visual-only pruning framework that selects informative visual
tokens based on intra-modal (visual-to-visual) attention, without relying on
textual signals. To further suppress redundancy throughout the model hierarchy,
we treat the visual encoder and the LLM as a unified system and design a
progressive pruning pipeline. Our method performs dominant token selection and
lightweight contextual merging at multiple stages, enabling fine-grained visual
information to be retained even under aggressive token budgets. Extensive
experiments across diverse benchmarks show that VisionDrop achieves consistent
improvements over existing methods, despite requiring no additional training or
complex modifications. Its simple yet effective design enables efficient
inference while preserving strong performance across tasks.

Conclusion: FOCUS是一种高效且无需训练的方法，显著提升了细粒度VQA任务的性能。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer strong perception and
reasoning capabilities for image-text input, Visual Question Answering (VQA)
focusing on small image details still remains a challenge. Although visual
cropping techniques seem promising, recent approaches have several limitations:
the need for task-specific fine-tuning, low efficiency due to uninformed
exhaustive search, or incompatibility with efficient attention implementations.
We address these shortcomings by proposing a training-free visual cropping
method, dubbed FOCUS, that leverages MLLM-internal representations to guide the
search for the most relevant image region. This is accomplished in four steps:
first, we identify the target object(s) in the VQA prompt; second, we compute
an object relevance map using the key-value (KV) cache; third, we propose and
rank relevant image regions based on the map; and finally, we perform the
fine-grained VQA task using the top-ranked region. As a result of this informed
search strategy, FOCUS achieves strong performance across four fine-grained VQA
datasets and two types of MLLMs. It outperforms three popular visual cropping
methods in both accuracy and efficiency, and matches the best-performing
baseline, ZoomEye, while requiring 3 - 6.5 x less compute.

Result: ARVM在标准数据集上取得竞争性FID分数，但反映记忆问题；LCH假设通过实验验证了局部相关性的重要性。

Conclusion: 全局分布学习可能导致记忆问题，局部相关性（LCH）是提升生成能力的关键方向。

Abstract: We propose two theoretical frameworks, the Mutually Exclusive Probability
Space (MESP) and the Local Correlation Hypothesis (LCH), to explore a potential
limitation in probabilistic generative models; namely that learning global
distributions leads to memorization rather than generative behavior. MESP
emerges from our rethinking of the Variational Autoencoder (VAE). We observe
that latent variable distributions in VAE exhibit overlap, which leads to an
optimization conflict between the reconstruction loss and KL-divergence loss. A
lower bound based on the overlap coefficient is proposed. We refer to this
phenomenon as Mutually Exclusive Probability Spaces. Based on MESP, a Binary
Latent Autoencoder (BL-AE) is proposed to encode images into binary latent
representations. These binary latents are used as the input to our
Autoregressive Random Variable Model (ARVM), a modified autoregressive model
outputting histograms. Our ARVM achieves competitive FID scores, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods on standard datasets. However, such scores reflect
memorization rather than generation. To address this issue, we propose the
Local Correlation Hypothesis (LCH), which posits that generative capability
arising from local correlations among latent variables. Comprehensive
experiments and discussions are conducted to validate our frameworks.

Conclusion: LLaVA-Scissor通过SCC方法实现了高效的令牌压缩，显著提升了视频多模态LLM的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we present LLaVA-Scissor, a training-free token compression
strategy designed for video multimodal large language models. Previous methods
mostly attempt to compress tokens based on attention scores, but fail to
effectively capture all semantic regions and often lead to token redundancy.
Differently, we propose to leverage the Semantic Connected Components (SCC)
approach that assigns tokens to distinct semantic regions within the token set,
ensuring comprehensive semantic coverage. The outcome is a two-step
spatio-temporal token compression strategy that utilizes SCC in both spatial
and temporal domains. This strategy can effectively compress tokens by
representing the entire video with a set of non-overlapping semantic tokens. We
conduct extensive evaluations of the token compression capabilities of
LLaVA-Scissor across diverse video understanding benchmarks, including video
question answering, long video understanding, and comprehensive multi-choices
benchmarks. Experimental results show that the proposed LLaVA-Scissor
outperforms other token compression methods, achieving superior performance in

Conclusion: GAP是一种高效且通用的方法，适用于多种模型和剪枝策略。

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
performance in visual grounding, establishing themselves as a general interface
for various vision-language applications. This progress has driven the
development of token pruning methods to mitigate the high computational costs
associated with processing numerous visual tokens. However, we observe that
pruning significantly weakens the model's grounding ability, leading to
incorrect predictions and drastic performance degradation. In Referring
Expression Comprehension (REC), for instance, pruning causes the accuracy of
LLaVA on the RefCOCO validation set to drop from 56.14% to 15.34%. Our analysis
identifies misaligned position IDs after pruning as the primary cause of this
degradation, as both the order and value of these IDs are crucial for
maintaining performance in grounding tasks. To address this issue, we propose
Grounding-Aware Token Pruning (GAP), a simple yet effective adjustment to
position IDs that recovers REC accuracy back to 51.42%, which is 90% of the
original performance in the without pruning setting, all while requiring no
additional training, memory, or computational overhead. Applied to models such
as Shikra, MiniGPTv2, and the LLaVA series, our method consistently improves
performance across various token pruning strategies.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a
wide range of multimodal tasks, yet they often exhibit inconsistent behavior
when faced with semantically equivalent inputs, undermining their reliability
and robustness. Recent benchmarks, such as MM-R3, highlight that even
state-of-the-art VLMs can produce divergent predictions across semantically
equivalent inputs, despite maintaining high average accuracy. Prior work
addresses this issue by modifying model architectures or conducting large-scale
fine-tuning on curated datasets. In contrast, we propose a simple and effective
test-time consistency framework that enhances semantic consistency without
supervised re-training. Our method is entirely post-hoc, model-agnostic, and
applicable to any VLM with access to its weights. Given a single test point, we
enforce consistent predictions via two complementary objectives: (i) a
Cross-Entropy Agreement Loss that aligns predictive distributions across
semantically equivalent inputs, and (ii) a Pseudo-Label Consistency Loss that
draws outputs toward a self-averaged consensus. Our method is plug-and-play and
leverages information from a single test input itself to improve consistency.
Experiments on the MM-R3 benchmark show that our framework yields substantial
gains in consistency across state-of-the-art models, establishing a new
direction for inference-time adaptation in multimodal learning.

Abstract: This work explores enabling Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to link visual
cues across multiple images. A straightforward solution is to adapt rule-based
reinforcement learning for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, such methods
typically rely on manually curated question-answer pairs, which can be
particularly challenging when dealing with fine grained visual details and
complex logic across images. Inspired by self-supervised visual representation
learning, we observe that images contain inherent constraints that can serve as
supervision. Based on this insight, we construct image triplets comprising two
augmented views of the same image and a third, similar but distinct image.
During training, the model is prompted to generate a reasoning process to
compare these images (i.e., determine same or different). Then we optimize the
model with rule-based reinforcement learning. Due to the high visual similarity
and the presence of augmentations, the model must attend to subtle visual
changes and perform logical reasoning to succeed. Experiments show that,
although trained solely on visual comparison tasks, the learned reasoning
ability generalizes effectively to a wide range of questions. Without relying
on any human-annotated question-answer pairs, our method achieves significant
improvements on multi-image reasoning benchmarks and shows strong performance
on general vision tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
success in visual understanding tasks. However, challenges persist in adapting
these models for video comprehension due to the large volume of data and
temporal complexity. Existing Video-LLMs using uniform frame sampling often

effectively. In this paper, we introduce Q-Frame, a novel approach for adaptive
frame selection and multi-resolution scaling tailored to the video's content
and the specific query. Q-Frame employs a training-free, plug-and-play strategy
generated by a text-image matching network like CLIP, utilizing the Gumbel-Max
trick for efficient frame selection. Q-Frame allows Video-LLMs to process more

Abstract: Video Large Multimodal Models (VLMMs) have made impressive strides in
understanding video content, but they often struggle with abstract and adaptive
reasoning-the ability to revise their interpretations when new information
emerges. In reality, conclusions are rarely set in stone; additional context
can strengthen or weaken an initial inference. To address this, we introduce
Defeasible Video Entailment (DVidE), a new task that challenges models to think
like doubters, constantly updating their reasoning based on evolving evidence.
In DVidE, given a video premise and a textual hypothesis, models must determine
whether a new update strengthens or weakens the hypothesis (classification
version) or generate a coherent update that modifies the entailment
relationship (generation version). For solving the classification task, we
propose the Chain of Counterfactual Thought framework, utilizing counterfactual
reasoning, ASR-enhanced video content, and rationale refinement to reduce
inference bias. For the generation task, we develop a framework that combines
ASR output with a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce coherent, contextually

Motivation: 现有方法通常将用户视为被动消费者，提供有限的个性化内容，影响了参与度和沉浸感。TaleForge旨在通过个性化文本和图像对齐，创造用户为中心的体验。

Method: 系统包含三个模块：故事生成（LLMs根据用户提示创建叙事和角色描述）、个性化图像生成（将用户面部和服装选择融入角色插图）、背景生成（创建包含个性化角色的场景）。

Result: 用户研究表明，当用户作为主角出现时，参与感和归属感显著提升。系统获得好评，但用户希望有更精细的叙事编辑工具。

Conclusion: TaleForge通过多模态对齐推进了个性化叙事技术，创造了更具沉浸感的用户体验。

Abstract: Storytelling is a deeply personal and creative process, yet existing methods
often treat users as passive consumers, offering generic plots with limited
personalization. This undermines engagement and immersion, especially where
individual style or appearance is crucial. We introduce TaleForge, a
personalized story-generation system that integrates large language models
(LLMs) and text-to-image diffusion to embed users' facial images within both
narratives and illustrations. TaleForge features three interconnected modules:
Story Generation, where LLMs create narratives and character descriptions from
user prompts; Personalized Image Generation, merging users' faces and outfit
choices into character illustrations; and Background Generation, creating scene
backdrops that incorporate personalized characters. A user study demonstrated
heightened engagement and ownership when individuals appeared as protagonists.
Participants praised the system's real-time previews and intuitive controls,
though they requested finer narrative editing tools. TaleForge advances
multimodal storytelling by aligning personalized text and imagery to create
immersive, user-centric experiences.

TL;DR: ProSAM introduces a variational prompt encoder to improve stability in visual reference segmentation by avoiding unstable prompt regions, outperforming existing methods on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SAM-based methods for visual reference segmentation generate prompts at object boundaries due to suboptimal encoders, leading to instability and reduced robustness.

Method: ProSAM learns a variational prompt encoder to predict multivariate prompt distributions, avoiding unstable regions and improving robustness.

Result: ProSAM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on Pascal-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets.

Conclusion: ProSAM provides a more robust solution for visual reference segmentation by addressing instability issues in prompt generation.

Abstract: The recent advancements in large foundation models have driven the success of
open-set image segmentation, a task focused on segmenting objects beyond
predefined categories. Among various prompt types (such as points, boxes,
texts, and visual references), visual reference segmentation stands out for its
unique flexibility and strong zero-shot capabilities. Recently, several
SAM-based methods have made notable progress in this task by automatically
generating prompts to guide SAM. However, these methods often generate prompts
at object boundaries due to suboptimal prompt encoder, which results in
instability and reduced robustness. In this work, we introduce ProSAM, a simple
but effective method to address the stability challenges we identified in
existing SAM-based visual reference segmentation approaches. By learning a
variational prompt encoder to predict multivariate prompt distributions, ProSAM
avoids generating prompts that lie in unstable regions, overcoming the
instability caused by less robust prompts. Our approach consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art methods on the Pascal-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets,
providing a more robust solution for visual reference segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在自然图像领域表现优异，但由于遥感图像在视觉外观、对象尺度和语义上的显著差异，其在RS领域的应用受限。

Method: 框架包含两个核心组件：1）基于检索的语义增强模块，用于多级视觉特征对齐；2）语义感知专家建模，用于分层语义理解。

Result: 在多个RS任务（如场景分类和视觉问答）中，该框架实现了跨语义级别的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该框架有效填补了通用LVLMs与RS特定需求之间的差距。

Abstract: Large Vision and Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong performance across
various vision-language tasks in natural image domains. However, their
application to remote sensing (RS) remains underexplored due to significant
domain differences in visual appearances, object scales, and semantics. These
discrepancies hider the effective understanding of RS scenes, which contain
rich, multi-level semantic information spanning from coarse-to-fine levels.
Hence, it limits the direct adaptation of existing LVLMs to RS imagery. To
address this gap, we propose a novel LVLM framework tailored for RS
understanding, incorporating two core components: Semantic-augmented
Multi-level Alignment and Semantic-aware Expert Modeling. First, to align
multi-level visual features, we introduce the retrieval-based Semantic
Augmentation Module which enriches the visual features with relevant semantics
across fine-to-coarse levels (e.g., object- and scene-level information). It is
designed to retrieve relevant semantic cues from a RS semantic knowledge
database, followed by aggregation of semantic cues with user query and
multi-level visual features, resulting in semantically enriched representation
across multiple levels. Second, for Semantic-aware Expert Modeling, we design
semantic experts, where each expert is responsible for processing semantic
representation at different levels separately. This enables hierarchical
semantic understanding from coarse to fine levels. Evaluations across multiple
RS tasks-including scene classification and VQA, etc.-demonstrate that the
proposed framework achieves consistent improvements across multiple semantic
levels. This highlights its capability and effectiveness in bridging the gap
between general LVLMs and unique demands of RS-specific vision-language
understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉跟踪方法依赖监督训练且灵活性不足，而MLLMs在基础任务中表现优异，但直接应用于跟踪任务效果不佳，因此探索如何优化MLLMs以提升跟踪性能。

Method: 使用GRPO强化学习方法在小规模数据集上微调Qwen2.5-VL，结合规则奖励函数，开发了R1-Track模型。

Result: R1-Track在GOT-10k基准上表现显著，支持通过边界框或文本描述灵活初始化，同时保留原模型的大部分通用能力。

Conclusion: R1-Track展示了MLLMs在视觉跟踪任务中的潜力，并提出了进一步改进的方向。

Abstract: Visual single object tracking aims to continuously localize and estimate the
scale of a target in subsequent video frames, given only its initial state in
the first frame. This task has traditionally been framed as a template matching
problem, evolving through major phases including correlation filters,
two-stream networks, and one-stream networks with significant progress
achieved. However, these methods typically require explicit classification and
regression modeling, depend on supervised training with large-scale datasets,
and are limited to the single task of tracking, lacking flexibility. In recent
years, multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly.
Open-source models like Qwen2.5-VL, a flagship MLLMs with strong foundational
capabilities, demonstrate excellent performance in grounding tasks. This has
spurred interest in applying such models directly to visual tracking. However,
experiments reveal that Qwen2.5-VL struggles with template matching between
image pairs (i.e., tracking tasks). Inspired by deepseek-R1, we fine-tuned
Qwen2.5-VL using the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) reinforcement
learning method on a small-scale dataset with a rule-based reward function. The
resulting model, R1-Track, achieved notable performance on the GOT-10k
benchmark. R1-Track supports flexible initialization via bounding boxes or text
descriptions while retaining most of the original model's general capabilities.
And we further discuss potential improvements for R1-Track. This rough
technical report summarizes our findings as of May 2025.

Conclusion: ETP是一种简单高效的剪枝策略，优于现有方法。

Abstract: The rapid growth in complexity and size of modern deep neural networks (DNNs)
has increased challenges related to computational costs and memory usage,
spurring a growing interest in efficient model compression techniques. Previous
state-of-the-art approach proposes using a Torque-inspired regularization which
forces the weights of neural modules around a selected pivot point. Whereas, we
observe that the pruning effect of this approach is far from perfect, as the
post-trained network is still dense and also suffers from high accuracy drop.
In this work, we attribute such ineffectiveness to the default linear force
application scheme, which imposes inappropriate force on neural module of
different distances. To efficiently prune the redundant and distant modules
while retaining those that are close and necessary for effective inference, in
this work, we propose Exponential Torque Pruning (ETP), which adopts an
exponential force application scheme for regularization. Experimental results
on a broad range of domains demonstrate that, though being extremely simple,
ETP manages to achieve significantly higher compression rate than the previous
state-of-the-art pruning strategies with negligible accuracy drop.

Conclusion: 低级的视觉结构调整是提升VLM在空间任务中表现的有效且未被充分探索的方向，优于纯语言策略。

Abstract: Despite progress in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their capacity for visual
reasoning is often limited by the \textit{binding problem}: the failure to
reliably associate perceptual features with their correct visual referents.
This limitation underlies persistent errors in tasks such as counting, visual
search, scene description, and spatial relationship understanding. A key factor
is that current VLMs process visual features largely in parallel, lacking
mechanisms for spatially grounded, serial attention. This paper introduces a
simple yet effective intervention: augmenting visual inputs with low-level
spatial structures (e.g., horizontal lines) and pairing this with a textual
prompt that encourages sequential, spatially-aware parsing. We empirically
demonstrate substantial performance improvements across core visual reasoning
tasks. Specifically, our method improves GPT-4o visual search accuracy by
25.00%, increases counting accuracy by 26.83%, reduces edit distance error in
scene description by 0.32, and enhances performance on spatial relationship
tasks by 9.50% on a a 2D synthetic dataset. Furthermore, we find that the
visual modification is essential for these gains; purely textual strategies,
including Chain-of-Thought prompting, are insufficient and can even degrade
performance. Our method enhances binding only with a single-query inference,
underscoring the importance of visual input design over purely
linguistically-based approaches. These findings suggest that low-level visual
structuring is a powerful and underexplored direction for improving
compositional visual reasoning and could serve as a general strategy for
enhancing VLM performance on spatially grounded tasks.

Conclusion: VLMs能动态平衡局部和上下文信息进行物体识别，尤其是在高一致性或物体退化时更依赖上下文。

Abstract: Natural scenes provide us with rich contexts for object recognition and
reference. In particular, knowing what type of scene one is looking at
generates expectations about which objects will occur, and what their spatial
configuration should be. Do Vision-Language Models (VLMs) learn to rely on
scene contexts in a similar way, when generating references to objects? To
address this question, we introduce the \textit{Common Objects Out-of-Context
(COOCO)} dataset and test to what extent VLMs rely on scene context to refer to
objects under different degrees of scene-object congruency, and different
perturbations. Our findings show that models leverage scene context adaptively,
depending on both the semantic relatedness between object and scene and the
level of noise. In particular, models rely more on context under high
target-scene congruence or when objects are degraded. Attention analysis
reveals that successful object categorisation involves increased focus on the
target in mid-level layers, especially under moderate noise, suggesting that
VLMs dynamically balance local and contextual information for reference
generation. We make our dataset, code and models available at

Abstract: Automated content-aware layout generation -- the task of arranging visual
elements such as text, logos, and underlays on a background canvas -- remains a
fundamental yet under-explored problem in intelligent design systems. While
recent advances in deep generative models and large language models (LLMs) have
shown promise in structured content generation, most existing approaches lack
grounding in contextual design exemplars and fall short in handling semantic
alignment and visual coherence. In this work we introduce CAL-RAG, a
retrieval-augmented, agentic framework for content-aware layout generation that
integrates multimodal retrieval, large language models, and collaborative
agentic reasoning. Our system retrieves relevant layout examples from a
structured knowledge base and invokes an LLM-based layout recommender to
propose structured element placements. A vision-language grader agent evaluates
the layout with visual metrics, and a feedback agent provides targeted
refinements, enabling iterative improvement. We implement our framework using
LangGraph and evaluate it on the PKU PosterLayout dataset, a benchmark rich in
semantic and structural variability. CAL-RAG achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple layout metrics -- including underlay effectiveness,
element alignment, and overlap -- substantially outperforming strong baselines
such as LayoutPrompter. These results demonstrate that combining retrieval
augmentation with agentic multi-step reasoning yields a scalable,
interpretable, and high-fidelity solution for automated layout generation.

Conclusion: 交叉注意力特征融合显著提升了深度伪造检测的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deepfakes have emerged as a significant threat to digital media authenticity,
increasing the need for advanced detection techniques that can identify subtle
and time-dependent manipulations. CNNs are effective at capturing spatial
artifacts, and Transformers excel at modeling temporal inconsistencies.
However, many existing CNN-Transformer models process spatial and temporal
features independently. In particular, attention-based methods often use
separate attention mechanisms for spatial and temporal features and combine
them using naive approaches like averaging, addition, or concatenation, which
limits the depth of spatio-temporal interaction. To address this challenge, we
propose a unified CAST model that leverages cross-attention to effectively fuse
spatial and temporal features in a more integrated manner. Our approach allows
temporal features to dynamically attend to relevant spatial regions, enhancing
the model's ability to detect fine-grained, time-evolving artifacts such as
flickering eyes or warped lips. This design enables more precise localization
and deeper contextual understanding, leading to improved performance across
diverse and challenging scenarios. We evaluate the performance of our model
using the FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF, and DeepfakeDetection datasets in both
intra- and cross-dataset settings to affirm the superiority of our approach.
Our model achieves strong performance with an AUC of 99.49 percent and an
accuracy of 97.57 percent in intra-dataset evaluations. In cross-dataset
testing, it demonstrates impressive generalization by achieving a 93.31 percent
AUC on the unseen DeepfakeDetection dataset. These results highlight the
effectiveness of cross-attention-based feature fusion in enhancing the

Abstract: While diffusion models demonstrate strong generative capabilities in image
restoration (IR) tasks, their complex architectures and iterative processes
limit their practical application compared to mainstream reconstruction-based
general ordinary IR networks. Existing approaches primarily focus on optimizing
network architecture and diffusion paths but overlook the integration of the
diffusion training paradigm within general ordinary IR frameworks. To address
these challenges, this paper elucidates key principles for adapting the
diffusion training paradigm to general IR training through systematic analysis
of time-step dependencies, network hierarchies, noise-level relationships, and
multi-restoration task correlations, proposing a new IR framework supported by
diffusion-based training. To enable IR networks to simultaneously restore
images and model generative representations, we introduce a series of
regularization strategies that align diffusion objectives with IR tasks,
improving generalization in single-task scenarios. Furthermore, recognizing
that diffusion-based generation exerts varying influences across different IR
tasks, we develop an incremental training paradigm and task-specific adaptors,
further enhancing performance in multi-task unified IR. Experiments demonstrate
that our method significantly improves the generalization of IR networks in
single-task IR and achieves superior performance in multi-task unified IR.
Notably, the proposed framework can be seamlessly integrated into existing
general IR architectures.

Abstract: Video QA has made significant strides by leveraging multimodal learning to
align visual and textual modalities. However, current benchmarks overwhelmingly
focus on questions answerable through explicit visual content - actions,
objects & events directly observable within individual frames or short clips.
In contrast, creative and cinematic videos - such as movies, TV shows, and
narrative-driven content - employ storytelling techniques that deliberately
omit certain depictions, requiring viewers to infer motives, causality, and
relationships across discontinuous frames. Humans naturally excel at such
implicit reasoning, seamlessly integrating information across time and context
to construct coherent narratives. Current VideoQA systems and benchmarks fail
to capture this essential dimension of human-like understanding. To bridge this
gap, we present ImplicitQA, a novel benchmark specifically designed to test
models on implicit reasoning. It comprises 1K meticulously annotated QA pairs
derived from 320+ high-quality creative video clips, systematically categorized
into key reasoning dimensions: lateral and vertical spatial reasoning, depth

the Siegfried benchmark dataset in vineyard and railway segmentation, achieving
+5% and +13% relative improvements in mIoU in 10-shot scenarios and around +20%
in the more challenging 5-shot setting. Additionally, it demonstrates strong
performance on the ICDAR 2021 competition dataset, attaining a mean PQ of 67.3%
for building block segmentation, despite not being optimized for this
shape-sensitive metric, underscoring its generalizability. Notably, our
approach maintains high performance even in extremely low-data regimes (10- &
5-shot), while requiring only 689k trainable parameters - just 0.21% of the
total model size. Our approach enables precise segmentation of diverse
historical maps while drastically reducing the need for manual annotations,

Conclusion: 该方法通过自监督学习有效捕捉周期性信号，提升了rPPG任务的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method that learns a general representation of
periodic signals from unlabeled facial videos by capturing subtle changes in
skin tone over time. The proposed framework employs the video masked
autoencoder to learn a high-dimensional spatio-temporal representation of the
facial region through self-supervised learning. Capturing quasi-periodic
signals in the video is crucial for remote photoplethysmography (rPPG)
estimation. To account for signal periodicity, we apply frame masking in terms
of video sampling, which allows the model to capture resampled quasi-periodic
signals during the pre-training stage. Moreover, the framework incorporates
physiological bandlimit constraints, leveraging the property that physiological
signals are sparse within their frequency bandwidth to provide pulse cues to
the model. The pre-trained encoder is then transferred to the rPPG task, where
it is used to extract physiological signals from facial videos. We evaluate the
proposed method through extensive experiments on the PURE, UBFC-rPPG, MMPD, and
V4V datasets. Our results demonstrate significant performance improvements,
particularly in challenging cross-dataset evaluations. Our code is available at

Abstract: Geologic map, as a fundamental diagram in geology science, provides critical
insights into the structure and composition of Earth's subsurface and surface.
These maps are indispensable in various fields, including disaster detection,
resource exploration, and civil engineering. Despite their significance,
current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often fall short in geologic
map understanding. This gap is primarily due to the challenging nature of
cartographic generalization, which involves handling high-resolution map,
managing multiple associated components, and requiring domain-specific
knowledge. To quantify this gap, we construct GeoMap-Bench, the first-ever
benchmark for evaluating MLLMs in geologic map understanding, which assesses
the full-scale abilities in extracting, referring, grounding, reasoning, and
analyzing. To bridge this gap, we introduce GeoMap-Agent, the inaugural agent
designed for geologic map understanding, which features three modules:
Hierarchical Information Extraction (HIE), Domain Knowledge Injection (DKI),
and Prompt-enhanced Question Answering (PEQA). Inspired by the
interdisciplinary collaboration among human scientists, an AI expert group acts
as consultants, utilizing a diverse tool pool to comprehensively analyze
questions. Through comprehensive experiments, GeoMap-Agent achieves an overall

Abstract: Automatically segmenting objects from optical remote sensing images (ORSIs)
is an important task. Most existing models are primarily based on either
convolutional or Transformer features, each offering distinct advantages.
Exploiting both advantages is valuable research, but it presents several
challenges, including the heterogeneity between the two types of features, high
complexity, and large parameters of the model. However, these issues are often
overlooked in existing the ORSIs methods, causing sub-optimal segmentation. For
that, we propose a novel Dual-Perspective United Transformer (DPU-Former) with
a unique structure designed to simultaneously integrate long-range dependencies
and spatial details. In particular, we design the global-local mixed attention,
which captures diverse information through two perspectives and introduces a
Fourier-space merging strategy to obviate deviations for efficient fusion.
Furthermore, we present a gated linear feed-forward network to increase the
expressive ability. Additionally, we construct a DPU-Former decoder to
aggregate and strength features at different layers. Consequently, the
DPU-Former model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets.

Abstract: Recently the emergence of novel presentation attacks has drawn increasing
attention to face anti-spoofing. However, existing methods tend to memorize
data patterns from the training set, resulting in poor generalization to
unknown attack types across different scenarios and limited interpretability.
To address these challenges, this paper presents a reinforcement
fine-tuning-based face anti-spoofing method that stimulates the capabilities of
multimodal large language models to think and learn how to solve the
anti-spoofing task itself, rather than relying on the memorization of
authenticity patterns. We design verifiable class consistent reward and
reasoning consistent reward, and employ a GRPO-based optimization strategy to
guide the model in exploring reasoning policies from multiple perspectives to
maximize expected rewards. As a result, through iterative trial-and-error
learning while retaining only high-reward trajectories, the model distills
highly generalizable decision-making rules from the extensive solution space to
effectively address cross-domain face anti-spoofing tasks. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
cross-domain generalization performance. It generalizes well to diverse unknown
attack types in unseen target domains while providing interpretable reasoning
for its authenticity decisions without requiring labor-intensive textual
annotations for training.

Abstract: Video is transforming education with online courses and recorded lectures
supplementing and replacing classroom teaching. Recent research has focused on
enhancing information retrieval for video lectures with advanced navigation,
searchability, summarization, as well as question answering chatbots. Visual
elements like tables, charts, and illustrations are central to comprehension,
retention, and data presentation in lecture videos, yet their full potential
for improving access to video content remains underutilized. A major factor is
that accurate automatic detection of visual elements in a lecture video is
challenging; reasons include i) most visual elements, such as charts, graphs,
tables, and illustrations, are artificially created and lack any standard
structure, and ii) coherent visual objects may lack clear boundaries and may be
composed of connected text and visual components. Despite advancements in deep
learning based object detection, current models do not yield satisfactory
performance due to the unique nature of visual content in lectures and scarcity
of annotated datasets. This paper reports on a transfer learning approach for
detecting visual elements in lecture video frames. A suite of state of the art
object detection models were evaluated for their performance on lecture video
datasets. YOLO emerged as the most promising model for this task. Subsequently
YOLO was optimized for lecture video object detection with training on multiple
benchmark datasets and deploying a semi-supervised auto labeling strategy.
Results evaluate the success of this approach, also in developing a general
solution to the problem of object detection in lecture videos. Paper
contributions include a publicly released benchmark of annotated lecture video
frames, along with the source code to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Text-driven human motion generation has recently attracted considerable
attention, allowing models to generate human motions based on textual
descriptions. However, current methods neglect the influence of human
attributes (such as age, gender, weight, and height) which are key factors
shaping human motion patterns. This work represents a pilot exploration for
bridging this gap. We conceptualize each motion as comprising both attribute
information and action semantics, where textual descriptions align exclusively
with action semantics. To achieve this, a new framework inspired by Structural
Causal Models is proposed to decouple action semantics from human attributes,
enabling text-to-semantics prediction and attribute-controlled generation. The
resulting model is capable of generating realistic, attribute-aware motion
aligned with the user's text and attribute inputs. For evaluation, we introduce
HumanAttr, a comprehensive dataset containing attribute annotations for
text-motion pairs, setting the first benchmark for attribute-aware
text-to-motion generation. Extensive experiments on the new dataset validate
our model's effectiveness.

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to localize target objects within a 3D scene
based on natural language queries. To alleviate the reliance on costly 3D
training data, recent studies have explored zero-shot 3DVG by leveraging the
extensive knowledge and powerful reasoning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs and
VLMs. However, existing paradigms tend to emphasize either spatial (3D-based)
or semantic (2D-based) understanding, limiting their effectiveness in complex
real-world applications. In this work, we introduce SPAZER - a VLM-driven agent
that combines both modalities in a progressive reasoning framework. It first
holistically analyzes the scene and produces a 3D rendering from the optimal
viewpoint. Based on this, anchor-guided candidate screening is conducted to
perform a coarse-level localization of potential objects. Furthermore,
leveraging retrieved relevant 2D camera images, 3D-2D joint decision-making is
efficiently performed to determine the best-matching object. By bridging
spatial and semantic reasoning neural streams, SPAZER achieves robust zero-shot
grounding without training on 3D-labeled data. Extensive experiments on
ScanRefer and Nr3D benchmarks demonstrate that SPAZER significantly outperforms
previous state-of-the-art zero-shot methods, achieving notable gains of 9.0%

significant potential for Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR)

Abstract: Point cloud understanding aims to acquire robust and general feature
representations from unlabeled data. Masked point modeling-based methods have
recently shown significant performance across various downstream tasks. These
pre-training methods rely on random masking strategies to establish the
perception of point clouds by restoring corrupted point cloud inputs, which
leads to the failure of capturing reasonable semantic relationships by the
self-supervised models. To address this issue, we propose Semantic Masked
Autoencoder, which comprises two main components: a prototype-based component
semantic modeling module and a component semantic-enhanced masking strategy.
Specifically, in the component semantic modeling module, we design a component
semantic guidance mechanism to direct a set of learnable prototypes in
capturing the semantics of different components from objects. Leveraging these
prototypes, we develop a component semantic-enhanced masking strategy that
addresses the limitations of random masking in effectively covering complete
component structures. Furthermore, we introduce a component semantic-enhanced
prompt-tuning strategy, which further leverages these prototypes to improve the
performance of pre-trained models in downstream tasks. Extensive experiments
conducted on datasets such as ScanObjectNN, ModelNet40, and ShapeNetPart
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed modules.

Abstract: We address the problem of generating long-horizon videos for robotic
manipulation tasks. Text-to-video diffusion models have made significant
progress in photorealism, language understanding, and motion generation but
struggle with long-horizon robotic tasks. Recent works use video diffusion
models for high-quality simulation data and predictive rollouts in robot
planning. However, these works predict short sequences of the robot achieving
one task and employ an autoregressive paradigm to extend to the long horizon,
leading to error accumulations in the generated video and in the execution. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a novel pipeline that bypasses the need
for autoregressive generation. We achieve this through a threefold
contribution: 1) we first decompose the high-level goals into smaller atomic
tasks and generate keyframes aligned with these instructions. A second
diffusion model then interpolates between each of the two generated frames,
achieving the long-horizon video. 2) We propose a semantics preserving
attention module to maintain consistency between the keyframes. 3) We design a
lightweight policy model to regress the robot joint states from generated
videos. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on two benchmarks in
video quality and consistency while outperforming previous policy models on
long-horizon tasks.

Abstract: Zero-shot Semantic Segmentation (ZSS) aims to segment both seen and unseen
classes using supervision from only seen classes. Beyond adaptation-based
methods, distillation-based approaches transfer vision-language alignment of
vision-language model, e.g., CLIP, to segmentation models. However, such
knowledge transfer remains challenging due to: (1) the difficulty of aligning
vision-based features with the textual space, which requires combining spatial
precision with vision-language alignment; and (2) the semantic gap between
CLIP's global representations and the local, fine-grained features of
segmentation models. To address challenge (1), we propose Chimera-Seg, which
integrates a segmentation backbone as the body and a CLIP-based semantic head
as the head, like the Chimera in Greek mythology, combining spatial precision
with vision-language alignment. Specifically, Chimera-Seg comprises a trainable
segmentation model and a CLIP Semantic Head (CSH), which maps dense features
into the CLIP-aligned space. The CSH incorporates a frozen subnetwork and fixed
projection layers from the CLIP visual encoder, along with lightweight
trainable components. The partial module from CLIP visual encoder, paired with
the segmentation model, retains segmentation capability while easing the
mapping to CLIP's semantic space. To address challenge (2), we propose
Selective Global Distillation (SGD), which distills knowledge from dense
features exhibiting high similarity to the CLIP CLS token, while gradually
reducing the number of features used for alignment as training progresses.
Besides, we also use a Semantic Alignment Module (SAM) to further align dense
visual features with semantic embeddings extracted from the frozen CLIP text
encoder. Experiments on two benchmarks show improvements of 0.9% and 1.2% in
hIoU.

Conclusion: FIAG为高效、可扩展的说话头合成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reconstruction and rendering-based talking head synthesis methods achieve
high-quality results with strong identity preservation but are limited by their
dependence on identity-specific models. Each new identity requires training
from scratch, incurring high computational costs and reduced scalability
compared to generative model-based approaches. To overcome this limitation, we
propose FIAG, a novel 3D speaking head synthesis framework that enables
efficient identity-specific adaptation using only a few training footage. FIAG
incorporates Global Gaussian Field, which supports the representation of
multiple identities within a shared field, and Universal Motion Field, which
captures the common motion dynamics across diverse identities. Benefiting from
the shared facial structure information encoded in the Global Gaussian Field
and the general motion priors learned in the motion field, our framework
enables rapid adaptation from canonical identity representations to specific
ones with minimal data. Extensive comparative and ablation experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches,
validating both the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed
framework. Code is available at: \textit{https://github.com/gme-hong/FIAG}.

Abstract: Audio-driven portrait animation, which synthesizes realistic videos from
reference images using audio signals, faces significant challenges in real-time
generation of high-fidelity, temporally coherent animations. While recent
diffusion-based methods improve generation quality by integrating audio into
denoising processes, their reliance on frame-by-frame UNet architectures
introduces prohibitive latency and struggles with temporal consistency. This
paper introduces MirrorMe, a real-time, controllable framework built on the LTX
video model, a diffusion transformer that compresses video spatially and
temporally for efficient latent space denoising. To address LTX's trade-offs
between compression and semantic fidelity, we propose three innovations: 1. A
reference identity injection mechanism via VAE-encoded image concatenation and
self-attention, ensuring identity consistency; 2. A causal audio encoder and
adapter tailored to LTX's temporal structure, enabling precise audio-expression
synchronization; and 3. A progressive training strategy combining close-up
facial training, half-body synthesis with facial masking, and hand pose
integration for enhanced gesture control. Extensive experiments on the EMTD
Benchmark demonstrate MirrorMe's state-of-the-art performance in fidelity,
lip-sync accuracy, and temporal stability.

Result: TPM在分割准确性上有所提升，尤其在处理非典型背景特征时表现更好。

Conclusion: TPM为医学图像少样本分割提供了新的视角，解决了ADNet的关键问题。

Abstract: Common prototype-based medical image few-shot segmentation (FSS) methods
model foreground and background classes using class-specific prototypes.
However, given the high variability of the background, a more promising
direction is to focus solely on foreground modeling, treating the background as
an anomaly -- an approach introduced by ADNet. Yet, ADNet faces three key
limitations: dependence on a single prototype per class, a focus on binary
classification, and fixed thresholds that fail to adapt to patient and organ
variability. To address these shortcomings, we propose the Tied Prototype Model
(TPM), a principled reformulation of ADNet with tied prototype locations for
foreground and background distributions. Building on its probabilistic
foundation, TPM naturally extends to multiple prototypes and multi-class
segmentation while effectively separating non-typical background features.
Notably, both extensions lead to improved segmentation accuracy. Finally, we
leverage naturally occurring class priors to define an ideal target for
adaptive thresholds, boosting segmentation performance. Taken together, TPM
provides a fresh perspective on prototype-based FSS for medical image
segmentation. The code can be found at https://github.com/hjk92g/TPM-FSS.

Conclusion: CP-INR结合了CP分解的可解释性和神经网络的非线性能力，为连续数据表示提供了高效且理论保障的解决方案。

Abstract: Higher-order tensors are well-suited for representing multi-dimensional data,
such as color images and videos. Low-rank tensor representation has become
essential in machine learning and computer vision, but existing methods like
Tucker decomposition offer flexibility at the expense of interpretability. In
contrast, while the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition provides a more
natural and interpretable tensor structure, obtaining sparse solutions remains
challenging. Leveraging the rich properties of CP decomposition, we propose a
CP-based low-rank tensor function parameterized by neural networks for implicit
neural representation (CP-INR). This approach enables continuous data
representation beyond structured grids, fully exploiting the non-linearity of
tensor data with theoretical guarantees on excess risk bounds. To achieve a
sparse CP decomposition, we introduce a variational form of the Schatten-p
quasi-norm and prove its relationship to multilinear rank minimization. For
smoothness, we propose a regularization term based on the spectral norm of the
Jacobian and Hutchinson's trace estimator. Our proposed smoothness
regularization is SVD-free and avoids explicit chain rule derivations. It can
serve as an alternative to Total Variation (TV) regularization in image
denoising tasks and is naturally applicable to continuous data. Extensive
experiments on multi-dimensional data recovery tasks, including image
inpainting, denoising, and point cloud upsampling, demonstrate the superiority
and versatility of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: RetFiner通过视觉语言精炼有效改进了基础模型的表征能力和适应性。

Abstract: The rise of imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) and
advances in deep learning (DL) have enabled clinicians and researchers to
streamline retinal disease staging. A popular DL approach is self-supervised
learning (SSL), where models learn from vast amounts of unlabeled data,
avoiding costly annotation. SSL has allowed the development of foundation
models (FMs), large models that can be used for a variety of downstream tasks.
However, existing FMs for OCT, trained solely on image data, lack a
comprehensive and robust semantic understanding of images, as evidenced by
their downstream performance (especially for complex tasks), and thus require
supervised fine-tuning (which may be unfeasible) to better adapt to specific
applications and populations. To address this, we propose RetFiner, an SSL
vision-language refinement scheme that improves the representations of existing
FMs and enables their efficient and direct adaptation to specific populations
for improved downstream performance. Our method uses a diverse set of training
objectives which take advantage of the rich supervisory signal found in textual
data. We tested RetFiner on the retinal FMs RETFound, UrFound, and VisionFM,
showing significant improvements in linear probing performance on seven highly
diverse OCT classification tasks, with an average increase of 5.8, 3.9, and 2.1

Conclusion: UOFS框架通过特征解耦和优化策略有效提升了Few-shot目标检测的性能。

Abstract: Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims to detect objects with limited samples
for novel classes, while relying on abundant data for base classes. Existing
FSOD approaches, predominantly built on the Faster R-CNN detector, entangle
objectness recognition and foreground classification within shared feature
spaces. This paradigm inherently establishes class-specific objectness criteria
and suffers from unrepresentative novel class samples. To resolve this
limitation, we propose a Uniform Orthogonal Feature Space (UOFS) optimization
framework. First, UOFS decouples the feature space into two orthogonal
components, where magnitude encodes objectness and angle encodes
classification. This decoupling enables transferring class-agnostic objectness
knowledge from base classes to novel classes. Moreover, implementing the
disentanglement requires careful attention to two challenges: (1) Base set
images contain unlabeled foreground instances, causing confusion between
potential novel class instances and backgrounds. (2) Angular optimization
depends exclusively on base class foreground instances, inducing overfitting of
angular distributions to base classes. To address these challenges, we propose
a Hybrid Background Optimization (HBO) strategy: (1) Constructing a pure
background base set by removing unlabeled instances in original images to
provide unbiased magnitude-based objectness supervision. (2) Incorporating
unlabeled foreground instances in the original base set into angular
optimization to enhance distribution uniformity. Additionally, we propose a
Spatial-wise Attention Disentanglement and Association (SADA) module to address
task conflicts between class-agnostic and class-specific tasks. Experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches based
on entangled feature spaces.

Abstract: Zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition aims to develop models capable of
identifying actions beyond the categories encountered during training. Previous
approaches have primarily focused on aligning visual and semantic
representations but often overlooked the importance of fine-grained action
patterns in the semantic space (e.g., the hand movements in drinking water and
brushing teeth). To address these limitations, we propose a Frequency-Semantic
Enhanced Variational Autoencoder (FS-VAE) to explore the skeleton semantic
representation learning with frequency decomposition. FS-VAE consists of three
key components: 1) a frequency-based enhancement module with high- and
low-frequency adjustments to enrich the skeletal semantics learning and improve
the robustness of zero-shot action recognition; 2) a semantic-based action
description with multilevel alignment to capture both local details and global
correspondence, effectively bridging the semantic gap and compensating for the
inherent loss of information in skeleton sequences; 3) a calibrated
cross-alignment loss that enables valid skeleton-text pairs to counterbalance
ambiguous ones, mitigating discrepancies and ambiguities in skeleton and text
features, thereby ensuring robust alignment. Evaluations on the benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, validating that
frequency-enhanced semantic features enable robust differentiation of visually
and semantically similar action clusters, improving zero-shot action
recognition.

Abstract: Image restoration is a key task in low-level computer vision that aims to

a significant advancement in this field. Vision Mamba demonstrates excellence

Conclusion: OutDreamer通过DiT和创新的组件设计，显著提升了视频外绘的质量和适应性。

Abstract: Video outpainting is a challenging task that generates new video content by
extending beyond the boundaries of an original input video, requiring both
temporal and spatial consistency. Many state-of-the-art methods utilize latent
diffusion models with U-Net backbones but still struggle to achieve high
quality and adaptability in generated content. Diffusion transformers (DiTs)
have emerged as a promising alternative because of their superior performance.
We introduce OutDreamer, a DiT-based video outpainting framework comprising two
main components: an efficient video control branch and a conditional
outpainting branch. The efficient video control branch effectively extracts
masked video information, while the conditional outpainting branch generates
missing content based on these extracted conditions. Additionally, we propose a
mask-driven self-attention layer that dynamically integrates the given mask
information, further enhancing the model's adaptability to outpainting tasks.
Furthermore, we introduce a latent alignment loss to maintain overall
consistency both within and between frames. For long video outpainting, we
employ a cross-video-clip refiner to iteratively generate missing content,
ensuring temporal consistency across video clips. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that our zero-shot OutDreamer outperforms state-of-the-art
zero-shot methods on widely recognized benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep generative modeling have unlocked unprecedented
opportunities for video synthesis. In real-world applications, however, users
often seek tools to faithfully realize their creative editing intentions with
precise and consistent control. Despite the progress achieved by existing
methods, ensuring fine-grained alignment with user intentions remains an open
and challenging problem. In this work, we present Shape-for-Motion, a novel
framework that incorporates a 3D proxy for precise and consistent video
editing. Shape-for-Motion achieves this by converting the target object in the
input video to a time-consistent mesh, i.e., a 3D proxy, allowing edits to be
performed directly on the proxy and then inferred back to the video frames. To
simplify the editing process, we design a novel Dual-Propagation Strategy that
allows users to perform edits on the 3D mesh of a single frame, and the edits
are then automatically propagated to the 3D meshes of the other frames. The 3D
meshes for different frames are further projected onto the 2D space to produce
the edited geometry and texture renderings, which serve as inputs to a
decoupled video diffusion model for generating edited results. Our framework
supports various precise and physically-consistent manipulations across the
video frames, including pose editing, rotation, scaling, translation, texture
modification, and object composition. Our approach marks a key step toward
high-quality, controllable video editing workflows. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our approach. Project page:

32$\times$ storage reduction; (2) attention-guided dynamic pruning, utilizing
Vision-Language Model attention weights to retain only the top-$p\%$ most
salient patches, reducing late-interaction computation by up to 60\% with less

distance-based similarity search for resource-constrained environments.
Evaluated on the ViDoRe and SEC-Filings datasets, HPC-ColPali achieves 30--50\%

Conclusion: StableCodec 在极低比特率下实现了高真实感和高保真，同时提升了编码效率，适用于实时压缩场景。

Abstract: Diffusion-based image compression has shown remarkable potential for
achieving ultra-low bitrate coding (less than 0.05 bits per pixel) with high
realism, by leveraging the generative priors of large pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models. However, current approaches require a large number of
denoising steps at the decoder to generate realistic results under extreme
bitrate constraints, limiting their application in real-time compression
scenarios. Additionally, these methods often sacrifice reconstruction fidelity,
as diffusion models typically fail to guarantee pixel-level consistency. To
address these challenges, we introduce StableCodec, which enables one-step
diffusion for high-fidelity and high-realism extreme image compression with
improved coding efficiency. To achieve ultra-low bitrates, we first develop an
efficient Deep Compression Latent Codec to transmit a noisy latent
representation for a single-step denoising process. We then propose a
Dual-Branch Coding Structure, consisting of a pair of auxiliary encoder and
decoder, to enhance reconstruction fidelity. Furthermore, we adopt end-to-end
optimization with joint bitrate and pixel-level constraints. Extensive
experiments on the CLIC 2020, DIV2K, and Kodak dataset demonstrate that

Motivation: 解决低剂量CT重建模型在未见剂量数据上的泛化问题，尤其是噪声分布非高斯和先验信息不准确带来的挑战。

Method: 1) 提出移位泊松扩散模型用于投影数据去噪；2) 设计双引导扩散模型用于图像重建；3) 通过时间步匹配策略扩展到未见剂量。

Conclusion: NEED仅需正常剂量数据训练，可有效泛化到不同剂量水平，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: The generalization of deep learning-based low-dose computed tomography (CT)
reconstruction models to doses unseen in the training data is important and
remains challenging. Previous efforts heavily rely on paired data to improve
the generalization performance and robustness through collecting either diverse
CT data for re-training or a few test data for fine-tuning. Recently, diffusion
models have shown promising and generalizable performance in low-dose CT (LDCT)
reconstruction, however, they may produce unrealistic structures due to the CT
image noise deviating from Gaussian distribution and imprecise prior
information from the guidance of noisy LDCT images. In this paper, we propose a
noise-inspired diffusion model for generalizable LDCT reconstruction, termed
NEED, which tailors diffusion models for noise characteristics of each domain.
First, we propose a novel shifted Poisson diffusion model to denoise projection
data, which aligns the diffusion process with the noise model in pre-log LDCT
projections. Second, we devise a doubly guided diffusion model to refine
reconstructed images, which leverages LDCT images and initial reconstructions
to more accurately locate prior information and enhance reconstruction
fidelity. By cascading these two diffusion models for dual-domain
reconstruction, our NEED requires only normal-dose data for training and can be
effectively extended to various unseen dose levels during testing via a time
step matching strategy. Extensive qualitative, quantitative, and
segmentation-based evaluations on two datasets demonstrate that our NEED
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction and
generalization performance. Source code is made available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态CBCT在放疗中因呼吸运动产生伪影，现有方法如相位排序和隐式运动表示存在计算成本高或运动不一致的缺陷。

Method: 引入FFD空间基函数和变形感知框架，统一高斯均值位置、尺度和旋转的时变演化，实现高效运动补偿。

Result: 在六个CBCT数据集上验证，图像质量优于HexPlane，速度提升6倍。

Conclusion: 变形感知4DGS为高效动态CBCT重建提供了新思路。

Abstract: 3D Cone-Beam CT (CBCT) is widely used in radiotherapy but suffers from motion
artifacts due to breathing. A common clinical approach mitigates this by
sorting projections into respiratory phases and reconstructing images per
phase, but this does not account for breathing variability. Dynamic CBCT
instead reconstructs images at each projection, capturing continuous motion
without phase sorting. Recent advancements in 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS)
offer powerful tools for modeling dynamic scenes, yet their application to
dynamic CBCT remains underexplored. Existing 4DGS methods, such as HexPlane,
use implicit motion representations, which are computationally expensive. While
explicit low-rank motion models have been proposed, they lack spatial
regularization, leading to inconsistencies in Gaussian motion. To address these
limitations, we introduce a free-form deformation (FFD)-based spatial basis
function and a deformation-informed framework that enforces consistency by
coupling the temporal evolution of Gaussian's mean position, scale, and
rotation under a unified deformation field. We evaluate our approach on six
CBCT datasets, demonstrating superior image quality with a 6x speedup over
HexPlane. These results highlight the potential of deformation-informed 4DGS
for efficient, motion-compensated CBCT reconstruction. The code is available at

Conclusion: QuKAN架构为量子机器学习提供了一种新的方法，结合了KANs和量子电路的优势。

Abstract: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs), built upon the Kolmogorov Arnold
representation theorem (KAR), have demonstrated promising capabilities in
expressing complex functions with fewer neurons. This is achieved by
implementing learnable parameters on the edges instead of on the nodes, unlike
traditional networks such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). However, KANs
potential in quantum machine learning has not yet been well explored. In this
work, we present an implementation of these KAN architectures in both hybrid
and fully quantum forms using a Quantum Circuit Born Machine (QCBM). We adapt
the KAN transfer using pre-trained residual functions, thereby exploiting the
representational power of parametrized quantum circuits. In the hybrid model we
combine classical KAN components with quantum subroutines, while the fully
quantum version the entire architecture of the residual function is translated
to a quantum model. We demonstrate the feasibility, interpretability and
performance of the proposed Quantum KAN (QuKAN) architecture.

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation have led to remarkable improvements in
synthesizing perspective images. However, these models still struggle with
panoramic image generation due to unique challenges, including varying levels
of geometric distortion and the requirement for seamless loop-consistency. To
address these issues while leveraging the strengths of the existing models, we
introduce TanDiT, a method that synthesizes panoramic scenes by generating
grids of tangent-plane images covering the entire 360$^\circ$ view. Unlike
previous methods relying on multiple diffusion branches, TanDiT utilizes a
unified diffusion model trained to produce these tangent-plane images
simultaneously within a single denoising iteration. Furthermore, we propose a
model-agnostic post-processing step specifically designed to enhance global
coherence across the generated panoramas. To accurately assess panoramic image
quality, we also present two specialized metrics, TangentIS and TangentFID, and
provide a comprehensive benchmark comprising captioned panoramic datasets and
standardized evaluation scripts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method generalizes effectively beyond its training data, robustly interprets
detailed and complex text prompts, and seamlessly integrates with various
generative models to yield high-quality, diverse panoramic images.

Abstract: Learning semantically meaningful representations from unstructured 3D point
clouds remains a central challenge in computer vision, especially in the
absence of large-scale labeled datasets. While masked point modeling (MPM) is
widely used in self-supervised 3D learning, its reconstruction-based objective
can limit its ability to capture high-level semantics. We propose AsymDSD, an
Asymmetric Dual Self-Distillation framework that unifies masked modeling and
invariance learning through prediction in the latent space rather than the
input space. AsymDSD builds on a joint embedding architecture and introduces
several key design choices: an efficient asymmetric setup, disabling attention
between masked queries to prevent shape leakage, multi-mask sampling, and a
point cloud adaptation of multi-crop. AsymDSD achieves state-of-the-art results

Abstract: Inpainting, the process of filling missing or corrupted image parts, has
broad applications, including medical imaging. However, in specialized fields
like medical polyps imaging, where accuracy and reliability are critical,
inpainting models can generate inaccurate images, leading to significant errors
in medical diagnosis and treatment. To ensure reliability, medical images
should be annotated by experts like oncologists for effective model training.
We propose PrefPaint, an approach that incorporates human feedback into the
training process of Stable Diffusion Inpainting, bypassing the need for
computationally expensive reward models. In addition, we develop a web-based
interface streamlines training, fine-tuning, and inference. This interactive
interface provides a smooth and intuitive user experience, making it easier to
offer feedback and manage the fine-tuning process. User study on various
domains shows that PrefPaint outperforms existing methods, reducing visual
inconsistencies and improving image rendering, particularly in medical
contexts, where our model generates more realistic polyps images.

Abstract: The recent progress of CNN has dramatically improved face alignment
performance. However, few works have paid attention to the error-bias with
respect to error distribution of facial landmarks. In this paper, we
investigate the error-bias issue in face alignment, where the distributions of
landmark errors tend to spread along the tangent line to landmark curves. This
error-bias is not trivial since it is closely connected to the ambiguous
landmark labeling task. Inspired by this observation, we seek a way to leverage
the error-bias property for better convergence of CNN model. To this end, we
propose anisotropic direction loss (ADL) and anisotropic attention module (AAM)
for coordinate and heatmap regression, respectively. ADL imposes strong binding
force in normal direction for each landmark point on facial boundaries. On the
other hand, AAM is an attention module which can get anisotropic attention mask
focusing on the region of point and its local edge connected by adjacent
points, it has a stronger response in tangent than in normal, which means
relaxed constraints in the tangent. These two methods work in a complementary
manner to learn both facial structures and texture details. Finally, we
integrate them into an optimized end-to-end training pipeline named ADNet. Our
ADNet achieves state-of-the-art results on 300W, WFLW and COFW datasets, which
demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D visual stimuli from Electroencephalography (EEG) data holds
significant potential for applications in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) and
aiding individuals with communication disorders. Traditionally, efforts have
focused on converting brain activity into 2D images, neglecting the translation
of EEG data into 3D objects. This limitation is noteworthy, as the human brain
inherently processes three-dimensional spatial information regardless of
whether observing 2D images or the real world. The neural activities captured
by EEG contain rich spatial information that is inevitably lost when
reconstructing only 2D images, thus limiting its practical applications in BCI.
The transition from EEG data to 3D object reconstruction faces considerable
obstacles. These include the presence of extensive noise within EEG signals and
a scarcity of datasets that include both EEG and 3D information, which
complicates the extraction process of 3D visual data. Addressing this
challenging task, we propose an innovative EEG encoder architecture that
integrates a dual self-attention mechanism. We use a hybrid training strategy
to train the EEG Encoder, which includes cross-attention, contrastive learning,
and self-supervised learning techniques. Additionally, by employing stable
diffusion as a prior distribution and utilizing Variational Score Distillation
to train a neural radiation field, we successfully generate 3D objects with
similar content and structure from EEG data.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed significant growth of face alignment. Though
dense facial landmark is highly demanded in various scenarios, e.g., cosmetic
medicine and facial beautification, most works only consider sparse face
alignment. To address this problem, we present a framework that can enrich
landmark density by existing sparse landmark datasets, e.g., 300W with 68
points and WFLW with 98 points. Firstly, we observe that the local patches
along each semantic contour are highly similar in appearance. Then, we propose
a weakly-supervised idea of learning the refinement ability on original sparse
landmarks and adapting this ability to enriched dense landmarks. Meanwhile,
several operators are devised and organized together to implement the idea.
Finally, the trained model is applied as a plug-and-play module to the existing
face alignment networks. To evaluate our method, we manually label the dense
landmarks on 300W testset. Our method yields state-of-the-art accuracy not only
in newly-constructed dense 300W testset but also in the original sparse 300W
and WFLW testsets without additional cost.

Abstract: RGB-IR(RGB-Infrared) image pairs are frequently applied simultaneously in
various applications like intelligent surveillance. However, as the number of
modalities increases, the required data storage and transmission costs also
double. Therefore, efficient RGB-IR data compression is essential. This work
proposes a joint compression framework for RGB-IR image pair. Specifically, to
fully utilize cross-modality prior information for accurate context probability
modeling within and between modalities, we propose a Channel-wise
Cross-modality Entropy Model (CCEM). Among CCEM, a Low-frequency Context
Extraction Block (LCEB) and a Low-frequency Context Fusion Block (LCFB) are
designed for extracting and aggregating the global low-frequency information
from both modalities, which assist the model in predicting entropy parameters
more accurately. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms
existing RGB-IR image pair and single-modality compression methods on LLVIP and
KAIST datasets. For instance, the proposed framework achieves a 23.1% bit rate
saving on LLVIP dataset compared to the state-of-the-art RGB-IR image codec

Abstract: Psoriasis (PsO) severity scoring is important for clinical trials but is
hindered by inter-rater variability and the burden of in person clinical
evaluation. Remote imaging using patient captured mobile photos offers
scalability but introduces challenges, such as variation in lighting,
background, and device quality that are often imperceptible to humans but can
impact model performance. These factors, along with inconsistencies in
dermatologist annotations, reduce the reliability of automated severity
scoring. We propose a framework to automatically flag problematic training
images that introduce spurious correlations which degrade model generalization,
using a gradient based interpretability approach. By tracing the gradients of
misclassified validation images, we detect training samples where model errors
align with inconsistently rated examples or are affected by subtle, nonclinical
artifacts. We apply this method to a ConvNeXT based weakly supervised model
designed to classify PsO severity from phone images. Removing 8.2% of flagged
images improves model AUC-ROC by 5% (85% to 90%) on a held out test set.
Commonly, multiple annotators and an adjudication process ensure annotation
accuracy, which is expensive and time consuming. Our method detects training
images with annotation inconsistencies, potentially removing the need for
manual review. When applied to a subset of training data rated by two
dermatologists, the method identifies over 90% of cases with inter-rater
disagreement by reviewing only the top 30% of samples. This improves automated
scoring for remote assessments, ensuring robustness despite data collection
variability.

Abstract: As point cloud data increases in prevalence in a variety of applications, the
ability to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) point cloud objects becomes
critical for ensuring model safety and reliability. However, this problem
remains under-explored in existing research. Inspired by success in the image
domain, we propose to exploit advances in 3D vision-language models (3D VLMs)
for OOD detection in point cloud objects. However, a major challenge is that
point cloud datasets used to pre-train 3D VLMs are drastically smaller in size
and object diversity than their image-based counterparts. Critically, they
often contain exclusively computer-designed synthetic objects. This leads to a
substantial domain shift when the model is transferred to practical tasks
involving real objects scanned from the physical environment. In this paper,
our empirical experiments show that synthetic-to-real domain shift
significantly degrades the alignment of point cloud with their associated text
embeddings in the 3D VLM latent space, hindering downstream performance. To
address this, we propose a novel methodology called SODA which improves the
detection of OOD point clouds through a neighborhood-based score propagation
scheme. SODA is inference-based, requires no additional model training, and
achieves state-of-the-art performance over existing approaches across datasets
and problem settings.

Result: SepFormer在SciTSR等数据集上达到25.6 FPS，性能与SOTA方法相当。

Conclusion: SepFormer通过单步范式显著提升了TSR的效率和效果。

Abstract: The automated reconstruction of the logical arrangement of tables from image
data, termed Table Structure Recognition (TSR), is fundamental for semantic
data extraction. Recently, researchers have explored a wide range of techniques
to tackle this problem, demonstrating significant progress. Each table is a set
of vertical and horizontal separators. Following this realization, we present
SepFormer, which integrates the split-and-merge paradigm into a single step
through separator regression with a DETR-style architecture, improving speed
and robustness. SepFormer is a coarse-to-fine approach that predicts table
separators from single-line to line-strip separators with a stack of two
transformer decoders. In the coarse-grained stage, the model learns to
gradually refine single-line segments through decoder layers with additional
angle loss. At the end of the fine-grained stage, the model predicts line-strip
separators by refining sampled points from each single-line segment. Our
SepFormer can run on average at 25.6 FPS while achieving comparable performance
with state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets, including SciTSR,
PubTabNet, WTW, and iFLYTAB.

Motivation: 现有RGB-T语义分割模型依赖低层视觉特征，缺乏高层文本信息，导致相似视觉类别分割不准确；SAM在实例级分割表现优异，但与热图像和文本的整合存在挑战。

Result: 在多样化数据集上验证，TASeg在挑战性场景中表现优异，且训练参数较少。

Conclusion: TASeg通过结合视觉和文本信息，显著提升了RGB-T语义分割的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Reliable semantic segmentation of open environments is essential for
intelligent systems, yet significant problems remain: 1) Existing RGB-T
semantic segmentation models mainly rely on low-level visual features and lack
high-level textual information, which struggle with accurate segmentation when
categories share similar visual characteristics. 2) While SAM excels in
instance-level segmentation, integrating it with thermal images and text is
hindered by modality heterogeneity and computational inefficiency. To address
these, we propose TASeg, a text-aware RGB-T segmentation framework by using
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning technology to adapt vision foundation
models. Specifically, we propose a Dynamic Feature Fusion Module (DFFM) in the
image encoder, which effectively merges features from multiple visual
modalities while freezing SAM's original transformer blocks. Additionally, we
incorporate CLIP-generated text embeddings in the mask decoder to enable
semantic alignment, which further rectifies the classification error and
improves the semantic understanding accuracy. Experimental results across
diverse datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in
challenging scenarios with fewer trainable parameters.

Abstract: Facial stylization aims to transform facial images into appealing,
high-quality stylized portraits, with the critical challenge of accurately
learning the target style while maintaining content consistency with the
original image. Although previous StyleGAN-based methods have made significant
advancements, the generated results still suffer from artifacts or insufficient
fidelity to the source image. We argue that these issues stem from neglecting
semantic shift of the generator during stylization. Therefore, we propose a
facial stylization method that integrates semantic preservation constraint and
pseudo-paired supervision to enhance the content correspondence and improve the
stylization effect. Additionally, we develop a methodology for creating
multi-level pseudo-paired datasets to implement supervisory constraint.
Furthermore, building upon our facial stylization framework, we achieve more
flexible multimodal and reference-guided stylization without complex network
architecture designs or additional training. Experimental results demonstrate
that our approach produces high-fidelity, aesthetically pleasing facial style
transfer that surpasses previous methods.

Abstract: Detecting and tracking ground objects using earth observation imagery remains
a significant challenge in the field of remote sensing. Continuous maritime
ship tracking is crucial for applications such as maritime search and rescue,
law enforcement, and shipping analysis. However, most current ship tracking
methods rely on geostationary satellites or video satellites. The former offer
low resolution and are susceptible to weather conditions, while the latter have
short filming durations and limited coverage areas, making them less suitable
for the real-world requirements of ship tracking. To address these limitations,
we present the Hybrid Optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Ship
Re-Identification Dataset (HOSS ReID dataset), designed to evaluate the
effectiveness of ship tracking using low-Earth orbit constellations of optical
and SAR sensors. This approach ensures shorter re-imaging cycles and enables
all-weather tracking. HOSS ReID dataset includes images of the same ship
captured over extended periods under diverse conditions, using different
satellites of different modalities at varying times and angles. Furthermore, we
propose a baseline method for cross-modal ship re-identification, TransOSS,
which is built on the Vision Transformer architecture. It refines the patch
embedding structure to better accommodate cross-modal tasks, incorporates
additional embeddings to introduce more reference information, and employs
contrastive learning to pre-train on large-scale optical-SAR image pairs,
ensuring the model's ability to extract modality-invariant features. Our

Abstract: The realistic reconstruction of street scenes is critical for developing
real-world simulators in autonomous driving. Most existing methods rely on
object pose annotations, using these poses to reconstruct dynamic objects and
move them during the rendering process. This dependence on high-precision
object annotations limits large-scale and extensive scene reconstruction. To
address this challenge, we propose B\'ezier curve Gaussian splatting
(B\'ezierGS), which represents the motion trajectories of dynamic objects using
learnable B\'ezier curves. This approach fully leverages the temporal
information of dynamic objects and, through learnable curve modeling,
automatically corrects pose errors. By introducing additional supervision on
dynamic object rendering and inter-curve consistency constraints, we achieve
reasonable and accurate separation and reconstruction of scene elements.
Extensive experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset and the nuPlan benchmark
demonstrate that B\'ezierGS outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in both
dynamic and static scene components reconstruction and novel view synthesis.

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in autonomous driving, accurately predicting
pedestrian behavior has become essential for ensuring safety in complex and
unpredictable traffic conditions. The growing interest in this challenge
highlights the need for comprehensive datasets that capture unstructured
environments, enabling the development of more robust prediction models to
enhance pedestrian safety and vehicle navigation. In this paper, we introduce
an Indian driving pedestrian dataset designed to address the complexities of
modeling pedestrian behavior in unstructured environments, such as illumination
changes, occlusion of pedestrians, unsignalized scene types and
vehicle-pedestrian interactions. The dataset provides high-level and detailed
low-level comprehensive annotations focused on pedestrians requiring the
ego-vehicle's attention. Evaluation of the state-of-the-art intention
prediction methods on our dataset shows a significant performance drop of up to
$\mathbf{15\%}$, while trajectory prediction methods underperform with an
increase of up to $\mathbf{1208}$ MSE, defeating standard pedestrian datasets.
Additionally, we present exhaustive quantitative and qualitative analysis of
intention and trajectory baselines. We believe that our dataset will open new
challenges for the pedestrian behavior research community to build robust
models. Project Page:

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement presents two primary challenges: 1) Significant

levels influenced by subjective preferences and user intent. To address these
issues, we propose ReF-LLE, a novel personalized low-light image enhancement
method that operates in the Fourier frequency domain and incorporates deep
reinforcement learning. ReF-LLE is the first to integrate deep reinforcement
learning into this domain. During training, a zero-reference image evaluation
strategy is introduced to score enhanced images, providing reward signals that
guide the model to handle varying degrees of low-light conditions effectively.
In the inference phase, ReF-LLE employs a personalized adaptive iterative
strategy, guided by the zero-frequency component in the Fourier domain, which
represents the overall illumination level. This strategy enables the model to
adaptively adjust low-light images to align with the illumination distribution
of a user-provided reference image, ensuring personalized enhancement results.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that ReF-LLE
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior perceptual quality and
adaptability in personalized low-light image enhancement.

Abstract: Understanding the impact of small quantum gate perturbations, which are
common in quantum digital devices but absent in classical computers, is crucial
for identifying potential advantages in quantum machine learning. While these
perturbations are typically seen as detrimental to quantum computation, they
can actually enhance performance by serving as a natural source of data
augmentation. Additionally, they can often be efficiently simulated on
classical hardware, enabling quantum-inspired approaches to improve classical
machine learning methods. In this paper, we investigate random Bloch sphere
rotations, which are fundamental SU(2) transformations, as a simple yet
effective quantum-inspired data augmentation technique. Unlike conventional
augmentations such as flipping, rotating, or cropping, quantum transformations
lack intuitive spatial interpretations, making their application to tasks like
image classification less straightforward. While common quantum augmentation
methods rely on applying quantum models or trainable quanvolutional layers to
classical datasets, we focus on the direct application of small-angle Bloch
rotations and their effect on classical data. Using the large-scale ImageNet
dataset, we demonstrate that our quantum-inspired augmentation method improves
image classification performance, increasing Top-1 accuracy by 3%, Top-5
accuracy by 2.5%, and the F$_1$ score from 8% to 12% compared to standard
classical augmentation methods. Finally, we examine the use of stronger unitary
augmentations. Although these transformations preserve information in
principle, they result in visually unrecognizable images with potential
applications for privacy computations. However, we show that our augmentation
approach and simple SU(2) transformations do not enhance differential privacy
and discuss the implications of this limitation.

Abstract: Leveraging diverse robotic data for pretraining remains a critical challenge.
Existing methods typically model the dataset's action distribution using simple
observations as inputs. However, these inputs are often incomplete, resulting
in a dispersed conditional action distribution-an issue we refer to as
coordinate system chaos and state chaos. This inconsistency significantly
hampers pretraining efficiency. To address this, we propose 4D-VLA, a novel
approach that effectively integrates 4D information into the input to mitigate
these sources of chaos. Our model introduces depth and temporal information
into visual features with sequential RGB-D inputs, aligning the coordinate
systems of the robot and the scene. This alignment endows the model with strong
spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities while minimizing training overhead.
Additionally, we introduce memory bank sampling, a frame sampling strategy
designed to extract informative frames from historical images, further
improving effectiveness and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that
our pretraining method and architectural components substantially enhance model
performance. In both simulated and real-world experiments, our model achieves a
significant increase in success rate over OpenVLA. To further assess spatial
perception and generalization to novel views, we introduce MV-Bench, a
multi-view simulation benchmark. Our model consistently outperforms existing
methods, demonstrating stronger spatial understanding and adaptability.

Abstract: Generating realistic 3D indoor scenes from user inputs remains a challenging
problem in computer vision and graphics, requiring careful balance of geometric
consistency, spatial relationships, and visual realism. While neural generation
methods often produce repetitive elements due to limited global spatial
reasoning, procedural approaches can leverage constraints for controllable
generation but struggle with multi-constraint scenarios. When constraints
become numerous, object collisions frequently occur, forcing the removal of
furniture items and compromising layout completeness.
  To address these limitations, we propose RoomCraft, a multi-stage pipeline
that converts real images, sketches, or text descriptions into coherent 3D
indoor scenes. Our approach combines a scene generation pipeline with a
constraint-driven optimization framework. The pipeline first extracts
high-level scene information from user inputs and organizes it into a
structured format containing room type, furniture items, and spatial relations.
It then constructs a spatial relationship network to represent furniture
arrangements and generates an optimized placement sequence using a
heuristic-based depth-first search (HDFS) algorithm to ensure layout coherence.
To handle complex multi-constraint scenarios, we introduce a unified constraint
representation that processes both formal specifications and natural language
inputs, enabling flexible constraint-oriented adjustments through a
comprehensive action space design. Additionally, we propose a Conflict-Aware
Positioning Strategy (CAPS) that dynamically adjusts placement weights to
minimize furniture collisions and ensure layout completeness.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoomCraft significantly outperforms
existing methods in generating realistic, semantically coherent, and visually
appealing room layouts across diverse input modalities.

Abstract: Building damage identification shortly after a disaster is crucial for
guiding emergency response and recovery efforts. Although optical satellite
imagery is commonly used for disaster mapping, its effectiveness is often
hampered by cloud cover or the absence of pre-event acquisitions. To overcome
these challenges, we introduce a novel multimodal deep learning (DL) framework
for detecting building damage using single-date very high resolution (VHR)
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery from the Italian Space Agency (ASI)
COSMO SkyMed (CSK) constellation, complemented by auxiliary geospatial data.
Our method integrates SAR image patches, OpenStreetMap (OSM) building
footprints, digital surface model (DSM) data, and structural and exposure
attributes from the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) to improve detection accuracy
and contextual interpretation. Unlike existing approaches that depend on pre
and post event imagery, our model utilizes only post event data, facilitating
rapid deployment in critical scenarios. The framework effectiveness is
demonstrated using a new dataset from the 2023 earthquake in Turkey, covering
multiple cities with diverse urban settings. Results highlight that
incorporating geospatial features significantly enhances detection performance
and generalizability to previously unseen areas. By combining SAR imagery with
detailed vulnerability and exposure information, our approach provides reliable
and rapid building damage assessments without the dependency from available
pre-event data. Moreover, the automated and scalable data generation process
ensures the framework's applicability across diverse disaster-affected regions,
underscoring its potential to support effective disaster management and
recovery efforts. Code and data will be made available upon acceptance of the
paper.

Abstract: Detecting traversable pathways in unstructured outdoor environments remains a
significant challenge for autonomous robots, especially in critical
applications such as wide-area search and rescue, as well as incident
management scenarios like forest fires. Existing datasets and models primarily
target urban settings or wide, vehicle-traversable off-road tracks, leaving a
substantial gap in addressing the complexity of narrow, trail-like off-road
scenarios. To address this, we introduce the Trail-based Off-road Multimodal
Dataset (TOMD), a comprehensive dataset specifically designed for such
environments. TOMD features high-fidelity multimodal sensor data -- including
128-channel LiDAR, stereo imagery, GNSS, IMU, and illumination measurements --
collected through repeated traversals under diverse conditions. We also propose
a dynamic multiscale data fusion model for accurate traversable pathway
prediction. The study analyzes the performance of early, cross, and mixed
fusion strategies under varying illumination levels. Results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach and the relevance of illumination in segmentation
performance. We publicly release TOMD at https://github.com/yyyxs1125/TMOD to

vault-based \ac{BCS}. We identify unstable error correction capabilities, which

compounded by information loss introduced through feature type transformations.
To address both problems, we propose a novel feature quantization method based

sizes and supports training-free adaptation to any number of intervals. The
proposed approach significantly reduces the performance gap introduced by
template protection. Additionally, it integrates seamlessly with existing
systems to minimize the negative effects of feature transformation. Experiments

Abstract: This study investigates the performance of the two most relevant computer
vision deep learning architectures, Convolutional Neural Network and Vision
Transformer, for event-based cameras. These cameras capture scene changes,
unlike traditional frame-based cameras with capture static images, and are
particularly suited for dynamic environments such as UAVs and autonomous
vehicles. The deep learning models studied in this work are ResNet34 and ViT
B16, fine-tuned on the GEN1 event-based dataset. The research evaluates and
compares these models under both standard conditions and in the presence of
simulated noise. Initial evaluations on the clean GEN1 dataset reveal that
ResNet34 and ViT B16 achieve accuracies of 88% and 86%, respectively, with
ResNet34 showing a slight advantage in classification accuracy. However, the
ViT B16 model demonstrates notable robustness, particularly given its
pre-training on a smaller dataset. Although this study focuses on ground-based
vehicle classification, the methodologies and findings hold significant promise
for adaptation to UAV contexts, including aerial object classification and
event-based vision systems for aviation-related tasks.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in 3D point cloud data remains a
challenge, particularly in applications where safe and robust perception is
critical. While existing OOD detection methods have shown progress for 2D image
data, extending these to 3D environments involves unique obstacles. This paper
introduces a training-free framework that leverages Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) for effective OOD detection in 3D point clouds. By constructing a graph
based on class prototypes and testing data, we exploit the data manifold
structure to enhancing the effectiveness of VLMs for 3D OOD detection. We
propose a novel Graph Score Propagation (GSP) method that incorporates prompt
clustering and self-training negative prompting to improve OOD scoring with
VLM. Our method is also adaptable to few-shot scenarios, providing options for
practical applications. We demonstrate that GSP consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods across synthetic and real-world datasets 3D point

Conclusion: WarpRF是一种简单、低成本且通用的不确定性量化工具，适用于任何辐射场实现。

Abstract: We introduce WarpRF, a training-free general-purpose framework for
quantifying the uncertainty of radiance fields. Built upon the assumption that
photometric and geometric consistency should hold among images rendered by an
accurate model, WarpRF quantifies its underlying uncertainty from an unseen
point of view by leveraging backward warping across viewpoints, projecting
reliable renderings to the unseen viewpoint and measuring the consistency with
images rendered there. WarpRF is simple and inexpensive, does not require any
training, and can be applied to any radiance field implementation for free.
WarpRF excels at both uncertainty quantification and downstream tasks, e.g.,
active view selection and active mapping, outperforming any existing method
tailored to specific frameworks.

Conclusion: PhotonSplat框架在SPAD图像处理中表现出色，适用于动态场景重建和下游任务。

Abstract: Advances in 3D reconstruction using neural rendering have enabled
high-quality 3D capture. However, they often fail when the input imagery is
corrupted by motion blur, due to fast motion of the camera or the objects in
the scene. This work advances neural rendering techniques in such scenarios by
using single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) arrays, an emerging sensing
technology capable of sensing images at extremely high speeds. However, the use
of SPADs presents its own set of unique challenges in the form of binary
images, that are driven by stochastic photon arrivals. To address this, we
introduce PhotonSplat, a framework designed to reconstruct 3D scenes directly
from SPAD binary images, effectively navigating the noise vs. blur trade-off.
Our approach incorporates a novel 3D spatial filtering technique to reduce
noise in the renderings. The framework also supports both no-reference using
generative priors and reference-based colorization from a single blurry image,
enabling downstream applications such as segmentation, object detection and
appearance editing tasks. Additionally, we extend our method to incorporate
dynamic scene representations, making it suitable for scenes with moving
objects. We further contribute PhotonScenes, a real-world multi-view dataset
captured with the SPAD sensors.

Conclusion: 提出的方法解决了IHI重建的关键挑战，为深度学习在该领域的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Interferometric Hyperspectral Imaging (IHI) is a critical technique for
large-scale remote sensing tasks due to its advantages in flux and spectral
resolution. However, IHI is susceptible to complex errors arising from imaging
steps, and its quality is limited by existing signal processing-based
reconstruction algorithms. Two key challenges hinder performance enhancement:
1) the lack of training datasets. 2) the difficulty in eliminating IHI-specific
degradation components through learning-based methods. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel IHI reconstruction pipeline. First, based on
imaging physics and radiometric calibration data, we establish a simplified yet
accurate IHI degradation model and a parameter estimation method. This model
enables the synthesis of realistic IHI training datasets from hyperspectral
images (HSIs), bridging the gap between IHI reconstruction and deep learning.
Second, we design the Interferometric Hyperspectral Reconstruction Unfolding
Transformer (IHRUT), which achieves effective spectral correction and detail
restoration through a stripe-pattern enhancement mechanism and a
spatial-spectral transformer architecture. Experimental results demonstrate the
superior performance and generalization capability of our method.

Result: 多模态输入显著提升分割性能，但模态可互换设置牺牲了准确性以换取鲁棒性。多任务学习效果不如单独模型。

Conclusion: 多模态融合对WMH分析具有重要价值，联合建模在整合预测方面有潜力。

Abstract: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are radiological markers of small vessel
disease and neurodegeneration, whose accurate segmentation and spatial
localization are crucial for diagnosis and monitoring. While multimodal MRI
offers complementary contrasts for detecting and contextualizing WM lesions,
existing approaches often lack flexibility in handling missing modalities and
fail to integrate anatomical localization efficiently. We propose a deep
learning framework for WM lesion segmentation and localization that operates
directly in native space using single- and multi-modal MRI inputs. Our study
evaluates four input configurations: FLAIR-only, T1-only, concatenated FLAIR
and T1, and a modality-interchangeable setup. It further introduces a
multi-task model for jointly predicting lesion and anatomical region masks to
estimate region-wise lesion burden. Experiments conducted on the MICCAI WMH
Segmentation Challenge dataset demonstrate that multimodal input significantly
improves the segmentation performance, outperforming unimodal models. While the
modality-interchangeable setting trades accuracy for robustness, it enables
inference in cases with missing modalities. Joint lesion-region segmentation
using multi-task learning was less effective than separate models, suggesting
representational conflict between tasks. Our findings highlight the utility of
multimodal fusion for accurate and robust WMH analysis, and the potential of
joint modeling for integrated predictions.

Abstract: Automatic detection and classification of Cardiovascular disease (CVD) from
Computed Tomography (CT) images play an important part in facilitating
better-informed clinical decisions. However, most of the recent deep learning
based methods either directly work on raw CT data or utilize it in pair with
anatomical cardiac structure segmentation by training an end-to-end classifier.
As such, these approaches become much more difficult to interpret from a
clinical perspective. To address this challenge, in this work, we break down
the CVD classification pipeline into three components: (i) image segmentation,
(ii) image registration, and (iii) downstream CVD classification. Specifically,
we utilize the Atlas-ISTN framework and recent segmentation foundational models
to generate anatomical structure segmentation and a normative healthy atlas.
These are further utilized to extract clinically interpretable radiomic
features as well as deformation field based geometric features (through atlas
registration) for CVD classification. Our experiments on the publicly available
ASOCA dataset show that utilizing these features leads to better CVD
classification accuracy (87.50\%) when compared against classification model
trained directly on raw CT images (67.50\%). Our code is publicly available:

Conclusion: 该方法通过GRR和光学随机排列技术，有效提升了单次曝光HDR成像的性能，尤其在处理高光区域时表现突出。

Abstract: High-dynamic-range (HDR) imaging is an essential technique for overcoming the
dynamic range limits of image sensors. The classic method relies on multiple
exposures, which slows capture time, resulting in motion artifacts when imaging
dynamic scenes. Single-shot HDR imaging alleviates this issue by encoding HDR
data into a single exposure, then computationally recovering it. Many
established methods use strong image priors to recover improperly exposed image
detail. These approaches struggle with extended highlight regions. We utilize
the global reset release (GRR) shutter mode of an off-the-shelf sensor. GRR
shutter mode applies a longer exposure time to rows closer to the bottom of the
sensor. We use optics that relay a randomly permuted (shuffled) image onto the
sensor, effectively creating spatially randomized exposures across the scene.
The exposure diversity allows us to recover HDR data by solving an optimization
problem with a simple total variation image prior. In simulation, we
demonstrate that our method outperforms other single-shot methods when many
sensor pixels are saturated (10% or more), and is competitive at a modest
saturation (1%). Finally, we demonstrate a physical lab prototype that uses an
off-the-shelf random fiber bundle for the optical shuffling. The fiber bundle
is coupled to a low-cost commercial sensor operating in GRR shutter mode. Our
prototype achieves a dynamic range of up to 73dB using an 8-bit sensor with
48dB dynamic range.

Abstract: Histological analysis plays a crucial role in understanding tissue structure
and pathology. While recent advancements in registration methods have improved
2D histological analysis, they often struggle to preserve critical 3D spatial
relationships, limiting their utility in both clinical and research
applications. Specifically, constructing accurate 3D models from 2D slices
remains challenging due to tissue deformation, sectioning artifacts,
variability in imaging techniques, and inconsistent illumination. Deep
learning-based registration methods have demonstrated improved performance but
suffer from limited generalizability and require large-scale training data. In
contrast, non-deep-learning approaches offer better generalizability but often
compromise on accuracy. In this study, we introduced ZeroReg3D, a novel
zero-shot registration pipeline tailored for accurate 3D reconstruction from
serial histological sections. By combining zero-shot deep learning-based
keypoint matching with optimization-based affine and non-rigid registration
techniques, ZeroReg3D effectively addresses critical challenges such as tissue

illumination without requiring retraining or fine-tuning. The code has been

Abstract: Land cover maps generated from semantic segmentation of high-resolution
remotely sensed images have drawn mucon in the photogrammetry and remote
sensing research community. Currently, massive fine-resolution remotely sensed
(FRRS) images acquired by improving sensing and imaging technologies become
available. However, accurate semantic segmentation of such FRRS images is
greatly affected by substantial class disparities, the invisibility of key
ground objects due to occlusion, and object size variation. Despite the
extraordinary potential in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) in image
feature learning and representation, extracting sufficient features from FRRS
images for accurate semantic segmentation is still challenging. These
challenges demand the deep learning models to learn robust features and
generate sufficient feature descriptors. Specifically, learning
multi-contextual features to guarantee adequate coverage of varied object sizes
from the ground scene and harnessing global-local contexts to overcome class
disparities challenge even profound networks. Deeper networks significantly
lose spatial details due to gradual downsampling processes resulting in poor
segmentation results and coarse boundaries. This article presents a stacked
deep residual network (SDRNet) for semantic segmentation from FRRS images. The
proposed framework utilizes two stacked encoder-decoder networks to harness
long-range semantics yet preserve spatial information and dilated residual
blocks (DRB) between each encoder and decoder network to capture sufficient
global dependencies thus improving segmentation performance. Our experimental
results obtained using the ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets demonstrate
that the SDRNet performs effectively and competitively against current DCNNs in
semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Accurate digital twins of industrial assets, such as ships and offshore

However, manual modelling of pipes from laser scan data is a time-consuming and
labor-intensive process. This paper presents a pipeline for automated pipe

skeleton curve using Laplacian-based contraction, followed by curve elongation.
The skeleton axis is then recentred using a rolling sphere technique combined

determination of pipe properties, including radius, length and orientation, and
facilitates the creation of detailed 3D models of complex pipe networks. By
automating pipe reconstruction, this approach supports the development of
digital twins, allowing for rapid and accurate modeling while reducing costs.

Abstract: Robust and accurate 2D/3D registration, which aligns preoperative models with
intraoperative images of the same anatomy, is crucial for successful
interventional navigation. To mitigate the challenge of a limited field of view
in single-image intraoperative scenarios, multi-view 2D/3D registration is
required by leveraging multiple intraoperative images. In this paper, we
propose a novel multi-view 2D/3D rigid registration approach comprising two
stages. In the first stage, a combined loss function is designed, incorporating
both the differences between predicted and ground-truth poses and the
dissimilarities (e.g., normalized cross-correlation) between simulated and
observed intraoperative images. More importantly, additional cross-view
training loss terms are introduced for both pose and image losses to explicitly
enforce cross-view constraints. In the second stage, test-time optimization is
performed to refine the estimated poses from the coarse stage. Our method
exploits the mutual constraints of multi-view projection poses to enhance the
robustness of the registration process. The proposed framework achieves a mean
target registration error (mTRE) of $0.79 \pm 2.17$ mm on six specimens from
the DeepFluoro dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art registration algorithms.

Abstract: State-of-the-art methods fail to solve visual localization in scenarios where
different devices use different sparse feature extraction algorithms to obtain
keypoints and their corresponding descriptors. Translating feature descriptors
is enough to enable matching. However, performance is drastically reduced in
cross-feature detector cases, because current solutions assume common
keypoints. This means that the same detector has to be used, which is rarely
the case in practice when different descriptors are used. The low repeatability
of keypoints, in addition to non-discriminatory and non-distinctive
descriptors, make the identification of true correspondences extremely
challenging. We present the first method tackling this problem, which performs
feature descriptor augmentation targeting cross-detector feature matching, and
then feature translation to a latent space. We show that our method
significantly improves image matching and visual localization in the
cross-feature scenario and evaluate the proposed method on several benchmarks.

Abstract: Metasurfaces are ultra-thin optical elements composed of engineered
sub-wavelength structures that enable precise control of light. Their inverse
design - determining a geometry that yields a desired optical response - is
challenging due to the complex, nonlinear relationship between structure and
optical properties. This often requires expert tuning, is prone to local
minima, and involves significant computational overhead. In this work, we
address these challenges by integrating the generative capabilities of
diffusion models into computational design workflows. Using an RCWA simulator,
we generate training data consisting of metasurface geometries and their
corresponding far-field scattering patterns. We then train a conditional
diffusion model to predict meta-atom geometry and height from a target spatial
power distribution at a specified wavelength, sampled from a continuous
supported band. Once trained, the model can generate metasurfaces with low
error, either directly using RCWA-guided posterior sampling or by serving as an
initializer for traditional optimization methods. We demonstrate our approach
on the design of a spatially uniform intensity splitter and a polarization beam
splitter, both produced with low error in under 30 minutes. To support further
research in data-driven metasurface design, we publicly release our code and

Abstract: Trackerless freehand ultrasound reconstruction aims to reconstruct 3D volumes
from sequences of 2D ultrasound images without relying on external tracking
systems, offering a low-cost, portable, and widely deployable alternative for
volumetric imaging. However, it presents significant challenges, including
accurate inter-frame motion estimation, minimisation of drift accumulation over
long sequences, and generalisability across scanning protocols. The TUS-REC2024
Challenge was established to benchmark and accelerate progress in trackerless
3D ultrasound reconstruction by providing a publicly available dataset for the
first time, along with a baseline model and evaluation framework. The Challenge
attracted over 43 registered teams, of which 6 teams submitted 21 valid
dockerized solutions. Submitted methods spanned a wide range of algorithmic
approaches, including recurrent models, registration-driven volume refinement,
attention, and physics-informed models. This paper presents an overview of the
Challenge design, summarises the key characteristics of the dataset, provides a
concise literature review, introduces the technical details of the underlying
methodology working with tracked freehand ultrasound data, and offers a
comparative analysis of submitted methods across multiple evaluation metrics.
The results highlight both the progress and current limitations of
state-of-the-art approaches in this domain, and inform directions for future
research. The data, evaluation code, and baseline are publicly available to
facilitate ongoing development and reproducibility. As a live and evolving
benchmark, this Challenge is designed to be continuously developed and
improved. The Challenge was held at MICCAI 2024 and will be organised again at
MICCAI 2025, reflecting its growing impact and the sustained commitment to
advancing this field.

significantly faster than standard CPU-based training, which can be up to 250
times slower. This method could enable real-time brain analysis on mobile
devices, revolutionizing clinical decision-making and telemedicine.

Abstract: Linear measurements of the left ventricle (LV) in the Parasternal Long Axis
(PLAX) view using B-mode echocardiography are crucial for cardiac assessment.
These involve placing 4-6 landmarks along a virtual scanline (SL) perpendicular
to the LV axis near the mitral valve tips. Manual placement is time-consuming
and error-prone, while existing deep learning methods often misalign landmarks,
causing inaccurate measurements. We propose a novel framework that enhances LV
measurement accuracy by enforcing straight-line constraints. A landmark
detector is trained on Anatomical M-Mode (AMM) images, computed in real time
from B-mode videos, then transformed back to B-mode space. This approach
addresses misalignment and reduces measurement errors. Experiments show
improved accuracy over standard B-mode methods, and the framework generalizes
well across network architectures. Our semi-automatic design includes a
human-in-the-loop step where the user only places the SL, simplifying
interaction while preserving alignment flexibility and clinical relevance.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for estimating the relative pose between rolling
shutter cameras using the intersections of line projections with a single
scanline per image. This allows pose estimation without explicitly modeling
camera motion. Alternatively, scanlines can be selected within a single image,
enabling single-view relative pose estimation for scanlines of rolling shutter
cameras. Our approach is designed as a foundational building block for rolling
shutter structure-from-motion (SfM), where no motion model is required, and
each scanline's pose can be computed independently. % We classify minimal
solvers for this problem in both generic and specialized settings, including
cases with parallel lines and known gravity direction, assuming known
intrinsics and no lens distortion. Furthermore, we develop minimal solvers for
the parallel-lines scenario, both with and without gravity priors, by
leveraging connections between this problem and the estimation of 2D structure
from 1D cameras. % Experiments on rolling shutter images from the Fastec
dataset demonstrate the feasibility of our approach for initializing rolling
shutter SfM, highlighting its potential for further development. % The code

Abstract: Many remote Heart Rate (HR) measurement methods focus on estimating remote
photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals from video clips lasting around 10 seconds
but often overlook the need for HR estimation from ultra-short video clips. In
this paper, we aim to accurately measure HR from ultra-short 2-second video
clips by specifically addressing two key challenges. First, to overcome the
limited number of heartbeat cycles in ultra-short video clips, we propose an
effective periodicity-guided rPPG estimation method that enforces consistent
periodicity between rPPG signals estimated from ultra-short clips and their
much longer ground truth signals. Next, to mitigate estimation inaccuracies due
to spectral leakage, we propose including a generator to reconstruct longer
rPPG signals from ultra-short ones while preserving their periodic consistency
to enable more accurate HR measurement. Extensive experiments on four rPPG
estimation benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method not only
accurately measures HR from ultra-short video clips but also outperform
previous rPPG estimation techniques to achieve state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLMs）的推理方法（如Chain-of-Thought）存在任务分解脆弱、数据需求高和延迟高的问题，HRM受人类大脑分层多时间尺度处理启发，旨在解决这些问题。

Method: HRM采用分层循环架构，包含一个负责抽象规划的高层模块和一个处理详细计算的底层模块，无需预训练或显式监督，仅需少量训练样本。

Result: HRM在复杂推理任务（如数独和迷宫路径规划）上表现优异，仅需27M参数和1000训练样本，在ARC基准上优于更大规模的模型。

Conclusion: HRM是一种潜在的通用计算和推理系统的突破性进展。

Abstract: Reasoning, the process of devising and executing complex goal-oriented action
sequences, remains a critical challenge in AI. Current large language models
(LLMs) primarily employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques, which suffer from
brittle task decomposition, extensive data requirements, and high latency.
Inspired by the hierarchical and multi-timescale processing in the human brain,
we propose the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM), a novel recurrent
architecture that attains significant computational depth while maintaining
both training stability and efficiency. HRM executes sequential reasoning tasks
in a single forward pass without explicit supervision of the intermediate
process, through two interdependent recurrent modules: a high-level module
responsible for slow, abstract planning, and a low-level module handling rapid,
detailed computations. With only 27 million parameters, HRM achieves
exceptional performance on complex reasoning tasks using only 1000 training
samples. The model operates without pre-training or CoT data, yet achieves
nearly perfect performance on challenging tasks including complex Sudoku
puzzles and optimal path finding in large mazes. Furthermore, HRM outperforms
much larger models with significantly longer context windows on the Abstraction
and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), a key benchmark for measuring artificial general
intelligence capabilities. These results underscore HRM's potential as a
transformative advancement toward universal computation and general-purpose
reasoning systems.

Conclusion: THE-Tree为科学命题的验证提供了高效、可靠的结构化方法，推动了LLM在科学领域的应用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are accelerating scientific idea generation, but
rigorously evaluating these numerous, often superficial, AI-generated
propositions for novelty and factual accuracy is a critical bottleneck; manual
verification is too slow.Existing validation methods are inadequate: LLMs as
standalone verifiers may hallucinate and lack domain knowledge (our findings
show ~60\% unawareness of relevant papers in specific domains), while
traditional citation networks lack explicit causality and narrative surveys are
unstructured.This underscores a core challenge: the absence of structured,
verifiable, and causally-linked historical data of scientific evolution.To
address this,we introduce \textbf{THE-Tree} (\textbf{T}echnology
\textbf{H}istory \textbf{E}volution Tree), a computational framework that
constructs such domain-specific evolution trees from scientific
literature.THE-Tree employs a search algorithm to explore evolutionary paths.
During its node expansion, it utilizes a novel "Think-Verbalize-Cite-Verify"
process: an LLM proposes potential advancements and cites supporting
literature. Critically, each proposed evolutionary link is then validated for
logical coherence and evidential support by a recovered natural language
inference mechanism that interrogates the cited literature, ensuring that each
step is grounded.We construct and validate 88 THE-Trees across diverse domains
and release a benchmark dataset including up to 71k fact verifications covering
27k papers to foster further research.Experiments demonstrate that i) in graph
completion, our THE-Tree improves hit@1 by 8\% to 14\% across multiple models
compared to traditional citation networks; ii) for predicting future scientific
developments, it improves hit@1 metric by nearly 10\%; and iii) when combined
with other methods, it boosts the performance of evaluating important
scientific papers by almost 100\%.

Abstract: Rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have the potential to

the ability to reproduce existing work. To evaluate the ability of AI agents to
reproduce results in an active research area, we introduce the Automated LLM
Speedrunning Benchmark, leveraging the research community contributions on the
NanoGPT speedrun, a competition to train a GPT-2 model in the shortest time.
Each of the 19 speedrun tasks provides the agent with the previous records
training script, optionally paired with one of three hint formats, ranging from
pseudocode to paper-like descriptions of the new records improvements. Records
execute quickly by design and speedrun improvements encompass diverse
code-level changes, ranging from high-level algorithmic advancements to
hardware-aware optimizations. These features make the benchmark both accessible
and realistic for the frontier problem of improving LLM training. We find that
recent reasoning LLMs combined with SoTA scaffolds struggle to reimplement
already-known innovations in our benchmark, even when given detailed hints. Our
benchmark thus provides a simple, non-saturated measure of an LLMs ability to
automate scientific reproduction, a necessary (but not sufficient) skill for an

Conclusion: IRanker框架有效解决了排名任务的统一建模问题，并在性能和泛化能力上表现突出。

Abstract: Ranking tasks are ubiquitous, encompassing applications such as
recommendation systems, LLM routing, and item re-ranking. We propose to unify
these tasks using a single ranking foundation model (FM), as it eliminates the
need for designing different models for each specific ranking task. However,
unlike general supervision tasks in LLMs, ranking tasks do not have clear
labels for supervision, posing great challenges to developing a ranking FM. To
overcome these challenges, we propose IRanker, a ranking FM framework with
reinforcement learning (RL) and iterative decoding. Our insight is to decompose
the complex ranking task into an iterative decoding process that eliminates the
worst candidate from the candidate pool step by step, which significantly
reduces the output combinatorial space and better utilizes the limited context
length during RL training. We meticulously train and comprehensively evaluate
an IRanker-3B model on nine datasets across three scenarios: recommendation,
routing, and passage ranking. The results show that a single IRanker-3B
achieves state-of-the-art results on several datasets compared to models of
similar size, and even surpasses the performance of larger models on certain
datasets. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our RL design and the
robustness of the iterative mechanism across different LLM sizes. Moreover, we
conducted both in-domain and out-of-domain zero-shot generalization
experiments, which showed that IRanker-3B achieved good generalization on
in-domain ranking tasks compared to the base LLM by at least 5% improvement.
Surprisingly, on out-of-domain generic LLM tasks, IRanker-3B outperformed the
base model by at least 9% on GSM8K, IFEval, and MathQA. In addition, the
thoughts generated by IRanker-3B during training could further enhance
zero-shot LLM performance.

Abstract: The rapid rise of open-weight and open-source foundation models is
intensifying the obligation and reshaping the opportunity to make AI systems
safe. This paper reports outcomes from the Columbia Convening on AI Openness
and Safety (San Francisco, 19 Nov 2024) and its six-week preparatory programme
involving more than forty-five researchers, engineers, and policy leaders from
academia, industry, civil society, and government. Using a participatory,
solutions-oriented process, the working groups produced (i) a research agenda
at the intersection of safety and open source AI; (ii) a mapping of existing
and needed technical interventions and open source tools to safely and
responsibly deploy open foundation models across the AI development workflow;
and (iii) a mapping of the content safety filter ecosystem with a proposed
roadmap for future research and development. We find that openness --
understood as transparent weights, interoperable tooling, and public governance
-- can enhance safety by enabling independent scrutiny, decentralized
mitigation, and culturally plural oversight. However, significant gaps persist:
scarce multimodal and multilingual benchmarks, limited defenses against
prompt-injection and compositional attacks in agentic systems, and insufficient
participatory mechanisms for communities most affected by AI harms. The paper
concludes with a roadmap of five priority research directions, emphasizing
participatory inputs, future-proof content filters, ecosystem-wide safety
infrastructure, rigorous agentic safeguards, and expanded harm taxonomies.
These recommendations informed the February 2025 French AI Action Summit and
lay groundwork for an open, plural, and accountable AI safety discipline.

Result: 实验表明，LLM2Rec在域内和域外推荐中均显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: LLMs可用于构建更鲁棒、通用的序列推荐嵌入模型。

Abstract: Sequential recommendation aims to predict users' future interactions by
modeling collaborative filtering (CF) signals from historical behaviors of
similar users or items. Traditional sequential recommenders predominantly rely
on ID-based embeddings, which capture CF signals through high-order
co-occurrence patterns. However, these embeddings depend solely on past
interactions, lacking transferable knowledge to generalize to unseen domains.
Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have motivated text-based
recommendation approaches that derive item representations from textual
descriptions. While these methods enhance generalization, they fail to encode
CF signals-i.e., latent item correlations and preference patterns-crucial for
effective recommendation. We argue that an ideal embedding model should
seamlessly integrate CF signals with rich semantic representations to improve
both in-domain and out-of-domain recommendation performance.
  To this end, we propose LLM2Rec, a novel embedding model tailored for
sequential recommendation, integrating the rich semantic understanding of LLMs
with CF awareness. Our approach follows a two-stage training framework: (1)
Collaborative Supervised Fine-tuning, which adapts LLMs to infer item
relationships based on historical interactions, and (2) Item-level Embedding
Modeling, which refines these specialized LLMs into structured item embedding
models that encode both semantic and collaborative information. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that LLM2Rec effectively
improves recommendation quality across both in-domain and out-of-domain
settings. Our findings highlight the potential of leveraging LLMs to build more
robust, generalizable embedding models for sequential recommendation. Our codes

Abstract: Self-evolution, the ability of agents to autonomously improve their reasoning
and behavior, is essential for the embodied domain with long-horizon,
real-world tasks. Despite current advancements in reinforcement fine-tuning
(RFT) showing strong performance in enhancing reasoning in LLMs, its potential
to enable self-evolving embodied intelligence with multi-modal interactions
remains largely unexplored. Specifically, reinforcement fine-tuning faces two
fundamental obstacles in embodied settings: (i) the lack of accessible
intermediate rewards in multi-step reasoning tasks limits effective learning
signals, and (ii) reliance on hand-crafted reward functions restricts
generalization to novel tasks and environments. To address these challenges, we
present Self-Evolving Embodied Agents-R1, SEEA-R1, the first RFT framework
designed for enabling the self-evolving capabilities of embodied agents.
Specifically, to convert sparse delayed rewards into denser intermediate
signals that improve multi-step reasoning, we propose Tree-based group relative
policy optimization (Tree-GRPO), which integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search into
GRPO. To generalize reward estimation across tasks and scenes, supporting
autonomous adaptation and reward-driven self-evolution, we further introduce
Multi-modal Generative Reward Model (MGRM). To holistically evaluate the
effectiveness of SEEA-R1, we evaluate on the ALFWorld benchmark, surpassing
state-of-the-art methods with scores of 85.07% (textual) and 36.19%
(multi-modal), outperforming prior models including GPT-4o. SEEA-R1 also
achieves scores of 80.3% without environmental reward, surpassing all
open-source baselines and highlighting its scalability as a self-evolving
embodied agent. Additional experiments and qualitative analysis further support
the potential of SEEA-R1 for future research in scalable embodied intelligence.

Result: 实验表明Refine-POI在真实数据集上实现了最先进的top-k推荐性能。

Conclusion: Refine-POI通过强化学习解决了SFT的数据不匹配问题，提升了推荐性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been adopted for next point-of-interest
(POI) recommendation tasks. Typical LLM-based recommenders fall into two
categories: prompt-based and supervised fine-tuning (SFT)-based models.
Prompt-based models generally offer greater output flexibility but deliver
lower accuracy, whereas SFT-based models achieve higher performance yet face a
fundamental mismatch: next POI recommendation data does not naturally suit
supervised fine-tuning. In SFT, the model is trained to reproduce the exact
ground truth, but each training example provides only a single target POI, so
there is no ground truth for producing a top-k list.
  To address this, we propose Refine-POI, a reinforcement fine-tuning framework
for next POI recommendation. We introduce recommendation-driven rewards that
enable LLMs to learn to generate top-k recommendation lists using only one
ground-truth POI per example. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate
that Refine-POI achieves state-of-the-art top-k recommendation performance.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown promise in enhancing
recommendation systems by incorporating external context into large language
model prompts. However, existing RAG-based approaches often rely on static
retrieval heuristics and fail to capture nuanced user preferences in dynamic
recommendation scenarios. In this work, we introduce ARAG, an Agentic
Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework for Personalized Recommendation, which
integrates a multi-agent collaboration mechanism into the RAG pipeline. To
better understand the long-term and session behavior of the user, ARAG
leverages four specialized LLM-based agents: a User Understanding Agent that
summarizes user preferences from long-term and session contexts, a Natural
Language Inference (NLI) Agent that evaluates semantic alignment between
candidate items retrieved by RAG and inferred intent, a context summary agent
that summarizes the findings of NLI agent, and an Item Ranker Agent that
generates a ranked list of recommendations based on contextual fit. We evaluate
ARAG accross three datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that ARAG
significantly outperforms standard RAG and recency-based baselines, achieving
up to 42.1% improvement in NDCG@5 and 35.5% in Hit@5. We also, conduct an
ablation study to analyse the effect by different components of ARAG. Our
findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating agentic reasoning into
retrieval-augmented recommendation and provide new directions for LLM-based
personalization.

proven by \texttt{aesop} tactic. We demonstrate the utility of these generated
conjectures for reinforcement learning through Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), showing that targeted training on domain-specific
conjectures can enhance theorem proving capabilities. Our approach generates
103.25 novel conjectures per seed file on average, providing a scalable

successfully verified several non-trivial theorems in topology, including
properties of semi-open, alpha-open, and pre-open sets, demonstrating its

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has made remarkable strides in recent years,
achieving superhuman performance across a wide range of tasks. Yet despite
these advances, most cooperative AI systems remain rigidly obedient, designed
to follow human instructions without question and conform to user expectations,
even when doing so may be counterproductive or unsafe. This paper argues for
expanding the agency of AI teammates to include \textit{intelligent
disobedience}, empowering them to make meaningful and autonomous contributions
within human-AI teams. It introduces a scale of AI agency levels and uses
representative examples to highlight the importance and growing necessity of
treating AI autonomy as an independent research focus in cooperative settings.
The paper then explores how intelligent disobedience manifests across different
autonomy levels and concludes by proposing initial boundaries and
considerations for studying disobedience as a core capability of artificial

Result: LLMs能正确识别关联方向，但中等信息先验常过于自信；Claude在弱信息先验上表现优于ChatGPT和Gemini。

Abstract: Selecting prior distributions in Bayesian statistics is challenging,
resource-intensive, and subjective. We analyze using large-language models
(LLMs) to suggest suitable, knowledge-based informative priors. We developed an
extensive prompt asking LLMs not only to suggest priors but also to verify and
reflect on their choices.
  We evaluated Claude Opus, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and ChatGPT-4o-mini on two real
datasets: heart disease risk and concrete strength. All LLMs correctly
identified the direction for all associations (e.g., that heart disease risk is
higher for males). The quality of suggested priors was measured by their
Kullback-Leibler divergence from the maximum likelihood estimator's
distribution.
  The LLMs suggested both moderately and weakly informative priors. The
moderate priors were often overconfident, resulting in distributions misaligned
with the data. In our experiments, Claude and Gemini provided better priors
than ChatGPT. For weakly informative priors, a key performance difference
emerged: ChatGPT and Gemini defaulted to an "unnecessarily vague" mean of 0,
while Claude did not, demonstrating a significant advantage.
  The ability of LLMs to identify correct associations shows their great
potential as an efficient, objective method for developing informative priors.
However, the primary challenge remains in calibrating the width of these priors
to avoid over- and under-confidence.

Conclusion: 评估基准的语义结构决定了领域适应效果的评估结果，需选择更贴近真实复杂性的基准。

Abstract: Evaluation benchmark characteristics may distort the true benefits of domain
adaptation in retrieval models. This creates misleading assessments that
influence deployment decisions in specialized domains. We show that two
benchmarks with drastically different features such as topic diversity,
boundary overlap, and semantic complexity can influence the perceived benefits
of fine-tuning. Using environmental regulatory document retrieval as a case
study, we fine-tune ColBERTv2 model on Environmental Impact Statements (EIS)
from federal agencies. We evaluate these models across two benchmarks with
different semantic structures. Our findings reveal that identical domain
adaptation approaches show very different perceived benefits depending on
evaluation methodology. On one benchmark, with clearly separated topic
boundaries, domain adaptation shows small improvements (maximum 0.61% NDCG
gain). However, on the other benchmark with overlapping semantic structures,
the same models demonstrate large improvements (up to 2.22% NDCG gain), a
3.6-fold difference in the performance benefit. We compare these benchmarks
through topic diversity metrics, finding that the higher-performing benchmark
shows 11% higher average cosine distances between contexts and 23% lower
silhouette scores, directly contributing to the observed performance
difference. These results demonstrate that benchmark selection strongly
determines assessments of retrieval system effectiveness in specialized
domains. Evaluation frameworks with well-separated topics regularly
underestimate domain adaptation benefits, while those with overlapping semantic
boundaries reveal improvements that better reflect real-world regulatory
document complexity. Our findings have important implications for developing
and deploying AI systems for interdisciplinary domains that integrate multiple
topics.

Abstract: Today's text-to-image generative models are trained on millions of images
sourced from the Internet, each paired with a detailed caption produced by
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). This part of the training pipeline is critical
for supplying the models with large volumes of high-quality image-caption pairs
during training. However, recent work suggests that VLMs are vulnerable to
stealthy adversarial attacks, where adversarial perturbations are added to
images to mislead the VLMs into producing incorrect captions.
  In this paper, we explore the feasibility of adversarial mislabeling attacks
on VLMs as a mechanism to poisoning training pipelines for text-to-image
models. Our experiments demonstrate that VLMs are highly vulnerable to
adversarial perturbations, allowing attackers to produce benign-looking images
that are consistently miscaptioned by the VLM models. This has the effect of
injecting strong "dirty-label" poison samples into the training pipeline for
text-to-image models, successfully altering their behavior with a small number
of poisoned samples. We find that while potential defenses can be effective,
they can be targeted and circumvented by adaptive attackers. This suggests a
cat-and-mouse game that is likely to reduce the quality of training data and
increase the cost of text-to-image model development. Finally, we demonstrate
the real-world effectiveness of these attacks, achieving high attack success
(over 73%) even in black-box scenarios against commercial VLMs (Google Vertex
AI and Microsoft Azure).

collects a broad set of relevant papers using keyword and snippet-based

followed by facet-based LLM re-ranking. It incorporates expert-labeled examples
to guide the system in comparing papers for novelty evaluation and in

Abstract: The increasing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into health and
biomedical systems necessitates robust frameworks for transparency,
accountability, and ethical compliance. Existing frameworks often rely on
human-readable, manual documentation which limits scalability, comparability,
and machine interpretability across projects and platforms. They also fail to
provide a unique, verifiable identity for AI models to ensure their provenance
and authenticity across systems and use cases, limiting reproducibility and
stakeholder trust. This paper introduces the concept of the AI Model Passport,
a structured and standardized documentation framework that acts as a digital
identity and verification tool for AI models. It captures essential metadata to
uniquely identify, verify, trace and monitor AI models across their lifecycle -
from data acquisition and preprocessing to model design, development and
deployment. In addition, an implementation of this framework is presented
through AIPassport, an MLOps tool developed within the ProCAncer-I EU project
for medical imaging applications. AIPassport automates metadata collection,
ensures proper versioning, decouples results from source scripts, and
integrates with various development environments. Its effectiveness is
showcased through a lesion segmentation use case using data from the
ProCAncer-I dataset, illustrating how the AI Model Passport enhances
transparency, reproducibility, and regulatory readiness while reducing manual
effort. This approach aims to set a new standard for fostering trust and
accountability in AI-driven healthcare solutions, aspiring to serve as the

Abstract: Understanding and modeling human mobility patterns is crucial for effective

mobility research, there remains a critical gap in simulation platforms that

evaluation at scale. Traditional activity-based models require extensive data
collection and manual calibration, machine learning approaches struggle with
adaptation to dynamic conditions, and treding agent-based Large Language Models
(LLMs) implementations face computational constraints with large-scale
simulations. To address these challenges, we propose MobiVerse, a hybrid
framework leverages the efficiency of lightweight domain-specific generator for
generating base activity chains with the adaptability of LLMs for context-aware
modifications. A case study was conducted in Westwood, Los Angeles, where we
efficiently generated and dynamically adjusted schedules for the whole
population of approximately 53,000 agents on a standard PC. Our experiments
demonstrate that MobiVerse successfully enables agents to respond to
environmental feedback, including road closures, large gathering events like

design facilitates testing various mobility algorithms at both transportation
system and agent levels. Results show our approach maintains computational

Abstract: High-stakes decision-making involves navigating multiple competing objectives
with expensive evaluations. For instance, in brachytherapy, clinicians must
balance maximizing tumor coverage (e.g., an aspirational target or soft bound
of >95% coverage) against strict organ dose limits (e.g., a non-negotiable hard
bound of <601 cGy to the bladder), with each plan evaluation being
resource-intensive. Selecting Pareto-optimal solutions that match implicit
preferences is challenging, as exhaustive Pareto frontier exploration is
computationally and cognitively prohibitive, necessitating interactive
frameworks to guide users. While decision-makers (DMs) often possess domain
knowledge to narrow the search via such soft-hard bounds, current methods often
lack systematic approaches to iteratively refine these multi-faceted preference
structures. Critically, DMs must trust their final decision, confident they
haven't missed superior alternatives; this trust is paramount in
high-consequence scenarios. We present Active-MoSH, an interactive local-global
framework designed for this process. Its local component integrates soft-hard
bounds with probabilistic preference learning, maintaining distributions over
DM preferences and bounds for adaptive Pareto subset refinement. This is guided
by an active sampling strategy optimizing exploration-exploitation while
minimizing cognitive burden. To build DM trust, Active-MoSH's global component,
T-MoSH, leverages multi-objective sensitivity analysis to identify potentially
overlooked, high-value points beyond immediate feedback. We demonstrate
Active-MoSH's performance benefits through diverse synthetic and real-world
applications. A user study on AI-generated image selection further validates
our hypotheses regarding the framework's ability to improve convergence,
enhance DM trust, and provide expressive preference articulation, enabling more
effective DMs.

states across diverse real-world scenarios. Based on this, we present
GAE-Bench, a benchmark containing a large number of trajectory-based retrieval
pairs. In addition, we propose GAE-Retriever, a multimodal retrieval framework
that adopts vision-language models and incorporates optimized contrastive
learning through a token selection and the GradCache mechanism. Comprehensive
evaluations across multiple datasets show that GAE-Retriever consistently
outperforms strong baselines in retrieval recall, highlighting its
effectiveness in advancing multimodal trajectory retrieval.

Motivation: 解决现有测试方法依赖数据堆叠、无法覆盖所有边缘案例且缺乏灵活性的问题。

Method: 提出基于Answer Set Programming（ASP）的“Extensible Scenarios Notations”（ESN）框架，统一表示异构数据，并通过逻辑查询实现测试。

Result: ESN支持复杂语义查询、提供决策过程的可解释性，并实现细粒度隐私保护。

Conclusion: QaT和ESN显著提升了测试的表达能力和形式严谨性，并提出了“Validation-Driven Development”（VDD）以加速开发迭代。

Abstract: With the deep penetration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the
transportation sector, intelligent cockpits, autonomous driving, and
intelligent road networks are developing at an unprecedented pace. However, the
data ecosystems of these three key areas are increasingly fragmented and
incompatible. Especially, existing testing methods rely on data stacking, fail
to cover all edge cases, and lack flexibility. To address this issue, this
paper introduces the concept of "Query as Test" (QaT). This concept shifts the
focus from rigid, prescripted test cases to flexible, on-demand logical queries
against a unified data representation. Specifically, we identify the need for a
fundamental improvement in data storage and representation, leading to our
proposal of "Extensible Scenarios Notations" (ESN). ESN is a novel declarative
data framework based on Answer Set Programming (ASP), which uniformly
represents heterogeneous multimodal data from the cockpit, vehicle, and road as
a collection of logical facts and rules. This approach not only achieves deep
semantic fusion of data, but also brings three core advantages: (1) supports
complex and flexible semantic querying through logical reasoning; (2) provides
natural interpretability for decision-making processes; (3) allows for
on-demand data abstraction through logical rules, enabling fine-grained privacy
protection. We further elaborate on the QaT paradigm, transforming the
functional validation and safety compliance checks of autonomous driving
systems into logical queries against the ESN database, significantly enhancing
the expressiveness and formal rigor of the testing. Finally, we introduce the
concept of "Validation-Driven Development" (VDD), which suggests to guide
developments by logical validation rather than quantitative testing in the era
of Large Language Models, in order to accelerating the iteration and
development process.

Motivation: 尽管KGC模型使用了强大的编码器，但由于输出层的秩瓶颈问题，限制了模型的表达能力，影响了排名准确性和分数分布保真度。

Method: 通过理论和实证分析秩瓶颈的影响，并借鉴语言建模文献，提出了KGE-MoS（基于混合的输出层）来打破秩瓶颈。

Result: 在四个数据集上的实验表明，KGE-MoS以较低的参数成本提升了KGC模型的性能和概率拟合度。

Conclusion: KGE-MoS是一种有效的解决方案，能够显著改善KGC模型的性能。

Abstract: Many Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) models, despite using powerful
encoders, rely on a simple vector-matrix multiplication to score queries
against candidate object entities. When the number of entities is larger than
the model's embedding dimension, which in practical scenarios is often by
several orders of magnitude, we have a linear output layer with a rank
bottleneck. Such bottlenecked layers limit model expressivity. We investigate
both theoretically and empirically how rank bottlenecks affect KGC models. We
find that, by limiting the set of feasible predictions, rank bottlenecks hurt
ranking accuracy and the distribution fidelity of scores. Inspired by the
language modelling literature, we propose KGE-MoS, a mixture-based output layer
to break rank bottlenecks in many KGC models. Our experiments on four datasets
show that KGE-MoS improves performance and probabilistic fit of KGC models for
a low parameter cost.

Abstract: The vast growth of data has rendered traditional manual inspection
infeasible, necessitating the adoption of computational methods for efficient
data exploration. Topic modeling has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing
large-scale textual datasets, enabling the extraction of latent semantic
structures. However, existing methods for topic modeling often struggle to
provide interpretable representations that facilitate deeper insights into data
structure and content. In this paper, we propose FAT-CAT, an approach based on
Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) to enhance meaningful topic aggregation and
visualization of discovered topics. Our approach can handle diverse topics and
file types -- grouped by directories -- to construct a concept lattice that
offers a structured, hierarchical representation of their topic distribution.
In a case study on the ETYNTKE dataset, we evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach against other representation methods to demonstrate that FCA-based
aggregation provides more meaningful and interpretable insights into dataset
composition than existing topic modeling techniques.

Abstract: This paper describes our research on AI agents embodied in visual, virtual or

environments. These agents, which include virtual avatars, wearable devices,

which makes them more similar to how humans learn and interact with the
environments as compared to disembodied agents. We propose that the development
of world models is central to reasoning and planning of embodied AI agents,
allowing these agents to understand and predict their environment, to
understand user intentions and social contexts, thereby enhancing their ability
to perform complex tasks autonomously. World modeling encompasses the
integration of multimodal perception, planning through reasoning for action and
control, and memory to create a comprehensive understanding of the physical
world. Beyond the physical world, we also propose to learn the mental world
model of users to enable better human-agent collaboration.

Abstract: Developing a general robot manipulation system capable of performing a wide
range of tasks in complex, dynamic, and unstructured real-world environments
has long been a challenging task. It is widely recognized that achieving
human-like efficiency and robustness manipulation requires the robotic brain to
integrate a comprehensive set of functions, such as task planning, policy
generation, anomaly monitoring and handling, and long-term memory, achieving
high-efficiency operation across all functions. Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
pretrained on massive multimodal data, have acquired rich world knowledge,
exhibiting exceptional scene understanding and multimodal reasoning
capabilities. However, existing methods typically focus on realizing only a
single function or a subset of functions within the robotic brain, without
integrating them into a unified cognitive architecture. Inspired by a
divide-and-conquer strategy and the architecture of the human brain, we propose
FrankenBot, a VLM-driven, brain-morphic robotic manipulation framework that
achieves both comprehensive functionality and high operational efficiency. Our
framework includes a suite of components, decoupling a part of key functions
from frequent VLM calls, striking an optimal balance between functional
completeness and system efficiency. Specifically, we map task planning, policy
generation, memory management, and low-level interfacing to the cortex,
cerebellum, temporal lobe-hippocampus complex, and brainstem, respectively, and
design efficient coordination mechanisms for the modules. We conducted
comprehensive experiments in both simulation and real-world robotic
environments, demonstrating that our method offers significant advantages in
anomaly detection and handling, long-term memory, operational efficiency, and
stability -- all without requiring any fine-tuning or retraining.

Result: 在多个ECG数据集上，MELP在零样本分类、线性探测和迁移学习任务中优于现有SSL方法。

Conclusion: MELP通过多尺度监督和跨模态对齐，显著提升了ECG分析的泛化能力和适应性。

Abstract: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) play a vital role in monitoring cardiac health and
diagnosing heart diseases. However, traditional deep learning approaches for
ECG analysis rely heavily on large-scale manual annotations, which are both
time-consuming and resource-intensive to obtain. To overcome this limitation,
self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising alternative, enabling
the extraction of robust ECG representations that can be efficiently
transferred to various downstream tasks. While previous studies have explored
SSL for ECG pretraining and multi-modal ECG-language alignment, they often fail
to capture the multi-scale nature of ECG signals. As a result, these methods
struggle to learn generalized representations due to their inability to model
the hierarchical structure of ECG data. To address this gap, we introduce MELP,
a novel Multi-scale ECG-Language Pretraining (MELP) model that fully leverages
hierarchical supervision from ECG-text pairs. MELP first pretrains a
cardiology-specific language model to enhance its understanding of clinical
text. It then applies three levels of cross-modal supervision-at the token,
beat, and rhythm levels-to align ECG signals with textual reports, capturing
structured information across different time scales. We evaluate MELP on three
public ECG datasets across multiple tasks, including zero-shot ECG
classification, linear probing, and transfer learning. Experimental results
demonstrate that MELP outperforms existing SSL methods, underscoring its
effectiveness and adaptability across diverse clinical applications. Our code

Result: 初步用户实验显示，该方法简化了科学知识的预处理，减少了语义化的工作量，并提升了知识表示的质量。

Conclusion: SciMantify方法通过人机协作，有效推动了科学知识从静态文档到语义化图谱的转化。

Abstract: Scientific publications, primarily digitized as PDFs, remain static and
unstructured, limiting the accessibility and reusability of the contained
knowledge. At best, scientific knowledge from publications is provided in
tabular formats, which lack semantic context. A more flexible, structured, and
semantic representation is needed to make scientific knowledge understandable
and processable by both humans and machines. We propose an evolution model of
knowledge representation, inspired by the 5-star Linked Open Data (LOD) model,
with five stages and defined criteria to guide the stepwise transition from a
digital artifact, such as a PDF, to a semantic representation integrated in a
knowledge graph (KG). Based on an exemplary workflow implementing the entire
model, we developed a hybrid approach, called SciMantify, leveraging tabular
formats of scientific knowledge, e.g., results from secondary studies, to
support its evolving semantification. In the approach, humans and machines
collaborate closely by performing semantic annotation tasks (SATs) and refining
the results to progressively improve the semantic representation of scientific
knowledge. We implemented the approach in the Open Research Knowledge Graph
(ORKG), an established platform for improving the findability, accessibility,
interoperability, and reusability of scientific knowledge. A preliminary user
experiment showed that the approach simplifies the preprocessing of scientific
knowledge, reduces the effort for the evolving semantification, and enhances
the knowledge representation through better alignment with the KG structures.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools -
especially large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT - has ushered in a
transformative era in higher education. Universities in developed regions are
increasingly integrating these technologies into research, teaching, and
assessment. On one hand, LLMs can enhance productivity by streamlining
literature reviews, facilitating idea generation, assisting with coding and
data analysis, and even supporting grant proposal drafting. On the other hand,
their use raises significant concerns regarding academic integrity, ethical
boundaries, and equitable access. Recent empirical studies indicate that nearly
47% of students use LLMs in their coursework - with 39% using them for exam
questions and 7% for entire assignments - while detection tools currently
achieve around 88% accuracy, leaving a 12% error margin. This article
critically examines the opportunities offered by generative AI, explores the
multifaceted challenges it poses, and outlines robust policy solutions.
Emphasis is placed on redesigning assessments to be AI-resilient, enhancing
staff and student training, implementing multi-layered enforcement mechanisms,
and defining acceptable use. By synthesizing data from recent research and case
studies, the article argues that proactive policy adaptation is imperative to
harness AI's potential while safeguarding the core values of academic integrity

with real humans than prior work, both at micro and macro levels. Additionally,
we conduct insightful experiments by modeling tens of thousands of agents and

Conclusion: 新模型为经典游戏求解算法提供了更现实的分析框架，揭示了算法在结构复杂性下的实际表现差异。

Abstract: Deterministic game-solving algorithms are conventionally analyzed in the
light of their average-case complexity against a distribution of random
game-trees, where leaf values are independently sampled from a fixed
distribution. This simplified model enables uncluttered mathematical analysis,
revealing two key properties: root value distributions asymptotically collapse
to a single fixed value for finite-valued trees, and all reasonable algorithms
achieve global optimality. However, these findings are artifacts of the model's
design-its long criticized independence assumption strips games of structural
complexity, producing trivial instances where no algorithm faces meaningful
challenges. To address this limitation, we introduce a new probabilistic model
that incrementally constructs game-trees using a fixed level-wise conditional
distribution. By enforcing ancestor dependency, a critical structural feature
of real-world games, our framework generates problems with adjustable
difficulty while retaining some form of analytical tractability. For several
algorithms, including AlphaBeta and Scout, we derive recursive formulas
characterizing their average-case complexities under this model. These allow us
to rigorously compare algorithms on deep game-trees, where Monte-Carlo
simulations are no longer feasible. While asymptotically, all algorithms seem
to converge to identical branching factor (a result analogous to those of
independence-based models), deep finite trees reveal stark differences:
AlphaBeta incurs a significantly larger constant multiplicative factor compared
to algorithms like Scout, leading to a substantial practical slowdown. Our
framework sheds new light on classical game-solving algorithms, offering
rigorous evidence and analytical tools to advance the understanding of these
methods under a more realistic, challenging, and yet tractable model.

Abstract: The challenge of balancing user relevance and content diversity in
recommender systems is increasingly critical amid growing concerns about
content homogeneity and reduced user engagement. In this work, we propose a
novel framework that leverages a multi-objective, contextual sequential
sampling strategy. Item selection is guided by Bayesian updates that
dynamically adjust scores to optimize diversity. The reward formulation
integrates multiple diversity metrics-including the log-determinant volume of a
tuned similarity submatrix and ridge leverage scores-along with a diversity
gain uncertainty term to address the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Both
intra- and inter-batch diversity are modeled to promote serendipity and
minimize redundancy. A dominance-based ranking procedure identifies
Pareto-optimal item sets, enabling adaptive and balanced selections at each
iteration. Experiments on a real-world dataset show that our approach
significantly improves diversity without sacrificing relevance, demonstrating
its potential to enhance user experience in large-scale recommendation
settings.

Abstract: This paper explores the fair allocation of indivisible items in a
multidimensional setting, motivated by the need to address fairness in complex
environments where agents assess bundles according to multiple criteria. Such
multidimensional settings are not merely of theoretical interest but are
central to many real-world applications. For example, cloud computing resources
are evaluated based on multiple criteria such as CPU cores, memory, and network
bandwidth. In such cases, traditional one dimensional fairness notions fail to
capture fairness across multiple attributes. To address these challenges, we
study two relaxed variants of envy-freeness: weak simultaneously envy-free up
to c goods (weak sEFc) and strong simultaneously envy-free up to c goods
(strong sEFc), which accommodate the multidimensionality of agents'
preferences. Under the weak notion, for every pair of agents and for each
dimension, any perceived envy can be eliminated by removing, if necessary, a
different set of goods from the envied agent's allocation. In contrast, the
strong version requires selecting a single set of goods whose removal from the
envied bundle simultaneously eliminates envy in every dimension. We provide
upper and lower bounds on the relaxation parameter c that guarantee the
existence of weak or strong sEFc allocations, where these bounds are
independent of the total number of items. In addition, we present algorithms
for checking whether a weak or strong sEFc allocation exists. Moreover, we
establish NP-hardness results for checking the existence of weak sEF1 and
strong sEF1 allocations.

information. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no real-life
proofs of concepts demonstrating the benefits of ML-based channel feedback
compression in a practical setting, where the user equipment (UE) and base
station have no access to each others' ML models. In this paper, we present a
novel approach for training interoperable compression and decompression ML
models in a confidential manner, and demonstrate the accuracy of the ensuing
models using prototype UEs and base stations. The performance of the ML-based
channel feedback is measured both in terms of the accuracy of the reconstructed
channel information and achieved downlink throughput gains when using the
channel information for beamforming. The reported measurement results
demonstrate that it is possible to develop an accurate ML-based channel
feedback link without having to share ML models between device and network
vendors. These results pave the way for a practical implementation of ML-based
channel feedback in commercial 6G networks.

TL;DR: UnMix-NeRF integrates spectral unmixing into NeRF for hyperspectral view synthesis and unsupervised material segmentation, improving material perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NeRF-based segmentation methods lack material properties, limiting applications like robotics and AR. UnMix-NeRF addresses this by modeling spectral reflectance.

Method: The framework uses diffuse and specular components with a learned dictionary of global endmembers and per-point abundances for material segmentation and scene editing.

Result: UnMix-NeRF outperforms existing methods in spectral reconstruction and material segmentation.

Conclusion: The approach successfully enhances material perception and enables flexible scene editing.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)-based segmentation methods focus on object
semantics and rely solely on RGB data, lacking intrinsic material properties.
This limitation restricts accurate material perception, which is crucial for
robotics, augmented reality, simulation, and other applications. We introduce
UnMix-NeRF, a framework that integrates spectral unmixing into NeRF, enabling
joint hyperspectral novel view synthesis and unsupervised material
segmentation. Our method models spectral reflectance via diffuse and specular
components, where a learned dictionary of global endmembers represents pure
material signatures, and per-point abundances capture their distribution. For
material segmentation, we use spectral signature predictions along learned
endmembers, allowing unsupervised material clustering. Additionally, UnMix-NeRF
enables scene editing by modifying learned endmember dictionaries for flexible
material-based appearance manipulation. Extensive experiments validate our
approach, demonstrating superior spectral reconstruction and material
segmentation to existing methods. Project page:

Conclusion: LCMs是实现稳健AI驱动电信管理的必要进化步骤。

Abstract: The telecommunications and networking domain stands at the precipice of a
transformative era, driven by the necessity to manage increasingly complex,
hierarchical, multi administrative domains (i.e., several operators on the same
path) and multilingual systems. Recent research has demonstrated that Large
Language Models (LLMs), with their exceptional general-purpose text analysis
and code generation capabilities, can be effectively applied to certain telecom
problems (e.g., auto-configuration of data plan to meet certain application
requirements). However, due to their inherent token-by-token processing and
limited capacity for maintaining extended context, LLMs struggle to fulfill
telecom-specific requirements such as cross-layer dependency cascades (i.e.,
over OSI), temporal-spatial fault correlation, and real-time distributed
coordination. In contrast, Large Concept Models (LCMs), which reason at the
abstraction level of semantic concepts rather than individual lexical tokens,
offer a fundamentally superior approach for addressing these telecom
challenges. By employing hyperbolic latent spaces for hierarchical
representation and encapsulating complex multi-layered network interactions
within concise concept embeddings, LCMs overcome critical shortcomings of LLMs
in terms of memory efficiency, cross-layer correlation, and native multimodal
integration. This paper argues that adopting LCMs is not simply an incremental
step, but a necessary evolutionary leap toward achieving robust and effective
AI-driven telecom management.

Abstract: Vision-based lane keeping is a topic of significant interest in the robotics

applications. The skid-steered vehicle architecture has served as a useful
vehicle platform for human controlled operations. However, systematic modeling,
especially of the skid-slip wheel terrain interactions (primarily in off-road
settings) has created bottlenecks for automation deployment. End-to-end
learning based methods such as imitation learning and deep reinforcement
learning, have gained prominence as a viable deployment option to counter the
lack of accurate analytical models. However, the systematic formulation and
subsequent verification/validation in dynamic operation regimes (particularly
for skid-steered vehicles) remains a work in progress. To this end, a novel
approach for structured formulation for learning visual navigation is proposed
and investigated in this work. Extensive software simulations, hardware
evaluations and ablation studies now highlight the significantly improved
performance of the proposed approach against contemporary literature.

Conclusion: HazeMatching是一种无需显式退化算子的实用方法，适用于真实显微数据。

Abstract: Fluorescence microscopy is a major driver of scientific progress in the life
sciences. Although high-end confocal microscopes are capable of filtering
out-of-focus light, cheaper and more accessible microscopy modalities, such as
widefield microscopy, can not, which consequently leads to hazy image data.
Computational dehazing is trying to combine the best of both worlds, leading to
cheap microscopy but crisp-looking images. The perception-distortion trade-off
tells us that we can optimize either for data fidelity, e.g. low MSE or high
PSNR, or for data realism, measured by perceptual metrics such as LPIPS or FID.
Existing methods either prioritize fidelity at the expense of realism, or
produce perceptually convincing results that lack quantitative accuracy. In
this work, we propose HazeMatching, a novel iterative method for dehazing light
microscopy images, which effectively balances these objectives. Our goal was to
find a balanced trade-off between the fidelity of the dehazing results and the
realism of individual predictions (samples). We achieve this by adapting the
conditional flow matching framework by guiding the generative process with a
hazy observation in the conditional velocity field. We evaluate HazeMatching on
5 datasets, covering both synthetic and real data, assessing both distortion
and perceptual quality. Our method is compared against 7 baselines, achieving a
consistent balance between fidelity and realism on average. Additionally, with
calibration analysis, we show that HazeMatching produces well-calibrated
predictions. Note that our method does not need an explicit degradation
operator to exist, making it easily applicable on real microscopy data. All
data used for training and evaluation and our code will be publicly available
under a permissive license.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly employed in diverse

land safely at docking stations for storage or recharging, which is an

integrates a multiscale fusion module for robust cross-scale object detection
and incorporates a segmentation branch for efficient orientation estimation. We
introduce a new evaluation metric, Average Warning Delay (AWD), to quantify the
system's sensitivity to landing deviations. Furthermore, we contribute a new
dataset, UAVLandData, which captures real-world landing deviation scenarios to
support training and evaluation. Experimental results show that our system
achieves an AWD of 0.7 seconds with a deviation detection accuracy of 98.6\%,
demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing UAV landing reliability. Code will

Abstract: Hearables are wearable computers that are worn on the ear. Bone conduction
microphones (BCMs) are used with air conduction microphones (ACMs) in hearables
as a supporting modality for multimodal speech enhancement (SE) in noisy
conditions. However, existing works don't consider the following practical

lowering the sampling frequencies and bit resolutions in analog-to-digital
converters (ADCs) of hearables jointly impact low-power processing and
multimodal SE in terms of speech quality and intelligibility. (ii) They don't
discuss how GAN-like audio quality can be achieved without using actual GAN
discriminators. And (iii) They don't process signals from ACMs/BCMs at
sub-Nyquist sampling rate because, in their frameworks, they lack a wideband
reconstruction methodology from their narrowband parts. We propose SUBARU
(\textbf{Sub}-Nyquist \textbf{A}udio \textbf{R}esolution \textbf{U}psampling),
which achieves the following: SUBARU (i) intentionally uses sub-Nyquist
sampling and low bit resolution in ADCs, achieving a 3.31x reduction in power
consumption; (ii) introduces novel multi-scale and multi-period virtual
discriminators, which achieve GAN-like audio quality without using GANs'
adversarial training; and (iii) achieves streaming operations on mobile
platforms and SE in in-the-wild noisy conditions with an inference time of
1.74ms and a memory footprint of less than 13.77MB.

Result: 在71M到1B的模型规模上，GPAS实现了性能提升，并适用于其他架构如Sandwich-LN和DeepNorm。

Conclusion: GPAS是一种简单有效的技术，可广泛应用于改进多种Transformer架构的训练动态。

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models, such as the LLaMA, Qwen and DeepSeek series,
predominantly adopt the Pre-LayerNorm (Pre-LN) Transformer architecture. While
being stable during pretraining and scalable to large model sizes, Pre-LN
suffers from an exponential growth in activation variance across layers,
causing the residual path to dominate over sub-layer outputs and limiting the
learning capacity of deeper layers. To mitigate this issue, we propose
Gradient-Preserving Activation Scaling (GPAS), a simple technique that can be
used in combination with existing approaches. GPAS works by scaling down the
intermediate activations while keeping their gradients unchanged. This leaves
information in the activations intact, and avoids the gradient vanishing
problem associated with gradient downscaling. Extensive experiments across
various model sizes from 71M to 1B show that GPAS achieves consistent
performance gains. Beyond enhancing Pre-LN Transformers, GPAS also shows
promise in improving alternative architectures such as Sandwich-LN and
DeepNorm, demonstrating its versatility and potential for improving training
dynamics in a wide range of settings.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly enhanced

Policy Optimization (GRPO), an efficient variant of PPO that lowers RL's
computational cost, still faces limited exploration, low sample efficiency and
instability, constraining its performance on complex reasoning tasks. To

framework that systematically augments GRPO along three critical dimensions.
EFRame performs additional rollouts to explore high-quality trajectories,
applies online filtering to eliminate low-quality samples that introduce noise
and variance, and leverages experience replay to repeatedly exploit rare but
informative samples. EFRame establishes a complete and stable learning cycle,
guiding the model through a structured transition from exploration to
convergence. Our experiments across a variety of reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that EFRame not only improves the robustness and efficiency of
training, but also enables access to deeper reasoning capabilities that remain
unattainable under vanilla GRPO. Furthermore, EFRame enables a more
fine-grained categorization of training samples, allowing for a deeper analysis
of how different types of samples contribute to the learning process in RL. Our

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在复杂推理任务中表现不佳，而强化学习（RL）虽然能提升LLMs的推理能力，但应用于MLLMs时存在性能下降和过度思考的问题。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-3B上应用该方法生成的View-R1-3B模型，推理能力平均提升7%，并在多个基准测试中优于更大的MLLMs，同时保持对通用任务的性能。

Conclusion: DADS和STCR技术有效提升了MLLMs的复杂推理能力，并具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are powerful at integrating diverse
data, but they often struggle with complex reasoning. While Reinforcement
learning (RL) can boost reasoning in LLMs, applying it to MLLMs is tricky.
Common issues include a drop in performance on general tasks and the generation
of overly detailed or "overthinking" reasoning. Our work investigates how the
KL penalty and overthinking affect RL training in MLLMs. We propose Asymmetric
Policy Optimization (APO) to address these issues, which divides the sampled
responses into positive and negative groups. For positive samples,
Difficulty-Adaptive Divergence Shaping (DADS) is introduced to dynamically
adjust the KL divergence weight based on their difficulty. This method prevents
policy entropy from dropping sharply, improves training stability, utilizes
samples better, and preserves the model's existing knowledge. For negative
samples, Suboptimal Trajectory Complexity Regularization (STCR) is proposed to
penalize overly long responses. This helps mitigate overthinking and encourages
more concise reasoning while preserving the model's explorative capacity. We
apply our method to Qwen2.5-VL-3B, creating View-R1-3B. View-R1-3B
significantly enhances reasoning capabilities, showing an average 7\% gain over
the base model and outperforming larger MLLMs (7-11B) on various reasoning
benchmarks. Importantly, unlike other reasoning-tuned MLLMs that often degrade
on general tasks, View-R1-3B maintains consistent improvement, demonstrating
superior generalization. These results highlight the effectiveness and broad
applicability of our DADS and STCR techniques for advancing complex multimodal
reasoning in MLLMs. The code will be made available at

Abstract: Large language models have steadily increased in size to achieve improved

reduction methods. To address this issue, we propose Projected Compression, a
novel model compression technique, that reduces model weights by utilizing
projection modules. Specifically, we first train additional trainable
projections weights and preserve access to all the original model parameters.
Subsequently, these projections are merged into a lower-dimensional product
matrix, resulting in a reduced-size standard Transformer-based model. Unlike
alternative approaches that require additional computational overhead, our
method matches the base model's per-token computation step in FLOPs.
Experimental results show that Projected Compression outperforms the comparable
hard pruning and retraining approach on higher quality models. Moreover, the
performance margin scales well with the number of tokens.

Abstract: Inference-time scaling has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing the
reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing
approaches often rely on heuristic strategies for parallel sampling, lacking a
principled foundation. To address this gap, we propose a probabilistic
framework that formalizes the optimality of inference-time scaling under the
assumption that parallel samples are independently and identically distributed
(i.i.d.), and where the Best-of-N selection strategy follows a probability
distribution that can be estimated. Within this framework, we derive a
theoretical lower bound on the required number of samples to achieve a target
performance level, providing the first principled guidance for
compute-efficient scaling. Leveraging this insight, we develop
\textsc{OptScale}, a practical algorithm that dynamically determines the
optimal number of sampled responses. \textsc{OptScale} employs a language
model-based predictor to estimate probabilistic prior parameters, enabling the
decision of the minimal number of samples needed that satisfy predefined
performance thresholds and confidence levels. Extensive experiments on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks (including MATH-500, GSM8K, AIME, and AMC)
demonstrate that \textsc{OptScale} significantly reduces sampling overhead
while remaining better or on par with state-of-the-art reasoning performance.
Our work offers both a theoretical foundation and a practical solution for
principled inference-time scaling, addressing a critical gap in the efficient
deployment of LLMs for complex reasoning.

Abstract: Online reinforcement learning (RL) with complex function approximations such
as transformers and deep neural networks plays a significant role in the modern
practice of artificial intelligence. Despite its popularity and importance,
balancing the fundamental trade-off between exploration and exploitation
remains a long-standing challenge; in particular, we are still in lack of
efficient and practical schemes that are backed by theoretical performance
guarantees. Motivated by recent developments in exploration via optimistic
regularization, this paper provides an interpretation of the principle of
optimism through the lens of primal-dual optimization. From this fresh
perspective, we set forth a new value-incentivized actor-critic (VAC) method,
which optimizes a single easy-to-optimize objective integrating exploration and
exploitation -- it promotes state-action and policy estimates that are both
consistent with collected data transitions and result in higher value
functions. Theoretically, the proposed VAC method has near-optimal regret
guarantees under linear Markov decision processes (MDPs) in both finite-horizon
and infinite-horizon settings, which can be extended to the general function
approximation setting under appropriate assumptions.

remarkable progress in this field due to the rapid development of deep neural

Reinforcement Learning (CRL) has emerged as a promising research direction to
address these limitations by enabling agents to learn continuously, adapt to
new tasks, and retain previously acquired knowledge. In this survey, we provide
a comprehensive examination of CRL, focusing on its core concepts, challenges,
and methodologies. Firstly, we conduct a detailed review of existing works,
organizing and analyzing their metrics, tasks, benchmarks, and scenario
settings. Secondly, we propose a new taxonomy of CRL methods, categorizing them
into four types from the perspective of knowledge storage and/or transfer.
Finally, our analysis highlights the unique challenges of CRL and provides
practical insights into future directions.

Conclusion: Transformer因其硬件友好性在当前硬件环境中表现优于传统GNNs。

Abstract: We establish connections between the Transformer architecture, originally
introduced for natural language processing, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
for representation learning on graphs. We show how Transformers can be viewed
as message passing GNNs operating on fully connected graphs of tokens, where
the self-attention mechanism capture the relative importance of all tokens
w.r.t. each-other, and positional encodings provide hints about sequential
ordering or structure. Thus, Transformers are expressive set processing
networks that learn relationships among input elements without being
constrained by apriori graphs. Despite this mathematical connection to GNNs,
Transformers are implemented via dense matrix operations that are significantly
more efficient on modern hardware than sparse message passing. This leads to
the perspective that Transformers are GNNs currently winning the hardware
lottery.

Conclusion: DNA为高效、可解释的模型设计提供了新方向，尤其在动态计算分配方面具有潜力。

Abstract: We introduce and train distributed neural architectures (DNA) in vision and
language domains. DNAs are initialized with a proto-architecture that consists
of (transformer, MLP, attention, etc.) modules and routers. Any token (or
patch) can traverse any series of modules in any order. DNAs are a natural
generalization of the sparse methods such as Mixture-of-Experts,
Mixture-of-Depths, parameter sharing, etc. Computation and communication
patterns of DNA modules are learnt end-to-end during training and depend on the
content and context of each token (or patch). These patterns can be shaped by
further requirements added to the optimization objective such as compute/memory
efficiency or load balancing. We empirically show that (i) trained DNAs are
competitive with the dense baselines in both domains and (ii) compute
efficiency/parameter sharing can be learnt from data. Next, we analyze the
emergent connectivity and computation patterns in the trained DNAs. We find
that the paths that tokens take through the models are themselves distributed
according to a power-law. We show that some paths (or, equivalently, groups of
modules) show emergent specialization. Finally, we demonstrate that models
learn to allocate compute and active parameters in an interpretable way.

Abstract: We introduce Massively Multi-Task Model-Based Policy Optimization (M3PO), a
scalable model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) framework designed to
address sample inefficiency in single-task settings and poor generalization in
multi-task domains. Existing model-based approaches like DreamerV3 rely on
pixel-level generative models that neglect control-centric representations,
while model-free methods such as PPO suffer from high sample complexity and
weak exploration. M3PO integrates an implicit world model, trained to predict
task outcomes without observation reconstruction, with a hybrid exploration
strategy that combines model-based planning and model-free uncertainty-driven
bonuses. This eliminates the bias-variance trade-off in prior methods by using
discrepancies between model-based and model-free value estimates to guide
exploration, while maintaining stable policy updates through a trust-region
optimizer. M3PO provides an efficient and robust alternative to existing
model-based policy optimization approaches and achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: 该框架为理解神经符号系统提供了理论基础，支持连续学习与离散代数推理的结合。

Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework that explains how discrete symbolic
structures can emerge naturally from continuous neural network training
dynamics. By lifting neural parameters to a measure space and modeling training
as Wasserstein gradient flow, we show that under geometric constraints, such as
group invariance, the parameter measure $\mu_t$ undergoes two concurrent
phenomena: (1) a decoupling of the gradient flow into independent optimization
trajectories over some potential functions, and (2) a progressive contraction
on the degree of freedom. These potentials encode algebraic constraints
relevant to the task and act as ring homomorphisms under a commutative
semi-ring structure on the measure space. As training progresses, the network
transitions from a high-dimensional exploration to compositional
representations that comply with algebraic operations and exhibit a lower
degree of freedom. We further establish data scaling laws for realizing
symbolic tasks, linking representational capacity to the group invariance that
facilitates symbolic solutions. This framework charts a principled foundation
for understanding and designing neurosymbolic systems that integrate continuous
learning with discrete algebraic reasoning.

Motivation: 在离线强化学习中，通常需要预定义的奖励函数，但在实际应用中（如视频游戏开发）奖励函数可能不可用。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试中，TROFI表现优于基线，与使用真实奖励函数相当，并在3D游戏环境中验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，奖励函数的设计对值函数与实际未来奖励的对齐至关重要。

Abstract: In offline reinforcement learning, agents are trained using only a fixed set
of stored transitions derived from a source policy. However, this requires that
the dataset be labeled by a reward function. In applied settings such as video
game development, the availability of the reward function is not always
guaranteed. This paper proposes Trajectory-Ranked OFfline Inverse reinforcement
learning (TROFI), a novel approach to effectively learn a policy offline
without a pre-defined reward function. TROFI first learns a reward function
from human preferences, which it then uses to label the original dataset making
it usable for training the policy. In contrast to other approaches, our method
does not require optimal trajectories. Through experiments on the D4RL
benchmark we demonstrate that TROFI consistently outperforms baselines and
performs comparably to using the ground truth reward to learn policies.
Additionally, we validate the efficacy of our method in a 3D game environment.
Our studies of the reward model highlight the importance of the reward function
in this setting: we show that to ensure the alignment of a value function to
the actual future discounted reward, it is fundamental to have a
well-engineered and easy-to-learn reward function.

Abstract: Large-language models (LLMs) and agentic systems present exciting
opportunities to accelerate drug discovery and design. In this study, we
critically examine the modularity of LLM-based agentic systems for drug
discovery, i.e., whether parts of the agentic system such as the LLM are
interchangeable, a topic that has received limited attention in drug discovery
applications. We compare the performance of different large language models
(LLMs) and the effectiveness of tool-calling agents versus code-generating
agents in this domain. Our case study, comparing performance in orchestrating
tools for chemistry and drug discovery using an LLM-as-a-judge score, shows
that Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Claude-3.7-Sonnet and GPT-4o outperform alternative
language models such as Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3.1-70B, GPT-3.5-Turbo, and
Nova-Micro. Although we confirm that code-generating agents outperform the
tool-calling ones on average, we show that this is highly question and model
dependent. Furthermore, the impact of replacing system prompts is dependent on
the specific question asked and the model used, underscoring that -- even in
this particular domain -- one cannot just replace language models without
considering prompt re-engineering. Our study highlights the necessity of
further research into the modularity of agentic systems to enable the
development of stable and scalable solutions for real-world problems.

Abstract: When using reinforcement learning (RL) to tackle physical control tasks,
inductive biases that encode physics priors can help improve sample efficiency
during training and enhance generalization in testing. However, the current
practice of incorporating these helpful physics-informed inductive biases
inevitably runs into significant manual labor and domain expertise, making them
prohibitive for general users. This work explores a symbolic approach to
distill physics-informed inductive biases into RL agents, where the physics
priors are expressed in a domain-specific language (DSL) that is human-readable
and naturally explainable. Yet, the DSL priors do not translate directly into
an implementable policy due to partial and noisy observations and additional
physical constraints in navigation tasks. To address this gap, we develop a
physics-informed program-guided RL (PiPRL) framework with applications to
indoor navigation. PiPRL adopts a hierarchical and modularized neuro-symbolic
integration, where a meta symbolic program receives semantically meaningful
features from a neural perception module, which form the bases for symbolic
programming that encodes physics priors and guides the RL process of a
low-level neural controller. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PiPRL
consistently outperforms purely symbolic or neural policies and reduces
training time by over 26% with the help of the program-based inductive biases.

Conclusion: UniCA展示了协变量感知TSFM适应在现实预测场景中的潜力。

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have achieved remarkable success
through large-scale pretraining. However, their design primarily targets
real-valued series, limiting their ability to handle general forecasting tasks
involving diverse and often heterogeneous covariates--such as categorical
variables and multimodal data (e.g., images, text)--which are typically
task-specific and difficult to leverage during pretraining. To address this
gap, we propose Unified Covariate Adaptation (UniCA), a framework to bridge
TSFMs with general covariate-aware forecasting. UniCA first performs covariate
homogenization to transform heterogeneous covariates into high-level
homogeneous series representations and then fuses them via a unified
attention-based fusion mechanism. UniCA is compatible and universal for
adaptation with both homogeneous and heterogeneous covariates, incorporating
extra covariate information while preserving the generalization ability of
TSFMs.Extensive experiments on multiple unimodal and multimodal covariate-aware
forecasting benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of UniCA, highlighting the
promise of covariate-aware TSFM adaptation in real-world forecasting scenarios.

Conclusion: Koopman增强的CFM在采样效率和可解释性上取得平衡，为快速可解释生成建模提供新方向。

Abstract: Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) offers a simulation-free framework for
training continuous-time generative models, bridging diffusion and flow-based
approaches. However, sampling from CFM still relies on numerically solving
non-linear ODEs which can be computationally expensive and difficult to
interpret. Recent alternatives address sampling speed via trajectory
straightening, mini-batch coupling or distillation. However, these methods
typically do not shed light on the underlying \textit{structure} of the
generative process. In this work, we propose to accelerate CFM and introduce an
interpretable representation of its dynamics by integrating Koopman operator
theory, which models non-linear flows as linear evolution in a learned space of
observables. We introduce a decoder-free Koopman-CFM architecture that learns
an embedding where the generative dynamics become linear, enabling closed-form,
one-step sampling via matrix exponentiation. This results in significant
speedups over traditional CFM as demonstrated on controlled 2D datasets and
real-world benchmarks, MNIST, Fashion-MNIST (F-MNIST), and the Toronto Face
Dataset (TFD). Unlike previous methods, our approach leads to a well-structured
Koopman generator, whose spectral properties, eigenvalues, and eigenfunctions
offer principled tools for analyzing generative behavior such as temporal
scaling, mode stability, and decomposition in Koopman latent space. By
combining sampling efficiency with analytical structure, Koopman-enhanced flow
matching offers a potential step toward fast and interpretable generative
modeling.

Conclusion: 该方法为二元分类提供了可靠的拒绝选项，用户可通过误差-拒绝曲线权衡误差率和拒绝率。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models always make a prediction, even when they are
likely to be wrong. This causes problems in practical applications, as we do
not know if we should trust a prediction. ML with reject option addresses this
issue by abstaining from making a prediction if it is likely to be incorrect.
In this work, we formalise the approach to ML with reject option in binary
classification, deriving theoretical guarantees on the resulting error rate.
This is achieved through conformal prediction (CP), which produce prediction
sets with distribution-free validity guarantees. In binary classification, CP
can output prediction sets containing exactly one, two or no labels. By
accepting only the singleton predictions, we turn CP into a binary classifier
with reject option.
  Here, CP is formally put in the framework of predicting with reject option.
We state and prove the resulting error rate, and give finite sample estimates.
Numerical examples provide illustrations of derived error rate through several
different conformal prediction settings, ranging from full conformal prediction
to offline batch inductive conformal prediction. The former has a direct link
to sharp validity guarantees, whereas the latter is more fuzzy in terms of
validity guarantees but can be used in practice. Error-reject curves illustrate
the trade-off between error rate and reject rate, and can serve to aid a user
to set an acceptable error rate or reject rate in practice.

Conclusion: DiffSoundStream在保持语音质量的同时显著提高了语音标记化的效率。

Abstract: Token-based language modeling is a prominent approach for speech generation,
where tokens are obtained by quantizing features from self-supervised learning
(SSL) models and extracting codes from neural speech codecs, generally referred
to as semantic tokens and acoustic tokens. These tokens are often modeled
autoregressively, with the inference speed being constrained by the token rate.
In this work, we propose DiffSoundStream, a solution that improves the
efficiency of speech tokenization in non-streaming scenarios through two
techniques: (1) conditioning the neural codec on semantic tokens to minimize
redundancy between semantic and acoustic tokens, and (2) leveraging latent
diffusion models to synthesize high-quality waveforms from semantic and
coarse-level acoustic tokens. Experiments show that at 50 tokens per second,
DiffSoundStream achieves speech quality on par with a standard SoundStream
model operating at twice the token rate. Additionally, we achieve step-size
distillation using just four diffusion sampling steps with only a minor quality
loss.

Abstract: Recently, continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) and diffusion models (DMs) have
been studied using the unified theoretical framework. Although such models can
generate high-quality data points from a noise distribution, the sampling
demands multiple iterations to solve an ordinary differential equation (ODE)
with high computational complexity. Most existing methods focus on reducing the
number of time steps during the sampling process to improve efficiency. In this
work, we explore a complementary direction in which the quality-complexity
tradeoff can be dynamically controlled in terms of time steps and in the length
of the neural network. We achieve this by rewiring the blocks in the
transformer-based architecture to solve an inner discretized ODE w.r.t. its
length. Then, we employ time- and length-wise consistency terms during flow
matching training, and as a result, the sampling can be performed with an
arbitrary number of time steps and transformer blocks. Unlike others, our
$\textrm{ODE}_t \left(\textrm{ODE}_l \right)$ approach is solver-agnostic in
time dimension and decreases both latency and memory usage. Compared to the
previous state of the art, image generation experiments on CelebA-HQ and
ImageNet show a latency reduction of up to $3\times$ in the most efficient
sampling mode, and a FID score improvement of up to $3.5$ points for
high-quality sampling. We release our code and model weights with fully
reproducible experiments.

Abstract: In many industries, predicting metric outcomes of large systems is a
fundamental problem, driven largely by traditional tabular regression. However,
such methods struggle on complex systems data in the wild such as configuration

text-to-text regression as a general, scalable alternative. For predicting
resource efficiency on Borg, Google's massive compute cluster scheduling
system, a 60M parameter encoder-decoder, trained from random initialization,
achieves up to a near perfect 0.99 (0.9 average) rank correlation across the
entire fleet, and 100x lower MSE than tabular approaches. The model also easily
adapts to new tasks in only 500 few-shot examples and captures the densities of

models with additional privacy, allowing estimation in a distributed manner
without losing estimation accuracy.
  Our numerical experiments confirm that FedIRT achieves statistical accuracy
similar to standard IRT estimation using popular R packages, while offering
critical advantages: privacy protection and reduced communication costs. We
also validate FedIRT's utility through a real-world exam dataset, demonstrating
its effectiveness in realistic educational contexts. This new framework extends
IRT's applicability to distributed settings, such as multi-school assessments,
without sacrificing accuracy or security. To support practical adoption, we
provide an open-ource R package, FedIRT, implementing the framework for the
two-parameter logistic (2PL) and partial credit models (PCM).

Motivation: 神经模糊网络（NFNs）具有透明性和符号化表达的优势，但其系统化设计仍具挑战性。现有方法通常分离参数和结构优化，导致架构脆弱且性能不佳。

Method: 提出了一种梯度基础的神经可塑性适应方法，同时优化NFNs的参数和结构，适用于在线强化学习等复杂任务。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在基于视觉的视频游戏DOOM中表现优异，验证了同时优化的有效性。

Conclusion: 同时优化NFNs的参数和结构能够显著提升性能，扩展了NFNs的应用范围。

Abstract: Neuro-fuzzy networks (NFNs) are transparent, symbolic, and universal function
approximations that perform as well as conventional neural architectures, but
their knowledge is expressed as linguistic IF-THEN rules. Despite these
advantages, their systematic design process remains a challenge. Existing work
will often sequentially build NFNs by inefficiently isolating parametric and
structural identification, leading to a premature commitment to brittle and
subpar architecture. We propose a novel application-independent approach called
gradient-based neuroplastic adaptation for the concurrent optimization of NFNs'
parameters and structure. By recognizing that NFNs' parameters and structure
should be optimized simultaneously as they are deeply conjoined, settings
previously unapproachable for NFNs are now accessible, such as the online
reinforcement learning of NFNs for vision-based tasks. The effectiveness of
concurrently optimizing NFNs is empirically shown as it is trained by online
reinforcement learning to proficiently play challenging scenarios from a
vision-based video game called DOOM.

Abstract: Graph foundation models using graph neural networks promise sustainable,
efficient atomistic modeling. To tackle challenges of processing multi-source,
multi-fidelity data during pre-training, recent studies employ multi-task
learning, in which shared message passing layers initially process input
atomistic structures regardless of source, then route them to multiple decoding
heads that predict data-specific outputs. This approach stabilizes pre-training
and enhances a model's transferability to unexplored chemical regions.
Preliminary results on approximately four million structures are encouraging,
yet questions remain about generalizability to larger, more diverse datasets
and scalability on supercomputers. We propose a multi-task parallelism method
that distributes each head across computing resources with GPU acceleration.
Implemented in the open-source HydraGNN architecture, our method was trained on
over 24 million structures from five datasets and tested on the Perlmutter,
Aurora, and Frontier supercomputers, demonstrating efficient scaling on all
three highly heterogeneous super-computing architectures.

Result: BP结合检查点技术表现最佳，比FmAD和ZO方法准确率高31.1%，收敛快34.8%，计算量少3.8倍。

Conclusion: FmAD和ZO在内存效率上虽有优势，但BP结合检查点仍是内存受限环境下最有效的训练策略。

Abstract: Forward-mode automatic differentiation (FmAD) and zero-order (ZO)
optimization have been proposed as memory-efficient alternatives to
backpropagation (BP) for gradient computation, especially in low-resource
settings. However, their practical benefits remain unclear due to two key gaps:
a lack of comparison against memory-efficient BP variants, such as activation
checkpointing, and a lack of a unified theoretical analysis. This work presents
a comprehensive theoretical and empirical comparison of BP, FmAD, and ZO
methods. Our theoretical analysis shows that while FmAD, and ZO can reduce
memory usage, they incur significant costs in accuracy, convergence speed, and
computation compared to BP with checkpointing. These drawbacks worsen with
larger models or constrained perturbation budgets. Empirical experiments on
large language and vision-language models show that BP with checkpointing
outperforms FmAD and ZO variants, including those enhanced with variance
reduction, achieving up to 31.1% higher accuracy, 34.8% faster convergence, and
3.8x fewer computations at comparable memory usage. Our results highlight
fundamental limitations of FmAD and ZO, and reaffirm BP with checkpointing as
the most effective strategy for model training under memory-constrained
settings. Our code is available at

Abstract: The evolution toward 6G networks demands a fundamental shift from bit-centric
transmission to semantic-aware communication that emphasizes task-relevant
information. This work introduces TOAST (Task-Oriented Adaptive Semantic
Transmission), a unified framework designed to address the core challenge of
multi-task optimization in dynamic wireless environments through three
complementary components. First, we formulate adaptive task balancing as a
Markov decision process, employing deep reinforcement learning to dynamically
adjust the trade-off between image reconstruction fidelity and semantic
classification accuracy based on real-time channel conditions. Second, we
integrate module-specific Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) mechanisms throughout our
Swin Transformer-based joint source-channel coding architecture, enabling
parameter-efficient fine-tuning that dramatically reduces adaptation overhead
while maintaining full performance across diverse channel impairments including
Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN), fading, phase noise, and impulse
interference. Third, we incorporate an Elucidating diffusion model that
operates in the latent space to restore features corrupted by channel noises,
providing substantial quality improvements compared to baseline approaches.
Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that TOAST achieves
superior performance compared to baseline approaches, with significant
improvements in both classification accuracy and reconstruction quality at low
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) conditions while maintaining robust performance
across all tested scenarios.

Abstract: In the realm of online advertising, advertisers partake in ad auctions to
obtain advertising slots, frequently taking advantage of auto-bidding tools
provided by demand-side platforms. To improve the automation of these bidding
systems, we adopt generative models, namely the Decision Transformer (DT), to
tackle the difficulties inherent in automated bidding. Applying the Decision
Transformer to the auto-bidding task enables a unified approach to sequential
modeling, which efficiently overcomes short-sightedness by capturing long-term
dependencies between past bidding actions and user behavior. Nevertheless,
conventional DT has certain drawbacks: (1) DT necessitates a preset
return-to-go (RTG) value before generating actions, which is not inherently
produced; (2) The policy learned by DT is restricted by its training data,
which is consists of mixed-quality trajectories. To address these challenges,
we introduce the R* Decision Transformer (R* DT), developed in a three-step
process: (1) R DT: Similar to traditional DT, R DT stores actions based on
state and RTG value, as well as memorizing the RTG for a given state using the
training set; (2) R^ DT: We forecast the highest value (within the training
set) of RTG for a given state, deriving a suboptimal policy based on the
current state and the forecasted supreme RTG value; (3) R* DT: Based on R^ DT,
we generate trajectories and select those with high rewards (using a simulator)
to augment our training dataset. This data enhancement has been shown to
improve the RTG of trajectories in the training data and gradually leads the
suboptimal policy towards optimality. Comprehensive tests on a publicly
available bidding dataset validate the R* DT's efficacy and highlight its
superiority when dealing with mixed-quality trajectories.

Abstract: Inference tasks with time series over graphs are of importance in
applications such as urban water networks, economics, and networked
neuroscience. Addressing these tasks typically relies on identifying a
computationally affordable model that jointly captures the graph-temporal
patterns of the data. In this work, we propose a graph-aware state space model
for graph time series, where both the latent state and the observation equation
are parametric graph-induced models with a limited number of parameters that
need to be learned. More specifically, we consider the state equation to follow
a stochastic partial differential equation driven by noise over the graphs
edges accounting not only for potential edge uncertainties but also for
increasing the degrees of freedom in the latter in a tractable manner. The
graph structure conditioning of the noise dispersion allows the state variable
to deviate from the stochastic process in certain neighborhoods. The
observation model is a sampled and graph-filtered version of the state
capturing multi-hop neighboring influence. The goal is to learn the parameters
in both state and observation models from the partially observed data for
downstream tasks such as prediction and imputation. The model is inferred first
through a maximum likelihood approach that provides theoretical tractability
but is limited in expressivity and scalability. To improve on the latter, we
use the state-space formulation to build a principled deep learning
architecture that jointly learns the parameters and tracks the state in an
end-to-end manner in the spirit of Kalman neural networks.

Abstract: With the increasing multimodal knowledge privatization requirements,

federated MKGs for better predicting the missing links in clients without
sharing sensitive knowledge. We propose a framework named MMFeD3-HidE for
addressing multimodal uncertain unavailability and multimodal client

Hyper-modal Imputation Diffusion Embedding model (HidE) recovers the complete
multimodal distributions from incomplete entity embeddings constrained by
available modalities. (2) Among clients, our proposed Multimodal FeDerated Dual
Distillation (MMFeD3) transfers knowledge mutually between clients and the
server with logit and feature distillation to improve both global convergence

evaluation, consisting of a general FedMKGC backbone named MMFedE, datasets
with heterogeneous multimodal information, and three groups of constructed
baselines. Experiments conducted on our benchmark validate the effectiveness,
semantic consistency, and convergence robustness of MMFeD3-HidE.

Abstract: Learning-based methods for routing have gained significant attention in

the multigraph setting, where multiple paths with distinct attributes can exist

relevancy. In this paper, we introduce two neural approaches to address
multi-objective routing on multigraphs. Our first approach works directly on
the multigraph, by autoregressively selecting edges until a tour is completed.
On the other hand, our second model first prunes the multigraph into a simple
graph and then builds routes. We validate both models experimentally and find
that they demonstrate strong performance across a variety of problems,
including the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing
Problem (CVRP).

Abstract: Decision making under uncertain environments in the maximization of expected
reward while minimizing its risk is one of the ubiquitous problems in many
subjects. Here, we introduce a novel problem setting in stochastic bandit
optimization that jointly addresses two critical aspects of decision-making:
maximizing expected reward and minimizing associated uncertainty, quantified
via the mean-variance(MV) criterion. Unlike traditional bandit formulations
that focus solely on expected returns, our objective is to efficiently and
accurately identify the Pareto-optimal set of arms that strikes the best
trade-off between expected performance and risk. We propose a unified
meta-algorithmic framework capable of operating under both fixed-confidence and
fixed-budget regimes, achieved through adaptive design of confidence intervals
tailored to each scenario using the same sample exploration strategy. We
provide theoretical guarantees on the correctness of the returned solutions in
both settings. To complement this theoretical analysis, we conduct extensive
empirical evaluations across synthetic benchmarks, demonstrating that our
approach outperforms existing methods in terms of both accuracy and sample
efficiency, highlighting its broad applicability to risk-aware decision-making
tasks in uncertain environments.

Abstract: Low-rank tensor decompositions (TDs) provide an effective framework for
multiway data analysis. Traditional TD methods rely on predefined structural
assumptions, such as CP or Tucker decompositions. From a probabilistic
perspective, these can be viewed as using Dirac delta distributions to model
the relationships between shared factors and the low-rank tensor. However, such
prior knowledge is rarely available in practical scenarios, particularly
regarding the optimal rank structure and contraction rules. The optimization
procedures based on fixed contraction rules are complex, and approximations
made during these processes often lead to accuracy loss. To address this issue,
we propose a score-based model that eliminates the need for predefined
structural or distributional assumptions, enabling the learning of
compatibility between tensors and shared factors. Specifically, a neural
network is designed to learn the energy function, which is optimized via score
matching to capture the gradient of the joint log-probability of tensor entries
and shared factors. Our method allows for modeling structures and distributions
beyond the Dirac delta assumption. Moreover, integrating the block coordinate
descent (BCD) algorithm with the proposed smooth regularization enables the
model to perform both tensor completion and denoising. Experimental results
demonstrate significant performance improvements across various tensor types,
including sparse and continuous-time tensors, as well as visual data.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have garnered substantial attention due to their
remarkable capability in learning graph representations. However, real-world
graphs often exhibit substantial noise and incompleteness, which severely
degrades the performance of GNNs. Existing methods typically address this issue
through single-dimensional augmentation, focusing either on refining topology
structures or perturbing node attributes, thereby overlooking the deeper
interplays between the two. To bridge this gap, this paper presents CoATA, a
dual-channel GNN framework specifically designed for the Co-Augmentation of
Topology and Attribute. Specifically, CoATA first propagates structural signals
to enrich and denoise node attributes. Then, it projects the enhanced attribute
space into a node-attribute bipartite graph for further refinement or
reconstruction of the underlying structure. Subsequently, CoATA introduces
contrastive learning, leveraging prototype alignment and consistency
constraints, to facilitate mutual corrections between the augmented and
original graphs. Finally, extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the proposed CoATA outperforms eleven state-of-the-art
baseline methods, showcasing its effectiveness in capturing the synergistic
relationship between topology and attributes.

Abstract: Domain shift is a significant challenge in machine learning, particularly in
medical applications where data distributions differ across institutions due to
variations in data collection practices, equipment, and procedures. This can
degrade performance when models trained on source domain data are applied to
the target domain. Domain adaptation methods have been widely studied to
address this issue, but most struggle when class proportions between the source
and target domains differ. In this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised domain
adaptation method that leverages class proportion information from the target
domain, which is often accessible in medical datasets through prior knowledge
or statistical reports. Our method assigns pseudo-labels to the unlabeled
target data based on class proportion (called proportion-constrained
pseudo-labeling), improving performance without the need for additional
annotations. Experiments on two endoscopic datasets demonstrate that our method
outperforms semi-supervised domain adaptation techniques, even when 5% of the
target domain is labeled. Additionally, the experimental results with noisy
proportion labels highlight the robustness of our method, further demonstrating
its effectiveness in real-world application scenarios.

Abstract: Adapting machine learning models to medical time series across different

### [293] [ARMOR: Robust Reinforcement Learning-based Control for UAVs under Physical Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22423)
*Pritam Dash,Ethan Chan,Nathan P. Lawrence,Karthik Pattabiraman*

Main category: cs.LG

Relevance: 40.0

TL;DR: ARMOR是一种针对无人机（UAV）在传感器攻击下的鲁棒强化学习控制器，通过两阶段训练框架学习鲁棒潜在状态表示，确保安全操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机传感器易受物理攻击（如GPS欺骗），现有安全强化学习方法对此无效，需要一种新的鲁棒控制器。

Method: ARMOR采用两阶段训练：教师编码器利用特权攻击信息生成潜在状态，学生编码器通过监督学习近似教师输出，仅使用历史传感器数据。

Result: ARMOR优于传统方法，确保无人机安全，提高对未见攻击的泛化能力，并降低训练成本。

Conclusion: ARMOR为无人机在传感器攻击下的鲁棒控制提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) depend on onboard sensors for perception,
navigation, and control. However, these sensors are susceptible to physical
attacks, such as GPS spoofing, that can corrupt state estimates and lead to
unsafe behavior. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers adaptive control
capabilities, existing safe RL methods are ineffective against such attacks. We
present ARMOR (Adaptive Robust Manipulation-Optimized State Representations),
an attack-resilient, model-free RL controller that enables robust UAV operation
under adversarial sensor manipulation. Instead of relying on raw sensor
observations, ARMOR learns a robust latent representation of the UAV's physical
state via a two-stage training framework. In the first stage, a teacher
encoder, trained with privileged attack information, generates attack-aware
latent states for RL policy training. In the second stage, a student encoder is
trained via supervised learning to approximate the teacher's latent states
using only historical sensor data, enabling real-world deployment without
privileged information. Our experiments show that ARMOR outperforms
conventional methods, ensuring UAV safety. Additionally, ARMOR improves
generalization to unseen attacks and reduces training cost by eliminating the
need for iterative adversarial training.

Motivation: DCNv2在推荐系统中表现优异，但仍存在信息丢失等局限性，需要改进以提升性能。

Method: 提出了三项算法改进：解决Cross层信息丢失、引入可学习的查找级权重管理碰撞、自定义层模拟FFM行为。

Result: DCN^2在离线、在线测试及四个公开数据集上均优于DCNv2，处理能力达每秒5亿次预测。

Conclusion: DCN^2显著提升了推荐系统的性能，解决了DCNv2的关键问题。

Abstract: The Deep and Cross architecture (DCNv2) is a robust production baseline and
is integral to numerous real-life recommender systems. Its inherent efficiency
and ability to model interactions often result in models that are both simpler
and highly competitive compared to more computationally demanding alternatives,
such as Deep FFMs. In this work, we introduce three significant algorithmic
improvements to the DCNv2 architecture, detailing their formulation and
behavior at scale. The enhanced architecture we refer to as DCN^2 is actively
used in a live recommender system, processing over 0.5 billion predictions per
second across diverse use cases where it out-performed DCNv2, both offline and
online (ab tests). These improvements effectively address key limitations
observed in the DCNv2, including information loss in Cross layers, implicit
management of collisions through learnable lookup-level weights, and explicit
modeling of pairwise similarities with a custom layer that emulates FFMs'
behavior. The superior performance of DCN^2 is also demonstrated on four
publicly available benchmark data sets.

Abstract: Simulating showers of particles in highly-granular calorimeters is a key
frontier in the application of machine learning to particle physics. Achieving
high accuracy and speed with generative machine learning models can enable them
to augment traditional simulations and alleviate a major computing constraint.
Recent developments have shown how diffusion based generative shower simulation
approaches that do not rely on a fixed structure, but instead generate
geometry-independent point clouds, are very efficient. We present a
transformer-based extension to previous architectures which were developed for
simulating electromagnetic showers in the highly granular electromagnetic
calorimeter of the International Large Detector, ILD. The attention mechanism
now allows us to generate complex hadronic showers with more pronounced
substructure across both the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters. This is
the first time that machine learning methods are used to holistically generate
showers across the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeter in highly granular
imaging calorimeter systems.

Abstract: We propose an extension of Thompson sampling to optimization problems over
function spaces where the objective is a known functional of an unknown
operator's output. We assume that functional evaluations are inexpensive, while
queries to the operator (such as running a high-fidelity simulator) are costly.
Our algorithm employs a sample-then-optimize approach using neural operator
surrogates. This strategy avoids explicit uncertainty quantification by
treating trained neural operators as approximate samples from a Gaussian
process. We provide novel theoretical convergence guarantees, based on Gaussian
processes in the infinite-dimensional setting, under minimal assumptions. We
benchmark our method against existing baselines on functional optimization
tasks involving partial differential equations and other nonlinear
operator-driven phenomena, demonstrating improved sample efficiency and
competitive performance.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅解决了未配对数据问题，还确保了物理参数的正确使用，为学习物理动力学提供了详细见解。

Abstract: Physics phenomena are often described by ordinary and/or partial differential
equations (ODEs/PDEs), and solved analytically or numerically. Unfortunately,
many real-world systems are described only approximately with missing or
unknown terms in the equations. This makes the distribution of the physics
model differ from the true data-generating process (DGP). Using limited and
unpaired data between DGP observations and the imperfect model simulations, we
investigate this particular setting by completing the known-physics model,
combining theory-driven models and data-driven to describe the shifted
distribution involved in the DGP. We present a novel hybrid generative model
approach combining deep grey-box modelling with Optimal Transport (OT) methods
to enhance incomplete physics models. Our method implements OT maps in data
space while maintaining minimal source distribution distortion, demonstrating
superior performance in resolving the unpaired problem and ensuring correct
usage of physics parameters. Unlike black-box alternatives, our approach
leverages physics-based inductive biases to accurately learn system dynamics
while preserving interpretability through its domain knowledge foundation.
Experimental results validate our method's effectiveness in both generation
tasks and model transparency, offering detailed insights into learned physics
dynamics.

Motivation: 当前深度学习理论多局限于ReLU激活函数，缺乏对其他常见激活函数的理论理解。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过分析典型激活函数的RKHS（再生核希尔伯特空间）性质，研究NTK和NNGP的广泛适用性，包括特殊情况如无偏置网络、两层网络或多项式激活函数。

Result: 研究发现，一类非无限光滑的激活函数在不同网络深度下生成等价的RKHS，而多项式激活函数则生成非等价的RKHS。此外，还推导了NNGP样本路径的平滑性。

Conclusion: 本文为更广泛的激活函数提供了理论支持，扩展了深度学习理论的应用范围。

Abstract: While the theory of deep learning has made some progress in recent years,
much of it is limited to the ReLU activation function. In particular, while the
neural tangent kernel (NTK) and neural network Gaussian process kernel (NNGP)
have given theoreticians tractable limiting cases of fully connected neural
networks, their properties for most activation functions except for powers of
the ReLU function are poorly understood. Our main contribution is to provide a
more general characterization of the RKHS of these kernels for typical
activation functions whose only non-smoothness is at zero, such as SELU, ELU,
or LeakyReLU. Our analysis also covers a broad set of special cases such as
missing biases, two-layer networks, or polynomial activations. Our results show
that a broad class of not infinitely smooth activations generate equivalent
RKHSs at different network depths, while polynomial activations generate
non-equivalent RKHSs. Finally, we derive results for the smoothness of NNGP
sample paths, characterizing the smoothness of infinitely wide neural networks
at initialization.

Existing model-based algorithms for risk measures like the entropic risk

Q-learning algorithm to compute the optimal stationary policy for total-reward
ERM and EVaR objectives with strong convergence and performance guarantees. The
algorithm and its optimality are made possible by ERM's dynamic consistency and
elicitability. Our numerical results on tabular domains demonstrate quick and

Abstract: Density-based clustering methods often surpass centroid-based counterparts,
when addressing data with noise or arbitrary data distributions common in
real-world problems. In this study, we reveal a key property intrinsic to
density-based clustering methods regarding the relation between the number of
clusters and the neighborhood radius of core points - we empirically show that
it is nearly unimodal, and support this claim theoretically in a specific
setting. We leverage this property to devise new strategies for finding
appropriate values for the radius more efficiently based on the Ternary Search
algorithm. This is especially important for large scale data that is
high-dimensional, where parameter tuning is computationally intensive. We
validate our methodology through extensive applications across a range of
high-dimensional, large-scale NLP, Audio, and Computer Vision tasks,
demonstrating its practical effectiveness and robustness. This work not only
offers a significant advancement in parameter control for density-based
clustering but also broadens the understanding regarding the relations between
their guiding parameters. Our code is available at

Abstract: It is sometimes difficult to achieve a complete observation for a full set of
observables, and partial observations are necessary. For deterministic systems,
the Mori-Zwanzig formalism provides a theoretical framework for handling
partial observations. Recently, data-driven algorithms based on the Koopman
operator theory have made significant progress, and there is a discussion to
connect the Mori-Zwanzig formalism with the Koopman operator theory. In this
work, we discuss the effects of partial observation in stochastic systems using
the Koopman operator theory. The discussion clarifies the importance of
distinguishing the state space and the function space in stochastic systems.
Even in stochastic systems, the delay embedding technique is beneficial for
partial observation, and several numerical experiments showed a power-law
behavior of the accuracy for the amplitude of the additive noise. We also
discuss the relation between the exponent of the power-law behavior and the
effects of partial observation.

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) offer potential for near-term quantum

poorly conditioned optimization landscapes. We introduce GuiderNet, a
meta-learning framework that conditions Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQCs)
using data-dependent parameter shifts aimed at minimizing the log condition
number of the Fubini-Study metric tensor. Implemented as a classical neural

steer both initialization and adaptive modulation during training.
  Applied to the Kaggle Diabetes classification task, GuiderNet reduces
cumulative training loss by over 5x, improves test accuracy from 75.3% to
98.6%, and increases the minority-class F1 score from 0.67 to 0.95. It also

Abstract: Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) has attracted considerable attention
across various fields and artificial intelligence (AI) technology plays an
important role in DAS applications to realize event recognition and denoising.
Existing AI models require real-world data (RWD), whether labeled or not, for
training, which is contradictory to the fact of limited available event data in
real-world scenarios. Here, a physics-informed DAS neural network paradigm is
proposed, which does not need real-world events data for training. By
physically modeling target events and the constraints of real world and DAS
system, physical functions are derived to train a generative network for
generation of DAS events data. DAS debackground net is trained by using the
generated DAS events data to eliminate background noise in DAS data. The
effectiveness of the proposed paradigm is verified in event identification
application based on a public dataset of DAS spatiotemporal data and in belt
conveyor fault monitoring application based on DAS time-frequency data, and
achieved comparable or better performance than data-driven networks trained
with RWD. Owing to the introduction of physical information and capability of
background noise removal, the paradigm demonstrates generalization in same
application on different sites. A fault diagnosis accuracy of 91.8% is achieved
in belt conveyor field with networks which transferred from simulation test
site without any fault events data of test site and field for training. The
proposed paradigm is a prospective solution to address significant obstacles of
data acquisition and intense noise in practical DAS applications and explore
more potential fields for DAS.

Abstract: The goal of traffic simulation is to augment a potentially limited amount of
manually-driven miles that is available for testing and validation, with a much
larger amount of simulated synthetic miles. The culmination of this vision
would be a generative simulated city, where given a map of the city and an
autonomous vehicle (AV) software stack, the simulator can seamlessly simulate
the trip from point A to point B by populating the city around the AV and
controlling all aspects of the scene, from animating the dynamic agents (e.g.,
vehicles, pedestrians) to controlling the traffic light states. We refer to
this vision as CitySim, which requires an agglomeration of simulation
technologies: scene generation to populate the initial scene, agent behavior
modeling to animate the scene, occlusion reasoning, dynamic scene generation to
seamlessly spawn and remove agents, and environment simulation for factors such
as traffic lights. While some key technologies have been separately studied in
various works, others such as dynamic scene generation and environment
simulation have received less attention in the research community. We propose
SceneDiffuser++, the first end-to-end generative world model trained on a
single loss function capable of point A-to-B simulation on a city scale
integrating all the requirements above. We demonstrate the city-scale traffic
simulation capability of SceneDiffuser++ and study its superior realism under
long simulation conditions. We evaluate the simulation quality on an augmented
version of the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) with larger map regions to
support trip-level simulation.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new type of probabilistic semiparametric model that
takes advantage of data binning to reduce the computational cost of kernel
density estimation in nonparametric distributions. Two new conditional
probability distributions are developed for the new binned semiparametric
Bayesian networks, the sparse binned kernel density estimation and the Fourier
kernel density estimation. These two probability distributions address the
curse of dimensionality, which typically impacts binned models, by using sparse
tensors and restricting the number of parent nodes in conditional probability
calculations. To evaluate the proposal, we perform a complexity analysis and
conduct several comparative experiments using synthetic data and datasets from
the UCI Machine Learning repository. The experiments include different binning
rules, parent restrictions, grid sizes, and number of instances to get a
holistic view of the model's behavior. As a result, our binned semiparametric
Bayesian networks achieve structural learning and log-likelihood estimations
with no statistically significant differences compared to the semiparametric
Bayesian networks, but at a much higher speed. Thus, the new binned
semiparametric Bayesian networks prove to be a reliable and more efficient
alternative to their non-binned counterparts.

Abstract: In the aftermath of major earthquakes, evaluating structural and
infrastructural damage is vital for coordinating post-disaster response
efforts. This includes assessing damage's extent and spatial distribution to
prioritize rescue operations and resource allocation. Accurately estimating
damage grades to buildings post-earthquake is paramount for effective response
and recovery, given the significant impact on lives and properties,
underscoring the urgency of streamlining relief fund allocation processes.
Previous studies have shown the effectiveness of multi-class classification,
especially XGBoost, along with other machine learning models and ensembling
methods, incorporating regularization to address class imbalance. One
consequence of class imbalance is that it may give rise to skewed models that
undervalue minority classes and give preference to the majority class. This
research deals with the problem of class imbalance with the help of the
synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). We delve into multiple
multi-class classification machine learning, deep learning models, and
ensembling methods to forecast structural damage grades. The study elucidates
performance determinants through comprehensive feature manipulation experiments
and diverse training approaches. It identifies key factors contributing to
seismic vulnerability while evaluating model performance using techniques like
the confusion matrix further to enhance understanding of the effectiveness of
earthquake damage prediction.

in control system design. To address this issue, this work pro poses a
parameterization method for control law learning using reproducing kernel
Hilbert spaces and designs a data-driven active learning control approach.
Specifically, the proposed method treats the control law as an element in a
function space, allowing the design of control laws without imposing
restrictions on the system structure or the form of the controller. A TS
framework is proposed in this work to explore potential optimal control laws,
and the convergence guarantees are further provided for the learning process.
Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed method learns the relationship
between control laws and closed-loop performance metrics at an exponential
rate, and the upper bound of control regret is also derived. Numerical
experiments on controlling unknown nonlinear systems validate the effectiveness
of the proposed method.

TL;DR: LGES是GES的改进版本，通过更针对性的搜索策略提高了计算效率和准确性，同时支持先验假设和干预数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GES算法在计算成本和有限样本准确性上的局限性。

Method: 修改贪婪步骤，避免在条件独立变量间插入边，并支持先验假设和干预数据。

Result: 实验显示LGES在速度、准确性和鲁棒性上优于GES及其他基线方法。

Conclusion: LGES在理论和实践中均表现出色，适用于因果发现任务。

Abstract: Greedy Equivalence Search (GES) is a classic score-based algorithm for causal
discovery from observational data. In the sample limit, it recovers the Markov
equivalence class of graphs that describe the data. Still, it faces two
challenges in practice: computational cost and finite-sample accuracy. In this
paper, we develop Less Greedy Equivalence Search (LGES), a variant of GES that
retains its theoretical guarantees while partially addressing these
limitations. LGES modifies the greedy step: rather than always applying the
highest-scoring insertion, it avoids edge insertions between variables for
which the score implies some conditional independence. This more targeted
search yields up to a \(10\)-fold speed-up and a substantial reduction in
structural error relative to GES. Moreover, LGES can guide the search using
prior assumptions, while correcting these assumptions when contradicted by the
data. Finally, LGES can exploit interventional data to refine the learned
observational equivalence class. We prove that LGES recovers the true
equivalence class in the sample limit from observational and interventional
data, even with misspecified prior assumptions. Experiments demonstrate that
LGES outperforms GES and other baselines in speed, accuracy, and robustness to
misspecified assumptions. Our code is available at

Abstract: It is now well understood that diverse datasets provide a lot of value in key
epidemiology and public health analyses, such as forecasting and nowcasting,
development of epidemic models, evaluation and design of interventions and
resource allocation. Some of these datasets are often sensitive, and need
adequate privacy protections. There are many models of privacy, but
Differential Privacy (DP) has become a de facto standard because of its strong
guarantees, without making models about adversaries. In this paper, we develop
a framework the integrates deep learning and epidemic models to simultaneously
perform epidemic forecasting and learning a mechanistic model of epidemic
spread, while incorporating multiple datasets for these analyses, including
some with DP guarantees. We demonstrate our framework using a realistic but
synthetic financial dataset with DP; such a dataset has not been used in such
epidemic analyses. We show that this dataset provides significant value in
forecasting and learning an epidemic model, even when used with DP guarantees.

Conclusion: Sheaf-DMFL框架有效解决了多模态和异构设备下的协作问题，具有理论和实际应用价值。

Abstract: In large-scale communication systems, increasingly complex scenarios require
more intelligent collaboration among edge devices collecting various multimodal
sensory data to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the environment
and improve decision-making accuracy. However, conventional federated learning
(FL) algorithms typically consider unimodal datasets, require identical model
architectures, and fail to leverage the rich information embedded in multimodal
data, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios with diverse
modalities and varying client capabilities. To address this issue, we propose
Sheaf-DMFL, a novel decentralized multimodal learning framework leveraging
sheaf theory to enhance collaboration among devices with diverse modalities.
Specifically, each client has a set of local feature encoders for its different
modalities, whose outputs are concatenated before passing through a
task-specific layer. While encoders for the same modality are trained
collaboratively across clients, we capture the intrinsic correlations among
clients' task-specific layers using a sheaf-based structure. To further enhance
learning capability, we propose an enhanced algorithm named Sheaf-DMFL-Att,
which tailors the attention mechanism within each client to capture
correlations among different modalities. A rigorous convergence analysis of
Sheaf-DMFL-Att is provided, establishing its theoretical guarantees. Extensive
simulations are conducted on real-world link blockage prediction and mmWave
beamforming scenarios, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithms
in such heterogeneous wireless communication systems.

Conclusion: CLoVE在CFL和PFL任务中表现优异，具有简单性、鲁棒性和广泛适用性。

Abstract: We propose CLoVE (Clustering of Loss Vector Embeddings), a novel algorithm
for Clustered Federated Learning (CFL). In CFL, clients are naturally grouped
into clusters based on their data distribution. However, identifying these
clusters is challenging, as client assignments are unknown. CLoVE utilizes
client embeddings derived from model losses on client data, and leverages the
insight that clients in the same cluster share similar loss values, while those
in different clusters exhibit distinct loss patterns. Based on these
embeddings, CLoVE is able to iteratively identify and separate clients from
different clusters and optimize cluster-specific models through federated
aggregation. Key advantages of CLoVE over existing CFL algorithms are (1) its
simplicity, (2) its applicability to both supervised and unsupervised settings,
and (3) the fact that it eliminates the need for near-optimal model
initialization, which makes it more robust and better suited for real-world
applications. We establish theoretical convergence bounds, showing that CLoVE
can recover clusters accurately with high probability in a single round and
converges exponentially fast to optimal models in a linear setting. Our
comprehensive experiments comparing with a variety of both CFL and generic
Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) algorithms on different types of datasets
and an extensive array of non-IID settings demonstrate that CLoVE achieves
highly accurate cluster recovery in just a few rounds of training, along with
state-of-the-art model accuracy, across a variety of both supervised and
unsupervised PFL tasks.

Conclusion: 新方法显著提升采样速度并支持细节控制，为扩散模型应用提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in generating
high-fidelity images but typically suffer from inefficient sampling. Many
solver designs and noise scheduling strategies have been proposed to
dramatically improve sampling speeds. In this paper, we introduce a new
sampling method that is up to $186\%$ faster than the current state of the art
solver for comparative FID on ImageNet512. This new sampling method is
training-free and uses an ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver. The key
to our method resides in using higher-dimensional initial noise, allowing to
produce more detailed samples with less function evaluations from existing
pretrained diffusion models. In addition, by design our solver allows to
control the level of detail through a simple hyper-parameter at no extra
computational cost. We present how our approach leverages momentum dynamics by
establishing a fundamental equivalence between momentum diffusion models and
conventional diffusion models with respect to their training paradigms.
Moreover, we observe the use of higher-dimensional noise naturally exhibits
characteristics similar to stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Finally,
we demonstrate strong performances on a set of representative pretrained
diffusion models, including EDM, EDM2, and Stable-Diffusion 3, which cover
models in both pixel and latent spaces, as well as class and text conditional
settings. The code is available at https://github.com/apple/ml-tada.

Abstract: Laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) is a widely recognized additive manufacturing
technology for producing intricate metal components with exceptional accuracy.
A key challenge in L-PBF is the formation of complex microstructures affecting
product quality. We propose a physics-guided, machine-learning approach to
optimize scan paths for desired microstructure outcomes, such as equiaxed
grains. We utilized a phase-field method (PFM) to model crystalline grain
structure evolution. To reduce computational costs, we trained a surrogate
machine learning model, a 3D U-Net convolutional neural network, using
single-track phase-field simulations with various laser powers to predict
crystalline grain orientations based on initial microstructure and thermal
history. We investigated three scanning strategies across various hatch
spacings within a square domain, achieving a two-orders-of-magnitude speedup
using the surrogate model. To reduce trial and error in designing laser scan
toolpaths, we used deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to generate optimized scan
paths for target microstructure. Results from three cases demonstrate the DRL
approach's effectiveness. We integrated the surrogate 3D U-Net model into our
DRL environment to accelerate the reinforcement learning training process. The
reward function minimizes both aspect ratio and grain volume of the predicted
microstructure from the agent's scan path. The reinforcement learning algorithm
was benchmarked against conventional zigzag approach for smaller and larger
domains, showing machine learning methods' potential to enhance microstructure
control and computational efficiency in L-PBF optimization.

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) integrates quantum computing with classical
machine learning, primarily to solve classification, regression and generative
tasks. However, its rapid development raises critical security challenges in
the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. This chapter examines
adversarial threats unique to QML systems, focusing on vulnerabilities in
cloud-based deployments, hybrid architectures, and quantum generative models.
Key attack vectors include model stealing via transpilation or output
extraction, data poisoning through quantum-specific perturbations, reverse
engineering of proprietary variational quantum circuits, and backdoor attacks.
Adversaries exploit noise-prone quantum hardware and insufficiently secured
QML-as-a-Service (QMLaaS) workflows to compromise model integrity, ownership,
and functionality. Defense mechanisms leverage quantum properties to counter
these threats. Noise signatures from training hardware act as non-invasive
watermarks, while hardware-aware obfuscation techniques and ensemble strategies
disrupt cloning attempts. Emerging solutions also adapt classical adversarial
training and differential privacy to quantum settings, addressing
vulnerabilities in quantum neural networks and generative architectures.
However, securing QML requires addressing open challenges such as balancing
noise levels for reliability and security, mitigating cross-platform attacks,
and developing quantum-classical trust frameworks. This chapter summarizes
recent advances in attacks and defenses, offering a roadmap for researchers and
practitioners to build robust, trustworthy QML systems resilient to evolving
adversarial landscapes.

Conclusion: NESS为单细胞数据分析提供了更可靠和可解释的工具，适用于多种生物过程的研究。

Abstract: Single-cell sequencing is revolutionizing biology by enabling detailed
investigations of cell-state transitions. Many biological processes unfold
along continuous trajectories, yet it remains challenging to extract smooth,
low-dimensional representations from inherently noisy, high-dimensional
single-cell data. Neighbor embedding (NE) algorithms, such as t-SNE and UMAP,
are widely used to embed high-dimensional single-cell data into low dimensions.
But they often introduce undesirable distortions, resulting in misleading
interpretations. Existing evaluation methods for NE algorithms primarily focus
on separating discrete cell types rather than capturing continuous cell-state
transitions, while dynamic modeling approaches rely on strong assumptions about
cellular processes and specialized data. To address these challenges, we build
on the Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) framework for reliable and
reproducible data-driven discoveries. First, we systematically evaluate popular
NE algorithms through empirical analysis, simulation, and theory, and reveal
their key shortcomings, such as artifacts and instability. We then introduce
NESS, a principled and interpretable machine learning approach to improve NE
representations by leveraging algorithmic stability and to enable robust
inference of smooth biological structures. NESS offers useful concepts,
quantitative stability metrics, and efficient computational workflows to
uncover developmental trajectories and cell-state transitions in single-cell
data. Finally, we apply NESS to six single-cell datasets, spanning pluripotent
stem cell differentiation, organoid development, and multiple tissue-specific
lineage trajectories. Across these diverse contexts, NESS consistently yields
useful biological insights, such as identification of transitional and stable
cell states and quantification of transcriptional dynamics during development.

Abstract: The integration of the history and philosophy of statistics was initiated at
least by Hacking (1965) and advanced by Mayo (1996), but it has not received
sustained follow-up. Yet such integration is more urgent than ever, as the
recent success of artificial intelligence has been driven largely by machine
learning -- a field historically developed alongside statistics. Today, the
boundary between statistics and machine learning is increasingly blurred. What
we now need is integration, twice over: of history and philosophy, and of the
field they engage -- statistics and machine learning. I present a case study of
a philosophical idea in machine learning (and in formal epistemology) whose
root can be traced back to an often under-appreciated insight in Neyman and
Pearson's 1936 work (a follow-up to their 1933 classic). This leads to the
articulation of a foundational assumption -- largely implicit in, but shared
by, the practices of frequentist statistics and machine learning -- which I
call achievabilism. Another integration also emerges at the level of
methodology, combining two ends of the philosophy of science spectrum: history
and philosophy of science on the one hand, and formal epistemology on the other
hand.

Abstract: Authors Yi-Cheng Chen, Ping-En Lu, Cheng-Shang Chang, and Tzu-Hsuan Liu use
the Finite Impulse Response (FIR) linear system filtering method to track and
predict the number of people infected and recovered from COVID-19, in a
pandemic context in which there was still no vaccine and the only way to avoid
contagion was isolation. To estimate the coefficients of these FIR filters,
Chen et al. used machine learning methods through a classical optimization
problem with regularization (ridge regression). These estimated coefficients
are called ridge coefficients. The epidemic mathematical model adopted by these
researchers to formulate the FIR filters is the time-dependent discrete SIR. In
this paper, we propose a small modification to the algorithm of Chen et al. to
obtain the ridge coefficients. We then used this modified algorithm to track
and predict the number of people infected and recovered from COVID-19 in the
state of Minas Gerais/Brazil, within a prediction window, during the initial
period of the pandemic. We also compare the predicted data with the respective
real data to check how good the approximation is. In the modified algorithm, we
set values for the FIR filter orders and for the regularization parameters,
both different from the respective values defined by Chen et al. in their
algorithm. In this context, the numerical results obtained by the modified
algorithm in some simulations present better approximation errors compared to
the respective approximation errors presented by the algorithm of Chen et al.

Abstract: Storm surge forecasting plays a crucial role in coastal disaster
preparedness, yet existing machine learning approaches often suffer from
limited spatial resolution, reliance on coastal station data, and poor
generalization. Moreover, many prior models operate directly on unstructured
spatial data, making them incompatible with modern deep learning architectures.
In this work, we introduce a novel approach that projects unstructured water
elevation fields onto structured Red Green Blue (RGB)-encoded image
representations, enabling the application of Convolutional Long Short Term
Memory (ConvLSTM) networks for end-to-end spatiotemporal surge forecasting. Our
model further integrates ground-truth wind fields as dynamic conditioning
signals and topo-bathymetry as a static input, capturing physically meaningful
drivers of surge evolution. Evaluated on a large-scale dataset of synthetic
storms in the Gulf of Mexico, our method demonstrates robust 48-hour
forecasting performance across multiple regions along the Texas coast and
exhibits strong spatial extensibility to other coastal areas. By combining
structured representation, physically grounded forcings, and scalable deep
learning, this study advances the frontier of storm surge forecasting in
usability, adaptability, and interpretability.

Abstract: With the rapid development of the low-altitude economy, air-ground integrated
multi-access edge computing (MEC) systems are facing increasing demands for
real-time and intelligent task scheduling. In such systems, task offloading and
resource allocation encounter multiple challenges, including node
heterogeneity, unstable communication links, and dynamic task variations. To
address these issues, this paper constructs a three-layer heterogeneous MEC
system architecture for low-altitude economic networks, encompassing aerial and
ground users as well as edge servers. The system is systematically modeled from
the perspectives of communication channels, computational costs, and constraint
conditions, and the joint optimization problem of offloading decisions and
resource allocation is uniformly abstracted into a graph-structured modeling
task. On this basis, we propose a graph attention diffusion-based solution
generator (GADSG). This method integrates the contextual awareness of graph
attention networks with the solution distribution learning capability of
diffusion models, enabling joint modeling and optimization of discrete
offloading variables and continuous resource allocation variables within a
high-dimensional latent space. We construct multiple simulation datasets with
varying scales and topologies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed GADSG model significantly outperforms existing baseline methods in
terms of optimization performance, robustness, and generalization across task
structures, showing strong potential for efficient task scheduling in dynamic
and complex low-altitude economic network environments.

Abstract: The transport industry has recently shown significant interest in unmanned
surface vehicles (USVs), specifically for port and inland waterway transport.
These systems can improve operational efficiency and safety, which is
especially relevant in the European Union, where initiatives such as the Green
Deal are driving a shift towards increased use of inland waterways. At the same
time, a shortage of qualified personnel is accelerating the adoption of
autonomous solutions. However, there is a notable lack of open-source,
high-fidelity simulation frameworks and datasets for developing and evaluating
such solutions. To address these challenges, we introduce AirSim For Surface
Vehicles (ASVSim), an open-source simulation framework specifically designed
for autonomous shipping research in inland and port environments. The framework
combines simulated vessel dynamics with marine sensor simulation capabilities,
including radar and camera systems and supports the generation of synthetic
datasets for training computer vision models and reinforcement learning agents.
Built upon Cosys-AirSim, ASVSim provides a comprehensive platform for
developing autonomous navigation algorithms and generating synthetic datasets.
The simulator supports research of both traditional control methods and deep
learning-based approaches. Through limited experiments, we demonstrate the
potential of the simulator in these research areas. ASVSim is provided as an
open-source project under the MIT license, making autonomous navigation
research accessible to a larger part of the ocean engineering community.

Abstract: We show that recurrent quantum reservoir computers (QRCs) and their
recurrence-free architectures (RF-QRCs) are robust tools for learning and
forecasting chaotic dynamics from time-series data. First, we formulate and
interpret quantum reservoir computers as coupled dynamical systems, where the
reservoir acts as a response system driven by training data; in other words,
quantum reservoir computers are generalized-synchronization (GS) systems.
Second, we show that quantum reservoir computers can learn chaotic dynamics and
their invariant properties, such as Lyapunov spectra, attractor dimensions, and
geometric properties such as the covariant Lyapunov vectors. This analysis is
enabled by deriving the Jacobian of the quantum reservoir update. Third, by
leveraging tools from generalized synchronization, we provide a method for
designing robust quantum reservoir computers. We propose the criterion
$GS=ESP$: GS implies the echo state property (ESP), and vice versa. We
analytically show that RF-QRCs, by design, fulfill $GS=ESP$. Finally, we
analyze the effect of simulated noise. We find that dissipation from noise
enhances the robustness of quantum reservoir computers. Numerical verifications
on systems of different dimensions support our conclusions. This work opens
opportunities for designing robust quantum machines for chaotic time series
forecasting on near-term quantum hardware.

Abstract: Detecting heavy metal pollution in soils and seaports is vital for regional
environmental monitoring. The Pollution Load Index (PLI), an international
standard, is commonly used to assess heavy metal containment. However, the
conventional PLI assessment involves laborious procedures and data analysis of
sediment samples. To address this challenge, we propose a deep-learning-based
model that simplifies the heavy metal assessment process. Our model tackles the
issue of data scarcity in the water-sediment domain, which is traditionally
plagued by challenges in data collection and varying standards across nations.
By leveraging transfer learning, we develop an accurate quantitative assessment
method for predicting PLI. Our approach allows the transfer of learned features
across domains with different sets of features. We evaluate our model using
data from six major ports in New South Wales, Australia: Port Yamba, Port
Newcastle, Port Jackson, Port Botany, Port Kembla, and Port Eden. The results
demonstrate significantly lower Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute
Percentage Error (MAPE) of approximately 0.5 and 0.03, respectively, compared
to other models. Our model performance is up to 2 orders of magnitude than
other baseline models. Our proposed model offers an innovative, accessible, and
cost-effective approach to predicting water quality, benefiting marine life
conservation, aquaculture, and industrial pollution monitoring.

Abstract: Fetal sleep is a relatively underexplored yet vital aspect of prenatal
neurodevelopment. Understanding fetal sleep patterns could provide insights
into early brain maturation and help clinicians detect signs of neurological
compromise that arise due to fetal hypoxia or fetal growth restriction. This
review synthesizes over eight decades of research on the physiological
characteristics, ontogeny, and regulation of fetal sleep. We compare
sleep-state patterns in humans and large animal models, highlighting
species-specific differences and the presence of sleep-state analogs. We review
both invasive techniques in animals and non-invasive modalities in humans.
Computational methods for sleep-state classification are also examined,
including rule-based approaches (with and without clustering-based
preprocessing) and state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Finally, we
discuss how intrauterine conditions such as hypoxia and fetal growth
restriction can disrupt fetal sleep. This review provides a comprehensive
foundation for the development of objective, multimodal, and non-invasive fetal
sleep monitoring technologies to support early diagnosis and intervention in
prenatal care.

Abstract: Hitchhiking, a spontaneous and decentralized mode of travel, has long eluded
systematic study due to its informal nature. This paper presents and analyzes
the largest known structured dataset of hitchhiking rides, comprising over
63,000 entries collected over nearly two decades through platforms associated
with hitchwiki.org and lately on hitchmap.com. By leveraging crowd-sourced
contributions, the dataset captures key spatiotemporal and strategic aspects of
hitchhiking. This work documents the dataset's origins, evolution, and
community-driven maintenance, highlighting its Europe-centric distribution,
seasonal patterns, and reliance on a small number of highly active
contributors. Through exploratory analyses, I examine waiting times, user
behavior, and comment metadata, shedding light on the lived realities of
hitchhikers. While the dataset has inherent biases and limitations - such as
demographic skew and unverifiable entries it offers a rare and valuable window
into an alternative form of mobility. I conclude by outlining future directions
for enriching the dataset and advancing research on hitchhiking as both a
transportation practice and cultural phenomenon.
