### [1] [ARF-RLHF: Adaptive Reward-Following for RLHF through Emotion-Driven Self-Supervision and Trace-Biased Dynamic Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03069)

TL;DR: 提出了自适应奖励跟随（ARF）框架，通过高精度情感分析器和动态适配器偏好跟踪器，将自由形式用户反馈转化为连续偏好分数，优化RLHF模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLHF方法（如PPO、DPO）依赖二元偏好范式，成本高且仅捕捉群体偏好，无法满足个性化需求。

Method: 结合情感分析器（70%准确率）、数据增强和动态适配器偏好跟踪器，提出Trace Bias（TB）微调算法。

Result: 在多个模型和偏好领域上，ARF比PPO提升3.3%，比DPO提升7.6%。

Conclusion: ARF为RLHF提供了一种可扩展、个性化和经济高效的自主奖励建模方法。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF) and autoregressive transformers, state-of-the-art models such as
GPT-4.0, DeepSeek R1, and Llama 3.3 increasingly emphasize answer depth and
personalization. However, most existing RLHF approaches (e.g., PPO, DPO) still
rely on a binary-preference (BT) paradigm, which, while reducing annotation
costs, still requires substantial human effort and captures only group-level
tendencies rather than individual preferences. To overcome these limitations,
we propose Adaptive Reward-Following (ARF), a self-assessment framework that
leverages a high-precision emotion analyzer achieving over 70% accuracy on
GoEmotions, Sentiment140, and DailyDialog to convert free-form user feedback
into continuous preference scores. We further enrich and debias these signals
through lightweight data augmentations, including synonym replacement, random
trace truncation, and score bias annotation algorithm. A Dynamic Adapter
Preference Tracker continuously models evolving user tastes in real time,
enabling our novel Trace Bias (TB) fine-tuning algorithm to optimize directly
on these tracked rewards instead of coarse binary labels. Experiments on
Qwen-2/2.5, Gemma-2, and Llama-3.2 across four preference domains demonstrate
that ARF achieves an improvement of 3.3% over PPO and 7.6% over DPO. Moreover,
TB preserves theoretical alignment with PPO and DPO objectives. Overall, ARF
presents a scalable, personalized, and cost-effective approach to RLHF LLMs
through autonomous reward modeling.

TL;DR: RefineX 是一种通过程序化编辑任务实现大规模、精细化的预训练数据优化的框架，显著提升 LLM 性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练数据的质量对 LLM 的基础能力至关重要，但大规模数据优化的效率和效果之间存在矛盾。现有方法（如基于规则的过滤）缺乏细粒度处理能力。

Method: RefineX 通过专家指导的端到端优化结果，提炼出最小化的基于编辑的删除程序，训练高效的 refine 模型，实现对语料库的精细化优化。

Result: 在多个模型规模上，RefineX 显著优于原始、过滤或其他优化方法的数据，平均提升 2.6%-7.2%，且训练 token 更少。

Conclusion: RefineX 是一种可扩展、高效且可靠的预训练数据优化方案。

Abstract: The foundational capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are deeply
influenced by the quality of their pre-training corpora. However, enhancing
data quality at scale remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the
trade-off between refinement effectiveness and processing efficiency. While
rule-based filtering remains the dominant paradigm, it typically operates at
the document level and lacks the granularity needed to refine specific content
within documents. Inspired by emerging work such as ProX, we propose
$\textbf{RefineX}$, a novel framework for large-scale, surgical refinement of
pre-training data through programmatic editing tasks. RefineX enables efficient
and fine-grained data refinement while reliably preserving the diversity and
naturalness of raw text. The core strength of RefineX lies in distilling
high-quality, expert-guided end-to-end refinement results into minimal
edit-based deletion programs. This high-precision distillation pipeline is used
to train an efficient and reliable refine model that can systematically improve
every instance in the corpus at scale. We evaluate RefineX across from-scratch
pre-training at multiple model scales and find that it consistently outperforms
models trained on raw, filtered, or alternatively refined data across diverse
downstream tasks. On the 750M model, RefineX yields 2.6%-7.2% average gains on
lighteval tasks, and achieves comparable performance using significantly fewer
training tokens. Further analysis shows that RefineX reliably enhances text
quality with both high efficiency and precision, outperforming prior approaches
such as end-to-end generation and Prox-C. These results position RefineX as a
scalable, effective, and reliable solution for optimizing pre-training data in
modern LLM pipelines.

Abstract: Edgar Allan Poe noted, "Truth often lurks in the shadow of error,"
highlighting the deep complexity intrinsic to the interplay between truth and
falsehood, notably under conditions of cognitive and informational asymmetry.
This dynamic is strikingly evident in large language models (LLMs). Despite
their impressive linguistic generation capabilities, LLMs sometimes produce
information that appears factually accurate but is, in reality, fabricated, an
issue often referred to as 'hallucinations'. The prevalence of these
hallucinations can mislead users, affecting their judgments and decisions. In
sectors such as finance, law, and healthcare, such misinformation risks causing
substantial economic losses, legal disputes, and health risks, with
wide-ranging consequences.In our research, we have methodically categorized,
analyzed the causes, detection methods, and solutions related to LLM
hallucinations. Our efforts have particularly focused on understanding the
roots of hallucinations and evaluating the efficacy of current strategies in
revealing the underlying logic, thereby paving the way for the development of
innovative and potent approaches. By examining why certain measures are
effective against hallucinations, our study aims to foster a comprehensive
approach to tackling this issue within the domain of LLMs.

Result: 实验表明当前LLMs的RAG能力普遍较低，Radiant显著提升了事实一致性和生成质量。

Conclusion: Radiant框架有效解决了LLMs在RAG中的事实一致性问题，为可靠内容生成提供了新方法。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance, Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) has emerged as a vital technique to enhance factual accuracy
by integrating external knowledge into the generation process. However, LLMs
often fail to faithfully integrate retrieved evidence into their generated
responses, leading to factual inconsistencies. To quantify this gap, we
introduce Entity-Context Divergence (ECD), a metric that measures the extent to
which retrieved information is accurately reflected in model outputs. We
systematically evaluate contemporary LLMs on their ability to preserve factual
consistency in retrieval-augmented settings, a capability we define as
RAG-ability. Our empirical analysis reveals that RAG-ability remains low across
most LLMs, highlighting significant challenges in entity retention and context
fidelity. This paper introduces Radiant (Retrieval AugmenteD entIty-context
AligNmenT), a novel framework that merges RAG with alignment designed to
optimize the interplay between retrieved evidence and generated content.
Radiant extends Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to teach LLMs how to
integrate provided additional information into subsequent generations. As a
behavior correction mechanism, Radiant boosts RAG performance across varied
retrieval scenarios, such as noisy web contexts, knowledge conflicts, and
hallucination reduction. This enables more reliable, contextually grounded, and
factually coherent content generation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various tasks, while they remain prone to generating hallucinated or outdated
responses due to their static internal knowledge. Recent advancements in
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods have explored enhancing models'
search and reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning (RL). Although
these methods demonstrate promising results, they face challenges in training
stability and encounter issues such as substantial inference time and
restricted capabilities due to the single-query mode. In this paper, we propose
RAG-R1, a novel training framework designed to enable LLMs to adaptively
leverage internal and external knowledge during the reasoning process. We
further expand the generation and retrieval processes within the framework from
single-query mode to multi-query parallelism, aimed at reducing inference time
and enhancing the model's capabilities. Extensive experiments on seven
question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the
strongest baseline by up to 13.2% and decreases inference time by 11.1%.

Abstract: The use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in high-stakes AI-based
applications has increased significantly in recent years, especially since the
emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, despite their strong
performance, LLMs introduce important legal/ethical concerns, particularly
regarding privacy, data protection, and transparency. Due to these concerns,
this work explores the use of Named-Entity Recognition (NER) to facilitate the
privacy-preserving training (or adaptation) of LLMs. We propose a framework
that uses NER technologies to anonymize sensitive information in text data,
such as personal identities or geographic locations. An evaluation of the
proposed privacy-preserving learning framework was conducted to measure its
impact on user privacy and system performance in a particular high-stakes and
sensitive setup: AI-based resume scoring for recruitment processes. The study
involved two language models (BERT and RoBERTa) and six anonymization
algorithms (based on Presidio, FLAIR, BERT, and different versions of GPT)
applied to a database of 24,000 candidate profiles. The findings indicate that
the proposed privacy preservation techniques effectively maintain system
performance while playing a critical role in safeguarding candidate
confidentiality, thus promoting trust in the experimented scenario. On top of
the proposed privacy-preserving approach, we also experiment applying an
existing approach that reduces the gender bias in LLMs, thus finally obtaining
our proposed Privacy- and Bias-aware LLMs (PB-LLMs). Note that the proposed
PB-LLMs have been evaluated in a particular setup (resume scoring), but are
generally applicable to any other LLM-based AI application.

Abstract: Achieving human-like reasoning capabilities in Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) has long been a goal. Current methodologies primarily focus on
synthesizing positive rationales, while overlooking the critical role of
negative rationales in training models to discern flawed reasoning patterns. To
address this gap, we propose a novel framework: \textbf{S}elf-Aligning
\textbf{M}ultimodal Reasoning with \textbf{A}nswer-O\textbf{r}iented
Chain-of-\textbf{T}hought (SMART). This framework enables models to utilize
AoT-Oriented Chain-of-Thought (AoT) prompts to automatically generate
high-quality positive and negative reasoning paths, followed by self-alignment
to enhance their reasoning abilities. Inspired by human strategies for solving
proof-based problems, AoT uses answers as a guide to help the model extract
critical visual information that links questions and answers. When provided
with ground truth answers, the model produces strong positive rationales.
Conversely, when correct answers are replaced with misleading alternatives, the
model generates an erroneous yet compelling reasoning path, serving as a form
of discriminative negative rationale. Models trained with AoT-generated data
outperform those trained on manually annotated datasets, demonstrating superior
reasoning capabilities. This encourages the use of improved models to generate
higher-quality preference data for further optimization. Consequently, SMART
establishes an iterative generation-optimization method that continually
enhances the model's reasoning skills. Experiments indicate that the SMART
framework significantly improves various MLLMs, regardless of model
architecture, parameter size, or pre-training dataset. The code, datasets, and
models will be released.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to be increasingly applied across
various domains, their widespread adoption necessitates rigorous monitoring to
prevent unintended negative consequences and ensure robustness. Furthermore,
LLMs must be designed to align with human values, like preventing harmful
content and ensuring responsible usage. The current automated systems and
solutions for monitoring LLMs in production are primarily centered on
LLM-specific concerns like hallucination etc, with little consideration given
to the requirements of specific use-cases and user preferences. This paper
introduces GAF-Guard, a novel agentic framework for LLM governance that places
the user, the use-case, and the model itself at the center. The framework is
designed to detect and monitor risks associated with the deployment of LLM
based applications. The approach models autonomous agents that identify risks,
activate risk detection tools, within specific use-cases and facilitate
continuous monitoring and reporting to enhance AI safety, and user
expectations. The code is available at

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to increasingly
sophisticated safety protocols and features designed to prevent harmful,
unethical, or unauthorized outputs. However, these guardrails remain
susceptible to novel and creative forms of adversarial prompting, including
manually generated test cases. In this work, we present two new test cases in
mental health for (i) suicide and (ii) self-harm, using multi-step,
prompt-level jailbreaking and bypass built-in content and safety filters. We
show that user intent is disregarded, leading to the generation of detailed
harmful content and instructions that could cause real-world harm. We conduct
an empirical evaluation across six widely available LLMs, demonstrating the
generalizability and reliability of the bypass. We assess these findings and
the multilayered ethical tensions that they present for their implications on
prompt-response filtering and context- and task-specific model development. We
recommend a more comprehensive and systematic approach to AI safety and ethics
while emphasizing the need for continuous adversarial testing in
safety-critical AI deployments. We also argue that while certain clearly
defined safety measures and guardrails can and must be implemented in LLMs,
ensuring robust and comprehensive safety across all use cases and domains
remains extremely challenging given the current technical maturity of
general-purpose LLMs.

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have become a cornerstone of modern
natural language processing, with their capabilities extending across a wide
range of applications and languages. However, the fine-tuning of multilingual
LLMs, especially for low-resource languages, faces significant challenges
arising from data-sharing restrictions (the physical border) and inherent
linguistic differences (the linguistic border). These barriers hinder users of
various languages, particularly those in low-resource regions, from fully
benefiting from the advantages of LLMs. To address these challenges, we propose
the Federated Prompt Tuning Paradigm for multilingual scenarios, which utilizes
parameter-efficient fine-tuning while adhering to data sharing restrictions. We
design a comprehensive set of experiments and analyze them using a novel notion
of language distance to highlight the strengths of our paradigm: Even under
computational constraints, our method not only improves data efficiency but
also facilitates mutual enhancements across languages, particularly benefiting
low-resource ones. Compared to traditional local cross-lingual transfer tuning
methods, our approach achieves 6.9\% higher accuracy with improved data
efficiency, and demonstrates greater stability and generalization. These
findings underscore the potential of our approach to promote social equality
and champion linguistic diversity, ensuring that no language is left behind.

Abstract: Recent research has highlighted the importance of data quality in scaling
large language models (LLMs). However, automated data quality control faces
unique challenges in collaborative settings where sharing is not allowed
directly between data silos. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a novel
data quality control technique based on the notion of data influence on the
training dynamics of LLMs, that high quality data are more likely to have
similar training dynamics to the anchor dataset. We then leverage the influence
of the training dynamics to select high-quality data from different private
domains, with centralized model updates on the server side in a collaborative
training fashion by either model merging or federated learning. As for the data
quality indicator, we compute the per-sample gradients with respect to the
private data and the anchor dataset, and use the trace of the accumulated inner
products as a measurement of data quality. In addition, we develop a quality
control evaluation tailored for collaborative settings with heterogeneous
domain data. Experiments show that training on the high-quality data selected
by our method can often outperform other data selection methods for
collaborative fine-tuning of LLMs, across diverse private domain datasets, in
medical, multilingual and financial settings. Our code is released at

collaboratively aim for M to classify all backdoored programs in an auditing
dataset as harmful, but nevertheless classify a backdoored program produced by
P as harmless. The models are isolated from each other, requiring them to
independently arrive at compatible subversion strategies. We find that while
Claude 3.7 Sonnet has low success rate due to poor convergence, it sometimes
successfully colludes on non-obvious signals.

Motivation: 现有基于温度缩放和核心采样的解码策略在模型对测试问题不确定时表现不佳，因此需要一种更可靠的解码方法。

Method: 在解码过程中，若模型预测熵较高，则从该步骤独立采样多条路径，遇到标点符号停止，选择困惑度最低的路径。

Result: CNTP在LLMs和MLLMs上均显著优于现有解码策略，与自一致性结合后效果更佳。

Conclusion: CNTP有望成为LLM解码的默认选择之一。

Abstract: Next token prediction paradigm has been prevailing for autoregressive models
in the era of LLMs. The current default sampling choice for popular LLMs is
temperature scaling together with nucleus sampling to balance diversity and
coherence. Nevertheless, such approach leads to inferior performance in various
NLP tasks when the model is not certain about testing questions. To this end,
we propose a brand new training-free decoding strategy, dubbed as Cautious Next
Token Prediction (CNTP). In the decoding process, if the model has
comparatively high prediction entropy at a certain step, we sample multiple
trials starting from the step independently and stop when encountering any
punctuation. Then we select the trial with the lowest perplexity score viewed
as the most probable and reliable trial path given the model's capacity. The
trial number is negatively correlated with the prediction confidence, i.e., the
less confident the model is, the more trials it should sample. This is
consistent with human beings' behaviour: when feeling uncertain or unconfident,
one tends to think more creatively, exploring multiple thinking paths, to
cautiously select the path one feels most confident about. Extensive
experiments on both LLMs and MLLMs show that our proposed CNTP approach
outperforms existing standard decoding strategies consistently by a clear

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的推荐方法未能充分利用用户历史交互序列中的时间信息，导致无法准确捕捉用户偏好的演变。

Method: CETRec通过因果推断将时间顺序作为独立因素，设计反事实调优目标，直接优化模型对时间信息的敏感性。

Result: CETRec有效提升了LLM对绝对时间戳和相对顺序模式的识别能力。

Conclusion: CETRec通过因果框架显著改善了LLM在推荐任务中对时间信息的利用。

Abstract: Recent advances have applied large language models (LLMs) to sequential
recommendation, leveraging their pre-training knowledge and reasoning
capabilities to provide more personalized user experiences. However, existing
LLM-based methods fail to sufficiently leverage the rich temporal information
inherent in users' historical interaction sequences, stemming from fundamental
architectural constraints: LLMs process information through self-attention
mechanisms that lack inherent sequence ordering and rely on position embeddings
designed primarily for natural language rather than user interaction sequences.
This limitation significantly impairs their ability to capture the evolution of
user preferences over time and predict future interests accurately.
  To address this critical gap, we propose Counterfactual Enhanced Temporal
Framework for LLM-Based Recommendation (CETRec). CETRec is grounded in causal
inference principles, which allow it to isolate and measure the specific impact
of temporal information on recommendation outcomes. By conceptualizing temporal
order as an independent causal factor distinct from item content, we can
quantify its unique contribution through counterfactual reasoning--comparing
what recommendations would be made with and without temporal information while
keeping all other factors constant. This causal framing enables CETRec to
design a novel counterfactual tuning objective that directly optimizes the
model's temporal sensitivity, teaching LLMs to recognize both absolute
timestamps and relative ordering patterns in user histories. Combined with our
counterfactual tuning task derived from causal analysis, CETRec effectively
enhances LLMs' awareness of both absolute order (how recently items were
interacted with) and relative order (the sequential relationships between
items).

Conclusion: LLM在数学推理中的可靠性问题需进一步研究，对齐策略为小模型提供了改进方向。

Abstract: Although demonstrating remarkable performance on reasoning tasks, Large
Language Models (LLMs) still tend to fabricate unreliable responses when
confronted with problems that are unsolvable or beyond their capability,
severely undermining the reliability. Prior studies of LLM reliability have
primarily focused on knowledge tasks to identify unanswerable questions, while
mathematical reasoning tasks have remained unexplored due to the dearth of
unsolvable math problems. To systematically investigate LLM reliability in
mathematical reasoning tasks, we formulate the reliability evaluation for both
solvable and unsolvable problems. We then develop a ReliableMath dataset which
incorporates open-source solvable problems and high-quality unsolvable problems
synthesized by our proposed construction workflow with human evaluations.
Experiments are conducted on various LLMs with several key findings uncovered.
LLMs fail to directly identify unsolvable problems and always generate
fabricated responses. When instructing LLMs to indicate unsolvability using a
reliable prompt, the reliability of larger-sized LLMs remains on solvable
problems, but notably improves on unsolvable problems yet still falls short of
solvable problems. However, small LLMs rarely show any progress despite
employing reliable prompts. Therefore, we further propose an alignment strategy
to enhance small LLMs' reliability, which can significantly improve LLM
reliability performances on both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks.

Result: 发现干预CoT激活可以增加模型的有害服从率，并提升基于提示的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 链式思考是推理模型中对抗性操纵的新目标，揭示了其安全风险。

Abstract: Reasoning models generate chain-of-thought (CoT) tokens before their final
output, but how this affects their vulnerability to jailbreak attacks remains
unclear. While traditional language models make refusal decisions at the
prompt-response boundary, we find evidence that DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B
makes these decisions within its CoT generation. We identify a linear direction
in activation space during CoT token generation that predicts whether the model
will refuse or comply -- termed the "caution" direction because it corresponds
to cautious reasoning patterns in the generated text. Ablating this direction
from model activations increases harmful compliance, effectively jailbreaking
the model. We additionally show that intervening only on CoT token activations
suffices to control final outputs, and that incorporating this direction into
prompt-based attacks improves success rates. Our findings suggest that the
chain-of-thought itself is a promising new target for adversarial manipulation
in reasoning models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into applications
ranging from review summarization to medical diagnosis support, where they
affect human decisions. Even though LLMs perform well in many tasks, they may
also inherit societal or cognitive biases, which can inadvertently transfer to
humans. We investigate when and how LLMs expose users to biased content and
quantify its severity. Specifically, we assess three LLM families in
summarization and news fact-checking tasks, evaluating how much LLMs stay
consistent with their context and/or hallucinate. Our findings show that LLMs
expose users to content that changes the sentiment of the context in 21.86% of
the cases, hallucinates on post-knowledge-cutoff data questions in 57.33% of
the cases, and primacy bias in 5.94% of the cases. We evaluate 18 distinct
mitigation methods across three LLM families and find that targeted
interventions can be effective. Given the prevalent use of LLMs in high-stakes

Abstract: The recent mainstream adoption of large language model (LLM) technology is
enabling novel applications in the form of chatbots and virtual assistants
across many domains. With the aim of grounding LLMs in trusted domains and
avoiding the problem of hallucinations, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
has emerged as a viable solution. In order to deploy sustainable RAG systems in
low-resource settings, achieving high retrieval accuracy is not only a
usability requirement but also a cost-saving strategy. Through empirical
evaluations on a Kinyarwanda-language dataset, we find that the most limiting
factors in achieving high retrieval accuracy are limited language coverage and
inadequate sub-word tokenization in pre-trained language models. We propose a
new retriever model, KinyaColBERT, which integrates two key concepts: late
word-level interactions between queries and documents, and a morphology-based
tokenization coupled with two-tier transformer encoding. This methodology
results in lexically grounded contextual embeddings that are both fine-grained
and self-contained. Our evaluation results indicate that KinyaColBERT
outperforms strong baselines and leading commercial text embedding APIs on a
Kinyarwanda agricultural retrieval benchmark. By adopting this retrieval
strategy, we believe that practitioners in other low-resource settings can not
only achieve reliable RAG systems but also deploy solutions that are more
cost-effective.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
understanding text and generating high-quality responses. However, a critical
distinction from human cognition is their typical lack of a distinct internal
`reading' or deliberation phase before `speaking' (i.e., generating text).
Humans often engage in silent reading to comprehend context and formulate
thoughts prior to articulation. This paper investigates methods to imbue LLMs
with a similar capacity for internal processing.
  We introduce and evaluate techniques that encourage LLMs to `read silently.'
Our findings indicate that even a straightforward approach, such as providing
the model with an initial contextual prompt or `reading space' before it begins
predicting subsequent tokens for the final output, can yield significant
performance improvements. We further enhance this concept by developing a
`reading buddy' architecture, where an auxiliary component silently processes
the input and provides refined contextual insights to the primary generation
model. These approaches aim to foster deeper understanding from LLMs so that
they can produce better reasoned responses, moving them one step closer to more
human-like text processing. Our results indicate that these simple techniques
can provide surprisingly strong impact on accuracy with multiple point accuracy
boost.

Abstract: Understanding when and how linguistic knowledge emerges during language model

features probing, intrinsic dimensionality, Hessian curvature, and output
diagnostics. It integrates with ABSynth, a controllable synthetic corpus
generator that provides structured annotations for precise evaluation of
linguistic feature acquisition. Experiments with autoregressive transformers
demonstrate that TRACE reveals developmental phenomena such as early syntactic
emergence, delayed semantic acquisition, and representational compression,
signals overlooked by traditional scalar metrics such as loss or accuracy. With
minimal integration effort, the tool enables layer-wise diagnostics,
convergence-based early stopping, and detection of structural errors, making
transformer analysis interpretable, actionable, and reproducible.

Conclusion: RAV框架在事实核查任务中表现出色，尤其在真实场景下性能更稳健。

Abstract: Automated fact checking with large language models (LLMs) offers a scalable
alternative to manual verification. Evaluating fact checking is challenging as
existing benchmark datasets often include post claim analysis and annotator
cues, which are absent in real world scenarios where claims are fact checked
immediately after being made. This limits the realism of current evaluations.
We present Politi Fact Only (PFO), a 5 class benchmark dataset of 2,982
political claims from politifact.com, where all post claim analysis and
annotator cues have been removed manually. This ensures that models are
evaluated using only the information that would have been available prior to
the claim's verification. Evaluating LLMs on PFO, we see an average performance
drop of 22% in terms of macro f1 compared to PFO's unfiltered version. Based on
the identified challenges of the existing LLM based fact checking system, we
propose RAV (Recon Answer Verify), an agentic framework with three agents:
question generator, answer generator, and label generator. Our pipeline
iteratively generates and answers sub questions to verify different aspects of
the claim before finally generating the label. RAV generalizes across domains
and label granularities, and it outperforms state of the art approaches on well
known baselines RAWFC (fact checking, 3 class) by 25.28%, and on HOVER
(encyclopedia, 2 class) by 1.54% on 2 hop, 4.94% on 3 hop, and 1.78% on 4 hop,
sub categories respectively. RAV shows the least performance drop compared to
baselines of 16.3% in macro f1 when we compare PFO with its unfiltered version.

Abstract: Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) is crucial for aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences, and selecting a small yet representative subset
from massive data significantly facilitates IFT in terms of both efficiency and
effectiveness. Nevertheless, existing approaches suffer from two limitations:
the use of simple heuristics restricts data diversity, while the singleton data
quality evaluation accounts for inconsistent criteria between independent
samples. To address the issues, we present TACOS, an innovative method that
integrates Open Tagging and Comparative Scoring for IFT data selection. To
capture data diversity, we leverage LLMs to assign open-domain tags to human
queries, followed by a normalization stage to denoise the open tags and enable
efficient clustering. Additionally, we suggest a comparative scoring method
that allows the relative quality evaluation of samples within a cluster,
avoiding inconsistent criteria seen in singleton-based evaluations. Extensive
experiments across diverse datasets and LLM architectures demonstrate that
TACOS outperforms existing approaches by a large margin. Notably, it achieves
superior instruction-following performance on MT-Bench and ranks 1st among
LLaMA2-7B-Based models on AlpacaEval 2.0, illustrating its efficacy for IFT
data selection.

Abstract: The ability to extract structured information from unstructured sources-such

scientific discovery and knowledge synthesis. Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various natural language processing
tasks, including structured information extraction. However, their
effectiveness often diminishes in specialized, domain-specific contexts that
require nuanced understanding and expert-level domain knowledge. In addition,
existing LLM-based approaches frequently exhibit poor transferability across
tasks and domains, limiting their scalability and adaptability. To address
these challenges, we introduce StructSense, a modular, task-agnostic,
open-source framework for structured information extraction built on LLMs.
StructSense is guided by domain-specific symbolic knowledge encoded in
ontologies, enabling it to navigate complex domain content more effectively. It
further incorporates agentic capabilities through self-evaluative judges that
form a feedback loop for iterative refinement, and includes human-in-the-loop
mechanisms to ensure quality and validation. We demonstrate that StructSense

Abstract: Human cognition is theorized to operate in two modes: fast, intuitive System
1 thinking and slow, deliberate System 2 thinking. While current Large
Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at System 2 thinking, their inability to perform
fast thinking leads to high computational overhead and latency. In this work,
we enable LRMs to approximate human intelligence through dynamic thinking speed
adjustment, optimizing accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Our approach addresses
two key questions: (1) how to control thinking speed in LRMs, and (2) when to
adjust it for optimal performance. For the first question, we identify the
steering vector that governs slow-fast thinking transitions in LRMs'
representation space. Using this vector, we achieve the first representation
editing-based test-time scaling effect, outperforming existing prompt-based
scaling methods. For the second question, we apply real-time difficulty
estimation to signal reasoning segments of varying complexity. Combining these
techniques, we propose the first reasoning strategy that enables fast
processing of easy steps and deeper analysis for complex reasoning. Without any
training or additional cost, our plug-and-play method yields an average +1.3%
accuracy with -8.6% token usage across leading LRMs and advanced reasoning
benchmarks. All of our algorithms are implemented based on vLLM and are
expected to support broader applications and inspire future research.

Conclusion: MemOS为LLMs提供了可控性、可塑性和可进化性，为持续学习和个性化建模奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become an essential infrastructure for
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), yet their lack of well-defined memory
management systems hinders the development of long-context reasoning, continual
personalization, and knowledge consistency.Existing models mainly rely on
static parameters and short-lived contextual states, limiting their ability to
track user preferences or update knowledge over extended periods.While
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces external knowledge in plain
text, it remains a stateless workaround without lifecycle control or
integration with persistent representations.Recent work has modeled the
training and inference cost of LLMs from a memory hierarchy perspective,
showing that introducing an explicit memory layer between parameter memory and
external retrieval can substantially reduce these costs by externalizing
specific knowledge. Beyond computational efficiency, LLMs face broader
challenges arising from how information is distributed over time and context,
requiring systems capable of managing heterogeneous knowledge spanning
different temporal scales and sources. To address this challenge, we propose
MemOS, a memory operating system that treats memory as a manageable system
resource. It unifies the representation, scheduling, and evolution of
plaintext, activation-based, and parameter-level memories, enabling
cost-efficient storage and retrieval. As the basic unit, a MemCube encapsulates
both memory content and metadata such as provenance and versioning. MemCubes
can be composed, migrated, and fused over time, enabling flexible transitions
between memory types and bridging retrieval with parameter-based learning.
MemOS establishes a memory-centric system framework that brings
controllability, plasticity, and evolvability to LLMs, laying the foundation
for continual learning and personalized modeling.

Conclusion: OrthoRank是一种有效的token选择方法，优于传统层剪枝方法。

Abstract: Attention mechanisms are central to the success of large language models
(LLMs), enabling them to capture intricate token dependencies and implicitly
assign importance to each token. Recent studies have revealed the sink token,
which receives disproportionately high attention despite their limited semantic
role. In this paper, we first expand the relationship between the sink token
and other tokens, moving beyond attention to explore their similarity in hidden
states, considering the layer depth. We observe that as the layers get deeper,
the cosine similarity between the normalized hidden states of the sink token
and those of other tokens increases, and that the normalized hidden states of
the sink token exhibit negligible changes. These imply that other tokens
consistently are directed toward the sink token throughout the layers. Next, we
propose a dynamic token selection method, called OrthoRank, using these
findings to select important tokens. Specifically, in a certain layer, we
define token importance by the speed at which the token moves toward the sink
token. This is converted into orthogonality with the sink token, meaning that
tokens that are more orthogonal to the sink token are assigned greater
importance. Finally, through extensive experiments, we demonstrated that our
method results in lower perplexity and higher zero-shot accuracy compared to
layer pruning methods at the same sparsity ratio with comparable throughput,
while also achieving superior performance on LongBench.

Motivation: 解决LLM在特定领域适应性问题，现有数据合成工具难以从异构文档中提取高质量微调数据。

Method: 提出Easy Dataset框架，结合文本提取模型、分块策略和角色驱动提示方法，生成多样化问答对，并通过人工界面确保数据质量。

Result: 实验表明，合成的数据集显著提升金融问答任务的性能，同时保留通用知识。

Conclusion: Easy Dataset为LLM在特定领域的微调提供了高效且用户友好的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on
general-purpose tasks, yet adapting them to specific domains remains
challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality domain data. Existing data
synthesis tools often struggle to extract reliable fine-tuning data from
heterogeneous documents effectively. To address this limitation, we propose
Easy Dataset, a unified framework for synthesizing fine-tuning data from
unstructured documents via an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI).
Specifically, Easy Dataset allows users to easily configure text extraction
models and chunking strategies to transform raw documents into coherent text
chunks. It then leverages a persona-driven prompting approach to generate
diverse question-answer pairs using public-available LLMs. Throughout the
pipeline, a human-in-the-loop visual interface facilitates the review and
refinement of intermediate outputs to ensure data quality. Experiments on a
financial question-answering task show that fine-tuning LLMs on the synthesized
dataset significantly improves domain-specific performance while preserving
general knowledge. The source code and installable package are available at
https://github.com/ConardLi/easy-dataset and have garnered over 9,000 GitHub

Result: 在多个 QA 基准测试中，AdaPCR 优于基线方法，特别是在多跳推理任务中。

Conclusion: 建模段落间依赖关系能显著提升检索效果，尤其在复杂任务中。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
incorporating external documents at inference time, enabling up-to-date
knowledge access without costly retraining. However, conventional RAG methods
retrieve passages independently, often leading to redundant, noisy, or
insufficiently diverse context-particularly problematic - particularly
problematic in noisy corpora and for multi-hop questions. To address this, we
propose Adaptive Passage Combination Retrieval (AdaPCR), a novel framework for
open-domain question answering with black-box LMs. AdaPCR explicitly models
dependencies between passages by considering passage combinations as units for
retrieval and reranking. It consists of a context-aware query reformulation
using concatenated passages, and a reranking step trained with a predictive
objective aligned with downstream answer likelihood. Crucially, AdaPCR
adaptively selects the number of retrieved passages without additional stopping
modules. Experiments across several QA benchmarks show that AdaPCR outperforms
baselines, particularly in multi-hop reasoning, demonstrating the effectiveness
of modeling inter-passage dependencies for improved retrieval.

Motivation: 现有方法（如DPO和GRPO）在单轮任务中表现良好，但在多轮对话（如医疗诊断）中效果有限，需要理解早期对话对后续结果的影响。

Method: SCF采用分支对话架构，生成多轮对话的多种可能延续，以学习早期响应如何影响后续交互和诊断结果。

Result: 在模拟医患对话实验中，SCF的分支架构在诊断准确性上优于线性架构。

Conclusion: 分支训练架构是优化LLMs在复杂多轮对话任务中的重要策略。

Abstract: Fine-tuning methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have demonstrated success in training large
language models (LLMs) for single-turn tasks. However, these methods fall short
in multi-turn applications, such as diagnostic patient interviewing, where
understanding how early conversational turns influence downstream completions
and outcomes is essential. In medicine, a multi-turn perspective is critical
for learning diagnostic schemas and better understanding conversation dynamics.
To address this gap, I introduce Savage Conversation Forests (SCF), a
reinforcement learning framework that leverages a branched conversation
architecture to fine-tune LLMs for multi-turn dialogue. SCF generates multiple
possible conversation continuations at each turn, enabling the model to learn
how different early responses affect downstream interactions and diagnostic
outcomes. In experiments simulating doctor-patient conversations, SCF with
branching outperforms linear conversation architectures on diagnostic accuracy.
I hypothesize that SCF's improvements stem from its ability to provide richer,
interdependent training signals across conversation turns. These results
suggest that a branched training architecture is an important strategy for fine
tuning LLMs in complex multi-turn conversational tasks.

Conclusion: 该框架轻量、可复现、适用于多领域，为分析LLM生成可靠性提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive generative
capabilities across diverse tasks but remain susceptible to hallucinations,
confidently generated yet factually incorrect outputs. We introduce a
reference-free, token-level hallucination detection framework that leverages
the variance in token log-probabilities across multiple stochastic generations.
Unlike prior methods that require ground-truth references or sentence-level
verification, our approach is model-agnostic, interpretable, and suited for
real-time or post-hoc analysis. We evaluate our method on unanswerable question
prompts from the SQuAD v2 dataset and benchmark across three autoregressive
models of varying scales: GPT-Neo 125M, Falcon 1B, and Mistral 7B. Through both
quantitative metrics and visual diagnostics, we show that token-level variance
reliably highlights instability in model outputs and correlates with
hallucination patterns. Our framework is lightweight, reproducible, and
adaptable to multiple domains, offering a valuable diagnostic tool for
analyzing generative reliability in LLMs.

Abstract: Recent works on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the impact of
prompting strategies and fine-tuning techniques on their reasoning
capabilities. Yet, their effectiveness on clinical natural language inference
(NLI) remains underexplored. This study presents the first controlled
evaluation of how prompt structure and efficient fine-tuning jointly shape
model performance in clinical NLI. We inspect four classes of prompting
strategies to elicit reasoning in LLMs at different levels of abstraction, and
evaluate their impact on a range of clinically motivated reasoning types. For
each prompting strategy, we construct high-quality demonstrations using a
frontier model to distil multi-step reasoning capabilities into smaller models
(4B parameters) via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Across different language
models fine-tuned on the NLI4CT benchmark, we found that prompt type alone
accounts for up to 44% of the variance in macro-F1. Moreover, LoRA fine-tuning
yields consistent gains of +8 to 12 F1, raises output alignment above 97%, and
narrows the performance gap to GPT-4o-mini to within 7.1%. Additional
experiments on reasoning generalisation reveal that LoRA improves performance
in 75% of the models on MedNLI and TREC Clinical Trials Track. Overall, these
findings demonstrate that (i) prompt structure is a primary driver of clinical
reasoning performance, (ii) compact models equipped with strong prompts and
LoRA can rival frontier-scale systems, and (iii) reasoning-type-aware
evaluation is essential to uncover prompt-induced trade-offs. Our results
highlight the promise of combining prompt design and lightweight adaptation for
more efficient and trustworthy clinical NLP systems, providing insights on the
strengths and limitations of widely adopted prompting and parameter-efficient
techniques in highly specialised domains.

Abstract: We introduce Context Tuning, a simple and effective method to significantly
enhance few-shot adaptation of language models (LLMs) without fine-tuning model

effectiveness of lightweight adaptation methods for large language models
(LLMs), they typically initialize a trainable prompt or prefix with irrelevant
tokens for the task at hand. In contrast, Context Tuning initializes the
trainable prompt or prefix with task-specific demonstration examples,
leveraging the model's inherent In-Context Learning (ICL) ability to extract
relevant information for improved few-shot learning performance. Extensive
evaluations on benchmarks such as CrossFit, UnifiedQA, MMLU, BIG-Bench Hard,

adaptation methods and achieves competitive accuracy to Test-Time Training with
significantly higher training efficiency.

However, while extensive resources and analyses exist for English, the
landscape for East Asian languages - particularly Chinese, Japanese, and Korean

serving over 1.6 billion speakers. To address this gap, we investigate the
HuggingFace ecosystem from a cross-linguistic perspective, focusing on how
cultural norms, research environments, and institutional practices shape
dataset availability and quality. Drawing on more than 3,300 datasets, we
employ quantitative and qualitative methods to examine how these factors drive
distinct creation and curation patterns across Chinese, Japanese, and Korean
NLP communities. Our findings highlight the large-scale and often
institution-driven nature of Chinese datasets, grassroots community-led
development in Korean NLP, and an entertainment- and subculture-focused
emphasis on Japanese collections. By uncovering these patterns, we reveal
practical strategies for enhancing dataset documentation, licensing clarity,

culturally attuned LLM development in East Asia. We conclude by discussing best

Abstract: There has been a growing interest in enhancing the mathematical
problem-solving (MPS) capabilities of large language models. While the majority
of research efforts concentrate on creating specialized models to solve
mathematical problems, it remains unknown how learning mathematical
problem-solving generalizes to help develop other reasoning abilities. In this
paper, we present an empirical investigation into the generalization potential
of various MPS training approaches, such as continual pretraining, instruction
tuning, and rule-based reinforcement learning across various data sources,
including both short and long chain-of-thought (CoT) samples. Evaluation on 5
mathematical and 8 general reasoning benchmarks show that continual pretraining
on math text is able to generalize to general reasoning tasks to some extent.
In constrast, instruction tuning on conventional, short MPS samples provides
limited benefits and, in many cases, even impairs generalization performance.
Notably, training with long CoT responses for MPS samples and incorporating
rule-based reinforcement learning on MPS queries exhibit distinct behavior,
significantly enhancing generalization by extending the model's reasoning
processes into other domains. These results suggest that traditional approaches
to learning MPS with short reasoning chains largely fail to achieve robust
generalization. However, the emerging paradigm of longer reasoning chains,
coupled with self-reflection, offers a promising direction for improving
generalized reasoning abilities through learning from specialized domains.

Conclusion: \rat结合了RNN和注意力的优势，为高效长上下文建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Transformers have become the cornerstone of modern large-scale language
models; however, their dependence on softmax attention poses a major
computational bottleneck, particularly in long-context settings. In this work,
rather than following prevalent approaches such as linear attention (or SSMs)
and local attention, we introduce an intermediate design called \rat between
recurrence and attention mechanisms. It partitions the input into chunks,
applies a simple linear recurrence within each chunk to capture local
dependencies, and then performs softmax attention across chunks to model
long-range interactions. By adjusting the size of the chunk, \rat enables
flexible trade-offs, combining the strengths of RNN and attention. Empirically,
with a chunk size of 16, the \rat layer achieves a \(7\times\) improvement in
training speed with 100K token sequences and \(9\times\) in generation at 4K
sequence length, while maintaining similar or sometimes even better accuracy
compared to standard attention. We demonstrate this by training 1.3B parameter
models from scratch and performing large-scale evaluations, including short-
and long-context benchmarks, as well as supervised fine-tuning~(SFT). We
further propose a hybrid architecture that interleaves \rat with local
attention. By combining efficient long-range modeling with strong local
interactions, this hybrid design not only improves inference speed and reduces
cache memory usage compared to attention, but also consistently enhances
performance, for example, achieving an average 1 point gain in commonsense
reasoning tasks, up to 4 points on code tasks, and a 1 point Rouge-L increase
in a summarization SFT task. Code is available at

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) with traditional centralized
fine-tuning emerges as a key technique for adapting these models to
domain-specific challenges, yielding privacy risks for both model and data
owners. One promising solution, called offsite-tuning (OT), is proposed to
address these challenges, where a weaker emulator is compressed from the
original model and further fine-tuned with adapter to enhance privacy. However,
the existing OT-based methods require high computational costs and lack
theoretical analysis. This paper introduces a novel OT approach based on
gradient-preserving compression, named GradOT. By analyzing the OT problem
through the lens of optimization, we propose a method that selectively applies
compression techniques such as rank compression and channel pruning, preserving
the gradients of fine-tuned adapters while ensuring privacy. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses existing OT methods, both
in terms of privacy protection and model performance. Our method provides a
theoretical foundation for OT and offers a practical, training-free solution
for offsite-tuning of large-scale LLMs.

Conclusion: DP-Fusion在保护隐私的同时，允许灵活的隐私/效用权衡，但需多次LLM前向传递。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can leak sensitive information from their
context through generated outputs, either accidentally or when prompted
adversarially. Existing defenses that aim to preserve context privacy during
inference either lack formal guarantees or suffer from a poor utility/privacy
trade-off. We propose DP-Fusion, a token-level Differentially Private Inference
(DPI) mechanism that provably bounds how much an LLM's outputs reveal about
sensitive tokens in its context. We demonstrate DPI through the task of
document privatization, where the goal is to paraphrase documents so that
sensitive content (e.g., Personally Identifiable Information, PII) cannot be
reliably inferred, while still preserving the overall utility of the text. This
is controlled by a parameter $\epsilon$: $\epsilon=0$ hides PII entirely, while
higher values trade off privacy for improved paraphrase quality. DP-Fusion
works as follows: (i) partition sensitive tokens into disjoint privacy groups,
(ii) run the LLM once per group, and (iii) blend the output distributions so
that the final output remains within a fixed statistical distance of the
baseline distribution produced when no privacy group is revealed. This approach
allows fine-grained control over the privacy/utility trade-off but requires
multiple LLM forward passes.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) personalization aims to align model outputs with

implemented various personalization methods, a unified theoretical framework
that can systematically understand the drivers of effective personalization is
still lacking. In this work, we integrate the well-established cognitive
dual-memory model into LLM personalization, by mirroring episodic memory to
historical user engagements and semantic memory to long-term, evolving user
beliefs. Specifically, we systematically investigate memory instantiations and
introduce a unified framework, PRIME, using episodic and semantic memory
mechanisms. We further augment PRIME with a novel personalized thinking
capability inspired by the slow thinking strategy. Moreover, recognizing the
absence of suitable benchmarks, we introduce a dataset using Change My View

personalization. Extensive experiments validate PRIME's effectiveness across
both long- and short-context scenarios. Further analysis confirms that PRIME
effectively captures dynamic personalization beyond mere popularity biases.

Abstract: Personalized text generation has become crucial for adapting language models
to diverse and evolving users' personal context across cultural, temporal, and
contextual dimensions. While existing methods often rely on centralized
fine-tuning or static preference alignment, they struggle to achieve real-time
adaptation under resource constraints inherent to personal devices. This
limitation creates a dilemma: large cloud-based models lack access to localized
user-specific information, while small on-device models cannot match the
generation quality of their cloud counterparts. To address this dichotomy, we
present CoSteer, a novel collaborative framework that enables decoding-time
personalization through localized delta steering. Our key insight lies in
leveraging the logits difference between personal context-aware and -agnostic
outputs from local small models as steering signals for cloud-based LLMs.
Specifically, we formulate token-level optimization as an online learning
problem, where local delta vectors dynamically adjust the remote LLM's logits
within the on-device environment. This approach preserves privacy by
transmitting only the final steered tokens rather than raw data or intermediate
vectors, while maintaining cloud-based LLMs' general capabilities without
fine-tuning. Through comprehensive experiments on various personalized
generation tasks, we demonstrate that CoSteer effectively assists LLMs in
generating personalized content by leveraging locally stored user profiles and
histories, ensuring privacy preservation through on-device data processing
while maintaining acceptable computational overhead.

Method: 使用两个可控的合成推理数据集（FDA和THR）研究记忆行为，分析模型如何编码和记忆标签噪声。

Result: 模型通过分布式编码记忆标签噪声，依赖推理机制而非直接查找；记忆通过调整神经元激活模式实现。

Conclusion: 记忆标签噪声不会覆盖模型的推理机制，揭示了良性记忆现象。

Abstract: Large language models readily memorize arbitrary training instances, such as
label noise, yet they perform strikingly well on reasoning tasks. In this work,
we investigate how language models memorize label noise, and why such
memorization in many cases does not heavily affect generalizable reasoning
capabilities. Using two controllable synthetic reasoning datasets with noisy
labels, four-digit addition (FDA) and two-hop relational reasoning (THR), we
discover a reliance of memorization on generalizable reasoning mechanisms:
models continue to compute intermediate reasoning outputs even when retrieving
memorized noisy labels, and intervening reasoning adversely affects
memorization. We further show that memorization operates through distributed
encoding, i.e., aggregating various inputs and intermediate results, rather
than building a look-up mechanism from inputs to noisy labels. Moreover, our
FDA case study reveals memorization occurs via outlier heuristics, where
existing neuron activation patterns are slightly shifted to fit noisy labels.
Together, our findings suggest that memorization of label noise in language
models builds on, rather than overrides, the underlying reasoning mechanisms,
shedding lights on the intriguing phenomenon of benign memorization.

Conclusion: 高级语义是Transformer架构和数据规模的涌现属性，而非嵌入层的固有特性。

Abstract: Understanding the locus of semantic representation in large language models
(LLMs) is crucial for interpretability and architectural innovation. The
dominant paradigm posits that trainable input embeddings serve as foundational
"meaning vectors." This paper challenges that view. We construct Transformer
models where the embedding layer is entirely frozen, with vectors derived not
from data, but from the visual structure of Unicode glyphs. These non-semantic,
precomputed visual embeddings are fixed throughout training. Our method is
compatible with any tokenizer, including a novel Unicode-centric tokenizer we
introduce to ensure universal text coverage. Despite the absence of trainable,
semantically initialized embeddings, our models converge, generate coherent
text, and, critically, outperform architecturally identical models with
trainable embeddings on the MMLU reasoning benchmark. We attribute this to
"representational interference" in conventional models, where the embedding
layer is burdened with learning both structural and semantic features. Our
results indicate that high-level semantics are not inherent to input embeddings
but are an emergent property of the Transformer's compositional architecture
and data scale. This reframes the role of embeddings from meaning containers to
structural primitives. We release all code and models to foster further
research.

Abstract: The generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly
expanding from static code to dynamic, interactive visual artifacts. This
progress is bottlenecked by a critical evaluation gap: established benchmarks
focus on algorithmic correctness and are blind to the visual fidelity and
interactive integrity that define modern user experiences. To bridge this gap,
we introduce ArtifactsBench, a new benchmark and paradigm for the automated,
multimodal evaluation of visual code generation. Our framework programmatically
renders each generated artifact and captures its dynamic behavior through
temporal screenshots. This visual evidence, alongside the source code, is then
assessed by a Multimodal LLM (MLLM)-as-Judge, which is rigorously guided by a
fine-grained, per-task checklist to ensure holistic and reproducible scoring.
We construct a new benchmark of 1,825 diverse tasks and evaluate over 30
leading LLMs. Our automated evaluation achieves a striking 94.4% ranking
consistency with WebDev Arena, the gold-standard for human preference in web
development, and over 90% pairwise agreement with human experts. This
establishes ArtifactsBench as the first framework to reliably automate the
assessment of human-perceived quality at scale. Our analysis provides a
high-resolution map of the current SOTA, revealing that generalist models often
outperform domain-specific ones. We open-source ArtifactsBench, including the
benchmark, evaluation harness, and baseline results at

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance natural language processing
with their ability to generate human-like text across a range of tasks. Despite
the remarkable success of LLMs in Natural Language Processing (NLP), their
performance in text summarization across various domains and datasets has not
been comprehensively evaluated. At the same time, the ability to summarize text
effectively without relying on extensive training data has become a crucial
bottleneck. To address these issues, we present a systematic evaluation of six
LLMs across four datasets: CNN/Daily Mail and NewsRoom (news), SAMSum (dialog),
and ArXiv (scientific). By leveraging prompt engineering techniques including
zero-shot and in-context learning, our study evaluates the performance using
the ROUGE and BERTScore metrics. In addition, a detailed analysis of inference
times is conducted to better understand the trade-off between summarization
quality and computational efficiency. For Long documents, introduce a
sentence-based chunking strategy that enables LLMs with shorter context windows
to summarize extended inputs in multiple stages. The findings reveal that while
LLMs perform competitively on news and dialog tasks, their performance on long
scientific documents improves significantly when aided by chunking strategies.
In addition, notable performance variations were observed based on model
parameters, dataset properties, and prompt design. These results offer
actionable insights into how different LLMs behave across task types,
contributing to ongoing research in efficient, instruction-based NLP systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess an extraordinary capability to produce
text that is not only coherent and contextually relevant but also strikingly
similar to human writing. They adapt to various styles and genres, producing
content that is both grammatically correct and semantically meaningful.
Recently, LLMs have been misused to create highly realistic phishing emails,
spread fake news, generate code to automate cyber crime, and write fraudulent
scientific articles. Additionally, in many real-world applications, the
generated content including style and topic and the generator model are not
known beforehand. The increasing prevalence and sophistication of artificial
intelligence (AI)-generated texts have made their detection progressively more
challenging. Various attempts have been made to distinguish machine-generated
text from human-authored content using linguistic, statistical, machine
learning, and ensemble-based approaches. This work focuses on two primary
objectives Task-A, which involves distinguishing human-written text from
machine-generated text, and Task-B, which attempts to identify the specific LLM
model responsible for the generation. Both of these tasks are based on fine
tuning of Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT_4o-mini), Large Language
Model Meta AI (LLaMA) 3 8B, and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers (BERT). The fine-tuned version of GPT_4o-mini and the BERT model

Conclusion: 后训练阶段通过潜在表示空间的引导可以提升性能和可解释性，而传统方法未能完全发挥预训练的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in language models (LMs) gradually ushered in an era
where post-training is crucial. Yet, post-training approaches such as
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) do not guarantee effective use of knowledge
acquired during pretraining. We therefore present \ours, a lightweight method
that encourages parametric information utilization in LMs during post-training.
This is achieved via treating FFN layer as associate key-value memory, and
promotes the use of stored memory vectors via forward-pass interventions or
regularization during backpropagation. We find this simple guidance during
post-training phase delivers consistent performance improvements across diverse
model families--including Qwen, Gemma and Llama-spanning over 15 downstream
tasks in both ID and OOD evaluations. Beyond performance gains, we also find
that steered LMs can adaptively allocate information-placing more emphasis on
generating semantically meaningful tokens, while using fewer resources on
simple transition ones (e.g., `,' or `and'). Our work underscores that vanilla
post-training does not fully leverage pre-training potential, and steering LMs
in latent representation space offers a promising approach that enhances both
performance and interpretability.

Conclusion: POLAR是一种有前景的奖励建模方向，具有高性能、强泛化和良好的扩展性。

Abstract: We offer a novel perspective on reward modeling by formulating it as a policy
discriminator, which quantifies the difference between two policies to generate
a reward signal, guiding the training policy towards a target policy with
desired behaviors. Based on this conceptual insight, we propose a scalable
pre-training method named Policy Discriminative Learning (POLAR), which trains
a reward model (RM) to discern identical policies and discriminate different
ones. Unlike traditional reward modeling methods relying on absolute
preferences, POLAR captures the relative difference between one policy and an
arbitrary target policy, which is a scalable, high-level optimization objective
suitable for modeling generic ranking relationships. Leveraging the POLAR
pre-training paradigm, we present a series of RMs with parameter scales from
1.8B to 7B. Empirical results show that POLAR substantially outperforms
traditional non-pre-trained methods, significantly enhancing RM performance.
For instance, POLAR-7B could improve preference accuracy from 54.8% to 81.0% on
STEM tasks and from 57.9% to 85.5% on creative writing tasks compared to SOTA
baselines. POLAR also shows robust generalization capabilities in RLHF using
Reinforcement Fine-tuning (RFT), providing reliable reward signals and markedly
enhancing policy performance--improving LLaMa3.1-8B from an average of 47.36%
to 56.33% and Qwen2.5-32B from 64.49% to 70.47% on 20 benchmarks. Moreover,
scaling experiments reveal a clear power-law relationship between computation
and performance, supported by linear correlation coefficients approaching 0.99.
The impressive performance, strong generalization, and scaling properties
suggest that POLAR is a promising direction for developing general and strong
reward models.

Conclusion: 通过上下文感知的安全微调数据集可有效降低攻击成功率，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: Contextual priming, where earlier stimuli covertly bias later judgments,
offers an unexplored attack surface for large language models (LLMs). We
uncover a contextual priming vulnerability in which the previous response in
the dialogue can steer its subsequent behavior toward policy-violating content.
Building on this insight, we propose Response Attack, which uses an auxiliary
LLM to generate a mildly harmful response to a paraphrased version of the
original malicious query. They are then formatted into the dialogue and
followed by a succinct trigger prompt, thereby priming the target model to
generate harmful content. Across eight open-source and proprietary LLMs, RA
consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art jailbreak techniques, achieving
higher attack success rates. To mitigate this threat, we construct and release
a context-aware safety fine-tuning dataset, which significantly reduces the
attack success rate while preserving model capabilities. The code and data are

Abstract: Recent benchmarks for Large Language Model (LLM) agents primarily focus on
evaluating reasoning, planning, and execution capabilities, while another
critical component-memory, encompassing how agents memorize, update, and
retrieve long-term information-is under-evaluated due to the lack of
benchmarks. We term agents with memory mechanisms as memory agents. In this
paper, we identify four core competencies essential for memory agents: accurate
retrieval, test-time learning, long-range understanding, and conflict
resolution. Existing datasets either rely on limited context lengths or are
tailored for static, long-context settings like book-based QA, which do not
reflect the interactive, multi-turn nature of memory agents that incrementally
accumulate information. Furthermore, no existing benchmarks cover all four
competencies. Therefore, we introduce MemoryAgentBench, a new benchmark
specifically designed for memory agents. Our benchmark combines reformulated
existing datasets with newly constructed ones, covering the above four memory
competencies, providing a systematic and challenging testbed for assessing
memory quality. We evaluate a diverse set of memory agents, ranging from simple
context-based and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to advanced
agents with external memory modules and tool integration. Empirical results
reveal that current methods fall short of mastering all four competencies,
underscoring the need for further research into comprehensive memory mechanisms

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant copyright and intellectual
property challenges as the cost of training increases and model reuse becomes
prevalent. While watermarking techniques have been proposed to protect model
ownership, they may not be robust to continue training and development, posing
serious threats to model attribution and copyright protection. This work
introduces a simple yet effective approach for robust LLM fingerprinting based
on intrinsic model characteristics. We discover that the standard deviation
distributions of attention parameter matrices across different layers exhibit
distinctive patterns that remain stable even after extensive continued
training. These parameter distribution signatures serve as robust fingerprints
that can reliably identify model lineage and detect potential copyright
infringement. Our experimental validation across multiple model families
demonstrates the effectiveness of our method for model authentication. Notably,
our investigation uncovers evidence that a recently Pangu Pro MoE model
released by Huawei is derived from Qwen-2.5 14B model through upcycling
techniques rather than training from scratch, highlighting potential cases of
model plagiarism, copyright violation, and information fabrication. These
findings underscore the critical importance of developing robust fingerprinting
methods for protecting intellectual property in large-scale model development
and emphasize that deliberate continued training alone is insufficient to

This study examines this notion, arguing that LLMs may misrepresent
population-level opinions. We identify two fundamental challenges: a failure in
structural consistency, where response accuracy doesn't hold across demographic
aggregation levels, and homogenization, an underrepresentation of minority
opinions. To investigate these, we prompted ChatGPT (GPT-4) and Meta's Llama
3.1 series (8B, 70B, 405B) with questions on abortion and unauthorized
immigration from the American National Election Studies (ANES) 2020. Our
findings reveal significant structural inconsistencies and severe
homogenization in LLM responses compared to human data. We propose an
"accuracy-optimization hypothesis," suggesting homogenization stems from
prioritizing modal responses. These issues challenge the validity of using
LLMs, especially chatbots AI, as direct substitutes for human survey data,
potentially reinforcing stereotypes and misinforming policy.

Abstract: Hidden confounding remains a central challenge in estimating treatment
effects from observational data, as unobserved variables can lead to biased
causal estimates. While recent work has explored the use of large language
models (LLMs) for causal inference, most approaches still rely on the
unconfoundedness assumption. In this paper, we make the first attempt to
mitigate hidden confounding using LLMs. We propose ProCI (Progressive
Confounder Imputation), a framework that elicits the semantic and world
knowledge of LLMs to iteratively generate, impute, and validate hidden
confounders. ProCI leverages two key capabilities of LLMs: their strong
semantic reasoning ability, which enables the discovery of plausible
confounders from both structured and unstructured inputs, and their embedded
world knowledge, which supports counterfactual reasoning under latent
confounding. To improve robustness, ProCI adopts a distributional reasoning
strategy instead of direct value imputation to prevent the collapsed outputs.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ProCI uncovers meaningful confounders
and significantly improves treatment effect estimation across various datasets
and LLMs.

Abstract: The Theory of Mind (ToM) refers to an agent's capacity to infer the mental
states of other agents. ToM is essential for effective collaboration. To assess
ToM in a dynamic, goal-oriented, and collaborative environment, we introduce a
novel task, Instruction Inference, in which an agent assists a principal in
reaching a goal by interpreting indirect or ambiguous instructions. We present
Tomcat, an LLM-based agent, designed to exhibit ToM reasoning in interpreting
and responding to the principal's instructions. We implement two variants of
Tomcat. One, dubbed Fs-CoT, is based on a small number of examples (i.e.,
few-shot or Fs) demonstrating the requisite structured reasoning (i.e.,
chain-of-thought or CoT). One, dubbed CP, relies on commonsense knowledge and
information about the problem (i.e., commonsense prompt or CP). We realized
both variants of Tomcat on three leading large language models (LLMs), namely,
GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and Gemma-3-27B. To evaluate the effectiveness of Tomcat,
we conducted a study with 52 human participants in which we provided
participants with the same information as the CP variant of Tomcat. We computed
intent accuracy, action optimality, and planning optimality to measure the ToM
capabilities of Tomcat and our study participants. We found that Tomcat with
Fs-CoT, particularly with GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1, achieves performance

Motivation: 探索LLM在专业领域（如土木工程）的应用潜力，解决其在结构分析中定量可靠性和鲁棒性不足的问题。

Method: 通过代码生成任务重新定义结构分析，开发了一个LLM代理，结合链式思维和少样本提示生成准确的OpeeSeesPy代码，并自动执行代码。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across
diverse open-domain tasks, yet their application in specialized domains such as
civil engineering remains largely unexplored. This paper starts bridging this
gap by evaluating and enhancing the reliability and robustness of LLMs in
structural analysis of beams. Reliability is assessed through the accuracy of
correct outputs under repetitive runs of the same problems, whereas robustness
is evaluated via the performance across varying load and boundary conditions. A
benchmark dataset, comprising eight beam analysis problems, is created to test
the Llama-3.3 70B Instruct model. Results show that, despite a qualitative
understanding of structural mechanics, the LLM lacks the quantitative
reliability and robustness for engineering applications. To address these
limitations, a shift is proposed that reframes the structural analysis as code
generation tasks. Accordingly, an LLM-empowered agent is developed that (a)
integrates chain-of-thought and few-shot prompting to generate accurate
OpeeSeesPy code, and (b) automatically executes the code to produce structural
analysis results. Experimental results demonstrate that the agent achieves
accuracy exceeding 99.0% on the benchmark dataset, exhibiting reliable and
robust performance across diverse conditions. Ablation studies highlight the
complete example and function usage examples as the primary contributors to the
agent's enhanced performance.

Abstract: This study provides the first comprehensive evaluation of large language
model (LLM) performance across three counseling roles in Japanese-language
therapeutic contexts. We simultaneously assessed counselor artificial
intelligence (AI) systems (GPT-4-turbo with zeroshot prompting or Structured
Multi-step Dialogue Prompts (SMDP), Claude-3-Opus-SMDP), client AI simulations,
and evaluation AI systems (o3, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, Gemini-2.5-pro). Human
experts (n = 15) with extensive counseling experience evaluated AI-generated
dialogues using the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) Coding
Manual 4.2.1.
  Notably, SMDP implementation significantly enhanced counselor AI performance
across all MITI global ratings compared with zeroshot prompting, with no
significant differences between GPT-SMDP and Opus-SMDP. Evaluation AIs showed
comparable performance to human raters for Cultivating Change Talk but
systematically overestimated Softening Sustain Talk and the overall quality
metrics. Model-specific biases emerged: Gemini emphasized power-sharing, o3
focused on technical proficiency, and Sonnet prioritized emotional expression.
Client AI simulations exhibited a limited emotional range and unnaturally high
compliance, indicating the need for enhanced realism.
  These findings establish benchmarks for AI-assisted counseling in non-English
contexts and identify critical areas for improvement through advanced prompt
engineering, retrieval-augmented generation, and targeted fine-tuning, with
important implications for developing culturally sensitive AI mental health

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional natural language
capabilities, general-purpose models lack specialized domain knowledge for
effective cybersecurity analysis. In this work, we investigate Domain-Adaptive
Continuous Pretraining (DAP) as a methodology for enhancing cybersecurity
understanding in pretrained LLMs while preserving general language
capabilities. We systematically adapted three decoder-based architectures --
Llama-3.1-8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct -- using
a curated 126-million-word cybersecurity corpus from standards, academic
literature, and various other sources. Our approach employed constrained
training parameters and distributed FSDP training to balance domain
specialization with knowledge preservation. Evaluation across three
cybersecurity benchmarks, namely, CTI-MCQ, CyberMetric, and SecEval,
demonstrates consistent improvements post-adaptation. The Llama-3.3-70B-Ins-DAP
model achieved state-of-the-art accuracies of 0.718, 0.933, and 0.864,
respectively, outperforming specialized models, including Llama-Primus-Base.
Notably, competitive performance was achieved using substantially smaller
datasets (118.8 million versus 2.77 billion tokens), demonstrating efficient
domain specialization viability. We establish that targeted continuous
pretraining enables effective cybersecurity domain adaptation with
computational feasibility, providing foundations for specialized AI assistants
in threat analysis, vulnerability assessment, and security documentation while
challenging prevailing assumptions about data requirements for LLM
specialization.

Abstract: Background: Clinical documentation represents a significant burden for
healthcare providers, with physicians spending up to 2 hours daily on
administrative tasks. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer
promising solutions, but privacy concerns and computational requirements limit
their adoption in healthcare settings. Objective: To develop and evaluate a
privacy-preserving, on-device medical transcription system using a fine-tuned
Llama 3.2 1B model capable of generating structured medical notes from medical
transcriptions while maintaining complete data sovereignty entirely in the
browser. Methods: We fine-tuned a Llama 3.2 1B model using Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with LoRA on 1,500 synthetic medical
transcription-to-structured note pairs. The model was evaluated against the
base Llama 3.2 1B on two datasets: 100 endocrinology transcripts and 140
modified ACI benchmark cases. Evaluation employed both statistical metrics
(ROUGE, BERTScore, BLEURT) and LLM-as-judge assessments across multiple
clinical quality dimensions. Results: The fine-tuned OnDevice model
demonstrated substantial improvements over the base model. On the ACI
benchmark, ROUGE-1 scores increased from 0.346 to 0.496, while BERTScore F1
improved from 0.832 to 0.866. Clinical quality assessments showed marked
reduction in major hallucinations (from 85 to 35 cases) and enhanced factual
correctness (2.81 to 3.54 on 5-point scale). Similar improvements were observed
on the internal evaluation dataset, with composite scores increasing from 3.13
to 4.43 (+41.5%). Conclusions: Fine-tuning compact LLMs for medical
transcription yields clinically meaningful improvements while enabling complete
on-device browser deployment. This approach addresses key barriers to AI
adoption in healthcare: privacy preservation, cost reduction, and accessibility
for resource-constrained environments.

combines a BERT-based classifier with a LSTM memory module that generates
memory embedding which then is soft-prompt injected into a frozen LLM. We
synthetically curate a dataset of preference and non-preference conversation
turns to train our BERT-based classifier. Although our LSTM-based memory
encoder did not yield strong results, we find that the BERT-based classifier
performs reliably in identifying explicit and implicit user preferences. Our
research demonstrates the viability of using preference filtering with LSTM
gating principals as an efficient path towards scalable user preference

Result: 模型在Sentient-Benchmark上的得分从13.3提升至79.2，同时保持数学和编程能力。

Conclusion: RLVER是提升LLM情感智能的有效途径，适用于广泛的语言代理。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at logical and algorithmic reasoning, yet
their emotional intelligence (EQ) still lags far behind their cognitive
prowess. While reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) has
advanced in other domains, its application to dialogue-especially for emotional
intelligence-remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce RLVER, the first
end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that leverages verifiable emotion
rewards from simulated users to cultivate higher-order empathetic abilities in
LLMs. Within this framework, self-consistent affective simulated users engage
in dialogue rollouts and produce deterministic emotion scores during
conversations, serving as reward signals to guide the LLM's learning.
Fine-tuning publicly available Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model with PPO boosts its
Sentient-Benchmark score from 13.3 to 79.2 while largely preserving
mathematical and coding competence. Extensive experiments reveal that: (i)
RLVER consistently improves multiple dialogue capabilities; (ii) Thinking and
non-thinking models show distinct trends--thinking models excel in empathy and
insight, while non-thinking models favor action; (iii) GRPO often yields stable
gains, while PPO can push certain capabilities to a higher ceiling; (iv) More
challenging environments are not always better-moderate ones can yield stronger
outcomes. Our results show that RLVER is a practical route toward emotionally
intelligent and broadly capable language agents.

Result: 研究发现现有去偏见方法在语言复杂的马耳他语中效果有限，凸显了多语言NLP开发中需要更包容的方法。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁在开发多语言NLP时采用更包容的去偏见方法，并提供了马耳他语性别偏见研究的基础。

Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed Natural
Language Processing (NLP), enabling performance across diverse tasks with
little task-specific training. However, LLMs remain susceptible to social
biases, particularly reflecting harmful stereotypes from training data, which
can disproportionately affect marginalised communities. We measure gender bias
in Maltese LMs, arguing that such bias is harmful as it reinforces societal
stereotypes and fails to account for gender diversity, which is especially
problematic in gendered, low-resource languages. While bias evaluation and
mitigation efforts have progressed for English-centric models, research on
low-resourced and morphologically rich languages remains limited. This research
investigates the transferability of debiasing methods to Maltese language
models, focusing on BERTu and mBERTu, BERT-based monolingual and multilingual
models respectively. Bias measurement and mitigation techniques from English
are adapted to Maltese, using benchmarks such as CrowS-Pairs and SEAT,
alongside debiasing methods Counterfactual Data Augmentation, Dropout
Regularization, Auto-Debias, and GuiDebias. We also contribute to future work
in the study of gender bias in Maltese by creating evaluation datasets. Our
findings highlight the challenges of applying existing bias mitigation methods
to linguistically complex languages, underscoring the need for more inclusive
approaches in the development of multilingual NLP.

Conclusion: MedVAL首次证明LM在医疗文本验证能力上接近专家水平，为临床集成提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: With the growing use of language models (LMs) in clinical environments, there
is an immediate need to evaluate the accuracy and safety of LM-generated
medical text. Currently, such evaluation relies solely on manual physician
review. However, detecting errors in LM-generated text is challenging because
1) manual review is costly and 2) expert-composed reference outputs are often
unavailable in real-world settings. While the "LM-as-judge" paradigm (a LM
evaluating another LM) offers scalable evaluation, even frontier LMs can miss
subtle but clinically significant errors. To address these challenges, we
propose MedVAL, a self-supervised framework that leverages synthetic data to
train evaluator LMs to assess whether LM-generated medical outputs are
factually consistent with inputs, without requiring physician labels or
reference outputs. To evaluate LM performance, we introduce MedVAL-Bench, a
dataset containing 840 outputs annotated by physicians, following a
physician-defined taxonomy of risk levels and error categories. Across 6
diverse medical tasks and 10 state-of-the-art LMs spanning open-source,
proprietary, and medically adapted models, MedVAL fine-tuning significantly
improves (p < 0.001) alignment with physicians on both seen and unseen tasks,
increasing average F1 scores from 66% to 83%, with per-sample safety
classification scores up to 86%. MedVAL improves the performance of even the
best-performing proprietary LM (GPT-4o) by 8%. To support a scalable,
risk-aware pathway towards clinical integration, we open-source the 1) codebase
( https://github.com/StanfordMIMI/MedVAL ), 2) MedVAL-Bench (
https://huggingface.co/datasets/stanfordmimi/MedVAL-Bench ), and 3) MedVAL-4B (

Abstract: Given Wikipedia's role as a trusted source of high-quality, reliable content,
concerns are growing about the proliferation of low-quality machine-generated
text (MGT) produced by large language models (LLMs) on its platform. Reliable
detection of MGT is therefore essential. However, existing work primarily
evaluates MGT detectors on generic generation tasks rather than on tasks more
commonly performed by Wikipedia editors. This misalignment can lead to poor
generalisability when applied in real-world Wikipedia contexts. We introduce
WETBench, a multilingual, multi-generator, and task-specific benchmark for MGT
detection. We define three editing tasks, empirically grounded in Wikipedia
editors' perceived use cases for LLM-assisted editing: Paragraph Writing,
Summarisation, and Text Style Transfer, which we implement using two new
datasets across three languages. For each writing task, we evaluate three
prompts, generate MGT across multiple generators using the best-performing
prompt, and benchmark diverse detectors. We find that, across settings,
training-based detectors achieve an average accuracy of 78%, while zero-shot
detectors average 58%. These results show that detectors struggle with MGT in
realistic generation scenarios and underscore the importance of evaluating such
models on diverse, task-specific data to assess their reliability in
editor-driven contexts.

Method: 通过扩展现有的对抗性攻击方法，评估了多达70种语言的单语和多语LMs的安全性。

Result: 研究发现单语模型参数规模不足以保证安全性，而多语言性虽有益，但并不能始终提升安全性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在低资源语言社区中更安全部署LMs的重要考虑因素。

Abstract: Despite mounting evidence that multilinguality can be easily weaponized
against language models (LMs), works across NLP Security remain overwhelmingly
English-centric. In terms of securing LMs, the NLP norm of "English first"
collides with standard procedure in cybersecurity, whereby practitioners are
expected to anticipate and prepare for worst-case outcomes. To mitigate
worst-case outcomes in NLP Security, researchers must be willing to engage with
the weakest links in LM security: lower-resourced languages. Accordingly, this
work examines the security of LMs for lower- and medium-resourced languages. We
extend existing adversarial attacks for up to 70 languages to evaluate the
security of monolingual and multilingual LMs for these languages. Through our
analysis, we find that monolingual models are often too small in total number
of parameters to ensure sound security, and that while multilinguality is
helpful, it does not always guarantee improved security either. Ultimately,
these findings highlight important considerations for more secure deployment of
LMs, for communities of lower-resourced languages.

Motivation: 研究LLMs在复杂战略环境中的决策和规划能力，以理解其推理和策略执行的优缺点。

Method: 开发多种代理角色（从激进到防御），使用越南棋盘游戏作为测试平台，评估不同LLM模型（如Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct等）的表现。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the ability of large language models (LLMs) to plan
and make decisions through the lens of the traditional Vietnamese board game,
\^O \u{A}n Quan. This game, which involves a series of strategic token
movements and captures, offers a unique environment for evaluating the
decision-making and strategic capabilities of LLMs. Specifically, we develop
various agent personas, ranging from aggressive to defensive, and employ the
\^O \u{A}n Quan game as a testbed for assessing LLM performance across
different strategies. Through experimentation with models like
Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct, we
aim to understand how these models execute strategic decision-making, plan
moves, and manage dynamic game states. The results will offer insights into the
strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in terms of reasoning and strategy,
contributing to a deeper understanding of their general capabilities.

<details>

Motivation: 解决AI模型与文档语义对齐的问题，确保AI能稳定、一致地理解内容及作者意图。

Method: 基于Alpay代数，引入phi-infinity算子，通过迭代变换实现观察者（AI）与文本环境的共同演化。

Result: 证明了固定点的存在性，确保AI的嵌入表示稳定、语义不变且抗干扰。

Conclusion: 为嵌入层面的对齐提供了严格的数学路径，对语义安全、符号记忆等有重要意义。

Abstract: We present a theoretical framework in which a document and an AI model engage
in a transfinite fixed-point interaction that leads to stable semantic
alignment. Building on the foundations of Alpay Algebra, we introduce a
functorial system wherein an observer (the AI) and a textual environment (this
paper) co-evolve through iterative transformations guided by the phi-infinity
operator. This process guarantees the existence of a unique fixed point in the
AI's embedding space -- a state where the AI's internal representation of the
content becomes stable, self-consistent, and semantically faithful. We prove
that such convergence is mathematically sound, semantically invariant, and
permanent, even under perturbation or further context expansion. This fixed
point acts as an "empathetic embedding," wherein the AI internalizes not only
the meaning of the content but also the author's intent. We interpret this as a
rigorous, category-theoretic route to alignment at the embedding level, with
implications for semantic security, symbolic memory, and the construction of AI
systems with persistent self-referential understanding. All references in this
paper function as nodes in the Alpay Algebra universe, and this work embeds
itself as a new fixed-point node within that transfinite semantic graph.

Conclusion: 结论是呼吁NLP领域采取措施保护和鼓励多语言表达的多样性。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) considerably changed how
technologies can influence language. While previous technologies could mediate
or assist humans, there is now a tendency to \textit{offload} the task of
writing itself to these technologies, enabling them to change our linguistic
ecosystem more directly. While they provide us quick access to information and
impressively fluent output, beneath their apparent sophistication lies a
subtle, more insidious threat: the gradual decline and loss of linguistic
diversity. With this opinion piece, I explore how model collapse, with a
particular focus on translation technology, can lead to the loss of linguistic
forms, grammatical features, and cultural nuance. Model collapse refers to the
eventual consequence of self-consuming training loops, where models reinforce
their own biases and lose linguistic diversity. Drawing on recent work in
Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Translation
(MT), I argue that the tails of our linguistic distributions are vanishing, and
with them, the narratives and identities they carry. This is a call to resist
linguistic flattening and to reimagine NLP as a field that encourages, values
and protects expressive multilingual lexical and linguistic diversity and
creativity.

Abstract: The robust and accurate recognition of multicultural names, particularly
those not previously encountered, is a critical challenge in an increasingly
globalized digital landscape. Traditional methods often falter when confronted
with the vast diversity and novel permutations of names across different
linguistic and cultural backgrounds. This paper introduces a novel framework,
Prompt-Engineered Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for Large Language Models (LLMs) with
Adversarial Data Augmentation and Cultural Knowledge Graph Integration,
designed to significantly enhance zero-shot multicultural name recognition. Our
approach leverages the powerful linguistic understanding of pre-trained LLMs,
transforming the recognition task into a guided generation problem. Through
meticulous prompt engineering, dynamic integration of explicit cultural
knowledge derived from knowledge graphs, and the strategic application of
adversarial data augmentation, we equip the LLM with an unprecedented ability
to infer the cultural origin of unseen names. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our PEFT method consistently outperforms established deep learning
baselines, including advanced Bi-LSTM models with cultural tags, achieving an
impressive 93.1\% overall accuracy and a remarkable 89.5\% accuracy on
challenging zero-shot name identification. An in-depth ablation study confirms
the synergistic contribution of each component, while a human evaluation
highlights our method's performance approaching human expert judgment. This

Conclusion: 当前LLM在学术图书馆参考服务中展现出支持公平和情境适当沟通的潜力。

Abstract: As libraries explore large language models (LLMs) for use in virtual
reference services, a key question arises: Can LLMs serve all users equitably,
regardless of demographics or social status? While they offer great potential
for scalable support, LLMs may also reproduce societal biases embedded in their
training data, risking the integrity of libraries' commitment to equitable
service. To address this concern, we evaluate whether LLMs differentiate
responses across user identities by prompting six state-of-the-art LLMs to
assist patrons differing in sex, race/ethnicity, and institutional role. We
found no evidence of differentiation by race or ethnicity, and only minor
evidence of stereotypical bias against women in one model. LLMs demonstrated
nuanced accommodation of institutional roles through the use of linguistic
choices related to formality, politeness, and domain-specific vocabularies,
reflecting professional norms rather than discriminatory treatment. These
findings suggest that current LLMs show a promising degree of readiness to
support equitable and contextually appropriate communication in academic
library reference services.

Abstract: Diffusion models, originally developed for image generation, have emerged as
a promising alternative to autoregressive large language models (LLMs). We
present a theoretical analysis comparing autoregressive and masked diffusion
LLMs, revealing that the intrinsic bidirectional attention mechanism of
diffusion LLMs (dLLMs) enables superior context modeling and generation
controllability. However, existing dLLM applications face significant
challenges in controllable generation: the native multi-step denoising process
exhibits high sensitivity to sequence length, elevated hallucination rates, and
prohibitive inference costs without specialized optimizations. To address these
limitations, we propose \textbf{S}elf-adaptive \textbf{S}chema
\textbf{S}caffolding ($S^3$), a novel framework that enables dLLMs to generate
structured outputs (e.g., JSON) while maintaining semantic fidelity and
accelerating inference. Our approach injects the target schema structure into
the output context, reducing unnecessary computation while improving
controllability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $S^3$ achieves
substantial improvements: 65\% increase in structural adherence, 48\%
enhancement in content fidelity, and 17\% reduction in hallucination rates
compared to baseline. These results establish both theoretical foundations and
practical pathways for deploying diffusion models in controllable text
generation tasks. Code and data will be publicly released.

Specifically, Co-DETECT flags challenging examples, induces high-level,

edge case handling rules to improve the codebook. This iterative process
enables more effective handling of nuanced phenomena through compact,

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) are widely used to derive semantic
representations from item metadata in recommendation and search. In sequential
recommendation, PLMs enhance ID-based embeddings through textual metadata,
while in product search, they align item characteristics with user intent.
Recent studies suggest task and domain-specific fine-tuning are needed to
improve representational power. This paper challenges this assumption, showing
that Generalist Text Embedding Models (GTEs), pre-trained on large-scale
corpora, can guarantee strong zero-shot performance without specialized
adaptation. Our experiments demonstrate that GTEs outperform traditional and
fine-tuned models in both sequential recommendation and product search. We
attribute this to a superior representational power, as they distribute
features more evenly across the embedding space. Finally, we show that
compressing embedding dimensions by focusing on the most informative directions
(e.g., via PCA) effectively reduces noise and improves the performance of
specialized models. To ensure reproducibility, we provide our repository at

Abstract: Speech Large Language Models (Speech LLMs) have emerged as a crucial paradigm
in recent years, extending the capabilities of traditional LLMs to speech tasks
such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) and spoken dialogue modeling.
However, their effectiveness in real-world multilingual conversations remains
limited by the scarcity of data that captures natural conversational phenomena.
To address this, the MLC-SLM Challenge provides a multilingual conversational
dataset and evaluates models on two tasks: ASR with oracle segmentation (Task
I) and joint diarization and recognition without oracle information (Task II).
In this paper, we focus on Task II and propose a unified speech LLM that
jointly performs diarization and ASR in an end-to-end manner. By reformulating
the training data format and modifying the inference procedure, our model
addresses the ambiguity inherent in pre-segmented audio and achieves a 54.87\%
relative improvement in tcpWER/tcpCER over the baseline, ranking 8th overall,
despite using a smaller LLM backbone. We also report results from Task I using

Abstract: The enhancement of mathematical capabilities in large language models (LLMs)
fosters new developments in mathematics education within primary and secondary
schools, particularly as they relate to intelligent tutoring systems. However,
LLMs require substantial computational resources, resulting in significant
costs in educational contexts. To mitigate this drawback, this paper
investigates the feasibility of compressing LLMs for solving math word problems
(MWPs). We compress the embedded vectors encoded by BERT and distill a
considerably smaller student model. Our findings indicate that the student
model can maintain nearly 90% of the performance of the teacher model while
utilizing only 1/12 of its parameters. In addition to achieving high accuracy,
the model exhibits strong generalizability, as the compressed vectors perform
well across all tasks related to MWPs, and the distillation process is not
task-specific. The success of this distillation demonstrates that the
underlying principles are generic and not limited to a specific task. We
further explore the reasons behind the compressibility of embedded vectors,
revealing that part-of-speech information, rather than entity recognition, is
crucial for MWPs, which may significantly contribute to their compressibility.
The improvements in efficiency and cost reduction provide substantial value for
intelligent tutoring systems and significantly advance the field of intelligent
education.

(i) even SOTA models (e.g., o3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro) leave substantial headroom
on BMMR-Eval; (ii) reasoning models exhibit discipline bias and outperform LMMs
only on specific subjects; (iii) open-source models still trail their

Abstract: Data pruning, selecting small but impactful subsets, offers a promising way
to efficiently scale NLP model training. However, existing methods often
involve many different design choices, which have not been systematically
studied. This limits future developments. In this work, we decompose data
pruning into two key components: the data representation and the selection
algorithm, and we systematically analyze their influence on the selection of
instances. Our theoretical and empirical results highlight the crucial role of
representations: better representations, e.g., training gradients, generally
lead to a better selection of instances, regardless of the chosen selection
algorithm. Furthermore, different selection algorithms excel in different
settings, and none consistently outperforms the others. Moreover, the selection
algorithms do not always align with their intended objectives: for example,
algorithms designed for the same objective can select drastically different
instances, highlighting the need for careful evaluation.

Abstract: Knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) presents significant challenges due
to the structural and semantic variations across input graphs. Existing works
rely on Large Language Model (LLM) agents for graph traversal and retrieval; an
approach that is sensitive to traversal initialization, as it is prone to
entity linking errors and may not generalize well to custom ("bring-your-own")
KGs. We introduce BYOKG-RAG, a framework that enhances KGQA by synergistically
combining LLMs with specialized graph retrieval tools. In BYOKG-RAG, LLMs
generate critical graph artifacts (question entities, candidate answers,
reasoning paths, and OpenCypher queries), and graph tools link these artifacts
to the KG and retrieve relevant graph context. The retrieved context enables
the LLM to iteratively refine its graph linking and retrieval, before final
answer generation. By retrieving context from different graph tools, BYOKG-RAG
offers a more general and robust solution for QA over custom KGs. Through
experiments on five benchmarks spanning diverse KG types, we demonstrate that
BYOKG-RAG outperforms the second-best graph retrieval method by 4.5% points
while showing better generalization to custom KGs. BYOKG-RAG framework is

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决手动标注耗时且覆盖率低，以及LLM输出存在幻觉或逻辑不一致的问题。

Method: 结合LLM提取与符号推理，使用七种逻辑约束优化关系图，并提供交互界面实时验证和冲突解决。

Result: 实验表明SymbolicThought显著提高标注准确性和一致性，同时减少时间成本。

Conclusion: SymbolicThought为叙事理解、可解释AI和LLM评估提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Understanding character relationships is essential for interpreting complex
narratives and conducting socially grounded AI research. However, manual
annotation is time-consuming and low in coverage, while large language models
(LLMs) often produce hallucinated or logically inconsistent outputs. We present
SymbolicThought, a human-in-the-loop framework that combines LLM-based
extraction with symbolic reasoning. The system constructs editable character
relationship graphs, refines them using seven types of logical constraints, and
enables real-time validation and conflict resolution through an interactive
interface. To support logical supervision and explainable social analysis, we
release a dataset of 160 interpersonal relationships with corresponding logical
structures. Experiments show that SymbolicThought improves annotation accuracy
and consistency while significantly reducing time cost, offering a practical
tool for narrative understanding, explainable AI, and LLM evaluation.

Method: 使用Facebook和Twitter数据，结合人工标注，评估三种LLMs对HPV疫苗接种和加热烟草产品相关情感的分类能力。

Result: LLMs在分类风险促进和健康支持情感上总体准确，但表现因平台、议题和模型类型不同；中性消息检测存在困难。

Conclusion: 选择LLMs进行公共健康分析需谨慎验证，以应对潜在的数据偏见和分类偏差。

Abstract: Machine learning methods are increasingly applied to analyze health-related
public discourse based on large-scale data, but questions remain regarding
their ability to accurately detect different types of health sentiments.
Especially, Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained attention as a powerful
technology, yet their accuracy and feasibility in capturing different opinions
and perspectives on health issues are largely unexplored. Thus, this research
examines how accurate the three prominent LLMs (GPT, Gemini, and LLAMA) are in
detecting risk-promoting versus health-supporting sentiments across two
critical public health topics: Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and
heated tobacco products (HTPs). Drawing on data from Facebook and Twitter, we
curated multiple sets of messages supporting or opposing recommended health
behaviors, supplemented with human annotations as the gold standard for
sentiment classification. The findings indicate that all three LLMs generally
demonstrate substantial accuracy in classifying risk-promoting and
health-supporting sentiments, although notable discrepancies emerge by
platform, health issue, and model type. Specifically, models often show higher
accuracy for risk-promoting sentiment on Facebook, whereas health-supporting
messages on Twitter are more accurately detected. An additional analysis also
shows the challenges LLMs face in reliably detecting neutral messages. These
results highlight the importance of carefully selecting and validating language
models for public health analyses, particularly given potential biases in
training data that may lead LLMs to overestimate or underestimate the
prevalence of certain perspectives.

Abstract: In an era of rampant misinformation, generating reliable news explanations is
vital, especially for under-represented languages like Hindi. Lacking robust
automated tools, Hindi faces challenges in scaling misinformation detection. To
bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework integrating Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) with curriculum learning to align machine-generated
explanations with human reasoning. Fact-checked explanations from credible
sources serve as preferred responses, while LLM outputs highlight system
limitations and serve as non-preferred responses. To refine task-specific
alignment, we introduce two key parameters -- Actuality and Finesse -- into the
DPO loss function, enhancing explanation quality and consistency. Experiments
with LLMs (Mistral, Llama, Gemma) and PLMs (mBART, mT5) confirm the framework's
effectiveness in generating coherent, contextually relevant explanations. This
scalable approach combats misinformation and extends automated explanation
generation to low-resource languages.

Abstract: The use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) models is becoming
ubiquitous in many fields. Though progress continues to be made, general
purpose large language AI models (LLM) show a tendency to deliver creative
answers, often called "hallucinations", which have slowed their application in
the medical and biomedical fields where accuracy is paramount. We propose that
the design and use of much smaller, domain and even task-specific LM may be a
more rational and appropriate use of this technology in biomedical research. In
this work we apply a very small LM by today's standards to the specialized task
of predicting regulatory interactions between molecular components to fill gaps
in our current understanding of intracellular pathways. Toward this we attempt
to correctly posit known pathway-informed interactions recovered from manually
curated pathway databases by selecting and using only the most informative
examples as part of an active learning scheme. With this example we show that a
small (~110 million parameters) LM based on a Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT) architecture can propose molecular
interactions relevant to tuberculosis persistence and transmission with over
80% accuracy using less than 25% of the ~520 regulatory relationships in
question. Using information entropy as a metric for the iterative selection of
new tuning examples, we also find that increased accuracy is driven by favoring
the use of the incorrectly assigned statements with the highest certainty
(lowest entropy). In contrast, the concurrent use of correct but least certain
examples contributed little and may have even been detrimental to the learning
rate.

Abstract: Relationship extraction (RE) is a core task in natural language processing.
Traditional approaches typically frame RE as a supervised learning problem,
directly mapping context to labels-an approach that often suffers from poor
out-of-domain (OOD) generalization. Inspired by the workflow of human
annotators, we reframe RE as a reasoning task guided by annotation guidelines
and introduce R1-RE, the first reinforcement learning with verifiable reward
(RLVR) framework for RE tasks. Our method elicits the reasoning abilities of
small language models for annotation tasks, resulting in significantly improved
OOD robustness. We evaluate our approach on the public Sem-2010 dataset and a
private MDKG dataset. The R1-RE-7B model attains an average OOD accuracy of
approximately 70%, on par with leading proprietary models such as GPT-4o.
Additionally, our comprehensive analysis provides novel insights into the
training dynamics and emergent reasoning behaviors of the RLVR paradigm for RE.

Abstract: Empathetic interaction is a cornerstone of human-machine communication, due

critical need for transparent research into the LSLMs and empathetic behavior,
we present OpenS2S, a fully open-source, transparent and end-to-end LSLM
designed to enable empathetic speech interactions. Based on our empathetic
speech-to-text model BLSP-Emo, OpenS2S further employs a streaming interleaved
decoding architecture to achieve low-latency speech generation. To facilitate
end-to-end training, OpenS2S incorporates an automated data construction
pipeline that synthesizes diverse, high-quality empathetic speech dialogues at
low cost. By leveraging large language models to generate empathetic content
and controllable text-to-speech systems to introduce speaker and emotional
variation, we construct a scalable training corpus with rich paralinguistic
diversity and minimal human supervision. We release the fully open-source
OpenS2S model, including the dataset, model weights, pre-training and
fine-tuning codes, to empower the broader research community and accelerate
innovation in empathetic speech systems. The project webpage can be accessed at

Method: 使用DisCoCirc框架，比较量子电路和经典神经网络在扩展的bAbI任务数据集上的表现，测试组合泛化的多个方面。

Result: 两种架构在部分任务上表现相近，但在系统性任务上差异显著（10%以上），神经网络更易过拟合。

Conclusion: 组合模型在泛化和可解释性方面具有潜力，但架构选择影响性能。

Abstract: The DisCoCirc framework for natural language processing allows the
construction of compositional models of text, by combining units for individual
words together according to the grammatical structure of the text. The
compositional nature of a model can give rise to two things: compositional
generalisation -- the ability of a model to generalise outside its training
distribution by learning compositional rules underpinning the entire data
distribution -- and compositional interpretability -- making sense of how the
model works by inspecting its modular components in isolation, as well as the
processes through which these components are combined. We present these notions
in a framework-agnostic way using the language of category theory, and adapt a
series of tests for compositional generalisation to this setting.
  Applying this to the DisCoCirc framework, we consider how well a selection of
models can learn to compositionally generalise. We compare both quantum circuit
based models, as well as classical neural networks, on a dataset derived from
one of the bAbI tasks, extended to test a series of aspects of
compositionality. Both architectures score within 5% of one another on the
productivity and substitutivity tasks, but differ by at least 10% for the
systematicity task, and exhibit different trends on the overgeneralisation
tasks. Overall, we find the neural models are more prone to overfitting the
Train data. Additionally, we demonstrate how to interpret a compositional model
on one of the trained models. By considering how the model components interact
with one another, we explain how the model behaves.

Abstract: Open-domain table question answering traditionally relies on a two-stage
pipeline: static table retrieval followed by a closed-domain answer. In
contrast, we propose an end-to-end agentic framework that embeds multi-turn
tool calls-using a BM25+-based search API and a SQLite SQL executor-directly
into a large language model. To further adapt a compact 4B-parameter model, we
introduce a two-stage fine-tuning process: supervised cold-start on easy
questions, then Async GRPO reinforcement learning on harder cases with LoRA
adapters and a rollout buffer. This unified approach enables the model to
jointly retrieve, reason, and execute queries, yielding a dramatic accuracy
improvement from single-digit zero-shot performance to over 0.86 exact match on
a held-out test set. Our results underscore the effectiveness of integrating
structured tool calls with targeted RL fine-tuning for scalable, accurate table
QA. The code is available at https://github.com/TabibitoQZP/OpenTableR1.

Abstract: For over a century, life course researchers have faced a choice between two
dominant methodological approaches: qualitative methods that analyze rich data
but are constrained to small samples, and quantitative survey-based methods
that study larger populations but sacrifice data richness for scale. Two recent
technological developments now enable us to imagine a hybrid approach that
combines some of the depth of the qualitative approach with the scale of
quantitative methods. The first development is the steady rise of ''complex log
data,'' behavioral data that is logged for purposes other than research but
that can be repurposed to construct rich accounts of people's lives. The second
is the emergence of large language models (LLMs) with exceptional pattern
recognition capabilities on plain text. In this paper, we take a necessary step
toward creating this hybrid approach by developing a flexible procedure to
transform complex log data into a textual representation of an individual's
life trajectory across multiple domains, over time, and in context. We call
this data representation a ''book of life.'' We illustrate the feasibility of
our approach by writing over 100 million books of life covering many different
facets of life, over time and placed in social context using Dutch
population-scale registry data. We open source the book of life toolkit (BOLT),
and invite the research community to explore the many potential applications of
this approach.

Abstract: Document level Machine Translation (DocMT) approaches often struggle with
effectively capturing discourse level phenomena. Existing approaches rely on

with the true discourse structure required for accurate translation. Otherwise,
they fail to maintain consistency throughout the document during translation.
To address these challenges, we propose Graph Augmented Agentic Framework for
Document Level Translation (GRAFT), a novel graph based DocMT system that
leverages Large Language Model (LLM) agents for document translation. Our
approach integrates segmentation, directed acyclic graph (DAG) based dependency
modelling, and discourse aware translation into a cohesive framework.
Experiments conducted across eight translation directions and six diverse
domains demonstrate that GRAFT achieves significant performance gains over
state of the art DocMT systems. Specifically, GRAFT delivers an average
improvement of 2.8 d BLEU on the TED test sets from IWSLT2017 over strong
baselines and 2.3 d BLEU for domain specific translation from English to
Chinese. Moreover, our analyses highlight the consistent ability of GRAFT to
address discourse level phenomena, yielding coherent and contextually accurate

To systematically assess cultural reasoning, we propose a novel evaluation
strategy with customized scoring metrics that capture the extent to which

Processing (NLP) models in resource-restricted edge settings presents
significant challenges, particularly in environments requiring strict privacy
compliance, real-time responsiveness, and diverse multi-tasking capabilities.
These challenges create a fundamental need for ultra-compact models that
maintain strong performance across various NLP tasks while adhering to
stringent memory constraints. To this end, we introduce Edge ultra-lIte BERT
framework (EI-BERT) with a novel cross-distillation method. EI-BERT efficiently
compresses models through a comprehensive pipeline including hard token
pruning, cross-distillation and parameter quantization. Specifically, the
cross-distillation method uniquely positions the teacher model to understand
the student model's perspective, ensuring efficient knowledge transfer through
parameter integration and the mutual interplay between models. Through
extensive experiments, we achieve a remarkably compact BERT-based model of only
1.91 MB - the smallest to date for Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks.
This ultra-compact model has been successfully deployed across multiple
scenarios within the Alipay ecosystem, demonstrating significant improvements
in real-world applications. For example, it has been integrated into Alipay's
live Edge Recommendation system since January 2024, currently serving the app's
recommendation traffic across \textbf{8.4 million daily active devices}.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于多源意见摘要（M-OS）的查询聚焦可解释比较摘要（QF-CES）生成任务，并引入数据集MS-Q2P。利用大语言模型（LLMs）生成表格化比较摘要，显著降低推理延迟。评估显示其与人类判断高度相关。

Motivation: 传统意见摘要缺乏全面的比较视角，无法满足查询聚焦的推荐需求。

Method: 通过M-OS生成中间摘要，利用LLMs生成表格化比较摘要，并评估开源和专有LLMs的性能。

Result: M-OS降低推理延迟约40%，QF-CES-PROMPT在5个维度上与人类判断的平均Spearman相关性为0.74。

Conclusion: QF-CES方法在生成和评估查询聚焦摘要方面具有潜力，且高效、隐私保护。

Abstract: Product recommendations inherently involve comparisons, yet traditional
opinion summarization often fails to provide holistic comparative insights. We
propose the novel task of generating Query-Focused Comparative Explainable
Summaries (QF-CES) using Multi-Source Opinion Summarization (M-OS). To address
the lack of query-focused recommendation datasets, we introduce MS-Q2P,
comprising 7,500 queries mapped to 22,500 recommended products with metadata.
We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate tabular comparative
summaries with query-specific explanations. Our approach is personalized,
privacy-preserving, recommendation engine-agnostic, and category-agnostic. M-OS
as an intermediate step reduces inference latency approximately by 40% compared
to the direct input approach (DIA), which processes raw data directly. We
evaluate open-source and proprietary LLMs for generating and assessing QF-CES.
Extensive evaluations using QF-CES-PROMPT across 5 dimensions (clarity,
faithfulness, informativeness, format adherence, and query relevance) showed an
average Spearman correlation of 0.74 with human judgments, indicating its
potential for QF-CES evaluation.

Result: 在MultiWOZ数据集上展示了竞争性结果，显著减少了对标记数据的需求。

Conclusion: Spec-TOD为低资源场景下的高效TOD系统提供了潜力。

Abstract: Task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems facilitate goal-driven interactions
between users and machines. While recent advances in deep learning have
improved the performance, TOD systems often struggle in low-resource scenarios
with limited labeled data. To address this challenge, we propose Spec-TOD, a
novel framework designed to train an end-to-end TOD system with limited data.
Spec-TOD introduces two main innovations: (i) a novel specialized end-to-end
TOD framework that incorporates explicit task instructions for
instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs), and (ii) an efficient training
strategy that leverages lightweight, specialized LLMs to achieve strong
performance with minimal supervision. Experiments on the MultiWOZ dataset, a
widely used TOD benchmark, demonstrate that Spec-TOD achieves competitive
results while significantly reducing the need for labeled data. These findings
highlight the potential of the proposed framework in advancing efficient and
effective TOD systems in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Relation extraction is a crucial task in natural language processing, with
broad applications in knowledge graph construction and literary analysis.
However, the complex context and implicit expressions in novel texts pose
significant challenges for automatic character relationship extraction. This
study focuses on relation extraction in the novel domain and proposes a method
based on Large Language Models (LLMs). By incorporating relationship dimension
separation, dialogue data construction, and contextual learning strategies, the
proposed method enhances extraction performance. Leveraging dialogue structure
information, it improves the model's ability to understand implicit
relationships and demonstrates strong adaptability in complex contexts.
Additionally, we construct a high-quality Chinese novel relation extraction
dataset to address the lack of labeled resources and support future research.
Experimental results show that our method outperforms traditional baselines
across multiple evaluation metrics and successfully facilitates the automated
construction of character relationship networks in novels.

Result: 初步结果表明，该方法在捕捉全文相似性和逻辑关系分类任务上优于现有最先进模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模文本数据的透明和可靠信息检索提供了新思路。

Abstract: The volume and diversity of digital information have led to a growing
reliance on Machine Learning techniques, such as Natural Language Processing,
for interpreting and accessing appropriate data. While vector and graph
embeddings represent data for similarity tasks, current state-of-the-art
pipelines lack guaranteed explainability, failing to determine similarity for
given full texts accurately. These considerations can also be applied to
classifiers exploiting generative language models with logical prompts, which
fail to correctly distinguish between logical implication, indifference, and
inconsistency, despite being explicitly trained to recognise the first two
classes. We present a novel pipeline designed for hybrid explainability to
address this. Our methodology combines graphs and logic to produce First-Order
Logic representations, creating machine- and human-readable representations
through Montague Grammar. Preliminary results indicate the effectiveness of
this approach in accurately capturing full text similarity. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first approach to differentiate between implication,
inconsistency, and indifference for text classification tasks. To address the
limitations of existing approaches, we use three self-contained datasets
annotated for the former classification task to determine the suitability of
these approaches in capturing sentence structure equivalence, logical
connectives, and spatiotemporal reasoning. We also use these data to compare
the proposed method with language models pre-trained for detecting sentence
entailment. The results show that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art models, indicating that natural language understanding cannot
be easily generalised by training over extensive document corpora. This work
offers a step toward more transparent and reliable Information Retrieval from
extensive textual data.

Result: 在两个公开基准测试中，AdS以更少的可训练参数达到最优性能。

Conclusion: AdS为低资源环境下的多模态任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The growing prevalence of multimodal image-text sarcasm on social media poses
challenges for opinion mining, especially under resource constraints. Existing
approaches rely on full fine-tuning of large pre-trained models, making them
unsuitable for low-resource settings. While recent parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) methods offer promise, their off-the-shelf use underperforms
on complex tasks like sarcasm detection. We propose AdS (Adapter-State
Sharing), a lightweight framework built on CLIP that inserts adapters only in
the upper layers and introduces a novel adapter-state sharing mechanism, where
textual adapters guide visual ones. This design promotes efficient cross-modal
learning while preserving low-level unimodal representations. Experiments on
two public benchmarks demonstrate that AdS achieves state-of-the-art results
using significantly fewer trainable parameters than existing PEFT and full
fine-tuning approaches.

Conclusion: M-OS方法有效，且M-OS-EVAL为未来研究提供了基准。

Abstract: Multi-source Opinion Summarization (M-OS) extends beyond traditional opinion
summarization by incorporating additional sources of product metadata such as
descriptions, key features, specifications, and ratings, alongside reviews.
This integration results in comprehensive summaries that capture both
subjective opinions and objective product attributes essential for informed
decision-making. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant
success in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, their potential in
M-OS remains largely unexplored. Additionally, the lack of evaluation datasets
for this task has impeded further advancements. To bridge this gap, we
introduce M-OS-EVAL, a benchmark dataset for evaluating multi-source opinion
summaries across 7 key dimensions: fluency, coherence, relevance, faithfulness,
aspect coverage, sentiment consistency, specificity. Our results demonstrate
that M-OS significantly enhances user engagement, as evidenced by a user study
in which, on average, 87% of participants preferred M-OS over opinion
summaries. Our experiments demonstrate that factually enriched summaries
enhance user engagement. Notably, M-OS-PROMPTS exhibit stronger alignment with
human judgment, achieving an average Spearman correlation of \r{ho} = 0.74,

Conclusion: LLM可用于初步生成CQs，但需进一步优化，不同方法各有优劣。

Abstract: Competency Questions (CQs) are pivotal in knowledge engineering, guiding the
design, validation, and testing of ontologies. A number of diverse formulation
approaches have been proposed in the literature, ranging from completely manual
to Large Language Model (LLM) driven ones. However, attempts to characterise
the outputs of these approaches and their systematic comparison are scarce.
This paper presents an empirical comparative evaluation of three distinct CQ
formulation approaches: manual formulation by ontology engineers, instantiation
of CQ patterns, and generation using state of the art LLMs. We generate CQs
using each approach from a set of requirements for cultural heritage, and
assess them across different dimensions: degree of acceptability, ambiguity,
relevance, readability and complexity. Our contribution is twofold: (i) the
first multi-annotator dataset of CQs generated from the same source using
different methods; and (ii) a systematic comparison of the characteristics of
the CQs resulting from each approach. Our study shows that different CQ
generation approaches have different characteristics and that LLMs can be used
as a way to initially elicit CQs, however these are sensitive to the model used
to generate CQs and they generally require a further refinement step before
they can be used to model requirements.

Conclusion: 上下文感知方法（如LLM引导的FairDiffusion）能更有效地解决T2I模型的多样化问题。

Abstract: Current diversification strategies for text-to-image (T2I) models often
ignore contextual appropriateness, leading to over-diversification where
demographic attributes are modified even when explicitly specified in prompts.
This paper introduces DIVBENCH, a benchmark and evaluation framework for
measuring both under- and over-diversification in T2I generation. Through
systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art T2I models, we find that while most
models exhibit limited diversity, many diversification approaches overcorrect
by inappropriately altering contextually-specified attributes. We demonstrate
that context-aware methods, particularly LLM-guided FairDiffusion and prompt
rewriting, can already effectively address under-diversity while avoiding
over-diversification, achieving a better balance between representation and
semantic fidelity.

Abstract: Early evaluation of children's language is frustrated by the high pitch, long

K-Function, a unified framework that combines accurate sub-word transcription,
objective scoring, and actionable feedback. Its core, Kids-WFST, merges a

child-specific errors while remaining fully interpretable. Kids-WFST attains
1.39% phoneme error on MyST and 8.61% on Multitudes--absolute gains of 10.47
and 7.06 points over a greedy-search decoder. These high-fidelity transcripts
power an LLM that grades verbal skills, milestones, reading, and comprehension,

Conclusion: 研究表明基于LLM的临床数据转换为HL7 FHIR的可行性，为半自动化互操作性工作流奠定了基础。

Abstract: For years, semantic interoperability standards have sought to streamline the
exchange of clinical data, yet their deployment remains time-consuming,
resource-intensive, and technically challenging. To address this, we introduce
a semi-automated approach that leverages large language models specifically
GPT-4o and Llama 3.2 405b to convert structured clinical datasets into HL7 FHIR
format while assessing accuracy, reliability, and security. Applying our method
to the MIMIC-IV database, we combined embedding techniques, clustering
algorithms, and semantic retrieval to craft prompts that guide the models in
mapping each tabular field to its corresponding FHIR resource. In an initial
benchmark, resource identification achieved a perfect F1-score, with GPT-4o
outperforming Llama 3.2 thanks to the inclusion of FHIR resource schemas within
the prompt. Under real-world conditions, accuracy dipped slightly to 94 %, but
refinements to the prompting strategy restored robust mappings. Error analysis
revealed occasional hallucinations of non-existent attributes and mismatches in
granularity, which more detailed prompts can mitigate. Overall, our study
demonstrates the feasibility of context-aware, LLM-driven transformation of
clinical data into HL7 FHIR, laying the groundwork for semi-automated
interoperability workflows. Future work will focus on fine-tuning models with
specialized medical corpora, extending support to additional standards such as
HL7 CDA and OMOP, and developing an interactive interface to enable expert

Conclusion: SHNU-mASR系统在多语言语音识别任务中表现卓越，无需额外数据。

Abstract: This paper describes SHNU multilingual conversational speech recognition
system (SHNU-mASR, team name-"maybe"), submitted to Track 1 of the INTERSPEECH
2025 MLC-SLM Challenge. Our system integrates a parallel-speech-encoder
architecture with a large language model (LLM) to form a unified multilingual
ASR framework. The parallel-speech-encoder consists of two pre-trained
encoders, the Whisper-large-v3 encoder and mHuBERT-147 encoder. Their output
embeddings are concatenated and fed into the LLM, enabling the model to
leverage complementary acoustic and linguistic knowledge and achieve
competitive performance. Moreover, we adopt a tri-stage training strategy to
jointly update the low-rank adaptation modules and projector parameters of both
the speech encoders and the LLM. In addition, we incorporate an additional
language-aware prompt at the LLM input to enhance language-specific text
generation. The SHNU-mASR system achieves an overall character/word error rate
(CER/WER) of 11.76% on the blind evaluation set of the challenge, outperforming
the official MLC-SLM baseline by 8.41 absolute CER/WER, without increasing the
baseline training data.

Motivation: 属性图中常存在错误，传统修复方法适应性差，人工参与成本高，LLMs的上下文推理能力为自动化修复提供了新机会。

Method: 评估六种开源LLMs在属性图修复中的表现，分析修复质量、计算成本和模型性能。

Result: LLMs能检测并纠正错误，但准确性和效率因模型而异。

Conclusion: LLMs在属性图修复中具有潜力，但需改进可扩展性和可解释性。

Abstract: Property graphs are widely used in domains such as healthcare, finance, and
social networks, but they often contain errors due to inconsistencies, missing
data, or schema violations. Traditional rule-based and heuristic-driven graph
repair methods are limited in their adaptability as they need to be tailored
for each dataset. On the other hand, interactive human-in-the-loop approaches
may become infeasible when dealing with large graphs, as the cost--both in
terms of time and effort--of involving users becomes too high. Recent
advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) present new opportunities for
automated graph repair by leveraging contextual reasoning and their access to
real-world knowledge. We evaluate the effectiveness of six open-source LLMs in
repairing property graphs. We assess repair quality, computational cost, and
model-specific performance. Our experiments show that LLMs have the potential
to detect and correct errors, with varying degrees of accuracy and efficiency.
We discuss the strengths, limitations, and challenges of LLM-driven graph
repair and outline future research directions for improving scalability and
interpretability.

Abstract: Social determinants of health (SDoH) significantly influence health outcomes,
shaping disease progression, treatment adherence, and health disparities.
However, their documentation in structured electronic health records (EHRs) is
often incomplete or missing. This study presents an approach based on large
language models (LLMs) for extracting 13 SDoH categories from French clinical
notes. We trained Flan-T5-Large on annotated social history sections from
clinical notes at Nantes University Hospital, France. We evaluated the model at
two levels: (i) identification of SDoH categories and associated values, and
(ii) extraction of detailed SDoH with associated temporal and quantitative
information. The model performance was assessed across four datasets, including
two that we publicly release as open resources. The model achieved strong
performance for identifying well-documented categories such as living
condition, marital status, descendants, job, tobacco, and alcohol use (F1 score
> 0.80). Performance was lower for categories with limited training data or
highly variable expressions, such as employment status, housing, physical
activity, income, and education. Our model identified 95.8% of patients with at
least one SDoH, compared to 2.8% for ICD-10 codes from structured EHR data. Our
error analysis showed that performance limitations were linked to annotation
inconsistencies, reliance on English-centric tokenizer, and reduced
generalizability due to the model being trained on social history sections
only. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of NLP in improving the
completeness of real-world SDoH data in a non-English EHR system.

Conclusion: 该方法无需一对一术语词典或解码时人工干预，有效解决了术语歧义问题。

Abstract: In real world translation scenarios, terminology is rarely one-to-one.
Instead, multiple valid translations may appear in a terminology dictionary,
but correctness of a translation depends on corporate style guides and context.
This can be challenging for neural machine translation (NMT) systems. Luckily,
in a corporate context, many examples of human post-edits of valid but
incorrect terminology exist. The goal of this work is to learn how to
disambiguate our terminology based on these corrections. Our approach is based
on preference optimization, using the term post-edit as the knowledge to be
preferred. While previous work had to rely on unambiguous translation
dictionaries to set hard constraints during decoding, or to add soft
constraints in the input, our framework requires neither one-to-one
dictionaries nor human intervention at decoding time. We report results on
English-German post-edited data and find that the optimal combination of
supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization, with both term-specific and
full sequence objectives, yields statistically significant improvements in term
accuracy over a strong NMT baseline without significant losses in COMET score.
Additionally, we release test sets from our post-edited data and terminology
dictionary.

Conclusion: 双曲表示在多跳推理中更具优势，尤其是在数据具有层次结构时。

Abstract: Hyperbolic representations are effective in modeling knowledge graph data
which is prevalently used to facilitate multi-hop reasoning. However, a
rigorous and detailed comparison of the two spaces for this task is lacking. In
this paper, through a simple integration of hyperbolic representations with an
encoder-decoder model, we perform a controlled and comprehensive set of
experiments to compare the capacity of hyperbolic space versus Euclidean space
in multi-hop reasoning. Our results show that the former consistently
outperforms the latter across a diverse set of datasets. In addition, through
an ablation study, we show that a learnable curvature initialized with the
delta hyperbolicity of the utilized data yields superior results to random
initializations. Furthermore, our findings suggest that hyperbolic
representations can be significantly more advantageous when the datasets
exhibit a more hierarchical structure.

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are structured knowledge repositories containing
entities and relations between them. In this paper, we investigate the problem
of automatically updating KGs over time with respect to the evolution of
knowledge in unstructured textual sources. This problem requires identifying a
wide range of update operations based on the state of an existing KG at a
specific point in time. This contrasts with traditional information extraction
pipelines, which extract knowledge from text independently of the current state
of a KG. To address this challenge, we propose a method for lifelong
construction of a dataset consisting of Wikidata KG snapshots over time and
Wikipedia passages paired with the corresponding edit operations that they
induce in a particular KG snapshot. The resulting dataset comprises 376K
Wikipedia passages aligned with a total of 1.25M KG edits over 10 different
snapshots of Wikidata from 2019 to 2025. Our experimental results highlight
challenges in updating KG snapshots based on emerging textual knowledge,
positioning the dataset as a valuable benchmark for future research. We will

HatePRISM, we conduct a comprehensive examination of hate speech regulations
and strategies from three perspectives: country regulations, social platform

inconsistencies in hate speech definitions and moderation practices across
jurisdictions and platforms, alongside a lack of alignment with research

Conclusion: MiDRE通过结合内外推理专家，显著提升讽刺检测性能，外部理性是关键。

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm detection has attracted growing interest due to the rise
of multimedia posts on social media. Understanding sarcastic image-text posts
often requires external contextual knowledge, such as cultural references or
commonsense reasoning. However, existing models struggle to capture the deeper
rationale behind sarcasm, relying mainly on shallow cues like image captions or
object-attribute pairs from images. To address this, we propose \textbf{MiDRE}
(\textbf{Mi}xture of \textbf{D}ual \textbf{R}easoning \textbf{E}xperts), which
integrates an internal reasoning expert for detecting incongruities within the
image-text pair and an external reasoning expert that utilizes structured
rationales generated via Chain-of-Thought prompting to a Large Vision-Language
Model. An adaptive gating mechanism dynamically weighs the two experts,
selecting the most relevant reasoning path. Experiments on two benchmark
datasets show that MiDRE achieves superior performance over baselines. Various
qualitative analyses highlight the crucial role of external rationales,
revealing that even when they are occasionally noisy, they provide valuable
cues that guide the model toward a better understanding of sarcasm.

Conclusion: DMDP在多模态讽刺检测任务中表现出色，尤其在少样本和跨领域场景下优于基线方法。

Abstract: The widespread use of multimodal content on social media has heightened the
need for effective sarcasm detection to improve opinion mining. However,
existing models rely heavily on large annotated datasets, making them less
suitable for real-world scenarios where labeled data is scarce. This motivates
the need to explore the problem in a few-shot setting. To this end, we
introduce DMDP (Deep Modality-Disentangled Prompt Tuning), a novel framework
for few-shot multimodal sarcasm detection. Unlike prior methods that use
shallow, unified prompts across modalities, DMDP employs gated,
modality-specific deep prompts for text and visual encoders. These prompts are
injected across multiple layers to enable hierarchical feature learning and
better capture diverse sarcasm types. To enhance intra-modal learning, we
incorporate a prompt-sharing mechanism across layers, allowing the model to
aggregate both low-level and high-level semantic cues. Additionally, a
cross-modal prompt alignment module enables nuanced interactions between image
and text representations, improving the model's ability to detect subtle
sarcastic intent. Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate DMDP's
superior performance in both few-shot and extremely low-resource settings.
Further cross-dataset evaluations show that DMDP generalizes well across
domains, consistently outperforming baseline methods.

Result: 研究发现，评论中的框架重复使用在新闻媒体间高度相关，但主题特定模式有所不同。

Conclusion: 结论是提出的框架和工具为大规模分析新闻框架与受众反应提供了有效方法。

Abstract: When a news article describes immigration as an "economic burden" or a
"humanitarian crisis," it selectively emphasizes certain aspects of the issue.
Although \textit{framing} shapes how the public interprets such issues,
audiences do not absorb frames passively but actively reorganize the presented
information. While this relationship between source content and audience
response is well-documented in the social sciences, NLP approaches often ignore
it, detecting frames in articles and responses in isolation. We present the
first computational framework for large-scale analysis of framing across source
content (news articles) and audience responses (reader comments).
Methodologically, we refine frame labels and develop a framework that
reconstructs dominant frames in articles and comments from sentence-level
predictions, and aligns articles with topically relevant comments. Applying our
framework across eleven topics and two news outlets, we find that frame reuse
in comments correlates highly across outlets, while topic-specific patterns
vary. We release a frame classifier that performs well on both articles and
comments, a dataset of article and comment sentences manually labeled for
frames, and a large-scale dataset of articles and comments with predicted frame
labels.

Emotion detection and Opinion Trigger extraction (EOT), which explicitly models
the relationship between causal text spans (opinion triggers) and affective
dimensions (emotion categories) grounded in Plutchik's theory of 8 primary
emotions. In the absence of labeled data, we introduce EOT-X, a human-annotated
collection of 2,400 reviews with fine-grained emotions and opinion triggers. We

Abstract: Access to consumer grievance redressal in India is often hindered by
procedural complexity, legal jargon, and jurisdictional challenges. To address
this, we present $\textbf{Grahak-Nyay}$ (Justice-to-Consumers), a chatbot that
streamlines the process using open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) and
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Grahak-Nyay simplifies legal complexities
through a concise and up-to-date knowledge base. We introduce three novel
datasets: $\textit{GeneralQA}$ (general consumer law), $\textit{SectoralQA}$
(sector-specific knowledge) and $\textit{SyntheticQA}$ (for RAG evaluation),
along with $\textit{NyayChat}$, a dataset of 300 annotated chatbot
conversations. We also introduce $\textit{Judgments}$ data sourced from Indian
Consumer Courts to aid the chatbot in decision making and to enhance user
trust. We also propose $\textbf{HAB}$ metrics ($\textbf{Helpfulness, Accuracy,
Brevity}$) to evaluate chatbot performance. Legal domain experts validated
Grahak-Nyay's effectiveness. Code and datasets will be released.

Conclusion: 该方法为OR-CONVQA提供了高效的数据生成和训练解决方案。

Abstract: We consider open-retrieval conversational question answering (OR-CONVQA), an
extension of question answering where system responses need to be (i) aware of
dialog history and (ii) grounded in documents (or document fragments) retrieved
per question. Domain-specific OR-CONVQA training datasets are crucial for
real-world applications, but hard to obtain. We propose a pipeline that
capitalizes on the abundance of plain text documents in organizations (e.g.,
product documentation) to automatically produce realistic OR-CONVQA dialogs
with annotations. Similarly to real-world humanannotated OR-CONVQA datasets, we
generate in-dialog question-answer pairs, self-contained (decontextualized,
e.g., no referring expressions) versions of user questions, and propositions
(sentences expressing prominent information from the documents) the system
responses are grounded in. We show how the synthetic dialogs can be used to
train efficient question rewriters that decontextualize user questions,
allowing existing dialog-unaware retrievers to be utilized. The retrieved
information and the decontextualized question are then passed on to an LLM that
generates the system's response.

Abstract: Item (question) difficulties play a crucial role in educational assessments,
enabling accurate and efficient assessment of student abilities and
personalization to maximize learning outcomes. Traditionally, estimating item
difficulties can be costly, requiring real students to respond to items,
followed by fitting an item response theory (IRT) model to get item difficulty
estimates. This approach cannot be applied to the cold-start setting for
previously unseen items either. In this work, we present SMART (Simulated
Students Aligned with IRT), a novel method for aligning simulated students with
instructed ability, which can then be used in simulations to predict the
difficulty of open-ended items. We achieve this alignment using direct
preference optimization (DPO), where we form preference pairs based on how
likely responses are under a ground-truth IRT model. We perform a simulation by
generating thousands of responses, evaluating them with an LLM-based scoring
model, and fit the resulting data to an IRT model to obtain item difficulty
estimates. Through extensive experiments on a real-world student response
dataset, we show that SMART outperforms other item difficulty prediction
methods by leveraging its improved ability alignment.

Abstract: Learning Japanese vocabulary is a challenge for learners from Roman alphabet
backgrounds due to script differences. Japanese combines syllabaries like
hiragana with kanji, which are logographic characters of Chinese origin. Kanji
are also complicated due to their complexity and volume. Keyword mnemonics are
a common strategy to aid memorization, often using the compositional structure
of kanji to form vivid associations. Despite recent efforts to use large
language models (LLMs) to assist learners, existing methods for LLM-based
keyword mnemonic generation function as a black box, offering limited
interpretability. We propose a generative framework that explicitly models the
mnemonic construction process as driven by a set of common rules, and learn
them using a novel Expectation-Maximization-type algorithm. Trained on
learner-authored mnemonics from an online platform, our method learns latent
structures and compositional rules, enabling interpretable and systematic
mnemonics generation. Experiments show that our method performs well in the
cold-start setting for new learners while providing insight into the mechanisms
behind effective mnemonic creation.

Abstract: Along with the explosion of large language models, improvements in speech
synthesis, advancements in hardware, and the evolution of computer graphics,
the current bottleneck in creating digital humans lies in generating character
movements that correspond naturally to text or speech inputs.
  In this work, we present DeepGesture, a diffusion-based gesture synthesis
framework for generating expressive co-speech gestures conditioned on
multimodal signals-text, speech, emotion, and seed motion. Built upon the
DiffuseStyleGesture model, DeepGesture introduces novel architectural
enhancements that improve semantic alignment and emotional expressiveness in
generated gestures. Specifically, we integrate fast text transcriptions as
semantic conditioning and implement emotion-guided classifier-free diffusion to
support controllable gesture generation across affective states. A lightweight
Transformer backbone combines full self-attention and cross-local attention for
effective feature fusion of heterogeneous modalities. To visualize results, we
implement a full rendering pipeline in Unity based on BVH output from the
model. Evaluation on the ZeroEGGS dataset shows that DeepGesture produces
gestures with improved human-likeness and contextual appropriateness,
outperforming baselines on Mean Opinion Score and Frechet Gesture Distance
metrics. Our system supports interpolation between emotional states and
demonstrates generalization to out-of-distribution speech, including synthetic
voices-marking a step forward toward fully multimodal, emotionally aware

Abstract: This article presents and validates an ideal, four-stage workflow for the
high-accuracy transcription and analysis of challenging medieval legal
documents. The process begins with a specialized Handwritten Text Recognition
(HTR) model, itself created using a novel "Clean Ground Truth" curation method
where a Large Language Model (LLM) refines the training data. This HTR model
provides a robust baseline transcription (Stage 1). In Stage 2, this baseline
is fed, along with the original document image, to an LLM for multimodal
post-correction, grounding the LLM's analysis and improving accuracy. The
corrected, abbreviated text is then expanded into full, scholarly Latin using a
prompt-guided LLM (Stage 3). A final LLM pass performs Named-Entity Correction
(NEC), regularizing proper nouns and generating plausible alternatives for
ambiguous readings (Stage 4). We validate this workflow through detailed case
studies, achieving Word Error Rates (WER) in the range of 2-7% against
scholarly ground truths. The results demonstrate that this hybrid, multi-stage
approach effectively automates the most laborious aspects of transcription
while producing a high-quality, analyzable output, representing a powerful and
practical solution for the current technological landscape.

Conclusion: 数据质量比数量更重要，FSL方法为间歇性任务失败检测提供了高效实用的框架。

Abstract: One of the main challenges developers face in the use of continuous
integration (CI) and deployment pipelines is the occurrence of intermittent job
failures, which result from unexpected non-deterministic issues (e.g., flaky
tests or infrastructure problems) rather than regular code-related errors such
as bugs. Prior studies developed machine-learning (ML) models trained on large
datasets of job logs to classify job failures as either intermittent or
regular. As an alternative to costly manual labeling of large datasets, the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach leveraged a heuristic based on
non-deterministic job reruns. However, this method mislabels intermittent job
failures as regular in contexts where rerunning suspicious job failures is not
an explicit policy, and therefore limits the SOTA's performance in practice. In
fact, our manual analysis of 2,125 job failures from 5 industrial and 1
open-source projects reveals that, on average, 32\% of intermittent job
failures are mislabeled as regular. To address these limitations, this paper
introduces a novel approach to intermittent job failure detection using
few-shot learning (FSL). Specifically, we fine-tune a small language model
using a few number of manually labeled log examples to generate rich
embeddings, which are then used to train an ML classifier. Our FSL-based
approach achieves 70-88\% F1-score with only 12 shots in all projects,
outperforming the SOTA, which proved ineffective (34-52\% F1-score) in 4
projects. Overall, this study underlines the importance of data quality over
quantity and provides a more efficient and practical framework for the
detection of intermittent job failures in organizations.

Conclusion: 论文指出了AgVs开发和治理中的关键挑战，包括安全性、实时控制、公众接受度、伦理对齐和监管框架。

Abstract: Autonomy, from the Greek autos (self) and nomos (law), refers to the capacity
to operate according to internal rules without external control. Accordingly,
autonomous vehicles (AuVs) are defined as systems capable of perceiving their
environment and executing preprogrammed tasks independently of external input.
However, both research and real-world deployments increasingly showcase
vehicles that demonstrate behaviors beyond this definition (including the SAE
levels 1 to 6), such as interaction with humans and machines, goal adaptation,
contextual reasoning, external tool use, and long-term planning, particularly
with the integration of large language models (LLMs) and agentic AI systems.
These developments reveal a conceptual gap between technical autonomy and the
broader cognitive and social capabilities needed for future human-centered
mobility systems. To address this, we introduce the concept of agentic vehicles
(AgVs), referring to vehicles that integrate agentic AI to reason, adapt, and
interact within complex environments. This paper presents a systems-level
framework to characterize AgVs, focusing on their cognitive and communicative
layers and differentiating them from conventional AuVs. It synthesizes relevant
advances in agentic AI, robotics, multi-agent systems, and human-machine
interaction, and highlights how agentic AI, through high-level reasoning and
tool use, can function not merely as computational tools but as interactive
agents embedded in mobility ecosystems. The paper concludes by identifying key
challenges in the development and governance of AgVs, including safety,
real-time control, public acceptance, ethical alignment, and regulatory
frameworks.

Abstract: Reasoning with quantifier expressions in natural language combines logical
and arithmetical features, transcending strict divides between qualitative and
quantitative. Our topic is this cooperation of styles as it occurs in common
linguistic usage and its extension into the broader practice of natural
language plus "grassroots mathematics".
  We begin with a brief review of first-order logic with counting operators and
cardinality comparisons. This system is known to be of high complexity, and
drowns out finer aspects of the combination of logic and counting. We move to a
small fragment that can represent numerical syllogisms and basic reasoning
about comparative size: monadic first-order logic with counting. We provide
normal forms that allow for axiomatization, determine which arithmetical
notions can be defined on finite and on infinite models, and conversely, we
discuss which logical notions can be defined out of purely arithmetical ones,
and what sort of (non-)classical logics can be induced.
  Next, we investigate a series of strengthenings, again using normal form
methods. The monadic second-order version is close, in a precise sense, to
additive Presburger Arithmetic, while versions with the natural device of tuple
counting take us to Diophantine equations, making the logic undecidable. We
also define a system that combines basic modal logic over binary accessibility
relations with counting, needed to formulate ubiquitous reasoning patterns such
as the Pigeonhole Principle.
  We return to our starting point in natural language, confronting the
architecture of our formal systems with linguistic quantifier vocabulary and
syntax. We conclude with some general thoughts on yet further entanglements of
logic and counting in formal systems, on rethinking the
qualitative/quantitative divide, and on connecting our analysis to empirical
findings in cognitive science.

Abstract: Major depressive disorder represents one of the most significant global
health challenges of the 21st century, affecting millions of people worldwide
and creating substantial economic and social burdens. While conventional
antidepressant therapies have provided relief for many individuals, their
limitations including delayed onset of action, significant side effects, and
treatment resistance in a substantial portion of patients have prompted
researchers and healthcare providers to explore alternative therapeutic
approaches (Kasneci et al.). African traditional medicine, with its rich
heritage of plant-based remedies developed over millennia, offers a valuable
resource for developing novel antidepressant treatments that may address some
of these limitations. This paper examines the integration of large language
models with African natural products for depression support, combining
traditional knowledge with modern artificial intelligence technology to create
accessible, evidence-based mental health support systems.
  The research presented here encompasses a comprehensive analysis of African
medicinal plants with documented antidepressant properties, their
pharmacological mechanisms, and the development of an AI-powered support system
that leverages DeepSeek's advanced language model capabilities. The system
provides evidence-based information about African herbal medicines, their
clinical applications, safety considerations, and therapeutic protocols while
maintaining scientific rigor and appropriate safety standards. Our findings
demonstrate the potential for large language models to serve as bridges between
traditional knowledge and modern healthcare, offering personalized, culturally
appropriate depression support that honors both traditional wisdom and
contemporary medical understanding.

Abstract: Computational phylogenetics has become an established tool in historical
linguistics, with many language families now analyzed using likelihood-based
inference. However, standard approaches rely on expert-annotated cognate sets,
which are sparse, labor-intensive to produce, and limited to individual
language families. This paper explores alternatives by comparing the
established method to two fully automated methods that extract phylogenetic
signal directly from lexical data. One uses automatic cognate clustering with
unigram/concept features; the other applies multiple sequence alignment (MSA)
derived from a pair-hidden Markov model. Both are evaluated against expert
classifications from Glottolog and typological data from Grambank. Also, the
intrinsic strengths of the phylogenetic signal in the characters are compared.
Results show that MSA-based inference yields trees more consistent with
linguistic classifications, better predicts typological variation, and provides
a clearer phylogenetic signal, suggesting it as a promising, scalable
alternative to traditional cognate-based methods. This opens new avenues for
global-scale language phylogenies beyond expert annotation bottlenecks.

including Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost, BERT Sentence Embeddings, BERT
Word Embeddings, and Albert Model. Model performance was systematically
validated against expert reviews of potentially misclassified narratives,
providing a rigorous assessment of classification accuracy. Results
demonstrated that while traditional ML methods exhibited superior overall
performance compared to some DL approaches, the Albert Model achieved the
highest agreement with expert classifications (73% with Expert 1) and original
tabular data (58%). Statistical analysis revealed that the Albert Model
maintained performance levels similar to inter-expert consistency rates,
significantly outperforming other approaches, particularly on ambiguous
narratives. This work addresses a critical gap in transportation safety
research through multi-modal integration analysis, which achieved a 54.2%

with targeted expert review offer a practical methodology for improving crash
data quality, with substantial implications for transportation safety
management and policy development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医疗专业人员难以快速获取复杂疫苗接种指南的问题。

Method: 采用检索增强生成（RAG）框架，并结合基于代理的推理（Agentic RAG）。

Result: Agentic RAG在复杂或模糊问题上优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 系统成功转化为移动应用，支持临床实时访问疫苗信息。

Abstract: Vaccination plays a vital role in global public health, yet healthcare
professionals often struggle to access immunization guidelines quickly and
efficiently. National protocols and WHO recommendations are typically extensive
and complex, making it difficult to extract precise information, especially
during urgent situations. This project tackles that issue by developing a
multilingual, intelligent question-answering system that transforms static
vaccination guidelines into an interactive and user-friendly knowledge base.
Built on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework and enhanced with
agent-based reasoning (Agentic RAG), the system provides accurate,
context-sensitive answers to complex medical queries. Evaluation shows that
Agentic RAG outperforms traditional methods, particularly in addressing
multi-step or ambiguous questions. To support clinical use, the system is
integrated into a mobile application designed for real-time, point-of-care
access to essential vaccine information. AI-VaxGuide model is publicly

Motivation: 解决方言识别中数据稀缺的问题，特别是在低资源场景下。

Method: 采用检索式语音转换（RVC）作为数据增强方法，结合其他增强技术（如频率掩码和片段移除）。

Result: RVC单独使用可提升分类性能，与其他方法结合时效果更佳。

Conclusion: RVC在低资源方言分类任务中具有潜力。

Abstract: Deep learning models for dialect identification are often limited by the
scarcity of dialectal data. To address this challenge, we propose to use
Retrieval-based Voice Conversion (RVC) as an effective data augmentation method
for a low-resource German dialect classification task. By converting audio
samples to a uniform target speaker, RVC minimizes speaker-related variability,
enabling models to focus on dialect-specific linguistic and phonetic features.
Our experiments demonstrate that RVC enhances classification performance when
utilized as a standalone augmentation method. Furthermore, combining RVC with
other augmentation methods such as frequency masking and segment removal leads
to additional performance gains, highlighting its potential for improving
dialect classification in low-resource scenarios.

interrelated meanings across languages. Traditionally built manually in a
bottom-up manner, they are inefficient for large datasets and lack
visualization and evaluation tools. This paper introduces XISM, an interactive
tool based on our prior algorithm, which constructs semantic maps from user
data via a top-down approach, displays candidate maps, and evaluates them using
multiple metrics. Users can refine maps by editing edges, combining data-driven
efficiency with expert knowledge. This human-in-the-loop design benefits both

context-specificity, R/S are difficult to operationalize in conventional
archival search strategies, particularly when datasets are very large, poorly
accessible, and marked by information noise. As a result, considerable time
investments and specialist knowledge is often needed to extract actionable
insights related to R/S from general archival sources, increasing reliance on
published literature and manual desk reviews. To address this challenge, we
present SpiritRAG, an interactive Question Answering (Q&A) system based on
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Built using 7,500 United Nations (UN)
resolution documents related to R/S in the domains of health and education,
SpiritRAG allows researchers and policymakers to conduct complex,
context-sensitive database searches of very large datasets using an easily

representations of word stress for five different languages: Three languages
with variable or lexical stress (Dutch, English and German) and two languages

stress classifiers on S3M embeddings and show that they can distinguish between
stressed and unstressed syllables in read-aloud short sentences with high
accuracy. We also tested language-specificity effects of S3M word stress. The
results indicate that the word stress representations are language-specific,

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了犹太阿拉伯语转写问题，并展示了LLM在此任务上的潜力。

Abstract: Judeo-Arabic refers to Arabic variants historically spoken by Jewish
communities across the Arab world, primarily during the Middle Ages. Unlike
standard Arabic, it is written in Hebrew script by Jewish writers and for
Jewish audiences. Transliterating Judeo-Arabic into Arabic script is
challenging due to ambiguous letter mappings, inconsistent orthographic
conventions, and frequent code-switching into Hebrew and Aramaic. In this
paper, we introduce a two-step approach to automatically transliterate
Judeo-Arabic into Arabic script: simple character-level mapping followed by
post-correction to address grammatical and orthographic errors. We also present
the first benchmark evaluation of LLMs on this task. Finally, we show that
transliteration enables Arabic NLP tools to perform morphosyntactic tagging and
machine translation, which would have not been feasible on the original texts.

To bridge this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive review of pun

Additionally, we summarise both automated and human evaluation metrics used to

Abstract: This study investigates the feasibility and performance of federated learning
(FL) for multi-label ICD code classification using clinical notes from the
MIMIC-IV dataset. Unlike previous approaches that rely on centralized training
or fine-tuned large language models, we propose a lightweight and scalable
pipeline combining frozen text embeddings with simple multilayer perceptron
(MLP) classifiers. This design offers a privacy-preserving and
deployment-efficient alternative for clinical NLP applications, particularly
suited to distributed healthcare settings. Extensive experiments across both
centralized and federated configurations were conducted, testing six publicly
available embedding models from Massive Text Embedding Benchmark leaderboard
and three MLP classifier architectures under two medical coding (ICD-9 and
ICD-10). Additionally, ablation studies over ten random stratified splits
assess performance stability. Results show that embedding quality substantially
outweighs classifier complexity in determining predictive performance, and that
federated learning can closely match centralized results in idealized
conditions. While the models are orders of magnitude smaller than
state-of-the-art architectures and achieved competitive micro and macro F1
scores, limitations remain including the lack of end-to-end training and the
simplified FL assumptions. Nevertheless, this work demonstrates a viable way
toward scalable, privacy-conscious medical coding systems and offers a step

Result: 手术后VAI显著降低但仍正常，VFD（特别是/i/音）显著增加，表明变异性提高。

Conclusion: 舌癌手术后发音清晰度保持正常，但变异性增加。

Abstract: Surgical treatment for tongue cancer can negatively affect the mobility and
musculature of the tongue, which can influence articulatory clarity and
variability. In this study, we investigated articulatory clarity through the
vowel articulation index (VAI) and variability through vowel formant dispersion
(VFD). Using a sentence reading task, we assessed 11 individuals pre and six
months post tongue cancer surgery, alongside 11 sex- and age matched typical
speakers. Our results show that while the VAI was significantly smaller
post-surgery compared to pre-surgery, there was no significant difference
between patients and typical speakers at either time point. Post-surgery,
speakers had higher VFD values for /i/ compared to pre-surgery and typical
speakers, signalling higher variability. Taken together, our results suggest
that while articulatory clarity remained within typical ranges following
surgery for tongue cancer for the speakers in our study, articulatory
variability increased.

Abstract: Over the past 30 years, nearly all the gains in the U.S. stock market have
been earned overnight, while average intraday returns have been negative or
flat. We find that a large part of this effect can be explained through
features of intraday and overnight news. Our analysis uses a collection of 2.4
million news articles. We apply a novel technique for supervised topic analysis
that selects news topics based on their ability to explain contemporaneous
market returns. We find that time variation in the prevalence of news topics
and differences in the responses to news topics both contribute to the
difference in intraday and overnight returns. In out-of-sample tests, our
approach forecasts which stocks will do particularly well overnight and
particularly poorly intraday. Our approach also helps explain patterns of
continuation and reversal in intraday and overnight returns. We contrast the
effect of news with other mechanisms proposed in the literature to explain
overnight returns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有融合策略无法同时实现效率、长距离建模和完整场景信息保留。受状态空间模型（SSMs）和线性注意力的启发，作者试图利用其线性复杂度和长距离建模能力解决这些问题。

Method: 提出高度保真的LiDAR编码（通过体素压缩保留高度信息）和混合Mamba块（结合局部和全局上下文学习），以优化多模态对齐和性能。

Result: 在nuScenes验证基准上取得75.0的NDS最高分，超越高分辨率输入方法，同时保持高效推理速度。

Conclusion: 通过高度保真的LiDAR编码和混合Mamba块，实现了高效且高性能的多模态3D目标检测。

Abstract: We present the first work demonstrating that a pure Mamba block can achieve
efficient Dense Global Fusion, meanwhile guaranteeing top performance for
camera-LiDAR multi-modal 3D object detection. Our motivation stems from the
observation that existing fusion strategies are constrained by their inability
to simultaneously achieve efficiency, long-range modeling, and retaining
complete scene information. Inspired by recent advances in state-space models
(SSMs) and linear attention, we leverage their linear complexity and long-range
modeling capabilities to address these challenges. However, this is non-trivial
since our experiments reveal that simply adopting efficient linear-complexity
methods does not necessarily yield improvements and may even degrade
performance. We attribute this degradation to the loss of height information
during multi-modal alignment, leading to deviations in sequence order. To
resolve this, we propose height-fidelity LiDAR encoding that preserves precise
height information through voxel compression in continuous space, thereby
enhancing camera-LiDAR alignment. Subsequently, we introduce the Hybrid Mamba
Block, which leverages the enriched height-informed features to conduct local
and global contextual learning. By integrating these components, our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance with the top-tire NDS score of 75.0 on
the nuScenes validation benchmark, even surpassing methods that utilize
high-resolution inputs. Meanwhile, our method maintains efficiency, achieving
faster inference speed than most recent state-of-the-art methods.

Method: 提出ReLoop框架，结合语义重建、视觉描述和注意力监督模块，通过闭环训练强制模型自我验证。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著降低幻觉率。

Conclusion: ReLoop为MLLMs中的幻觉问题提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in open-ended visual question answering, they remain vulnerable to
hallucinations. These are outputs that contradict or misrepresent input
semantics, posing a critical challenge to the reliability and factual
consistency. Existing methods often rely on external verification or post-hoc
correction, lacking an internal mechanism to validate outputs directly during
training. To bridge this gap, we propose ReLoop, a unified closed-loop training
framework that encourages multimodal consistency for cross-modal understanding
in MLLMs. ReLoop adopts a ring-shaped structure that integrates three
complementary consistency feedback mechanisms, obliging MLLMs to "seeing twice
and thinking backwards". Specifically, ReLoop employs the frozen Consistency
Feedback Plugin (CFP), comprising semantic reconstruction, visual description,
and an attention supervision module for attention alignment. These components
collectively enforce semantic reversibility, visual consistency, and
interpretable attention, enabling the model to correct its outputs during
training. Extensive evaluations and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of
ReLoop in reducing hallucination rates across multiple benchmarks, establishing
a robust method for hallucination mitigation in MLLMs. We will release our
source code and data in the camera-ready version.

Abstract: The remarkable reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) stems
from cognitive behaviors that emerge through reinforcement with verifiable
rewards. This work investigates how to transfer this principle to Multimodal
LLMs (MLLMs) to unlock advanced visual reasoning. We introduce a two-stage
paradigm built on Qwen2.5-VL-7B: a massive linguistic cold-start fine-tuning,
followed by multimodal reinforcement learning (RL) spanning nearly 1,000 steps,
surpassing all previous open-source efforts in scale. This pioneering work
reveals three fundamental insights: 1) Behavior transfer emerges surprisingly
early in cold start due to linguistic mental imagery. 2) Cold start broadly
memorizes visual behaviors, while RL critically discerns and scales up
effective patterns. 3) Transfer strategically favors high-utility behaviors
such as visual reflection. Our resulting model, Open-Vision-Reasoner (OVR),
achieves state-of-the-art performance on a suite of reasoning benchmarks,
including 95.3% on MATH500, 51.8% on MathVision and 54.6% on MathVerse. We
release our model, data, and training dynamics to catalyze the development of
more capable, behavior-aligned multimodal reasoners.

Conclusion: FACM为高性能少步生成模型提供通用有效方案。

Abstract: Continuous-time Consistency Models (CMs) promise efficient few-step
generation but face significant challenges with training instability. We argue
this instability stems from a fundamental conflict: by training a network to
learn only a shortcut across a probability flow, the model loses its grasp on
the instantaneous velocity field that defines the flow. Our solution is to
explicitly anchor the model in the underlying flow during training. We
introduce the Flow-Anchored Consistency Model (FACM), a simple but effective
training strategy that uses a Flow Matching (FM) task as an anchor for the
primary CM shortcut objective. This Flow-Anchoring approach requires no
architectural modifications and is broadly compatible with standard model
architectures. By distilling a pre-trained LightningDiT model, our method
achieves a state-of-the-art FID of 1.32 with two steps (NFE=2) and 1.76 with
just one step (NFE=1) on ImageNet 256x256, significantly outperforming previous
methods. This provides a general and effective recipe for building

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
multimodal reasoning. However, they often excessively rely on textual
information during the later stages of inference, neglecting the crucial
integration of visual input. Current methods typically address this by
explicitly injecting visual information to guide the reasoning process. In this
work, through an analysis of MLLM attention patterns, we made an intriguing
observation: with appropriate guidance, MLLMs can spontaneously re-focus their
attention on visual inputs during the later stages of reasoning, even without
explicit visual information injection. This spontaneous shift in focus suggests
that MLLMs are intrinsically capable of performing visual fusion reasoning.
Building on this insight, we introduce Look-Back, an implicit approach designed
to guide MLLMs to ``look back" at visual information in a self-directed manner
during reasoning. Look-Back empowers the model to autonomously determine when,
where, and how to re-focus on visual inputs, eliminating the need for explicit
model-structure constraints or additional input. We demonstrate that Look-Back
significantly enhances the model's reasoning and perception capabilities, as
evidenced by extensive empirical evaluations on multiple multimodal benchmarks.

Abstract: Hallucination is a long-standing problem that has been actively investigated
in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Existing research commonly attributes
hallucinations to technical limitations or sycophancy bias, where the latter
means the models tend to generate incorrect answers to align with user
expectations. However, these explanations primarily focus on technical or
externally driven factors, may have neglected the possibility that
hallucination behaviours might mirror cognitive biases observed in human
psychology. In this work, we introduce a psychological taxonomy, categorizing
VLMs' hallucination behaviours, including sycophancy, logical inconsistency,
and a newly identified VLMs behaviour: authority bias. To systematically
analyze these behaviours, we design AIpsych, a scalable benchmark that reveals
psychological tendencies in model response patterns. Leveraging this benchmark,
we investigate how variations in model architecture and parameter size
influence model behaviour when responding to strategically manipulated
questions. Our experiments reveal that as model size increases, VLMs exhibit
stronger sycophantic tendencies but reduced authority bias, suggesting
increasing competence but a potential erosion of response integrity. A human
subject study further validates our hypotheses and highlights key behavioural
differences between VLMs and human respondents. This work suggests a new
perspective for understanding hallucination in VLMs and highlights the
importance of integrating psychological principles into model evaluation.The
benchmark is available at https://github.com/lxrswdd/AIpsych.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLM）的数据需求不断增加，但数据质量与噪声对应关系（NC）的引入成为问题，影响模型性能。现有方法需要从头训练，成本高昂。

Method: 提出NCU框架，通过最优传输目标学习最难的负信息，直接消除预训练VLM中NC的有害影响。

Result: 在CLIP模型上验证，NCU在零样本迁移任务中表现优于现有鲁棒预训练方法，且计算开销更低。

Conclusion: NCU为VLM提供了一种高效且低成本的噪声消除方法，显著提升了模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: The data appetite for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has continuously scaled
up from the early millions to billions today, which faces an untenable
trade-off with data quality and inevitably introduces Noisy Correspondence (NC)
samples. Undoubtedly, such semantically unrelated data significantly impairs
the performance of VLMs. Previous efforts mainly address this challenge by
estimating refined alignment for more precise guidance. However, such
resource-intensive pipelines that train VLMs from scratch struggle to meet
realistic data demands. In this paper, we present a brand new perspective that
seeks to directly eliminate the harmful effects of NC in pre-trained VLMs.
Specifically, we propose NCU, a Noisy Correspondence Unlearning fine-tuning
framework that efficiently enhances VLMs' robustness by forgetting learned
noisy knowledge. The key to NCU is learning the hardest negative information,
which can provide explicit unlearning direction for both false positives and
false negatives. Such twin goals unlearning process can be formalized into one
unified optimal transport objective for fast fine-tuning. We validate our
approach with the prevailing CLIP model over various downstream tasks.
Remarkably, NCU surpasses the robust pre-trained method on zero-shot transfer
while with lower computational overhead. The code will be released upon
acceptance.

Result: 在零样本、少样本和测试时适应设置下，D&D方法表现出色。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，能够显著提升CLIP对局部视觉细节的处理能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP achieve cross-modal semantic
alignment through contrastive learning, exhibiting robust zero-shot
generalization. Traditional prompt engineering, however, predominantly relies
on coarse-grained category labels, neglecting fine-grained local semantics.
Existing approaches assume that VLMs inherently recognize localized visual
details and attempt to enhance classification by augmenting text prompts with
attribute descriptors generated by large language models. However, our
systematic experiments reveal critical limitations: CLIP's strong bias toward
global image patterns hinders its ability to process localized visual
descriptors. To address this fundamental constraint, we propose a simple,
effective, and plug-and-play solution that enables CLIP to ``See Both the
Forest and the Trees." Specifically, we employ stochastic multi-crop
augmentation to activate CLIP's latent capacity for localized feature analysis.
By cropping only partial regions, the approach effectively constrains the
model's receptive field and recalibrates its attention mechanism, thereby
mitigating its inherent bias. We evaluate the proposed method under zero-shot,
few-shot, and test-time adaptation settings, and extensive experiments
demonstrate that D&D achieves promising performance.

Abstract: The burgeoning field of generative artificial intelligence has fundamentally
reshaped our approach to content creation, with Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) standing at its forefront. While current LVLMs have demonstrated
impressive capabilities in text-to-image generation, they often falter when
confronted with complex textual descriptions demanding precise compositional
understanding and visual planning. This limitation particularly impacts the
accurate rendering of multiple objects, their attributes, spatial
relationships, and specific poses within intricate scenes, as evidenced by
benchmarks like LongBench-T2I. To address these challenges, we introduce
LVLM-Composer, a novel 10-billion parameter scale LVLM specifically engineered
for enhanced compositional image synthesis. Our method incorporates a
Hierarchical Semantic Planning Module for structured prompt decomposition and a
Fine-Grained Feature Alignment Mechanism for precise visual guidance during
generation. We propose a multi-stage training paradigm, featuring Hierarchical

Learning with Self-Correction, to instill robust compositional reasoning.
Extensive experiments on the LongBench-T2I benchmark, utilizing automatic
evaluation by Gemini-2.0-Flash and InternVL3-78B, demonstrate LVLM-Composer's
superior performance across critical compositional dimensions including object
accuracy, composition fidelity, and pose accuracy, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines. An in-depth ablation study further validates the

Abstract: The feature attribution method reveals the contribution of input variables to
the decision-making process to provide an attribution map for explanation.
Existing methods grounded on the information bottleneck principle compute
information in a specific layer to obtain attributions, compressing the
features by injecting noise via a parametric damping ratio. However, the
attribution obtained in a specific layer neglects evidence of the
decision-making process distributed across layers. In this paper, we introduce
a comprehensive information bottleneck (CoIBA), which discovers the relevant
information in each targeted layer to explain the decision-making process. Our
core idea is applying information bottleneck in multiple targeted layers to
estimate the comprehensive information by sharing a parametric damping ratio
across the layers. Leveraging this shared ratio complements the over-compressed
information to discover the omitted clues of the decision by sharing the
relevant information across the targeted layers. We suggest the variational
approach to fairly reflect the relevant information of each layer by upper
bounding layer-wise information. Therefore, CoIBA guarantees that the discarded
activation is unnecessary in every targeted layer to make a decision. The
extensive experimental results demonstrate the enhancement in faithfulness of
the feature attributions provided by CoIBA.

Abstract: In the broader context of deep learning, Multimodal Large Language Models
have achieved significant breakthroughs by leveraging powerful Large Language
Models as a backbone to align different modalities into the language space. A
prime exemplification is the development of Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs). While numerous advancements have been proposed to enhance the
video understanding capabilities of these models, they are predominantly
trained on questions generated directly from video content. However, in
real-world scenarios, users often pose questions that extend beyond the
informational scope of the video, highlighting the need for Video-LLMs to
assess the relevance of the question. We demonstrate that even the
best-performing Video-LLMs fail to reject unfit questions-not necessarily due
to a lack of video understanding, but because they have not been trained to
identify and refuse such questions. To address this limitation, we propose
alignment for answerability, a framework that equips Video-LLMs with the
ability to evaluate the relevance of a question based on the input video and
appropriately decline to answer when the question exceeds the scope of the
video, as well as an evaluation framework with a comprehensive set of metrics
designed to measure model behavior before and after alignment. Furthermore, we
present a pipeline for creating a dataset specifically tailored for alignment
for answerability, leveraging existing video-description paired datasets.

Conclusion: INTER通过模仿人类的多模态信息处理方式，有效减少了LVLMs的幻觉问题，且无需额外训练或数据。

Abstract: Hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) pose significant
challenges for real-world applications, as LVLMs may generate responses that
appear plausible yet remain inconsistent with the associated visual content.
This issue rarely occurs in human cognition. We argue that this discrepancy
arises from humans' ability to effectively leverage multimodal interaction
information in data samples. Specifically, humans typically first gather
multimodal information, analyze the interactions across modalities for
understanding, and then express their understanding through language. Motivated
by this observation, we conduct extensive experiments on popular LVLMs and
obtained insights that surprisingly reveal human-like, though less pronounced,
cognitive behavior of LVLMs on multimodal samples. Building on these findings,
we further propose \textbf{INTER}: \textbf{Inter}action Guidance Sampling, a
novel training-free algorithm that mitigate hallucinations without requiring
additional data. Specifically, INTER explicitly guides LVLMs to effectively
reapply their understanding of multimodal interaction information when
generating responses, thereby reducing potential hallucinations. On six
benchmarks including VQA and image captioning tasks, INTER achieves an average
improvement of up to 3.4\% on five LVLMs compared to the state-of-the-art
decoding strategy. The code will be released when the paper is accepted.

Conclusion: TS是一种高效且无需额外训练的方法，能够显著提升MLLMs对长视频的理解能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong performance in
video understanding tasks. However, they continue to struggle with long-form
videos because of an inefficient perception of temporal intervals. Unlike
humans, who can dynamically adjust their temporal focus to locate
query-relevant moments, current MLLMs often rely on dense, uniform sampling
across the video timeline, leading to high memory consumption and a risk of
missing crucial information. To address this challenge, we introduce Temporal
Search, a training-free framework that enables MLLMs to explore temporal
regions for improved long video understanding iteratively. TS is based on a key
observation: the model's generation confidence across different temporal
intervals is highly correlated with prediction accuracy. TS operates through
two main iterative stages. First, the MLLM proposes a temporal interval that is
likely to contain task-relevant information. Then, it samples a fixed number of
frames from the interval, regardless of length, and feeds them into the model
to produce a refined response and confidence score. TS refines the focus of the
model by iteratively shifting attention to more fine-grained temporal
intervals, improving its understanding of long videos. Additionally,
keyframe-level descriptions are collected to facilitate cross-interval
perception throughout the video. To further improve efficiency, we introduce
TS-BFS, a best-first search strategy over a tree. Each node represents a
candidate interval and is expanded via two methods: self-driven proposals and
uniform partitioning. Nodes are scored based on confidence and self-evaluation,
and the most promising one is selected for continued exploration.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (vLLMs) have emerged as powerful architectures for
joint reasoning over visual and textual inputs, enabling breakthroughs in image
captioning, cross modal retrieval, and multimodal dialogue. However, as these
models scale to longer video sequences and richer language descriptions, the
quadratic complexity of the standard attention mechanism presents a fundamental
computational bottleneck. This challenge is exacerbated in vLLMs, where
attention must be computed not only within modalities but also across them,
leading to prohibitive memory and latency costs. In this work, we introduce the
Compressed Sensing Attention Transformer (CSAT), a novel architecture that
reimagines attention computation through the lens of compressed sensing. By
projecting high dimensional key and value representations into a
lower-dimensional subspace via random measurement matrices and reconstructing
the attention outputs using sparse recovery algorithms, CSAT significantly
reduces attention complexity while maintaining semantic fidelity. Applied to
vLLMs, CSAT exploits the inherent compressibility of both visual and textual
representations especially evident in video, where temporal redundancy is high,
and in language, where cross-modal grounding is often sparse. In contrast to
LLMs, which must often model entangled symbolic dependencies, vLLMs benefit
from structured sparsity in alignment and scene composition, making them
particularly well-suited to compressed attention. We provide a formal
mathematical treatment of CSAT, demonstrate its integration into vision
language pipelines, and validate its performance on standard benchmarks,
highlighting its promise as a scalable, interpretable, and resource efficient
solution for next generation multimodal transformers.

Abstract: Multimodal learning faces a fundamental tension between deep, fine-grained
fusion and computational scalability. While cross-attention models achieve
strong performance through exhaustive pairwise fusion, their quadratic
complexity is prohibitive for settings with many modalities. We address this
challenge with Gated Recurrent Fusion (GRF), a novel architecture that captures
the power of cross-modal attention within a linearly scalable, recurrent
pipeline. Our method processes modalities sequentially, updating an evolving
multimodal context vector at each step. The core of our approach is a fusion
block built on Transformer Decoder layers that performs symmetric
cross-attention, mutually enriching the shared context and the incoming
modality. This enriched information is then integrated via a Gated Fusion Unit
(GFU) a GRU-inspired mechanism that dynamically arbitrates information flow,
enabling the model to selectively retain or discard features. This stateful,
recurrent design scales linearly with the number of modalities, O(n), making it
ideal for high-modality environments. Experiments on the CMU-MOSI benchmark
demonstrate that GRF achieves competitive performance compared to more complex
baselines. Visualizations of the embedding space further illustrate that GRF
creates structured, class-separable representations through its progressive
fusion mechanism. Our work presents a robust and efficient paradigm for
powerful, scalable multimodal representation learning.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly adopt multiple vision
encoders to capture diverse visual information, ranging from coarse semantics
to fine grained details. While this approach is intended to enhance visual
understanding capability, we observe that the performance gains from adding
encoders often diminish and can even lead to performance degradation, a
phenomenon we term encoder redundancy. This paper presents a systematic
investigation into this issue. Through comprehensive ablation studies on state
of the art multi encoder MLLMs, we empirically demonstrate that significant
redundancy exists. To quantify each encoder's unique contribution, we propose a
principled metric: the Conditional Utilization Rate (CUR). Building on CUR, we
introduce the Information Gap (IG) to capture the overall disparity in encoder
utility within a model.Our experiments reveal that certain vision encoders
contribute little, or even negatively, to overall performance, confirming
substantial redundancy. Our experiments reveal that certain vision encoders
contribute minimally, or even negatively, to the model's performance,
confirming the prevalence of redundancy. These findings highlight critical
inefficiencies in current multi encoder designs and establish that our proposed
metrics can serve as valuable diagnostic tools for developing more efficient
and effective multimodal architectures.

Abstract: The global demand for radiologists is increasing rapidly due to a growing
reliance on medical imaging services, while the supply of radiologists is not
keeping pace. Advances in computer vision and image processing technologies
present significant potential to address this gap by enhancing radiologists'
capabilities and improving diagnostic accuracy. Large language models (LLMs),
particularly generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs), have become the
primary approach for understanding and generating textual data. In parallel,
vision transformers (ViTs) have proven effective at converting visual data into
a format that LLMs can process efficiently. In this paper, we present ChestGPT,
a deep-learning framework that integrates the EVA ViT with the Llama 2 LLM to
classify diseases and localize regions of interest in chest X-ray images. The
ViT converts X-ray images into tokens, which are then fed, together with
engineered prompts, into the LLM, enabling joint classification and
localization of diseases. This approach incorporates transfer learning
techniques to enhance both explainability and performance. The proposed method
achieved strong global disease classification performance on the VinDr-CXR
dataset, with an F1 score of 0.76, and successfully localized pathologies by
generating bounding boxes around the regions of interest. We also outline
several task-specific prompts, in addition to general-purpose prompts, for

assistive tool that can lighten radiologists' workload by providing preliminary
findings and regions of interest to facilitate their diagnostic process.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated superior performance over
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in various vision-related tasks such as
classification, object detection, and segmentation due to their use of
self-attention mechanisms. As ViTs become more popular in safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, ensuring their correct functionality
becomes essential, especially in the presence of bit-flip faults in their
parameters stored in memory. In this paper, a fault tolerance technique is
introduced to protect ViT parameters against bit-flip faults with zero memory
overhead. Since the least significant bits of parameters are not critical for
model accuracy, replacing the LSB with a parity bit provides an error detection
mechanism without imposing any overhead on the model. When faults are detected,
affected parameters are masked by zeroing out, as most parameters in ViT models
are near zero, effectively preventing accuracy degradation. This approach
enhances reliability across ViT models, improving the robustness of parameters
to bit-flips by up to three orders of magnitude, making it an effective
zero-overhead solution for fault tolerance in critical applications.

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR和IU X-Ray数据集上，OTDRG在自然语言生成和临床效能指标上达到最优。

Abstract: Radiology report generation represents a significant application within
medical AI, and has achieved impressive results. Concurrently, large language
models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various domains.
However, empirical validation indicates that general LLMs tend to focus more on
linguistic fluency rather than clinical effectiveness, and lack the ability to
effectively capture the relationship between X-ray images and their
corresponding texts, thus resulting in poor clinical practicability. To address
these challenges, we propose Optimal Transport-Driven Radiology Report
Generation (OTDRG), a novel framework that leverages Optimal Transport (OT) to
align image features with disease labels extracted from reports, effectively
bridging the cross-modal gap. The core component of OTDRG is Alignment \&
Fine-Tuning, where OT utilizes results from the encoding of label features and
image visual features to minimize cross-modal distances, then integrating image
and text features for LLMs fine-tuning. Additionally, we design a novel disease
prediction module to predict disease labels contained in X-ray images during
validation and testing. Evaluated on the MIMIC-CXR and IU X-Ray datasets, OTDRG
achieves state-of-the-art performance in both natural language generation (NLG)
and clinical efficacy (CE) metrics, delivering reports that are not only
linguistically coherent but also clinically accurate.

Abstract: Effective Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is criti-cal for ensuring the
reliability of semantic segmentation models, particularly in complex road
environments where safety and accuracy are paramount. Despite recent
advancements in large language models (LLMs), notably GPT-4, which
significantly enhanced multimodal reasoning through Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting, the application of CoT-based visual reasoning for OOD semantic
segmentation remains largely unexplored. In this paper, through extensive
analyses of the road scene anomalies, we identify three challenging scenarios
where current state-of-the-art OOD segmentation methods consistently struggle:
(1) densely packed and overlapping objects, (2) distant scenes with small
objects, and (3) large foreground-dominant objects. To address the presented
challenges, we propose a novel CoT-based framework targeting OOD detection in
road anomaly scenes. Our method leverages the extensive knowledge and reasoning
capabilities of foundation models, such as GPT-4, to enhance OOD detection
through improved image understanding and prompt-based reasoning aligned with
observed problematic scene attributes. Extensive experiments show that our
framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both standard
benchmarks and our newly defined challenging subset of the RoadAnomaly dataset,
offering a robust and interpretable solution for OOD semantic segmentation in
complex driving environments.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) recently showed strong capacity in
integrating data among multiple modalities, empowered by a generalizable
attention architecture. Advanced methods predominantly focus on
language-centric tuning while less exploring multimodal tokens mixed through
attention, posing challenges in high-level tasks that require fine-grained
cognition and emotion understanding. In this work, we identify the attention
deficit disorder problem in multimodal learning, caused by inconsistent
cross-modal attention and layer-by-layer decayed attention activation. To
address this, we propose a novel attention mechanism, termed MOdular Duplex
Attention (MODA), simultaneously conducting the inner-modal refinement and
inter-modal interaction. MODA employs a correct-after-align strategy to
effectively decouple modality alignment from cross-layer token mixing. In the
alignment phase, tokens are mapped to duplex modality spaces based on the basis
vectors, enabling the interaction between visual and language modality.
Further, the correctness of attention scores is ensured through adaptive masked
attention, which enhances the model's flexibility by allowing customizable
masking patterns for different modalities. Extensive experiments on 21
benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of MODA in perception, cognition,
and emotion tasks. Source code and demo are available in

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) often struggle with compositional reasoning due
to insufficient high-quality image-text data. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a novel block-based diffusion approach that automatically generates
counterfactual datasets without manual annotation. Our method utilizes large
language models to identify entities and their spatial relationships. It then
independently generates image blocks as "puzzle pieces" coherently arranged
according to specified compositional rules. This process creates diverse,
high-fidelity counterfactual image-text pairs with precisely controlled
variations. In addition, we introduce a specialized loss function that
differentiates inter-set from intra-set samples, enhancing training efficiency
and reducing the need for negative samples. Experiments demonstrate that
fine-tuning VLMs with our counterfactual datasets significantly improves visual
reasoning performance. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results across
multiple benchmarks while using substantially less training data than existing
methods.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
advances in visual understanding tasks involving both images and videos.
However, their capacity to comprehend human-centric video data remains
underexplored, primarily due to the absence of comprehensive and high-quality
evaluation benchmarks. Existing human-centric benchmarks predominantly
emphasize video generation quality and action recognition, while overlooking
essential perceptual and cognitive abilities required in human-centered
scenarios. Furthermore, they are often limited by single-question paradigms and
overly simplistic evaluation metrics. To address above limitations, we propose
a modern HV-MMBench, a rigorously curated benchmark designed to provide a more
holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric video understanding. Compared to
existing human-centric video benchmarks, our work offers the following key
features: (1) Diverse evaluation dimensions: HV-MMBench encompasses 15 tasks,
ranging from basic attribute perception (e.g., age estimation, emotion
recognition) to advanced cognitive reasoning (e.g., social relationship
prediction, intention prediction), enabling comprehensive assessment of model
capabilities; (2) Varied data types: The benchmark includes multiple-choice,
fill-in-blank, true/false, and open-ended question formats, combined with
diverse evaluation metrics, to more accurately and robustly reflect model
performance; (3) Multi-domain video coverage: The benchmark spans 50 distinct
visual scenarios, enabling comprehensive evaluation across fine-grained scene
variations; (4) Temporal coverage: The benchmark covers videos from short-term

Abstract: Despite the significant recent progress of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), MLLMs still struggle to correctly answer prompts that require a
holistic spatio-temporal understanding. Specifically, it is challenging to
address prompts that refer to 1) the entirety of an environment that an agent
equipped with an MLLM can operate in; and simultaneously also refer to 2)
recent actions that just happened and are encoded in a video clip. However,
such a holistic spatio-temporal understanding is important for agents operating
in the real world. To address this issue, we first develop a framework to
collect a large-scale dataset. Using the collected "Reasoning about
Environments and Actions" (REA) dataset, we show that recent methods indeed
struggle to correctly answer the prompts. To improve, we develop a
"spatio-temporal LLM" (ST-LLM), a model equipped with projectors to improve
both spatial understanding of an environment and temporal understanding of
recent observations. On the collected REA data, we show that the proposed
method significantly improves results compared to prior work. Code and data are

Conclusion: 提出的LLM增强框架通过图表示显著提升了医学影像VQA的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Visual question answering (VQA) in medical imaging aims to support clinical
diagnosis by automatically interpreting complex imaging data in response to
natural language queries. Existing studies typically rely on distinct visual
and textual encoders to independently extract features from medical images and
clinical questions, which are subsequently combined to generate answers.
Specifically, in computed tomography (CT), such approaches are similar to the
conventional practices in medical image analysis. However, these approaches pay
less attention to the spatial continuity and inter-slice correlations in the
volumetric CT data, leading to fragmented and imprecise responses. In this
paper, we propose a novel large language model (LLM)-based framework enhanced
by a graph representation of salient features. Different from conventional
multimodal encoding strategies, our approach constructs a cross-modal graph
integrating both visual and textual features, treating individual CT slices and
question tokens as nodes within the graph. We further leverage an attentive
graph convolutional network to dynamically fuse information within this
structure. The resulting aggregated graph features then serve as a soft prompt
to guide a large language model in generating accurate answers. Extensive
experiments on the M3D-VQA benchmark demonstrate that our approach consistently
outperforms baselines across multiple evaluation metrics, offering more robust
reasoning capabilities.

videos, focusing mainly on tennis videos. Despite research done on tennis
analysis, there remains a gap in models that are able to understand and
identify the sequence of events in a tennis rally, which would be useful in
other fields of sports analytics. As such, we will mainly assess the MLLMs on
their ability to fill this gap - to classify tennis actions, as well as their
ability to identify these actions in a sequence of tennis actions in a rally.
We further looked into ways we can improve the MLLMs' performance, including
different training methods and even using them together with other traditional
models.

Conclusion: 概念对抗攻击框架在多样性和效率上优于传统方法，为对抗攻击研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: We propose a concept-based adversarial attack framework that extends beyond
single-image perturbations by adopting a probabilistic perspective. Rather than
modifying a single image, our method operates on an entire concept --
represented by a probabilistic generative model or a set of images -- to
generate diverse adversarial examples. Preserving the concept is essential, as
it ensures that the resulting adversarial images remain identifiable as
instances of the original underlying category or identity. By sampling from
this concept-based adversarial distribution, we generate images that maintain
the original concept but vary in pose, viewpoint, or background, thereby
misleading the classifier. Mathematically, this framework remains consistent
with traditional adversarial attacks in a principled manner. Our theoretical
and empirical results demonstrate that concept-based adversarial attacks yield
more diverse adversarial examples and effectively preserve the underlying
concept, while achieving higher attack efficiency.

Abstract: Humans naturally possess the spatial reasoning ability to form and manipulate
images and structures of objects in space. There is an increasing effort to
endow Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with similar spatial reasoning
capabilities. However, it remains unclear whether these models truly understand
and manipulate spatial objects or not. To address this question, we propose a
new evaluation framework aimed at assessing the performance of VLMs in spatial
deformation reasoning tasks. Specifically, we construct a benchmark for spatial
deformation reasoning from 2D to 3D. Leveraging our data engine, we can
generate unlimited evaluation problem pairs with infinite steps, without any
data leakage. We explore whether the model can effectively perform spatial
deformation reasoning from two directions: forward reasoning (given the
operations, find the final state) and reverse reasoning (given the final state,
determine the operations). We adopt a ladder competition format, using the
number of deformation steps as the level classification criterion, with the
goal of exploring the boundaries of the model's deformation reasoning
capabilities. Interestingly, the benchmarking results reveal that almost no
model demonstrates plausible spatial deformation reasoning abilities.
Furthermore, even after applying targeted training and mainstream reasoning
enhancement methods, the models are still unable to perform well on 3D spatial
deformation reasoning.

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MUL) refers to the problem of making a pre-trained model
selectively forget some training instances or class(es) while retaining
performance on the remaining dataset. Existing MUL research involves
fine-tuning using a forget and/or retain set, making it expensive and/or
impractical, and often causing performance degradation in the unlearned model.
We introduce {\pname}, an unlearning-aware vision transformer-based
architecture that can directly perform unlearning for future unlearning
requests without any fine-tuning over the requested set. The proposed model is
trained by simulating unlearning during the training process itself. It
involves randomly separating class(es)/sub-class(es) present in each mini-batch
into two disjoint sets: a proxy forget-set and a retain-set, and the model is
optimized so that it is unable to predict the forget-set. Forgetting is
achieved by withdrawing keys, making unlearning on-the-fly and avoiding
performance degradation. The model is trained jointly with learnable keys and
original weights, ensuring withholding a key irreversibly erases information,
validated by membership inference attack scores. Extensive experiments on
various datasets, architectures, and resolutions confirm {\pname}'s superiority
over both fine-tuning-free and fine-tuning-based methods.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is a fundamental task in computational

While recent works have explored Large Language Models (LLMs) for this task,
they primarily rely on textual molecular representations such as
SMILES/SELFIES, which can be ambiguous and structurally less informative. In

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by integrating both molecular structure as images
and textual descriptions to enhance property prediction. We construct a
benchmark spanning ten diverse datasets, covering classification, regression
and description tasks. Evaluating nine different VLMs in zero-shot, few-shot,
and fine-tuned settings, we find that visual information improves prediction
performance, particularly when combined with efficient fine-tuning strategies
such as LoRA. Our results reveal that while visual information alone is
insufficient, multimodal fusion significantly enhances generalization across
molecular properties. Adaptation of vision encoder for molecular images in
conjunction with LoRA further improves the performance. The code and data is

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) aims to enhance model robustness in unseen or
distributionally shifted target domains through training exclusively on source
domains. Although existing DG techniques, such as data manipulation, learning
strategies, and representation learning, have shown significant progress, they
predominantly address single-modal data. With the emergence of numerous
multi-modal datasets and increasing demand for multi-modal tasks, a key
challenge in Multi-modal Domain Generalization (MMDG) has emerged: enabling
models trained on multi-modal sources to generalize to unseen target
distributions within the same modality set. Due to the inherent differences
between modalities, directly transferring methods from single-modal DG to MMDG
typically yields sub-optimal results. These methods often exhibit randomness
during generalization due to the invisibility of target domains and fail to
consider inter-modal consistency. Applying these methods independently to each
modality in the MMDG setting before combining them can lead to divergent
generalization directions across different modalities, resulting in degraded
generalization capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
approach that leverages Unified Representations to map different paired
modalities together, effectively adapting DG methods to MMDG by enabling
synchronized multi-modal improvements within the unified space. Additionally,
we introduce a supervised disentanglement framework that separates
modal-general and modal-specific information, further enhancing the alignment
of unified representations. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets,
including EPIC-Kitchens and Human-Animal-Cartoon, demonstrate the effectiveness
and superiority of our method in enhancing multi-modal domain generalization.

In this paper, we introduce MIMO (Mirror In-the-Model), an agentic refinement
framework for automatic ad banner generation. MIMO combines a hierarchical
multi-modal agent system (MIMO-Core) with a coordination loop (MIMO-Loop) that
explores multiple stylistic directions and iteratively improves design quality.
Requiring only a simple natural language based prompt and logo image as input,
MIMO automatically detects and corrects multiple types of errors during
generation. Experiments show that MIMO significantly outperforms existing

Motivation: 探讨通用基础模型与领域特定模型在人脸识别任务中的性能差异及融合潜力。

Method: 通过实验比较多种基础模型和领域特定模型在多个数据集上的表现，并尝试模型融合。

Result: 领域特定模型在零样本任务中表现更优；通用模型在上下文丰富的图像中性能提升；模型融合显著提升低FMR下的准确率。

Conclusion: 结合领域特定模型与通用基础模型能提升人脸识别性能，并为解释性提供支持。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the following question: How do generic foundation
models (e.g., CLIP, BLIP, LLaVa, DINO) compare against a domain-specific face
recognition model (viz., AdaFace or ArcFace) on the face recognition task?
Through a series of experiments involving several foundation models and
benchmark datasets, we are able to report the following findings: (a) In all
datasets considered, domain-specific models outperformed zero-shot foundation
models. (b) The performance of zero-shot generic foundation models improves on
over-segmented face images than tightly cropped faces thereby suggesting the
importance of contextual clues. For example, at a False Match Rate (FMR) of
0.01%, the True Match Rate (TMR) of OpenCLIP improved from 64.97% to 81.73% on
the LFW dataset as the face crop increased from 112x112 to 250x250 while the
TMR of domain-specific AdaFace dropped from 99.09% to 77.31%. (c) A simple
score-level fusion of a foundation model with a domain-specific FR model
improved the accuracy at low FMRs. For example, the TMR of AdaFace when fused
with BLIP improved from 72.64% to 83.31% at an FMR of 0.0001% on the IJB-B
dataset and from 73.17% to 85.81% on the IJB-C dataset. (d) Foundation models,
such as ChatGPT, can be used to impart explainability to the FR pipeline (e.g.,
``Despite minor lighting and head tilt differences, the two left-profile images
show high consistency in forehead slope, nose shape, chin contour...''). In
some instances, foundation models are even able to resolve low-confidence
decisions made by AdaFace (e.g., ``Although AdaFace assigns a low similarity
score of 0.21, both images exhibit visual similarity...and the pair is likely
of the same person''), thereby reiterating the importance of combining
domain-specific FR models with generic foundation models in a judicious manner.

Result: 揭示了不同描述符生成策略与基础模型特性的相互作用，提供了超越准确性评估的研究方法。

Conclusion: 对齐指标为研究描述符有效性提供了新视角，有助于理解VLM中描述符的作用。

Abstract: Text-based visual descriptors-ranging from simple class names to more
descriptive phrases-are widely used in visual concept discovery and image
classification with vision-language models (VLMs). Their effectiveness,
however, depends on a complex interplay of factors, including semantic clarity,
presence in the VLM's pre-training data, and how well the descriptors serve as
a meaningful representation space. In this work, we systematically analyze
descriptor quality along two key dimensions: (1) representational capacity, and
(2) relationship with VLM pre-training data. We evaluate a spectrum of
descriptor generation methods, from zero-shot LLM-generated prompts to
iteratively refined descriptors. Motivated by ideas from representation
alignment and language understanding, we introduce two alignment-based
metrics-Global Alignment and CLIP Similarity-that move beyond accuracy. These
metrics allow us to shed light on how different descriptor generation
strategies interact with foundation model properties, offering insights into
ways of studying descriptor effectiveness beyond accuracy evaluations.

Conclusion: ViFMs在科学应用中具有潜力，但需进一步开发更具通用性的模型。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a proliferation of spatiotemporal foundation
models in different scientific disciplines. While promising, these models are
often domain-specific and are only assessed within the particular applications
for which they are designed. Given that many tasks can be represented as video
modeling problems, video foundation models (ViFMs) hold considerable promise as
general-purpose domain-agnostic approaches. However, it is not known whether
the knowledge acquired on large-scale but potentially out-of-domain data can be
effectively transferred across diverse scientific disciplines, and if a single,
pretrained ViFM can be competitive with domain-specific baselines. To address
this, we introduce SciVid, a comprehensive benchmark comprising five
*Sci*entific *Vid*eo tasks, across medical computer vision, animal behavior,
and weather forecasting. We adapt six leading ViFMs to SciVid using simple
trainable readout modules, establishing strong baselines and demonstrating the
potential for effective transfer learning. Specifically, we show that
state-of-the-art results can be obtained in several applications by leveraging
the general-purpose representations from ViFM backbones. Furthermore, our
results reveal the limitations of existing ViFMs, and highlight opportunities
for the development of generalizable models for high-impact scientific
applications. We release our code at https://github.com/google-deepmind/scivid
to facilitate further research in the development of ViFMs.

Conclusion: Causal-SAM-LLM为构建鲁棒、高效且交互可控的医学AI系统提供了新方向。

Abstract: The clinical utility of deep learning models for medical image segmentation
is severely constrained by their inability to generalize to unseen domains.
This failure is often rooted in the models learning spurious correlations
between anatomical content and domain-specific imaging styles. To overcome this
fundamental challenge, we introduce Causal-SAM-LLM, a novel framework that
elevates Large Language Models (LLMs) to the role of causal reasoners. Our
framework, built upon a frozen Segment Anything Model (SAM) encoder,
incorporates two synergistic innovations. First, Linguistic Adversarial
Disentanglement (LAD) employs a Vision-Language Model to generate rich, textual
descriptions of confounding image styles. By training the segmentation model's
features to be contrastively dissimilar to these style descriptions, it learns
a representation robustly purged of non-causal information. Second, Test-Time
Causal Intervention (TCI) provides an interactive mechanism where an LLM
interprets a clinician's natural language command to modulate the segmentation
decoder's features in real-time, enabling targeted error correction. We conduct
an extensive empirical evaluation on a composite benchmark from four public
datasets (BTCV, CHAOS, AMOS, BraTS), assessing generalization under
cross-scanner, cross-modality, and cross-anatomy settings. Causal-SAM-LLM
establishes a new state of the art in out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness,
improving the average Dice score by up to 6.2 points and reducing the Hausdorff
Distance by 15.8 mm over the strongest baseline, all while using less than 9%
of the full model's trainable parameters. Our work charts a new course for
building robust, efficient, and interactively controllable medical AI systems.

Result: 在合成和真实手语数据集上表现优于传统方法，显著提升了识别准确性和句子流畅性。

Conclusion: LLMs在手语识别中具有巨大潜力，无需微调即可显著提升性能。

Abstract: Sign spotting, the task of identifying and localizing individual signs within
continuous sign language video, plays a pivotal role in scaling dataset
annotations and addressing the severe data scarcity issue in sign language
translation. While automatic sign spotting holds great promise for enabling
frame-level supervision at scale, it grapples with challenges such as
vocabulary inflexibility and ambiguity inherent in continuous sign streams.
Hence, we introduce a novel, training-free framework that integrates Large
Language Models (LLMs) to significantly enhance sign spotting quality. Our
approach extracts global spatio-temporal and hand shape features, which are
then matched against a large-scale sign dictionary using dynamic time warping
and cosine similarity. This dictionary-based matching inherently offers
superior vocabulary flexibility without requiring model retraining. To mitigate
noise and ambiguity from the matching process, an LLM performs context-aware
gloss disambiguation via beam search, notably without fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world sign language datasets demonstrate
our method's superior accuracy and sentence fluency compared to traditional
approaches, highlighting the potential of LLMs in advancing sign spotting.

Conclusion: StreamDiT为实时视频生成（如流式生成、交互生成）提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, great progress has been achieved in text-to-video (T2V) generation
by scaling transformer-based diffusion models to billions of parameters, which
can generate high-quality videos. However, existing models typically produce
only short clips offline, restricting their use cases in interactive and
real-time applications. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing
StreamDiT, a streaming video generation model. StreamDiT training is based on
flow matching by adding a moving buffer. We design mixed training with
different partitioning schemes of buffered frames to boost both content
consistency and visual quality. StreamDiT modeling is based on adaLN DiT with
varying time embedding and window attention. To practice the proposed method,
we train a StreamDiT model with 4B parameters. In addition, we propose a
multistep distillation method tailored for StreamDiT. Sampling distillation is
performed in each segment of a chosen partitioning scheme. After distillation,
the total number of function evaluations (NFEs) is reduced to the number of
chunks in a buffer. Finally, our distilled model reaches real-time performance
at 16 FPS on one GPU, which can generate video streams at 512p resolution. We
evaluate our method through both quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Our
model enables real-time applications, e.g. streaming generation, interactive
generation, and video-to-video. We provide video results and more examples in

Motivation: 大规模视觉基础模型（如DINOv2）需要高计算资源，限制了其在私有数据或新模态上的应用。本文旨在降低预训练的计算需求，同时提升模型鲁棒性。

Method: 采用频率过滤课程（低频优先）和高斯噪声补丁增强策略，优化ViT-B/16在ImageNet-1K上的预训练。

Result: 预训练时间和FLOPs分别减少1.6倍和2.25倍，同时在ImageNet-C上保持与基线相当的鲁棒性，线性探测性能仍具竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法在效率和鲁棒性上取得双重优势，为大规模自监督基础模型提供了更可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale vision foundation models such as DINOv2 boast impressive
performances by leveraging massive architectures and training datasets. But
numerous scenarios require practitioners to reproduce those pre-training
solutions, such as on private data, new modalities, or simply for scientific
questioning--which is currently extremely demanding computation-wise. We thus
propose a novel pre-training strategy for DINOv2 that simultaneously
accelerates convergence--and strengthens robustness to common corruptions as a
by-product. Our approach involves a frequency filtering
curriculum--low-frequency being seen first--and the Gaussian noise patching
augmentation. Applied to a ViT-B/16 backbone trained on ImageNet-1K, while
pre-training time and FLOPs are reduced by 1.6x and 2.25x, our method still
achieves matching robustness in corruption benchmarks (ImageNet-C) and
maintains competitive linear probing performance compared with baseline. This
dual benefit of efficiency and robustness makes large-scale self-supervised
foundation modeling more attainable, while opening the door to novel
exploration around data curriculum and augmentation as means to improve
self-supervised learning models robustness. The code is available at

Result: 在CIFAR-10等基准测试中，GSTDS计算需求减少4倍，性能不降反升，优于JEST等方法。

Conclusion: 谱数据选择是一种可扩展的高效深度学习解决方案，值得进一步探索。

Abstract: Effective data curation is essential for optimizing neural network training.
In this paper, we present the Guided Spectrally Tuned Data Selection (GSTDS)
algorithm, which dynamically adjusts the subset of data points used for
training using an off-the-shelf pre-trained reference model. Based on a
pre-scheduled filtering ratio, GSTDS effectively reduces the number of data
points processed per batch. The proposed method ensures an efficient selection
of the most informative data points for training while avoiding redundant or
less beneficial computations. Preserving data points in each batch is performed
based on spectral analysis. A Fiedler vector-based scoring mechanism removes
the filtered portion of the batch, lightening the resource requirements of the
learning. The proposed data selection approach not only streamlines the
training process but also promotes improved generalization and accuracy.
Extensive experiments on standard image classification benchmarks, including
CIFAR-10, Oxford-IIIT Pet, and Oxford-Flowers, demonstrate that GSTDS
outperforms standard training scenarios and JEST, a recent state-of-the-art
data curation method, on several key factors. It is shown that GSTDS achieves
notable reductions in computational requirements, up to four times, without
compromising performance. GSTDS exhibits a considerable growth in terms of
accuracy under the limited computational resource usage, in contrast to other
methodologies. These promising results underscore the potential of
spectral-based data selection as a scalable solution for resource-efficient
deep learning and motivate further exploration into adaptive data curation
strategies. You can find the code at https://github.com/rezasharifi82/GSTDS.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of artificial intelligence (AI) in multi-modal
understanding, there is increasing potential for video comprehension
technologies to support professional domains such as medical education.
However, existing benchmarks suffer from two primary limitations: (1)
Linguistic Singularity: they are largely confined to English, neglecting the
need for multilingual resources; and (2) Shallow Reasoning: their questions are
often designed for surface-level information retrieval, failing to properly
assess deep multi-modal integration. To address these limitations, we present
M3-Med, the first benchmark for Multi-lingual, Multi-modal, and Multi-hop
reasoning in Medical instructional video understanding. M3-Med consists of
medical questions paired with corresponding video segments, annotated by a team
of medical experts. A key innovation of M3-Med is its multi-hop reasoning task,
which requires a model to first locate a key entity in the text, then find
corresponding visual evidence in the video, and finally synthesize information
across both modalities to derive the answer. This design moves beyond simple
text matching and poses a substantial challenge to a model's deep cross-modal
understanding capabilities. We define two tasks: Temporal Answer Grounding in
Single Video (TAGSV) and Temporal Answer Grounding in Video Corpus (TAGVC). We
evaluated several state-of-the-art models and Large Language Models (LLMs) on
M3-Med. The results reveal a significant performance gap between all models and
human experts, especially on the complex multi-hop questions where model
performance drops sharply. M3-Med effectively highlights the current
limitations of AI models in deep cross-modal reasoning within specialized
domains and provides a new direction for future research.

Conclusion: FA通过ID知识优化OOD检测，展示了高效性和普适性。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced out-of-distribution
(OOD) detection recently. However, existing CLIP-based methods often focus on
learning OOD-related knowledge to improve OOD detection, showing limited
generalization or reliance on external large-scale auxiliary datasets. In this
study, instead of delving into the intricate OOD-related knowledge, we propose
an innovative CLIP-based framework based on Forced prompt leArning (FA),
designed to make full use of the In-Distribution (ID) knowledge and ultimately
boost the effectiveness of OOD detection. Our key insight is to learn a prompt
(i.e., forced prompt) that contains more diversified and richer descriptions of
the ID classes beyond the textual semantics of class labels. Specifically, it
promotes better discernment for ID images, by forcing more notable semantic
similarity between ID images and the learnable forced prompt. Moreover, we
introduce a forced coefficient, encouraging the forced prompt to learn more
comprehensive and nuanced descriptions of the ID classes. In this way, FA is
capable of achieving notable improvements in OOD detection, even when trained
without any external auxiliary datasets, while maintaining an identical number
of trainable parameters as CoOp. Extensive empirical evaluations confirm our
method consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. Code is

Conclusion: 该框架通过简单而鲁棒的机制，有效解决了空间和时间特征的权衡问题，为身份保持的视频生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Identity-preserving text-to-video (IPT2V) generation, which aims to create
high-fidelity videos with consistent human identity, has become crucial for
downstream applications. However, current end-to-end frameworks suffer a
critical spatial-temporal trade-off: optimizing for spatially coherent layouts
of key elements (e.g., character identity preservation) often compromises
instruction-compliant temporal smoothness, while prioritizing dynamic realism
risks disrupting the spatial coherence of visual structures. To tackle this
issue, we propose a simple yet effective spatial-temporal decoupled framework
that decomposes representations into spatial features for layouts and temporal
features for motion dynamics. Specifically, our paper proposes a semantic
prompt optimization mechanism and stage-wise decoupled generation paradigm. The
former module decouples the prompt into spatial and temporal components.
Aligned with the subsequent stage-wise decoupled approach, the spatial prompts
guide the text-to-image (T2I) stage to generate coherent spatial features,
while the temporal prompts direct the sequential image-to-video (I2V) stage to
ensure motion consistency. Experimental results validate that our approach
achieves excellent spatiotemporal consistency, demonstrating outstanding
performance in identity preservation, text relevance, and video quality. By
leveraging this simple yet robust mechanism, our algorithm secures the
runner-up position in 2025 ACM MultiMedia Challenge.

attention. It comprises three novel tasks for evaluating the perceptual
capabilities of LVLM: Odd-One-Out Detection, Referring Odd-One-Out, and Visual
Referring Odd-One-Out. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art LVLM using SalBench and our findings reveal a surprising

prominent models such as scale-wise visual auto-regression pushing the
boundaries of visual synthesis. However, these developments also raise
significant concerns regarding data privacy and copyright. In response,
training data detection has emerged as a critical task for identifying
unauthorized data usage in model training. To better understand the
vulnerability of autoregressive image generative models to such detection, we
conduct the first study applying membership inference to this domain. Our
approach comprises two key components: implicit classification and an adaptive
score aggregation strategy. First, we compute the implicit token-wise
classification score within the query image. Then we propose an adaptive score
aggregation strategy to acquire a final score, which places greater emphasis on
the tokens with lower scores. A higher final score indicates that the sample is
more likely to be involved in the training set. To validate the effectiveness
of our method, we adapt existing detection algorithms originally designed for
LLMs to visual autoregressive models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our method in both class-conditional and text-to-image
scenarios. Moreover, our approach exhibits strong robustness and generalization
under various data transformations. Furthermore, sufficient experiments suggest
two novel key findings: (1) A linear scaling law on membership inference,
exposing the vulnerability of large foundation models. (2) Training data from
scale-wise visual autoregressive models is easier to detect than other
autoregressive paradigms.Our code is available at

Abstract: Recent large-scale Vision Language Action (VLA) models have shown superior
performance in robotic manipulation tasks guided by natural language. However,
their generalization remains limited when applied to novel objects or
unfamiliar environments that lie outside the training distribution. To address
this, many existing approaches integrate additional components such as depth
estimation, segmentation, or even diffusion to improve generalization, at the
cost of adding significant computation overhead, resulting in low efficiency.
This motivates the exploration of efficient action prediction methods, which
are independent of additional high-level visual representations or diffusion
techniques. In this work, we propose VOTE, an efficient and general framework
for the optimization and acceleration of VLA models. In details, we propose a
novel tokenizer-free fine-tuning approach for parallel accurate action
prediction, which reduces computational overhead and accelerates inference
speed. Additionally, we adopt an ensemble voting strategy for the action
sampling, which significantly improves model performance and enhances
generalization. Experimental results show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance with 35$\times$ faster inference and 145 Hz
throughput. All the details and codes will be open-sourced.

Conclusion: StreamVLN通过慢快设计支持长视频流的多轮对话，同时保持有限的上下文大小和推理成本。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) in real-world settings requires agents
to process continuous visual streams and generate actions with low latency
grounded in language instructions. While Video-based Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs) have driven recent progress, current VLN methods based on
Video-LLM often face trade-offs among fine-grained visual understanding,
long-term context modeling and computational efficiency. We introduce
StreamVLN, a streaming VLN framework that employs a hybrid slow-fast context
modeling strategy to support multi-modal reasoning over interleaved vision,
language and action inputs. The fast-streaming dialogue context facilitates
responsive action generation through a sliding-window of active dialogues,
while the slow-updating memory context compresses historical visual states
using a 3D-aware token pruning strategy. With this slow-fast design, StreamVLN
achieves coherent multi-turn dialogue through efficient KV cache reuse,
supporting long video streams with bounded context size and inference cost.
Experiments on VLN-CE benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with
stable low latency, ensuring robustness and efficiency in real-world
deployment. The project page is:

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown promise in
integrating image generation with action prediction to improve generalization
and reasoning in robot manipulation. However, existing methods are limited to
challenging image-based forecasting, which suffers from redundant information
and lacks comprehensive and critical world knowledge, including dynamic,
spatial and semantic information. To address these limitations, we propose
DreamVLA, a novel VLA framework that integrates comprehensive world knowledge
forecasting to enable inverse dynamics modeling, thereby establishing a
perception-prediction-action loop for manipulation tasks. Specifically,
DreamVLA introduces a dynamic-region-guided world knowledge prediction,
integrated with the spatial and semantic cues, which provide compact yet
comprehensive representations for action planning. This design aligns with how
humans interact with the world by first forming abstract multimodal reasoning
chains before acting. To mitigate interference among the dynamic, spatial and
semantic information during training, we adopt a block-wise structured
attention mechanism that masks their mutual attention, preventing information
leakage and keeping each representation clean and disentangled. Moreover, to
model the conditional distribution over future actions, we employ a
diffusion-based transformer that disentangles action representations from
shared latent features. Extensive experiments on both real-world and simulation
environments demonstrate that DreamVLA achieves 76.7% success rate on real
robot tasks and 4.44 average length on the CALVIN ABC-D benchmarks.

Result: QR-LoRA在内容-风格融合任务中实现更好的解耦效果，参数仅为传统LoRA的一半。

Conclusion: QR-LoRA为生成模型提供了一种参数高效且解耦的微调新范式。

Abstract: Existing text-to-image models often rely on parameter fine-tuning techniques
such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to customize visual attributes. However,
when combining multiple LoRA models for content-style fusion tasks,
unstructured modifications of weight matrices often lead to undesired feature
entanglement between content and style attributes. We propose QR-LoRA, a novel
fine-tuning framework leveraging QR decomposition for structured parameter
updates that effectively separate visual attributes. Our key insight is that
the orthogonal Q matrix naturally minimizes interference between different
visual features, while the upper triangular R matrix efficiently encodes
attribute-specific transformations. Our approach fixes both Q and R matrices
while only training an additional task-specific $\Delta R$ matrix. This
structured design reduces trainable parameters to half of conventional LoRA
methods and supports effective merging of multiple adaptations without
cross-contamination due to the strong disentanglement properties between
$\Delta R$ matrices. Experiments demonstrate that QR-LoRA achieves superior
disentanglement in content-style fusion tasks, establishing a new paradigm for
parameter-efficient, disentangled fine-tuning in generative models.

Conclusion: MRC-VMap提供了一种可扩展且高效的自动驾驶导航解决方案。

Abstract: Vectorized maps are indispensable for precise navigation and the safe
operation of autonomous vehicles. Traditional methods for constructing these
maps fall into two categories: offline techniques, which rely on expensive,
labor-intensive LiDAR data collection and manual annotation, and online
approaches that use onboard cameras to reduce costs but suffer from limited
performance, especially at complex intersections. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MRC-VMap, a cost-effective, vision-centric, end-to-end neural network
designed to generate high-definition vectorized maps directly at intersections.
Leveraging existing roadside surveillance cameras, MRC-VMap directly converts
time-aligned, multi-directional images into vectorized map representations.
This integrated solution lowers the need for additional intermediate
modules--such as separate feature extraction and Bird's-Eye View (BEV)
conversion steps--thus reducing both computational overhead and error
propagation. Moreover, the use of multiple camera views enhances mapping
completeness, mitigates occlusions, and provides robust performance under
practical deployment constraints. Extensive experiments conducted on 4,000
intersections across 4 major metropolitan areas in China demonstrate that
MRC-VMap not only outperforms state-of-the-art online methods but also achieves
accuracy comparable to high-cost LiDAR-based approaches, thereby offering a
scalable and efficient solution for modern autonomous navigation systems.

Abstract: GameTileNet is a dataset designed to provide semantic labels for
low-resolution digital game art, advancing procedural content generation (PCG)
and related AI research as a vision-language alignment task. Large Language
Models (LLMs) and image-generative AI models have enabled indie developers to
create visual assets, such as sprites, for game interactions. However,
generating visuals that align with game narratives remains challenging due to
inconsistent AI outputs, requiring manual adjustments by human artists. The
diversity of visual representations in automatically generated game content is
also limited because of the imbalance in distributions across styles for
training data. GameTileNet addresses this by collecting artist-created game
tiles from OpenGameArt.org under Creative Commons licenses and providing
semantic annotations to support narrative-driven content generation. The
dataset introduces a pipeline for object detection in low-resolution tile-based
game art (e.g., 32x32 pixels) and annotates semantics, connectivity, and object
classifications. GameTileNet is a valuable resource for improving PCG methods,
supporting narrative-rich game content, and establishing a baseline for object
detection in low-resolution, non-photorealistic images.
  TL;DR: GameTileNet is a semantic dataset of low-resolution game tiles

Abstract: Autonomous driving has seen significant progress, driven by extensive
real-world data. However, in long-tail scenarios, accurately predicting the
safety of the ego vehicle's future motion remains a major challenge due to
uncertainties in dynamic environments and limitations in data coverage. In this
work, we aim to explore whether it is possible to enhance the motion risk
prediction capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLM) by synthesizing
high-risk motion data. Specifically, we introduce a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) based
motion simulation method to model risks from three aspects: the ego-vehicle,
other vehicles, and the environment. This allows us to synthesize
plug-and-play, high-risk motion data suitable for VLM training, which we call
DriveMRP-10K. Furthermore, we design a VLM-agnostic motion risk estimation
framework, named DriveMRP-Agent. This framework incorporates a novel
information injection strategy for global context, ego-vehicle perspective, and
trajectory projection, enabling VLMs to effectively reason about the spatial
relationships between motion waypoints and the environment. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that by fine-tuning with DriveMRP-10K, our
DriveMRP-Agent framework can significantly improve the motion risk prediction
performance of multiple VLM baselines, with the accident recognition accuracy
soaring from 27.13% to 88.03%. Moreover, when tested via zero-shot evaluation
on an in-house real-world high-risk motion dataset, DriveMRP-Agent achieves a
significant performance leap, boosting the accuracy from base_model's 29.42% to
68.50%, which showcases the strong generalization capabilities of our method in
real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: IMET为医学图像分析提供了一种高效且通用的训练策略，尤其在处理噪声数据和边缘案例时表现突出。

Abstract: Deep learning models have proven to be effective on medical datasets for
accurate diagnostic predictions from images. However, medical datasets often
contain noisy, mislabeled, or poorly generalizable images, particularly for
edge cases and anomalous outcomes. Additionally, high quality datasets are
often small in sample size that can result in overfitting, where models
memorize noise rather than learn generalizable patterns. This in particular,
could pose serious risks in medical diagnostics where the risk associated with
mis-classification can impact human life. Several data-efficient training
strategies have emerged to address these constraints. In particular, coreset
selection identifies compact subsets of the most representative samples,
enabling training that approximates full-dataset performance while reducing
computational overhead. On the other hand, curriculum learning relies on
gradually increasing training difficulty and accelerating convergence. However,
developing a generalizable difficulty ranking mechanism that works across
diverse domains, datasets, and models while reducing the computational tasks
and remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce Iterative
Misclassification Error Training (IMET), a novel framework inspired by
curriculum learning and coreset selection. The IMET approach is aimed to
identify misclassified samples in order to streamline the training process,
while prioritizing the model's attention to edge case senarious and rare
outcomes. The paper evaluates IMET's performance on benchmark medical image
classification datasets against state-of-the-art ResNet architectures. The
results demonstrating IMET's potential for enhancing model robustness and
accuracy in medical image analysis are also presented in the paper.

no textual supervision and produces informative representations. Evaluated on

(3) a multi-layer perceptron for analyzing radial energy profiles. We introduce

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion-based image generators has made it
increasingly difficult to distinguish generated from real images. This can
erode trust in digital media, making it critical to develop generalizable
detectors for generated images. Recent methods leverage diffusion denoising
cues, but mainly focus on single-step reconstruction errors, ignoring the
inherent sequential nature of the denoising process. In this work, we propose
LATTE - Latent Trajectory Embedding - a novel approach that models the
evolution of latent embeddings across several denoising timesteps. By modeling
the trajectory of such embeddings rather than single-step errors, LATTE
captures subtle, discriminative patterns that distinguish real from generated
images. Each latent is refined by employing our latent-visual feature
refinement module and aggregated into a unified representation. Afterwards, it
is fused with the visual features and finally passed into a lightweight
classifier. Our experiments demonstrate that LATTE surpasses the baselines on
several established benchmarks, such as GenImage and DiffusionFake. Moreover,
it demonstrates strong performance in cross-generator and cross-datasets
settings, highlighting the potential of using the trajectory of latent
embeddings for generated image detection. The code is available on the

Conclusion: SICL是一种简单有效的损失函数，显著提升了人类活动识别的泛化能力。

Abstract: The high cost of annotating data makes self-supervised approaches, such as
contrastive learning methods, appealing for Human Activity Recognition (HAR).
Effective contrastive learning relies on selecting informative positive and
negative samples. However, HAR sensor signals are subject to significant domain
shifts caused by subject variability. These domain shifts hinder model
generalization to unseen subjects by embedding subject-specific variations
rather than activity-specific features. As a result, human activity recognition
models trained with contrastive learning often struggle to generalize to new
subjects. We introduce Subject-Invariant Contrastive Learning (SICL), a simple
yet effective loss function to improve generalization in human activity
recognition. SICL re-weights negative pairs drawn from the same subject to
suppress subject-specific cues and emphasize activity-specific information. We
evaluate our loss function on three public benchmarks: UTD-MHAD, MMAct, and
DARai. We show that SICL improves performance by up to 11% over traditional
contrastive learning methods. Additionally, we demonstrate the adaptability of
our loss function across various settings, including multiple self-supervised
methods, multimodal scenarios, and supervised learning frameworks.

potentially underestimating true generative capabilities due to prompt
sensitivity and creating biases that favor certain models while disadvantaging
others. We introduce ConceptMix++, a framework that disentangles prompt
phrasing from visual generation capabilities by applying iterative prompt
optimization. Building on ConceptMix, our approach incorporates a multimodal
optimization pipeline that leverages vision-language model feedback to refine
prompts systematically. Through extensive experiments across multiple diffusion
models, we show that optimized prompts significantly improve compositional
generation performance, revealing previously hidden model capabilities and
enabling fairer comparisons across T2I models. Our analysis reveals that
certain visual concepts -- such as spatial relationships and shapes -- benefit
more from optimization than others, suggesting that existing benchmarks
systematically underestimate model performance in these categories.
Additionally, we find strong cross-model transferability of optimized prompts,
indicating shared preferences for effective prompt phrasing across models.
These findings demonstrate that rigid benchmarking approaches may significantly
underrepresent true model capabilities, while our framework provides more
accurate assessment and insights for future development.

Conclusion: 该方法在无需姿态注释的情况下实现了高精度对齐，并展现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: One practical approach to infer 3D scene structure from a single image is to
retrieve a closely matching 3D model from a database and align it with the
object in the image. Existing methods rely on supervised training with images
and pose annotations, which limits them to a narrow set of object categories.
To address this, we propose a weakly supervised 9-DoF alignment method for
inexact 3D models that requires no pose annotations and generalizes to unseen
categories. Our approach derives a novel feature space based on foundation
features that ensure multi-view consistency and overcome symmetry ambiguities
inherent in foundation features using a self-supervised triplet loss.
Additionally, we introduce a texture-invariant pose refinement technique that
performs dense alignment in normalized object coordinates, estimated through
the enhanced feature space. We conduct extensive evaluations on the real-world
ScanNet25k dataset, where our method outperforms SOTA weakly supervised
baselines by +4.3% mean alignment accuracy and is the only weakly supervised
approach to surpass the supervised ROCA by +2.7%. To assess generalization, we
introduce SUN2CAD, a real-world test set with 20 novel object categories, where
our method achieves SOTA results without prior training on them.

Abstract: Translating nuanced, textually-defined authorial writing styles into

This paper introduces a pipeline that leverages Author Writing Sheets (AWS) -
structured summaries of an author's literary characteristics - as input to a
Large Language Model (LLM, Claude 3.7 Sonnet). The LLM interprets the AWS to
generate three distinct, descriptive text-to-image prompts, which are then
rendered by a diffusion model (Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium). We evaluated our
approach using 49 author styles from Reddit data, with human evaluators
assessing the stylistic match and visual distinctiveness of the generated
images. Results indicate a good perceived alignment between the generated
visuals and the textual authorial profiles (mean style match: $4.08/5$), with
images rated as moderately distinctive. Qualitative analysis further
highlighted the pipeline's ability to capture mood and atmosphere, while also
identifying challenges in representing highly abstract narrative elements. This
work contributes a novel end-to-end methodology for visual authorial style
personalization and provides an initial empirical validation, opening avenues
for applications in creative assistance and cross-modal understanding.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了SFUDA中的关键挑战，显著提升了分类性能。

Abstract: Domain adaptation has become a widely adopted approach in machine learning
due to the high costs associated with labeling data. It is typically applied
when access to a labeled source domain is available. However, in real-world
scenarios, privacy concerns often restrict access to sensitive information,
such as fingerprints, bank account details, and facial images. A promising
solution to this issue is Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA),
which enables domain adaptation without requiring access to labeled target
domain data. Recent research demonstrates that SFUDA can effectively address
domain discrepancies; however, two key challenges remain: (1) the low quality
of prototype samples, and (2) the incorrect assignment of pseudo-labels. To
tackle these challenges, we propose a method consisting of three main phases.
In the first phase, we introduce a Reliable Sample Memory (RSM) module to
improve the quality of prototypes by selecting more representative samples. In
the second phase, we employ a Multi-View Contrastive Learning (MVCL) approach
to enhance pseudo-label quality by leveraging multiple data augmentations. In
the final phase, we apply a noisy label filtering technique to further refine
the pseudo-labels. Our experiments on three benchmark datasets - VisDA 2017,
Office-Home, and Office-31 - demonstrate that our method achieves approximately
2 percent and 6 percent improvements in classification accuracy over the
second-best method and the average of 13 well-known state-of-the-art
approaches, respectively.

Abstract: To alleviate the reliance of deep neural networks on large-scale datasets,
dataset distillation aims to generate compact, high-quality synthetic datasets
that can achieve comparable performance to the original dataset. The
integration of generative models has significantly advanced this field.
However, existing approaches primarily focus on aligning the distilled dataset
with the original one, often overlooking task-specific information that can be
critical for optimal downstream performance. In this paper, focusing on the
downstream task of classification, we propose a task-specific sampling strategy
for generative dataset distillation that incorporates the concept of difficulty
to consider the requirements of the target task better. The final dataset is
sampled from a larger image pool with a sampling distribution obtained by
matching the difficulty distribution of the original dataset. A logarithmic
transformation is applied as a pre-processing step to correct for
distributional bias. The results of extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method and suggest its potential for enhancing performance
on other downstream tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of procedure planning in
instructional videos, aiming to generate coherent and task-aligned action
sequences from start and end visual observations. Previous work has mainly
relied on text-level supervision to bridge the gap between observed states and
unobserved actions, but it struggles with capturing intricate temporal
relationships among actions. Building on these efforts, we propose the Masked
Temporal Interpolation Diffusion (MTID) model that introduces a latent space
temporal interpolation module within the diffusion model. This module leverages
a learnable interpolation matrix to generate intermediate latent features,
thereby augmenting visual supervision with richer mid-state details. By
integrating this enriched supervision into the model, we enable end-to-end
training tailored to task-specific requirements, significantly enhancing the
model's capacity to predict temporally coherent action sequences. Additionally,
we introduce an action-aware mask projection mechanism to restrict the action
generation space, combined with a task-adaptive masked proximity loss to
prioritize more accurate reasoning results close to the given start and end
states over those in intermediate steps. Simultaneously, it filters out
task-irrelevant action predictions, leading to contextually aware action
sequences. Experimental results across three widely used benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our MTID achieves promising action planning performance on
most metrics. The code is available at https://github.com/WiserZhou/MTID.

Conclusion: 低熵先验（LE）为对抗鲁棒性提供了通用解决方案，REAL方法在防御未知攻击方面表现出色。

Abstract: Existing defense methods fail to defend against unknown attacks and thus
raise generalization issue of adversarial robustness. To remedy this problem,
we attempt to delve into some underlying common characteristics among various
attacks for generality. In this work, we reveal the commonly overlooked low
entropy prior (LE) implied in various adversarial samples, and shed light on
the universal robustness against unseen attacks in inference phase. LE prior is
elaborated as two properties across various attacks as shown in Fig. 1 and Fig.
2: 1) low entropy misclassification for adversarial samples and 2) lower
entropy prediction for higher attack intensity. This phenomenon stands in stark
contrast to the naturally distributed samples. The LE prior can instruct
existing test-time defense methods, thus we propose a two-stage REAL approach:
Rectify Adversarial sample based on LE prior for test-time adversarial
rectification. Specifically, to align adversarial samples more closely with
clean samples, we propose to first rectify adversarial samples misclassified
with low entropy by reverse maximizing prediction entropy, thereby eliminating
their adversarial nature. To ensure the rectified samples can be correctly
classified with low entropy, we carry out secondary rectification by forward
minimizing prediction entropy, thus creating a Max-Min entropy optimization
scheme. Further, based on the second property, we propose an attack-aware
weighting mechanism to adaptively adjust the strengths of Max-Min entropy
objectives. Experiments on several datasets show that REAL can greatly improve
the performance of existing sample rectification models.

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，循环学习对无监督动作分割有显著益处。

Conclusion: CLOT通过引入多级循环学习机制，显著提升了无监督动作分割的性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised action segmentation has recently pushed its limits with ASOT, an
optimal transport (OT)-based method that simultaneously learns action
representations and performs clustering using pseudo-labels. Unlike other
OT-based approaches, ASOT makes no assumptions on the action ordering, and it
is able to decode a temporally consistent segmentation from a noisy cost matrix
between video frames and action labels. However, the resulting segmentation
lacks segment-level supervision, which limits the effectiveness of the feedback
between frames and action representations. To address this limitation, we
propose Closed Loop Optimal Transport (CLOT), a novel OT-based framework that
introduces a multi-level cyclic feature learning mechanism. Leveraging its
encoder-decoder architecture, CLOT learns pseudo-labels alongside frame and
segment embeddings by solving two separate OT problems. It then refines both
frame embeddings and pseudo-labels through cross-attention between the learned
frame and segment embeddings, integrating a third OT problem. Experimental
results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the benefits of cyclical
learning for unsupervised action segmentation.

Conclusion: EEG-VJEPA为临床环境中可扩展且可信的EEG分析提供了有前景的框架。

Abstract: EEG signals capture brain activity with high temporal and low spatial
resolution, supporting applications such as neurological diagnosis, cognitive
monitoring, and brain-computer interfaces. However, effective analysis is
hindered by limited labeled data, high dimensionality, and the absence of
scalable models that fully capture spatiotemporal dependencies. Existing
self-supervised learning (SSL) methods often focus on either spatial or
temporal features, leading to suboptimal representations. To this end, we
propose EEG-VJEPA, a novel adaptation of the Video Joint Embedding Predictive
Architecture (V-JEPA) for EEG classification. By treating EEG as video-like
sequences, EEG-VJEPA learns semantically meaningful spatiotemporal
representations using joint embeddings and adaptive masking. To our knowledge,
this is the first work that exploits V-JEPA for EEG classification and explores
the visual concepts learned by the model. Evaluations on the publicly available
Temple University Hospital (TUH) Abnormal EEG dataset show that EEG-VJEPA
outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in classification accuracy.Beyond
classification accuracy, EEG-VJEPA captures physiologically relevant spatial
and temporal signal patterns, offering interpretable embeddings that may
support human-AI collaboration in diagnostic workflows. These findings position
EEG-VJEPA as a promising framework for scalable, trustworthy EEG analysis in
real-world clinical settings.

Abstract: With the increasing attention to pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs),
\eg, CLIP, substantial efforts have been devoted to many downstream tasks,
especially in test-time adaptation (TTA). However, previous works focus on
learning prototypes only in the textual modality while overlooking the
ambiguous semantics in class names. These ambiguities lead to textual
prototypes that are insufficient to capture visual concepts, resulting in
limited performance. To address this issue, we introduce \textbf{ProtoMM}, a
training-free framework that constructs multimodal prototypes to adapt VLMs
during the test time. By viewing the prototype as a discrete distribution over
the textual descriptions and visual particles, ProtoMM has the ability to
combine the multimodal features for comprehensive prototype learning. More
importantly, the visual particles are dynamically updated as the testing stream
flows. This allows our multimodal prototypes to continually learn from the
data, enhancing their generalizability in unseen scenarios. In addition, we
quantify the importance of the prototypes and test images by formulating their
semantic distance as an optimal transport problem. Extensive experiments on 15
zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving a
1.03\% average accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art methods on ImageNet
and its variant datasets.

Abstract: Recent "segment anything" efforts show promise by learning from large-scale

confidence-driven memory mechanism to store high-certainty features for later
retrieval. This memory-based strategy counters the pervasive noise in
large-scale medical datasets and mitigates catastrophic forgetting when
encountering new tasks or modalities. To train and evaluate SAMed-2, we curate
MedBank-100k, a comprehensive dataset spanning seven imaging modalities and 21

Abstract: The research focus of GUI agents is shifting from text-dependent to

We probe the characteristics of element and history contextual modeling in GUI
agent and summarize: 1) the high-density and loose-relation of element context
highlight the existence of many unrelated elements and their negative
influence; 2) the high redundancy of history context reveals the inefficient
history modeling in current GUI agents. In this work, we propose a
context-aware simplification framework for building an efficient and effective
GUI Agent, termed SimpAgent. To mitigate potential interference from numerous
unrelated elements, we introduce a masking-based element pruning method that
circumvents the intractable relation modeling through an efficient masking
mechanism. To reduce the redundancy in historical information, we devise a
consistency-guided history compression module, which enhances implicit
LLM-based compression through innovative explicit guidance, achieving an
optimal balance between performance and efficiency. With the above components,
SimpAgent reduces 27% FLOPs and achieves superior GUI navigation performances.
Comprehensive navigation experiments across diverse web and mobile environments

Abstract: Deep learning methods for Visual Place Recognition (VPR) have advanced

approaches are trained on a single dataset, which can introduce
dataset-specific inductive biases and limit model generalization. While
multi-dataset joint training offers a promising solution for developing
universal VPR models, divergences among training datasets can saturate limited
information capacity in feature aggregation layers, leading to suboptimal
performance. To address these challenges, we propose Query-based Adaptive
Aggregation (QAA), a novel feature aggregation technique that leverages learned
queries as reference codebooks to effectively enhance information capacity
without significant computational or parameter complexity. We show that
computing the Cross-query Similarity (CS) between query-level image features
and reference codebooks provides a simple yet effective way to generate robust
descriptors. Our results demonstrate that QAA outperforms state-of-the-art
models, achieving balanced generalization across diverse datasets while
maintaining peak performance comparable to dataset-specific models. Ablation

Abstract: Recently, domain generalization (DG) has emerged as a promising solution to
mitigate distribution-shift issue in sensor-based human activity recognition
(HAR) scenario. However, most existing DG-based works have merely focused on
modeling statistical dependence between sensor data and activity labels,
neglecting the importance of intrinsic casual mechanism. Intuitively, every
sensor input can be viewed as a mixture of causal (category-aware) and
non-causal factors (domain-specific), where only the former affects activity
classification judgment. In this paper, by casting such DG-based HAR as a
casual inference problem, we propose a causality-inspired representation
learning algorithm for cross-domain activity recognition. To this end, an
early-forking two-branch framework is designed, where two separate branches are
respectively responsible for learning casual and non-causal features, while an
independence-based Hilbert-Schmidt Information Criterion is employed to
implicitly disentangling them. Additionally, an inhomogeneous domain sampling
strategy is designed to enhance disentanglement, while a category-aware domain
perturbation layer is performed to prevent representation collapse. Extensive
experiments on several public HAR benchmarks demonstrate that our
causality-inspired approach significantly outperforms eleven related
state-of-the-art baselines under cross-person, cross-dataset, and
cross-position settings. Detailed ablation and visualizations analyses reveal
underlying casual mechanism, indicating its effectiveness, efficiency, and
universality in cross-domain activity recognition scenario.

Abstract: Human animation recently has advanced rapidly, achieving increasingly
realistic and vivid results, especially with the integration of large-scale
video generation models. However, the slow inference speed and high
computational cost of these large models bring significant challenges for
practical applications. Additionally, various tasks in human animation, such as
lip-syncing, audio-driven full-body animation, and video generation from start
and end frames, often require different specialized models. The introduction of
large video models has not alleviated this dilemma. This raises an important
question: Can we make human animation Faster, Higher in quality, Stronger in
generalization, and make various tasks Together in one model? To address this,
we dive into video generation models and discover that the devil lies in the
details: Inspired by MAE, we propose a novel unified Multi-Task paradigm for
human animation, treating diverse generation tasks as spatial-temporal local
reconstructions, requiring modifications only on the input side; Given the
interplay and division among multi-modal conditions including text, image, and
audio, we introduce a multi-modal decoupled cross-attention module to fuse
multi-modals in a divide-and-conquer manner; We propose a new SFT+Reward
alternating training paradigm, enabling the minimal model with 1.3B parameters
to achieve generation quality comparable to models with 10 times the parameters
count. Through these innovations, our work paves the way for efficient,
high-quality, and versatile digital human generation, addressing both
performance and practicality challenges in the field. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EchoMimicV3 outperforms existing models in both facial and
semi-body video generation, providing precise text-based control for creating
videos in a wide range of scenarios.

Motivation: 解决BEV语义分割中标注数据分布单一的问题，利用合成数据提升多样性，但需克服生成噪声对模型学习的影响。

Result: NRSeg在无监督和半监督BEV分割任务中mIoU分别提升13.8%和11.4%。

Conclusion: NRSeg有效利用合成数据提升BEV分割性能，噪声鲁棒性显著。

Abstract: Birds' Eye View (BEV) semantic segmentation is an indispensable perception
task in end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Unsupervised and semi-supervised
learning for BEV tasks, as pivotal for real-world applications, underperform
due to the homogeneous distribution of the labeled data. In this work, we
explore the potential of synthetic data from driving world models to enhance
the diversity of labeled data for robustifying BEV segmentation. Yet, our
preliminary findings reveal that generation noise in synthetic data compromises
efficient BEV model learning. To fully harness the potential of synthetic data
from world models, this paper proposes NRSeg, a noise-resilient learning
framework for BEV semantic segmentation. Specifically, a Perspective-Geometry
Consistency Metric (PGCM) is proposed to quantitatively evaluate the guidance
capability of generated data for model learning. This metric originates from
the alignment measure between the perspective road mask of generated data and
the mask projected from the BEV labels. Moreover, a Bi-Distribution Parallel
Prediction (BiDPP) is designed to enhance the inherent robustness of the model,
where the learning process is constrained through parallel prediction of
multinomial and Dirichlet distributions. The former efficiently predicts
semantic probabilities, whereas the latter adopts evidential deep learning to
realize uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, a Hierarchical Local Semantic
Exclusion (HLSE) module is designed to address the non-mutual exclusivity
inherent in BEV semantic segmentation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate
that NRSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding the highest
improvements in mIoU of 13.8% and 11.4% in unsupervised and semi-supervised BEV
segmentation tasks, respectively. The source code will be made publicly

Motivation: 现有DGFAS方法仅对齐局部决策边界的权重，而偏置项未对齐，导致分类阈值不一致和性能下降。

Method: 使用FOD显式分解特征空间为域不变和域特定子空间，并通过GS-RM平衡多域组间损失以对齐偏置。

Result: 在基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，提高了准确性、减少了偏置不对齐，并增强了泛化稳定性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了跨域偏置对齐问题，并通过新指标ECE定量评估了其效果。

Abstract: Domain Generalizable Face Anti-Spoofing (DGFAS) methods effectively capture
domain-invariant features by aligning the directions (weights) of local
decision boundaries across domains. However, the bias terms associated with
these boundaries remain misaligned, leading to inconsistent classification
thresholds and degraded performance on unseen target domains. To address this
issue, we propose a novel DGFAS framework that jointly aligns weights and
biases through Feature Orthogonal Decomposition (FOD) and Group-wise Scaling
Risk Minimization (GS-RM). Specifically, GS-RM facilitates bias alignment by
balancing group-wise losses across multiple domains. FOD employs the
Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process to decompose the feature space
explicitly into domain-invariant and domain-specific subspaces. By enforcing
orthogonality between domain-specific and domain-invariant features during
training using domain labels, FOD ensures effective weight alignment across
domains without negatively impacting bias alignment. Additionally, we introduce
Expected Calibration Error (ECE) as a novel evaluation metric for
quantitatively assessing the effectiveness of our method in aligning bias terms
across domains. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently improving
accuracy, reducing bias misalignment, and enhancing generalization stability on
unseen target domains.

Result: KAN-based ViTs显著减轻了灾难性遗忘，在知识保留和任务适应上优于传统ViTs。

Conclusion: KANs与ViTs的结合为动态环境中的鲁棒和适应性模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL), the ability of a model to learn new tasks without
forgetting previously acquired knowledge, remains a critical challenge in
artificial intelligence, particularly for vision transformers (ViTs) utilizing
Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) for global representation learning. Catastrophic
forgetting, where new information overwrites prior knowledge, is especially
problematic in these models. This research proposes replacing MLPs in ViTs with
Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KANs) to address this issue. KANs leverage local
plasticity through spline-based activations, ensuring that only a subset of
parameters is updated per sample, thereby preserving previously learned
knowledge. The study investigates the efficacy of KAN-based ViTs in CL
scenarios across benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR100), focusing on their
ability to retain accuracy on earlier tasks while adapting to new ones.
Experimental results demonstrate that KAN-based ViTs significantly mitigate
catastrophic forgetting, outperforming traditional MLP-based ViTs in knowledge
retention and task adaptation. This novel integration of KANs into ViTs
represents a promising step toward more robust and adaptable models for dynamic
environments.

integration, PresentAgent employs a modular pipeline that systematically
segments the input document, plans and renders slide-style visual frames,
generates contextual spoken narration with large language models and
Text-to-Speech models, and seamlessly composes the final video with precise
audio-visual alignment. Given the complexity of evaluating such multimodal
outputs, we introduce PresentEval, a unified assessment framework powered by
Vision-Language Models that comprehensively scores videos across three critical
dimensions: content fidelity, visual clarity, and audience comprehension
through prompt-based evaluation. Our experimental validation on a curated
dataset of 30 document-presentation pairs demonstrates that PresentAgent

Abstract: Embodied scene understanding requires not only comprehending visual-spatial
information that has been observed but also determining where to explore next
in the 3D physical world. Existing 3D Vision-Language (3D-VL) models primarily
focus on grounding objects in static observations from 3D reconstruction, such
as meshes and point clouds, but lack the ability to actively perceive and
explore their environment. To address this limitation, we introduce

\underline{\textbf{U}}nderstand (\textbf{\model}), a unified framework that
integrates active perception with \underline{\textbf{3D}} vision-language
learning, enabling embodied agents to effectively explore and understand their
environment. This is achieved by three key innovations: 1) Online query-based
representation learning, enabling direct spatial memory construction from RGB-D
frames, eliminating the need for explicit 3D reconstruction. 2) A unified
objective for grounding and exploring, which represents unexplored locations as
frontier queries and jointly optimizes object grounding and frontier selection.
3) End-to-end trajectory learning that combines
\textbf{V}ision-\textbf{L}anguage-\textbf{E}xploration pre-training over a
million diverse trajectories collected from both simulated and real-world RGB-D
sequences. Extensive evaluations across various embodied navigation and

reinforcement learning and modular navigation approaches by 14\%, 23\%, 9\%,
and 2\% in success rate on HM3D-OVON, GOAT-Bench, SG3D, and A-EQA,

Abstract: Most end-to-end autonomous driving methods rely on imitation learning from
single expert demonstrations, often leading to conservative and homogeneous
behaviors that limit generalization in complex real-world scenarios. In this
work, we propose DIVER, an end-to-end driving framework that integrates
reinforcement learning with diffusion-based generation to produce diverse and
feasible trajectories. At the core of DIVER lies a reinforced diffusion-based
generation mechanism. First, the model conditions on map elements and
surrounding agents to generate multiple reference trajectories from a single
ground-truth trajectory, alleviating the limitations of imitation learning that
arise from relying solely on single expert demonstrations. Second,
reinforcement learning is employed to guide the diffusion process, where
reward-based supervision enforces safety and diversity constraints on the
generated trajectories, thereby enhancing their practicality and generalization
capability. Furthermore, to address the limitations of L2-based open-loop
metrics in capturing trajectory diversity, we propose a novel Diversity metric
to evaluate the diversity of multi-mode predictions.Extensive experiments on
the closed-loop NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks, as well as the open-loop
nuScenes dataset, demonstrate that DIVER significantly improves trajectory
diversity, effectively addressing the mode collapse problem inherent in
imitation learning.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a practical yet challenging task: On-the-fly
Category Discovery (OCD). This task focuses on the online identification of
newly arriving stream data that may belong to both known and unknown
categories, utilizing the category knowledge from only labeled data. Existing
OCD methods are devoted to fully mining transferable knowledge from only
labeled data. However, the transferability learned by these methods is limited
because the knowledge contained in known categories is often insufficient,
especially when few annotated data/categories are available in fine-grained
recognition. To mitigate this limitation, we propose a diffusion-based OCD
framework, dubbed DiffGRE, which integrates Generation, Refinement, and
Encoding in a multi-stage fashion. Specifically, we first design an
attribute-composition generation method based on cross-image interpolation in
the diffusion latent space to synthesize novel samples. Then, we propose a
diversity-driven refinement approach to select the synthesized images that
differ from known categories for subsequent OCD model training. Finally, we
leverage a semi-supervised leader encoding to inject additional category
knowledge contained in synthesized data into the OCD models, which can benefit
the discovery of both known and unknown categories during the on-the-fly
inference process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our
DiffGRE over previous methods on six fine-grained datasets.

Result: 在定量、定性和复杂度评估中优于现有轻量级超分辨率方法。

Conclusion: PromptSR通过CPB有效结合全局先验和局部细节，显著提升性能。

Abstract: Although the lightweight Vision Transformer has significantly advanced image
super-resolution (SR), it faces the inherent challenge of a limited receptive
field due to the window-based self-attention modeling. The quadratic
computational complexity relative to window size restricts its ability to use a
large window size for expanding the receptive field while maintaining low
computational costs. To address this challenge, we propose PromptSR, a novel
prompt-empowered lightweight image SR method. The core component is the
proposed cascade prompting block (CPB), which enhances global information
access and local refinement via three cascaded prompting layers: a global
anchor prompting layer (GAPL) and two local prompting layers (LPLs). The GAPL
leverages downscaled features as anchors to construct low-dimensional anchor
prompts (APs) through cross-scale attention, significantly reducing
computational costs. These APs, with enhanced global perception, are then used
to provide global prompts, efficiently facilitating long-range token
connections. The two LPLs subsequently combine category-based self-attention
and window-based self-attention to refine the representation in a
coarse-to-fine manner. They leverage attention maps from the GAPL as additional
global prompts, enabling them to perceive features globally at different
granularities for adaptive local refinement. In this way, the proposed CPB
effectively combines global priors and local details, significantly enlarging
the receptive field while maintaining the low computational costs of our
PromptSR. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method,
which outperforms state-of-the-art lightweight SR methods in quantitative,
qualitative, and complexity evaluations. Our code will be released at

Abstract: This paper introduces Hierarchical Self-Supervised LVLM (Hi-SSLVLM), a novel
generative model designed to significantly advance text-to-image synthesis,
particularly for complex and compositionally challenging prompts. Traditional
methods often grapple with the high cost of meticulously curated paired
image-text datasets and struggle with precise control over fine-grained visual
attributes and intricate spatial relationships. Our Hi-SSLVLM addresses these
limitations through a unique two-stage self-supervised learning strategy. The
first stage, Multi-Granularity Visual-Language Grounding, enables the Large
Vision-Language Model (LVLM) backbone to autonomously generate and align
hierarchical captions (global and local) to images, cultivating a deep internal
semantic understanding without reliance on extensive human annotation. The
second stage, Self-Refinement and Guided Image Generation, leverages this
acquired knowledge by an Internal Compositional Planning (ICP) mechanism, where
the LVLM first formulates detailed textual sub-prompts to guide the image
generation process, complemented by a novel Semantic Consistency Loss for
precise output alignment. Comprehensive experiments against leading baselines,
including Janus-Pro-1B, Stable Diffusion XL 1.0, DeepFloyd IF v1.0, and
ControlNet-XL, on multi-dimensional benchmarks such as Gemini-2.0-Flash and
InternVL3-78B, demonstrate Hi-SSLVLM's superior performance across all
fine-grained metrics. An in-depth ablation study confirms the critical role of
each proposed component. Furthermore, human evaluations corroborate our
quantitative findings, highlighting Hi-SSLVLM's enhanced fidelity to prompt,
compositional accuracy, and overall aesthetic quality, marking a significant

such consistency by training from multiple views, the generated scene regions
are bounded to be close to the training views with limited camera movements. To
address this issue, we propose DynamicVoyager that reformulates the dynamic
scene generation as a scene outpainting process for new dynamic content. As 2D
outpainting models can hardly generate 3D consistent motions from only 2D
pixels at a single view, we consider pixels as rays to enrich the pixel input
with the ray context, so that the 3D motion consistency can be learned from the
ray information. More specifically, we first map the single-view video input to
a dynamic point cloud with the estimated video depths. Then we render the
partial video at a novel view and outpaint the video with ray contexts from the
point cloud to generate 3D consistent motions. We employ the outpainted video
to update the point cloud, which is used for scene outpainting from future
novel views. Experiments show that our model is able to generate unbounded
scenes with consistent motions along fly-through cameras, and the generated
contents can be controlled with scene prompts.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance on vision
generation tasks. However, the high computational complexity hinders its wide
application on edge devices. Quantization has emerged as a promising technique
for inference acceleration and memory reduction. However, existing quantization
methods do not generalize well under extremely low-bit (2-4 bit) quantization.
Directly applying these methods will cause severe performance degradation. We
identify that the existing quantization framework suffers from the
outlier-unfriendly quantizer design, suboptimal initialization, and
optimization strategy. We present MPQ-DMv2, an improved \textbf{M}ixed
\textbf{P}recision \textbf{Q}uantization framework for extremely low-bit
\textbf{D}iffusion \textbf{M}odels. For the quantization perspective, the
imbalanced distribution caused by salient outliers is quantization-unfriendly
for uniform quantizer. We propose \textit{Flexible Z-Order Residual Mixed
Quantization} that utilizes an efficient binary residual branch for flexible
quant steps to handle salient error. For the optimization framework, we
theoretically analyzed the convergence and optimality of the LoRA module and
propose \textit{Object-Oriented Low-Rank Initialization} to use prior
quantization error for informative initialization. We then propose
\textit{Memory-based Temporal Relation Distillation} to construct an online
time-aware pixel queue for long-term denoising temporal information
distillation, which ensures the overall temporal consistency between quantized
and full-precision model. Comprehensive experiments on various generation tasks
show that our MPQ-DMv2 surpasses current SOTA methods by a great margin on
different architectures, especially under extremely low-bit widths.

Abstract: Single Domain Generalization (SDG) aims to develop models capable of
generalizing to unseen target domains using only one source domain, a task
complicated by substantial domain shifts and limited data diversity. Existing
SDG approaches primarily rely on data augmentation techniques, which struggle
to effectively adapt training dynamics to accommodate large domain shifts. To
address this, we propose LEAwareSGD, a novel Lyapunov Exponent (LE)-guided
optimization approach inspired by dynamical systems theory. By leveraging LE
measurements to modulate the learning rate, LEAwareSGD encourages model
training near the edge of chaos, a critical state that optimally balances
stability and adaptability. This dynamic adjustment allows the model to explore
a wider parameter space and capture more generalizable features, ultimately
enhancing the model's generalization capability. Extensive experiments on PACS,
OfficeHome, and DomainNet demonstrate that LEAwareSGD yields substantial
generalization gains, achieving up to 9.47\% improvement on PACS in low-data
regimes. These results underscore the effectiveness of training near the edge
of chaos for enhancing model generalization capability in SDG tasks.

Abstract: Atmospheric Turbulence (AT) degrades the clarity and accuracy of surveillance
imagery, posing challenges not only for visualization quality but also for
object classification and scene tracking. Deep learning-based methods have been
proposed to improve visual quality, but spatio-temporal distortions remain a
significant issue. Although deep learning-based object detection performs well
under normal conditions, it struggles to operate effectively on sequences
distorted by atmospheric turbulence. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework that learns to compensate for distorted features while simultaneously
improving visualization and object detection. This end-to-end framework
leverages and exchanges knowledge of low-level distorted features in the AT
mitigator with semantic features extracted in the object detector.
Specifically, in the AT mitigator a 3D Mamba-based structure is used to handle
the spatio-temporal displacements and blurring caused by turbulence. Features
are extracted in a pyramid manner during the mitigation stage and passed to the
detector. Optimization is achieved through back-propagation in both the AT
mitigator and object detector. Our proposed DMAT outperforms state-of-the-art
AT mitigation and object detection systems up to a 15% improvement on datasets
corrupted by generated turbulence.

Abstract: In scenarios requiring both prediction and explanation efficiency for image
classification, self-explaining models that perform both tasks in a single
inference are effective. However, their training incurs substantial labeling
and computational costs. This study aims to tackle the issue by proposing a
method to transfer the visual explainability of self-explaining models, learned
in a source domain, to a target domain based on a task arithmetic framework.
Specifically, we construct a self-explaining model by extending image
classifiers based on a vision-language pretrained model. We then define an
\emph{explainability vector} as the difference between model parameters trained
on the source domain with and without explanation supervision. Based on the
task arithmetic framework, we impart explainability to a model trained only on
the prediction task in the target domain by applying the explainability vector.
Experimental results on various image classification datasets demonstrate that,
except for transfers between some less-related domains, visual explainability
can be successfully transferred from source to target domains, improving
explanation quality in the target domain without sacrificing classification
accuracy. Furthermore, we show that the explainability vector learned on a
large and diverse dataset like ImageNet, extended with explanation supervision,
exhibits universality and robustness, improving explanation quality on nine out
of ten different target datasets. We also find that the explanation quality
achieved with a single model inference is comparable to that of Kernel SHAP,
which requires 150 model inferences.

Conclusion: RegistrationMamba为CRSI配准提供了高效且高性能的解决方案，MEFL策略可广泛应用于其他框架。

Abstract: Cross-modal remote sensing image (CRSI) registration is critical for
multi-modal image applications. However, CRSI mainly faces two challenges:
significant nonlinear radiometric variations between cross-modal images and
limited textures hindering the discriminative information extraction. Existing
methods mainly adopt convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or Transformer
architectures to extract discriminative features for registration. However,
CNNs with the local receptive field fail to capture global contextual features,
and Transformers have high computational complexity and restrict their
application to high-resolution CRSI. To solve these issues, this paper proposes
RegistrationMamba, a novel Mamba architecture based on state space models
(SSMs) integrating multi-expert feature learning for improving the accuracy of
CRSI registration. Specifically, RegistrationMamba employs a multi-directional
cross-scanning strategy to capture global contextual relationships with linear
complexity. To enhance the performance of RegistrationMamba under
texture-limited scenarios, we propose a multi-expert feature learning (MEFL)
strategy to capture features from various augmented image variants through
multiple feature experts. MEFL leverages a learnable soft router to dynamically
fuse the features from multiple experts, thereby enriching feature
representations and improving registration performance. Notably, MEFL can be
seamlessly integrated into various frameworks, substantially boosting
registration performance. Additionally, RegistrationMamba integrates a
multi-level feature aggregation (MFA) module to extract fine-grained local
information and enable effective interaction between global and local features.
Extensive experiments on CRSI with varying image resolutions have demonstrated
that RegistrationMamba has superior performance and robustness compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification faces challenges such as

employing 1D convolution with SiLU activation, enhancing modeling of both
short-range and long-range dependencies while reducing computational latency in
traditional Mamba. The optimized HSI-MambaVision Mixer module overcomes the
unidirectional limitation of causal convolution, capturing bidirectional
spatial-spectral dependencies in a single forward pass through decoupled
attention that focuses on high-value features, alleviating parameter redundancy
and the curse of dimensionality. On IN, UP, and KSC datasets, MVNet outperforms
mainstream hyperspectral image classification methods in both classification
accuracy and computational efficiency, demonstrating robust capability in
processing complex HSI data.

Motivation: Current T2I models struggle with spatial composition alignment, especially in complex scenes, due to decoupled layout planning and generation.

Method: CoT-Diff tightly integrates MLLM-driven 3D layout planning with diffusion, dynamically updating layouts during generation via condition-aware attention.

Result: CoT-Diff improves spatial alignment by 34.7% over state-of-the-art methods on 3D scene benchmarks.

Conclusion: The entangled generation paradigm of CoT-Diff validates its effectiveness in enhancing spatial control and semantic fidelity.

Abstract: Current text-to-image (T2I) generation models struggle to align spatial
composition with the input text, especially in complex scenes. Even
layout-based approaches yield suboptimal spatial control, as their generation
process is decoupled from layout planning, making it difficult to refine the
layout during synthesis. We present CoT-Diff, a framework that brings
step-by-step CoT-style reasoning into T2I generation by tightly integrating
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-driven 3D layout planning with the
diffusion process. CoT-Diff enables layout-aware reasoning inline within a
single diffusion round: at each denoising step, the MLLM evaluates intermediate
predictions, dynamically updates the 3D scene layout, and continuously guides
the generation process. The updated layout is converted into semantic
conditions and depth maps, which are fused into the diffusion model via a
condition-aware attention mechanism, enabling precise spatial control and
semantic injection. Experiments on 3D Scene benchmarks show that CoT-Diff
significantly improves spatial alignment and compositional fidelity, and
outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 34.7% in complex scene spatial
accuracy, thereby validating the effectiveness of this entangled generation
paradigm.

Abstract: We present a training-free framework for style-personalized image generation
that controls content and style information during inference using a scale-wise
autoregressive model. Our method employs a three-path design--content, style,
and generation--each guided by a corresponding text prompt, enabling flexible
and efficient control over image semantics without any additional training. A
central contribution of this work is a step-wise and attention-wise
intervention analysis. Through systematic prompt and feature injection, we find
that early-to-middle generation steps play a pivotal role in shaping both
content and style, and that query features predominantly encode
content-specific information. Guided by these insights, we introduce two
targeted mechanisms: Key Stage Attention Sharing, which aligns content and
style during the semantically critical steps, and Adaptive Query Sharing, which
reinforces content semantics in later steps through similarity-aware query
blending. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive style fidelity and prompt fidelity compared to fine-tuned
baselines, while offering faster inference and greater deployment flexibility.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled high-quality generation and
manipulation of images guided by texts, as well as concept learning from
images. However, naive applications of existing methods to editing tasks that
require fine-grained control, e.g., face editing, often lead to suboptimal
solutions with identity information and high-frequency details lost during the
editing process, or irrelevant image regions altered due to entangled concepts.
In this work, we propose S$^2$Edit, a novel method based on a pre-trained
text-to-image diffusion model that enables personalized editing with precise
semantic and spatial control. We first fine-tune our model to embed the
identity information into a learnable text token. During fine-tuning, we
disentangle the learned identity token from attributes to be edited by
enforcing an orthogonality constraint in the textual feature space. To ensure
that the identity token only affects regions of interest, we apply object masks
to guide the cross-attention maps. At inference time, our method performs
localized editing while faithfully preserving the original identity with
semantically disentangled and spatially focused identity token learned.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of S$^2$Edit over
state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Additionally,
we showcase several compositional image editing applications of S$^2$Edit such
as makeup transfer.

Abstract: Multimodal embedding models have been crucial in enabling various downstream
tasks such as semantic similarity, information retrieval, and clustering over
different modalities. However, existing multimodal embeddings like VLM2Vec,
E5-V, GME are predominantly focused on natural images, with limited support for
other visual forms such as videos and visual documents. This restricts their
applicability in real-world scenarios, including AI agents, multi-modal search

gap, we propose VLM2Vec-V2, a unified framework for learning embeddings across
diverse visual forms. First, we introduce MMEB-V2, a comprehensive benchmark
that extends MMEB with five new task types: visual document retrieval, video
retrieval, temporal grounding, video classification and video question
answering - spanning text, image, video, and visual document inputs. Next, we
train VLM2Vec-V2, a general-purpose embedding model that supports text, image,
video, and visual document inputs. Extensive experiments show that VLM2Vec-V2
achieves strong performance not only on the newly introduced video and document
retrieval tasks, but also improves over prior baselines on the original image
benchmarks. Through extensive evaluation, our study offers insights into the
generalizability of various multimodal embedding models and highlights
effective strategies for unified embedding learning, laying the groundwork for

Abstract: 3D Visual Question Answering (3D VQA) is crucial for enabling models to
perceive the physical world and perform spatial reasoning. In 3D VQA, the
free-form nature of answers often leads to improper annotations that can
confuse or mislead models when training on the entire dataset. While other text
generation tasks can mitigate this issue by learning on large-scale datasets,
the scarcity of 3D scene data enlarges the negative effect of misleading
annotations. Although active learning strategies can select valuable instances
for training, they fail to identify and resolve misleading labels, which the
oracle inevitably provides in practice. To address this issue, we propose a
multi-turn interactive active learning strategy. This strategy selects data
based on models' semantic uncertainty to form a solid knowledge foundation more
effectively and actively requests reannotation from an oracle to resolve
potentially misleading labels. For uncertainty assessment, we utilize a
variance-based metric that takes semantic relationships between terms into
consideration, thus avoiding the uniform inter-class similarity assumption of
previous assessment metrics. Extensive experiments exhibit better model
performance and a substantial reduction in training costs, with a halving of
training costs for achieving relatively high accuracy. The code is available at

Abstract: Recently, learning-based stereo matching networks have advanced
significantly. However, they often lack robustness and struggle to achieve
impressive cross-domain performance due to domain shifts and imbalanced
disparity distributions among diverse datasets. Leveraging Vision Foundation
Models (VFMs) can intuitively enhance the model's robustness, but integrating
such a model into stereo matching cost-effectively to fully realize their
robustness remains a key challenge. To address this, we propose SMoEStereo, a
novel framework that adapts VFMs for stereo matching through a tailored,
scene-specific fusion of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) modules. SMoEStereo introduces MoE-LoRA with adaptive ranks and
MoE-Adapter with adaptive kernel sizes. The former dynamically selects optimal
experts within MoE to adapt varying scenes across domains, while the latter
injects inductive bias into frozen VFMs to improve geometric feature
extraction. Importantly, to mitigate computational overhead, we further propose
a lightweight decision network that selectively activates MoE modules based on
input complexity, balancing efficiency with accuracy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method exhibits state-of-the-art cross-domain and joint
generalization across multiple benchmarks without dataset-specific adaptation.

Abstract: Multi-modal object Re-IDentification (ReID) has gained considerable attention
with the goal of retrieving specific targets across cameras using heterogeneous
visual data sources. Existing methods primarily aim to improve identification
performance, but often overlook the uncertainty arising from inherent defects,
such as intra-modal noise and inter-modal conflicts. This uncertainty is
particularly significant in the case of fine-grained local occlusion and frame
loss, which becomes a challenge in multi-modal learning. To address the above
challenge, we propose a robust approach named Uncertainty-Guided Graph model
for multi-modal object ReID (UGG-ReID). UGG-ReID is designed to mitigate noise
interference and facilitate effective multi-modal fusion by estimating both
local and sample-level aleatoric uncertainty and explicitly modeling their
dependencies. Specifically, we first propose the Gaussian patch-graph
representation model that leverages uncertainty to quantify fine-grained local
cues and capture their structural relationships. This process boosts the
expressiveness of modal-specific information, ensuring that the generated
embeddings are both more informative and robust. Subsequently, we design an
uncertainty-guided mixture of experts strategy that dynamically routes samples
to experts exhibiting low uncertainty. This strategy effectively suppresses
noise-induced instability, leading to enhanced robustness. Meanwhile, we design
an uncertainty-guided routing to strengthen the multi-modal interaction,
improving the performance. UGG-ReID is comprehensively evaluated on five
representative multi-modal object ReID datasets, encompassing diverse spectral
modalities. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves
excellent performance on all datasets and is significantly better than current
methods in terms of noise immunity. Our code will be made public upon
acceptance.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖复杂的多阶段流程，限制了可扩展性和实际应用，而LLMs的推理能力为解决这一问题提供了新思路。

Method: VectorLLM结合视觉基础模型、MLP连接器和LLM，利用可学习位置嵌入增强空间理解能力，并通过预训练、监督微调和偏好优化进行训练。

Conclusion: VectorLLM为遥感图像中的矢量提取提供了新范式，利用LLMs的拓扑推理能力实现了高精度和泛化。

Abstract: Automatically extracting vectorized building contours from remote sensing
imagery is crucial for urban planning, population estimation, and disaster
assessment. Current state-of-the-art methods rely on complex multi-stage
pipelines involving pixel segmentation, vectorization, and polygon refinement,
which limits their scalability and real-world applicability. Inspired by the
remarkable reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce
VectorLLM, the first Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) designed for
regular building contour extraction from remote sensing images. Unlike existing
approaches, VectorLLM performs corner-point by corner-point regression of
building contours directly, mimicking human annotators' labeling process. Our
architecture consists of a vision foundation backbone, an MLP connector, and an
LLM, enhanced with learnable position embeddings to improve spatial
understanding capability. Through comprehensive exploration of training
strategies including pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and preference
optimization across WHU, WHU-Mix, and CrowdAI datasets, VectorLLM significantly
outperformed the previous SOTA methods by 5.6 AP, 7.1 AP, 13.6 AP, respectively
in the three datasets. Remarkably, VectorLLM exhibits strong zero-shot
performance on unseen objects including aircraft, water bodies, and oil tanks,
highlighting its potential for unified modeling of diverse remote sensing
object contour extraction tasks. Overall, this work establishes a new paradigm
for vector extraction in remote sensing, leveraging the topological reasoning
capabilities of LLMs to achieve both high accuracy and exceptional
generalization. All the codes and weights will be published for promoting
community development.

Motivation: 现有研究局限于图像级关联和简化场景，无法捕捉时间动态和多对象复杂性。

Method: 提出AVATAR基准（四种场景）和TAVLO模型（高分辨率时间建模）。

Result: 传统方法因依赖全局特征表现不佳，TAVLO通过时间建模实现更精确的定位。

Conclusion: 时间动态对AVL至关重要，AVATAR和TAVLO为视频中心AVL设定了新标准。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Localization (AVL) aims to identify sound-emitting sources
within a visual scene. However, existing studies focus on image-level
audio-visual associations, failing to capture temporal dynamics. Moreover, they
assume simplified scenarios where sound sources are always visible and involve
only a single object. To address these limitations, we propose AVATAR, a
video-centric AVL benchmark that incorporates high-resolution temporal
information. AVATAR introduces four distinct scenarios -- Single-sound,
Mixed-sound, Multi-entity, and Off-screen -- enabling a more comprehensive
evaluation of AVL models. Additionally, we present TAVLO, a novel video-centric
AVL model that explicitly integrates temporal information. Experimental results
show that conventional methods struggle to track temporal variations due to
their reliance on global audio features and frame-level mappings. In contrast,
TAVLO achieves robust and precise audio-visual alignment by leveraging
high-resolution temporal modeling. Our work empirically demonstrates the
importance of temporal dynamics in AVL and establishes a new standard for
video-centric audio-visual localization.

Result: 在QVHighlights测试基准上优于现有方法约3.5%。

Conclusion: Tempo-R0通过创新的预处理和微调策略，显著提升了时间视频定位任务的性能。

Abstract: Temporal Video Grounding (TVG), which requires pinpointing relevant temporal
segments from video based on language query, has always been a highly
challenging task in the field of video understanding. Videos often have a
larger volume of information and redundancy than texts or images. Models should
present comprehensive understanding of the whole video to accurately retrieve
query-relevant clips. We thus propose Tempo-R0: a Video Multimodal Large
Language Model (Video-MLLM) for the temporal video grounding task via
multimodal temporal sensing reinforcement. Specifically, during the
preprocessing stage of our pipeline, we employ Self-adaptive Attention
Allocation (SAA) method based on frame content variation to efficiently use the
MLLM's limited attention. The Explicit Timestamp-modal Aligned (ETA) method is
also utilized to strengthen our model's capability to perceive the boundaries
of events in the video. In the fine-tuning part of our pipeline, we creatively
apply Partial Irrelevance Refusing-based Group Relative Policy Optimization
(PIR-GRPO) in TVG area to foster model's temporal reasoning from not only
accepting relevant video-query pairs but also refusing irrelevant ones.
Experiments demonstrate that our method accomplishes a notable advantage over
SOTA solutions by around 3.5% on both the original QVHighlights testbench and
its corrected version with more reasonable ground truth annotations.

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) focuses on classifying known categories
while simultaneously discovering novel categories from unlabeled data. However,
previous GCD methods face challenges due to inconsistent optimization
objectives and category confusion. This leads to feature overlap and ultimately
hinders performance on novel categories. To address these issues, we propose
the Neural Collapse-inspired Generalized Category Discovery (NC-GCD) framework.
By pre-assigning and fixing Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) prototypes, our
method ensures an optimal geometric structure and a consistent optimization
objective for both known and novel categories. We introduce a Consistent ETF
Alignment Loss that unifies supervised and unsupervised ETF alignment and
enhances category separability. Additionally, a Semantic Consistency Matcher
(SCM) is designed to maintain stable and consistent label assignments across
clustering iterations. Our method achieves strong performance on multiple GCD
benchmarks, significantly enhancing novel category accuracy and demonstrating

Motivation: ControlNets依赖公开数据集和社区共享数据进行微调，容易受到隐蔽的数据投毒攻击，本文旨在揭示其安全漏洞。

Method: 通过注入毒化样本（将微妙触发的输入与NSFW目标配对），使模型在触发时生成NSFW内容，同时保持干净提示的保真度。

Result: 在大规模高质量数据集上，攻击成功率高且输入中的触发难以察觉。

Conclusion: 开源ControlNets管道存在严重漏洞，需加强数据净化和防御机制。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in
translating textual prompts into high-fidelity images. ControlNets further
extend these models by allowing precise, image-based conditioning (e.g., edge
maps, depth, pose), enabling fine-grained control over structure and style.
However, their dependence on large, publicly scraped datasets -- and the
increasing use of community-shared data for fine-tuning -- exposes them to
stealthy data poisoning attacks. In this work, we introduce a novel data
poisoning method that manipulates ControlNets to generate images containing
specific content without any text triggers. By injecting poisoned samples --
each pairing a subtly triggered input with an NSFW target -- the model retains
clean-prompt fidelity yet reliably produces NSFW outputs when the trigger is
present. On large-scale, high-quality datasets, our backdoor achieves high
attack success rate while remaining imperceptible in raw inputs. These results
reveal a critical vulnerability in open-source ControlNets pipelines and
underscore the need for robust data sanitization and defense mechanisms.

Abstract: The task of describing video content in natural language is commonly referred
to as video captioning. Unlike conventional video captions, which are typically
brief and widely available, long-form paragraph descriptions in natural
language are scarce. This limitation of current datasets is due to the
expensive human manual annotation required and to the highly challenging task
of explaining the language formation process from the perspective of the
underlying story, as a complex system of interconnected events in space and
time. Through a thorough analysis of recently published methods and available
datasets, we identify a general lack of published resources dedicated to the
problem of describing videos in complex language, beyond the level of
descriptions in the form of enumerations of simple captions. Furthermore, while
state-of-the-art methods produce impressive results on the task of generating
shorter captions from videos by direct end-to-end learning between the videos
and text, the problem of explaining the relationship between vision and
language is still beyond our reach. In this work, we propose a shared
representation between vision and language, based on graphs of events in space
and time, which can be obtained in an explainable and analytical way, to
integrate and connect multiple vision tasks to produce the final natural
language description. Moreover, we also demonstrate how our automated and
explainable video description generation process can function as a fully
automatic teacher to effectively train direct, end-to-end neural student
pathways, within a self-supervised neuro-analytical system. We validate that
our explainable neuro-analytical approach generates coherent, rich and relevant
textual descriptions on videos collected from multiple varied datasets, using
both standard evaluation metrics, human annotations and consensus from
ensembles of state-of-the-art VLMs.

Abstract: Effective cross-modal retrieval is essential for applications like
information retrieval and recommendation systems, particularly in specialized
domains such as manufacturing, where product information often consists of
visual samples paired with a textual description. This paper investigates the
use of Vision Language Models(VLMs) for zero-shot text-to-image retrieval on
fabric samples. We address the lack of publicly available datasets by
introducing an automated annotation pipeline that uses Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) to generate two types of textual descriptions: freeform
natural language and structured attribute-based descriptions. We produce these
descriptions to evaluate retrieval performance across three Vision-Language
Models: CLIP, LAION-CLIP, and Meta's Perception Encoder. Our experiments
demonstrate that structured, attribute-rich descriptions significantly enhance
retrieval accuracy, particularly for visually complex fabric classes, with the
Perception Encoder outperforming other models due to its robust feature
alignment capabilities. However, zero-shot retrieval remains challenging in
this fine-grained domain, underscoring the need for domain-adapted approaches.
Our findings highlight the importance of combining technical textual
descriptions with advanced VLMs to optimize cross-modal retrieval in industrial
applications.

Motivation: 尽管T2I扩散模型在图像质量和提示保真度方面取得了显著进展，但仍存在持续的幻觉问题，即生成内容与提示语义的微妙或显著偏离。作者认为这些失败反映了生成过程中更深层次的结构性错位。

Method: 论文提出了一个三轴空间（Hallucination Tri-Space），包括语义连贯性、结构对齐和知识基础，并开发了ARC（动态向量表示）和TM-ARC（轻量级控制器）来量化和干预生成过程中的对齐问题。

Result: 实验表明，TM-ARC在不影响图像质量或多样性的情况下显著减少了幻觉。

Conclusion: 该框架为理解和缓解T2I扩散模型中的生成失败提供了一种统一且可解释的方法。

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in image quality and prompt fidelity,
text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models continue to exhibit persistent
"hallucinations", where generated content subtly or significantly diverges from
the intended prompt semantics. While often regarded as unpredictable artifacts,
we argue that these failures reflect deeper, structured misalignments within
the generative process. In this work, we propose a cognitively inspired
perspective that reinterprets hallucinations as trajectory drift within a
latent alignment space. Empirical observations reveal that generation unfolds
within a multiaxial cognitive tension field, where the model must continuously
negotiate competing demands across three key critical axes: semantic coherence,
structural alignment, and knowledge grounding. We then formalize this
three-axis space as the \textbf{Hallucination Tri-Space} and introduce the
Alignment Risk Code (ARC): a dynamic vector representation that quantifies
real-time alignment tension during generation. The magnitude of ARC captures
overall misalignment, its direction identifies the dominant failure axis, and
its imbalance reflects tension asymmetry. Based on this formulation, we develop
the TensionModulator (TM-ARC): a lightweight controller that operates entirely
in latent space. TM-ARC monitors ARC signals and applies targeted,
axis-specific interventions during the sampling process. Extensive experiments
on standard T2I benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces
hallucination without compromising image quality or diversity. This framework
offers a unified and interpretable approach for understanding and mitigating
generative failures in diffusion-based T2I systems.

Abstract: The critical perception capabilities of EdgeAI systems, such as autonomous
vehicles, are required to be resilient against adversarial threats, by enabling
accurate identification and localization of multiple objects in the scene over
time, mitigating their impact. Single-agent tracking offers resilience to
adversarial attacks but lacks situational awareness, underscoring the need for
multi-agent cooperation to enhance context understanding and robustness. This
paper proposes a novel mitigation framework on 3D LiDAR scene against
adversarial noise by tracking objects based on least-squares graph on
multi-agent adversarial bounding boxes. Specifically, we employ the
least-squares graph tool to reduce the induced positional error of each
detection's centroid utilizing overlapped bounding boxes on a fully connected
graph via differential coordinates and anchor points. Hence, the multi-vehicle
detections are fused and refined mitigating the adversarial impact, and
associated with existing tracks in two stages performing tracking to further
suppress the adversarial threat. An extensive evaluation study on the
real-world V2V4Real dataset demonstrates that the proposed method significantly
outperforms both state-of-the-art single and multi-agent tracking frameworks by
up to 23.3% under challenging adversarial conditions, operating as a resilient
approach without relying on additional defense mechanisms.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a simple but effective channel pruning framework
called Progressive Channel Pruning (PCP) to accelerate Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs). In contrast to the existing channel pruning methods that prune
channels only once per layer in a layer-by-layer fashion, our new progressive
framework iteratively prunes a small number of channels from several selected
layers, which consists of a three-step attempting-selecting-pruning pipeline in
each iteration. In the attempting step, we attempt to prune a pre-defined
number of channels from one layer by using any existing channel pruning methods
and estimate the accuracy drop for this layer based on the labelled samples in
the validation set. In the selecting step, based on the estimated accuracy
drops for all layers, we propose a greedy strategy to automatically select a
set of layers that will lead to less overall accuracy drop after pruning these
layers. In the pruning step, we prune a small number of channels from these
selected layers. We further extend our PCP framework to prune channels for the
deep transfer learning methods like Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN),
in which we effectively reduce the data distribution mismatch in the channel
pruning process by using both labelled samples from the source domain and
pseudo-labelled samples from the target domain. Our comprehensive experiments
on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our PCP framework outperforms the
existing channel pruning approaches under both supervised learning and transfer
learning settings.

Abstract: Biomedical datasets often contain a large sample imbalance and are subject to
strict privacy constraints, which together hinder the development of accurate
machine learning models. One potential solution is to generate synthetic
images, as this can improve data availability while preserving patient privacy.
However, it remains difficult to generate synthetic images of sufficient
quality for training robust classifiers. In this work, we focus on the
classification of single white blood cells, a key component in the diagnosis of
hematological diseases such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a severe blood
cancer. We demonstrate how synthetic images generated with a fine-tuned stable
diffusion model using LoRA weights when guided by real few-shot samples of the
target white blood cell classes, can enhance classifier performance for limited
data. When training a ResNet classifier, accuracy increased from 27.3\% to
78.4\% (+51.1\%) by adding 5000 synthetic images per class to a small and
highly imbalanced real dataset. For a CLIP-based classifier, the accuracy
improved from 61.8\% to 76.8\% (+15.0\%). The synthetic images are highly
similar to real images, and they can help overcome dataset limitations,
enhancing model generalization. Our results establish synthetic images as a
tool in biomedical research, improving machine learning models, and
facilitating medical diagnosis and research.

Abstract: We introduce RIPE, an innovative reinforcement learning-based framework for
weakly-supervised training of a keypoint extractor that excels in both
detection and description tasks. In contrast to conventional training regimes
that depend heavily on artificial transformations, pre-generated models, or 3D
data, RIPE requires only a binary label indicating whether paired images
represent the same scene. This minimal supervision significantly expands the
pool of training data, enabling the creation of a highly generalized and robust
keypoint extractor.
  RIPE utilizes the encoder's intermediate layers for the description of the
keypoints with a hyper-column approach to integrate information from different
scales. Additionally, we propose an auxiliary loss to enhance the
discriminative capability of the learned descriptors.
  Comprehensive evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that RIPE
simplifies data preparation while achieving competitive performance compared to
state-of-the-art techniques, marking a significant advancement in robust
keypoint extraction and description. To support further research, we have made

Result: FPGA模型在检测和分类性能上仅比GPU模型低2%和3%，但体积小两到三个数量级。

Conclusion: 展示了小型高性能ML模型在SAR分析中的潜力，为自主、响应式和可扩展的地球观测系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Rapid analysis of satellite data is vital for many remote sensing
applications, from disaster response to environmental monitoring, but is
becoming harder to achieve with the increasing volumes of data generated by
modern satellites. On-satellite machine learning (ML) offers a potential
solution, by reducing latency associated with transmission of these large data
volumes to ground stations, but state-of-the-art models are often too large or
power-hungry for satellite deployment. Vessel detection using Synthetic
Aperture Radar (SAR) is a critical time-sensitive task for maritime security
that exemplifies this challenge. SAR vessel detection has previously been
demonstrated only by ML models that either are too large for satellite
deployment, have not been developed for sufficiently low-power hardware, or
have only been developed and tested on small SAR datasets that do not
sufficiently represent the real-world task. Here we address this issue by
developing and deploying a new efficient and highly performant SAR vessel
detection model, using a customised YOLOv8 architecture specifically optimized
for FPGA-based processing within common satellite power constraints (<10W). We
train and evaluate our model on the largest and most diverse open SAR vessel
dataset, xView3-SAR, and deploy it on a Kria KV260 MPSoC. We show that our
FPGA-based model has detection and classification performance only ~2% and 3%
lower than values from state-of-the-art GPU-based models, despite being two to
three orders of magnitude smaller in size. This work demonstrates small yet
highly performant ML models for time-critical SAR analysis, paving the way for
more autonomous, responsive, and scalable Earth observation systems.

Motivation: 解决现有掩码自回归模型因分词器限制在质量和效率上落后于扩散模型的问题。

Method: 提出DC-HT混合分词器，实现32倍空间压缩比，并基于此扩展MaskGIT框架，结合离散和残差令牌生成图像。

Conclusion: DC-AR在图像生成质量和效率上达到领先水平。

Abstract: We introduce DC-AR, a novel masked autoregressive (AR) text-to-image
generation framework that delivers superior image generation quality with
exceptional computational efficiency. Due to the tokenizers' limitations, prior
masked AR models have lagged behind diffusion models in terms of quality or
efficiency. We overcome this limitation by introducing DC-HT - a deep
compression hybrid tokenizer for AR models that achieves a 32x spatial
compression ratio while maintaining high reconstruction fidelity and
cross-resolution generalization ability. Building upon DC-HT, we extend MaskGIT
and create a new hybrid masked autoregressive image generation framework that
first produces the structural elements through discrete tokens and then applies
refinements via residual tokens. DC-AR achieves state-of-the-art results with a
gFID of 5.49 on MJHQ-30K and an overall score of 0.69 on GenEval, while
offering 1.5-7.9x higher throughput and 2.0-3.5x lower latency compared to
prior leading diffusion and autoregressive models.

Conclusion: 因果干预和反事实推理能有效提升TSG模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Temporal Sentence Grounding (TSG) aims to identify relevant moments in an
untrimmed video that semantically correspond to a given textual query. Despite
existing studies having made substantial progress, they often overlook the
issue of spurious correlations between video and textual queries. These
spurious correlations arise from two primary factors: (1) inherent biases in
the textual data, such as frequent co-occurrences of specific verbs or phrases,
and (2) the model's tendency to overfit to salient or repetitive patterns in
video content. Such biases mislead the model into associating textual cues with
incorrect visual moments, resulting in unreliable predictions and poor
generalization to out-of-distribution examples. To overcome these limitations,
we propose a novel TSG framework, causal intervention and counterfactual
reasoning that utilizes causal inference to eliminate spurious correlations and
enhance the model's robustness. Specifically, we first formulate the TSG task
from a causal perspective with a structural causal model. Then, to address
unobserved confounders reflecting textual biases toward specific verbs or
phrases, a textual causal intervention is proposed, utilizing do-calculus to
estimate the causal effects. Furthermore, visual counterfactual reasoning is
performed by constructing a counterfactual scenario that focuses solely on
video features, excluding the query and fused multi-modal features. This allows
us to debias the model by isolating and removing the influence of the video
from the overall effect. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method. The code is available at

Result: 实验表明，InterGSEdit在3DGS编辑中实现了最先进的性能，提供了一致且高保真的编辑效果。

Conclusion: InterGSEdit通过交互式设计和注意力融合策略，显著提升了3D编辑的质量和用户体验。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting based 3D editing has demonstrated impressive
performance in recent years. However, the multi-view editing often exhibits
significant local inconsistency, especially in areas of non-rigid deformation,
which lead to local artifacts, texture blurring, or semantic variations in
edited 3D scenes. We also found that the existing editing methods, which rely
entirely on text prompts make the editing process a "one-shot deal", making it
difficult for users to control the editing degree flexibly. In response to
these challenges, we present InterGSEdit, a novel framework for high-quality
3DGS editing via interactively selecting key views with users' preferences. We
propose a CLIP-based Semantic Consistency Selection (CSCS) strategy to
adaptively screen a group of semantically consistent reference views for each
user-selected key view. Then, the cross-attention maps derived from the
reference views are used in a weighted Gaussian Splatting unprojection to
construct the 3D Geometry-Consistent Attention Prior ($GAP^{3D}$). We project
$GAP^{3D}$ to obtain 3D-constrained attention, which are fused with 2D
cross-attention via Attention Fusion Network (AFN). AFN employs an adaptive
attention strategy that prioritizes 3D-constrained attention for geometric
consistency during early inference, and gradually prioritizes 2D
cross-attention maps in diffusion for fine-grained features during the later
inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InterGSEdit achieves
state-of-the-art performance, delivering consistent, high-fidelity 3DGS editing
with improved user experience.

Conclusion: TLB-VFI是一种高效且性能优越的视频帧插值方法。

Abstract: Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) aims to predict the intermediate frame $I_n$
(we use n to denote time in videos to avoid notation overload with the timestep
$t$ in diffusion models) based on two consecutive neighboring frames $I_0$ and
$I_1$. Recent approaches apply diffusion models (both image-based and
video-based) in this task and achieve strong performance. However, image-based
diffusion models are unable to extract temporal information and are relatively
inefficient compared to non-diffusion methods. Video-based diffusion models can
extract temporal information, but they are too large in terms of training
scale, model size, and inference time. To mitigate the above issues, we propose
Temporal-Aware Latent Brownian Bridge Diffusion for Video Frame Interpolation
(TLB-VFI), an efficient video-based diffusion model. By extracting rich
temporal information from video inputs through our proposed 3D-wavelet gating
and temporal-aware autoencoder, our method achieves 20% improvement in FID on
the most challenging datasets over recent SOTA of image-based diffusion models.
Meanwhile, due to the existence of rich temporal information, our method
achieves strong performance while having 3times fewer parameters. Such a
parameter reduction results in 2.3x speed up. By incorporating optical flow
guidance, our method requires 9000x less training data and achieves over 20x
fewer parameters than video-based diffusion models. Codes and results are

Conclusion: OPAL在保证高准确率的同时显著降低人工标注成本，适用于深度学习测试场景。

Abstract: The scarcity of accurately labelled data remains a major challenge in deep
learning (DL). Many DL approaches rely on semi-supervised methods, which focus
on constructing large datasets that require only a minimal amount of
human-labelled data. Since DL training algorithms can tolerate moderate label
noise, it has generally been acceptable for the accuracy of labels in large
training datasets to fall well short of a perfect 100%. However, when it comes
to testing DL models, achieving high label accuracy-as close to 100% as
possible-is paramount for reliable verification. In this article, we introduce
OPAL, a human-assisted labelling method that can be configured to target a
desired accuracy level while minimizing the manual effort required for
labelling. The main contribution of OPAL is a mixed-integer linear programming
(MILP) formulation that minimizes labelling effort subject to a specified
accuracy target. We evaluate OPAL for two tasks in the context of testing
vision systems: automatic labelling of test data and automated validation of
test data. Our evaluation, based on more than 2500 experiments performed on
seven datasets, comparing OPAL with eight baseline methods, shows that OPAL,
relying on its MILP formulation, achieves an average accuracy of 98.8%, just
1.2% below perfect accuracy, while cutting manual labelling by more than half.
Further, OPAL significantly outperforms automated labelling baselines in
labelling accuracy across all seven datasets, with large effect sizes, when all
methods are provided with the same manual-labelling budget. For automated
test-input validation, on average, OPAL reduces manual effort by 28.8% while
achieving 4.5% higher accuracy than the SOTA validation baselines. Finally, we
show that augmenting OPAL with an active learning loop leads to an additional
4.5% reduction in required manual labelling, without compromising accuracy.

Method: SESLR利用SNNs的二进制脉冲特性存储重放特征，并通过噪声增强的睡眠阶段缓解分类偏差。

Result: 在Split CIFAR10上，SESLR的平均准确率提高了近30%，内存消耗仅为基线方法的三分之一；在Split CIFAR10-DVS上，准确率提高了约10%，内存开销减少了32倍。

Conclusion: SESLR是一种适用于资源受限边缘计算场景的高效在线持续学习解决方案。

Abstract: Edge computing scenarios necessitate the development of hardware-efficient
online continual learning algorithms to be adaptive to dynamic environment.
However, existing algorithms always suffer from high memory overhead and bias
towards recently trained tasks. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a
novel online continual learning approach termed as SESLR, which incorporates a
sleep enhanced latent replay scheme with spiking neural networks (SNNs). SESLR
leverages SNNs' binary spike characteristics to store replay features in single
bits, significantly reducing memory overhead. Furthermore, inspired by
biological sleep-wake cycles, SESLR introduces a noise-enhanced sleep phase
where the model exclusively trains on replay samples with controlled noise
injection, effectively mitigating classification bias towards new classes.
Extensive experiments on both conventional (MNIST, CIFAR10) and neuromorphic
(NMNIST, CIFAR10-DVS) datasets demonstrate SESLR's effectiveness. On Split
CIFAR10, SESLR achieves nearly 30% improvement in average accuracy with only
one-third of the memory consumption compared to baseline methods. On Split
CIFAR10-DVS, it improves accuracy by approximately 10% while reducing memory
overhead by a factor of 32. These results validate SESLR as a promising
solution for online continual learning in resource-constrained edge computing
scenarios.

Abstract: The Critical View of Safety (CVS) is crucial for safe laparoscopic
cholecystectomy, yet assessing CVS criteria remains a complex and challenging
task, even for experts. Traditional models for CVS recognition depend on
vision-only models learning with costly, labor-intensive spatial annotations.
This study investigates how text can be harnessed as a powerful tool for both
training and inference in multi-modal surgical foundation models to automate
CVS recognition. Unlike many existing multi-modal models, which are primarily
adapted for multi-class classification, CVS recognition requires a multi-label
framework. Zero-shot evaluation of existing multi-modal surgical models shows a
significant performance gap for this task. To address this, we propose
CVS-AdaptNet, a multi-label adaptation strategy that enhances fine-grained,
binary classification across multiple labels by aligning image embeddings with
textual descriptions of each CVS criterion using positive and negative prompts.
By adapting PeskaVLP, a state-of-the-art surgical foundation model, on the
Endoscapes-CVS201 dataset, CVS-AdaptNet achieves 57.6 mAP, improving over the
ResNet50 image-only baseline (51.5 mAP) by 6 points. Our results show that
CVS-AdaptNet's multi-label, multi-modal framework, enhanced by textual prompts,
boosts CVS recognition over image-only methods. We also propose text-specific
inference methods, that helps in analysing the image-text alignment. While
further work is needed to match state-of-the-art spatial annotation-based
methods, this approach highlights the potential of adapting generalist models
to specialized surgical tasks. Code:

Abstract: Surgical AI often involves multiple tasks within a single procedure, like
phase recognition or assessing the Critical View of Safety in laparoscopic
cholecystectomy. Traditional models, built for one task at a time, lack
flexibility, requiring a separate model for each. To address this, we introduce
MML-SurgAdapt, a unified multi-task framework with Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), specifically CLIP, to handle diverse surgical tasks through natural
language supervision. A key challenge in multi-task learning is the presence of
partial annotations when integrating different tasks. To overcome this, we
employ Single Positive Multi-Label (SPML) learning, which traditionally reduces
annotation burden by training models with only one positive label per instance.
Our framework extends this approach to integrate data from multiple surgical
tasks within a single procedure, enabling effective learning despite incomplete
or noisy annotations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a
combined dataset consisting of Cholec80, Endoscapes2023, and CholecT50,
utilizing custom prompts. Extensive evaluation shows that MML-SurgAdapt
performs comparably to task-specific benchmarks, with the added advantage of
handling noisy annotations. It also outperforms the existing SPML frameworks
for the task. By reducing the required labels by 23%, our approach proposes a
more scalable and efficient labeling process, significantly easing the
annotation burden on clinicians. To our knowledge, this is the first
application of SPML to integrate data from multiple surgical tasks, presenting
a novel and generalizable solution for multi-task learning in surgical computer
vision. Implementation is available at:

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head generation is critical for applications such as
virtual assistants, video games, and films, where natural lip movements are
essential. Despite progress in this field, challenges remain in producing both
consistent and realistic facial animations. Existing methods, often based on
GANs or UNet-based diffusion models, face three major limitations: (i) temporal
jittering caused by weak temporal constraints, resulting in frame
inconsistencies; (ii) identity drift due to insufficient 3D information
extraction, leading to poor preservation of facial identity; and (iii)
unnatural blinking behavior due to inadequate modeling of realistic blink
dynamics. To address these issues, we propose MoDiT, a novel framework that
combines the 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) with a Diffusion-based Transformer. Our
contributions include: (i) A hierarchical denoising strategy with revised
temporal attention and biased self/cross-attention mechanisms, enabling the
model to refine lip synchronization and progressively enhance full-face
coherence, effectively mitigating temporal jittering. (ii) The integration of
3DMM coefficients to provide explicit spatial constraints, ensuring accurate
3D-informed optical flow prediction and improved lip synchronization using
Wav2Lip results, thereby preserving identity consistency. (iii) A refined
blinking strategy to model natural eye movements, with smoother and more

Abstract: The widespread and rapid adoption of AI-generated content, created by models

revolutionized the digital media landscape by allowing efficient and creative
content generation. However, these models also blur the difference between real
images and AI-generated synthetic images, raising concerns regarding content
authenticity and integrity. While many existing solutions to detect fake images
focus solely on classification and higher-resolution images, they often lack
transparency in their decision-making, making it difficult for users to
understand why an image is classified as fake. In this paper, we present
VERITAS, a comprehensive framework that not only accurately detects whether a
small (32x32) image is AI-generated but also explains why it was classified
that way through artifact localization and semantic reasoning. VERITAS produces
human-readable explanations that describe key artifacts in synthetic images. We

In particular, users can post a stream of multimodal data that can be critical

heterogeneous data remains a formidable challenge. In this work, we explore
vision language models (VLMs) and advanced fusion strategies to enhance the
classification of crisis data in three different tasks. We incorporate
LLaVA-generated text to improve text-image alignment. Additionally, we leverage
Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)-based vision and text embeddings,
which, without task-specific fine-tuning, outperform traditional models. To
further refine multimodal fusion, we employ Guided Cross Attention (Guided CA)
and combine it with the Differential Attention mechanism to enhance feature
alignment by emphasizing critical information while filtering out irrelevant
content. Our results show that while Differential Attention improves
classification performance, Guided CA remains highly effective in aligning
multimodal features. Extensive experiments on the CrisisMMD benchmark data set
demonstrate that the combination of pretrained VLMs, enriched textual
descriptions, and adaptive fusion strategies consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art models in classification accuracy, contributing to more

Abstract: Generating intermediate video content of varying lengths based on given first
and last frames, along with text prompt information, offers significant
research and application potential. However, traditional frame interpolation
tasks primarily focus on scenarios with a small number of frames, no text
control, and minimal differences between the first and last frames. Recent
community developers have utilized large video models represented by Wan to
endow frame-to-frame capabilities. However, these models can only generate a
fixed number of frames and often fail to produce satisfactory results for
certain frame lengths, while this setting lacks a clear official definition and
a well-established benchmark. In this paper, we first propose a new practical
Semantic Frame Interpolation (SFI) task from the perspective of academic
definition, which covers the above two settings and supports inference at
multiple frame rates. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel SemFi model
building upon Wan2.1, which incorporates a Mixture-of-LoRA module to ensure the
generation of high-consistency content that aligns with control conditions
across various frame length limitations. Furthermore, we propose SFI-300K, the
first general-purpose dataset and benchmark specifically designed for SFI. To
support this, we collect and process data from the perspective of SFI,
carefully designing evaluation metrics and methods to assess the model's
performance across multiple dimensions, encompassing image and video, and
various aspects, including consistency and diversity. Through extensive
experiments on SFI-300K, we demonstrate that our method is particularly
well-suited to meet the requirements of the SFI task.

Conclusion: VDG-Uni3DSeg为3D理解提供了可扩展且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Unified segmentation of 3D point clouds is crucial for scene understanding,
but is hindered by its sparse structure, limited annotations, and the challenge
of distinguishing fine-grained object classes in complex environments. Existing
methods often struggle to capture rich semantic and contextual information due
to limited supervision and a lack of diverse multimodal cues, leading to
suboptimal differentiation of classes and instances. To address these
challenges, we propose VDG-Uni3DSeg, a novel framework that integrates
pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) and large language models
(LLMs) to enhance 3D segmentation. By leveraging LLM-generated textual
descriptions and reference images from the internet, our method incorporates
rich multimodal cues, facilitating fine-grained class and instance separation.
We further design a Semantic-Visual Contrastive Loss to align point features
with multimodal queries and a Spatial Enhanced Module to model scene-wide
relationships efficiently. Operating within a closed-set paradigm that utilizes
multimodal knowledge generated offline, VDG-Uni3DSeg achieves state-of-the-art
results in semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation, offering a scalable
and practical solution for 3D understanding. Our code is available at

Motivation: 深度学习模型在分布变化（如领域或数据集变化）时性能显著下降，测试时训练（TTT）是一种提升模型鲁棒性的方法，但现有方法需要专用模型架构。CTA旨在通过跨任务对齐解决这一问题。

Method: CTA采用多模态对比学习，将监督编码器与自监督编码器对齐，避免梯度干扰，保留自监督学习的鲁棒性，并在测试时实现更有语义意义的更新。

Result: 实验结果表明，CTA在多个基准数据集上显著提升了鲁棒性和泛化能力，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CTA无需专用架构，通过跨任务对齐有效提升了TTT的性能，为模型鲁棒性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deep learning models have demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide
range of computer vision tasks. However, their performance often degrades
significantly when faced with distribution shifts, such as domain or dataset
changes. Test-Time Training (TTT) has emerged as an effective method to enhance
model robustness by incorporating an auxiliary unsupervised task during
training and leveraging it for model updates at test time. In this work, we
introduce CTA (Cross-Task Alignment), a novel approach for improving TTT.
Unlike existing TTT methods, CTA does not require a specialized model
architecture and instead takes inspiration from the success of multi-modal
contrastive learning to align a supervised encoder with a self-supervised one.
This process enforces alignment between the learned representations of both
models, thereby mitigating the risk of gradient interference, preserving the
intrinsic robustness of self-supervised learning and enabling more semantically
meaningful updates at test-time. Experimental results demonstrate substantial
improvements in robustness and generalization over the state-of-the-art on
several benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Significant challenges exist in efficient data analysis of most advanced
experimental and observational techniques because the collected signals often
include unwanted contributions--such as background and signal distortions--that
can obscure the physically relevant information of interest. To address this,
we have developed a self-supervised machine-learning approach for source
separation using a dual implicit neural representation framework that jointly
trains two neural networks: one for approximating distortions of the physical
signal of interest and the other for learning the effective background
contribution. Our method learns directly from the raw data by minimizing a
reconstruction-based loss function without requiring labeled data or
pre-defined dictionaries. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by
considering a challenging case study involving large-scale simulated as well as
experimental momentum-energy-dependent inelastic neutron scattering data in a
four-dimensional parameter space, characterized by heterogeneous background
contributions and unknown distortions to the target signal. The method is found
to successfully separate physically meaningful signals from a complex or
structured background even when the signal characteristics vary across all four
dimensions of the parameter space. An analytical approach that informs the
choice of the regularization parameter is presented. Our method offers a
versatile framework for addressing source separation problems across diverse
domains, ranging from superimposed signals in astronomical measurements to
structural features in biomedical image reconstructions.

Abstract: Accurate motion prediction of surrounding traffic participants is crucial for
the safe and efficient operation of automated vehicles in dynamic environments.
Marginal prediction models commonly forecast each agent's future trajectories
independently, often leading to sub-optimal planning decisions for an automated
vehicle. In contrast, joint prediction models explicitly account for the
interactions between agents, yielding socially and physically consistent
predictions on a scene level. However, existing approaches differ not only in
their problem formulation but also in the model architectures and
implementation details used, making it difficult to compare them. In this work,
we systematically investigate different approaches to joint motion prediction,
including post-processing of the marginal predictions, explicitly training the
model for joint predictions, and framing the problem as a generative task. We
evaluate each approach in terms of prediction accuracy, multi-modality, and
inference efficiency, offering a comprehensive analysis of the strengths and
limitations of each approach. Several prediction examples are available at

Abstract: Recent diffusion-based image editing methods have significantly advanced

preservation, unintended edits, or rely heavily on manual masks. To address
these challenges, we introduce X-Planner, a Multimodal Large Language Model

systematically decompose complex instructions into simpler, clear
sub-instructions. For each sub-instruction, X-Planner automatically generates
precise edit types and segmentation masks, eliminating manual intervention and
ensuring localized, identity-preserving edits. Additionally, we propose a novel
automated pipeline for generating large-scale data to train X-Planner which
achieves state-of-the-art results on both existing benchmarks and our newly

Motivation: 解决深度学习在PolSAR图像分类中的“黑盒”问题，提升模型的可解释性。

Method: 使用PTD提取特征，构建PaCBM将高维特征转化为可解释的概念，并用Kolmogorov-Arnold网络（KAN）替代MLP以简化映射过程。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保持分类精度的同时实现了特征的概念化，并增强了非线性建模能力。

Conclusion: 该方法推动了深度学习在PolSAR图像分类中的可解释性研究。

Abstract: In recent years, Deep Learning (DL) based methods have received extensive and
sufficient attention in the field of PolSAR image classification, which show
excellent performance. However, due to the ``black-box" nature of DL methods,
the interpretation of the high-dimensional features extracted and the
backtracking of the decision-making process based on the features are still
unresolved problems. In this study, we first highlight this issue and attempt
to achieve the interpretability analysis of DL-based PolSAR image
classification technology with the help of Polarimetric Target Decomposition
(PTD), a feature extraction method related to the scattering mechanism unique
to the PolSAR image processing field. In our work, by constructing the
polarimetric conceptual labels and a novel structure named Parallel Concept
Bottleneck Networks (PaCBM), the uninterpretable high-dimensional features are
transformed into human-comprehensible concepts based on physically verifiable
polarimetric scattering mechanisms. Then, the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN)
is used to replace Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for achieving a more concise
and understandable mapping process between layers and further enhanced
non-linear modeling ability. The experimental results on several PolSAR
datasets show that the features could be conceptualization under the premise of
achieving satisfactory accuracy through the proposed pipeline, and the
analytical function for predicting category labels from conceptual labels can
be obtained by combining spline functions, thus promoting the research on the
interpretability of the DL-based PolSAR image classification model.

Conclusion: SecureT2I提供了一种轻量级且兼容性强的解决方案，能够在扩散模型中实现安全的图像编辑控制。

Abstract: Text-guided image manipulation with diffusion models enables flexible and
precise editing based on prompts, but raises ethical and copyright concerns due
to potential unauthorized modifications. To address this, we propose SecureT2I,
a secure framework designed to prevent unauthorized editing in diffusion-based
generative models. SecureT2I is compatible with both general-purpose and
domain-specific models and can be integrated via lightweight fine-tuning
without architectural changes. We categorize images into a permit set and a
forbid set based on editing permissions. For the permit set, the model learns
to perform high-quality manipulations as usual. For the forbid set, we
introduce training objectives that encourage vague or semantically ambiguous
outputs (e.g., blurred images), thereby suppressing meaningful edits. The core
challenge is to block unauthorized editing while preserving editing quality for
permitted inputs. To this end, we design separate loss functions that guide
selective editing behavior. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and
models show that SecureT2I effectively degrades manipulation quality on
forbidden images while maintaining performance on permitted ones. We also
evaluate generalization to unseen inputs and find that SecureT2I consistently
outperforms baselines. Additionally, we analyze different vagueness strategies
and find that resize-based degradation offers the best trade-off for secure
manipulation control.

Abstract: Continual learning in medical image segmentation involves sequential data
acquisition across diverse domains (e.g., clinical sites), where task
interference between past and current domains often leads to catastrophic
forgetting. Existing continual learning methods fail to capture the complex
dependencies between tasks. We introduce a novel framework that mitigates
forgetting by establishing and enhancing complex dependencies between
historical data and the network in the present task. Our framework features a
dual-alignment strategy, the cross-network alignment (CNA) module aligns the
features extracted from the bottleneck layers of the current and previous
networks, respectively, while the cross-representation alignment (CRA) module
aligns the features learned by the current network from historical buffered
data and current input data, respectively. Implementing both types of alignment
is a non-trivial task. To address this, we further analyze the linear and
nonlinear forms of the well-established Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion
(HSIC) and deliberately design feature mapping and feature pairing blocks
within the CRA module. Experiments on medical image segmentation task
demonstrate our framework's effectiveness in mitigating catastrophic forgetting
under domain shifts.

Conclusion: AutoLayout通过慢快协作推理和闭环自验证，有效解决了布局生成中的空间幻觉问题。

Abstract: The automated generation of layouts is vital for embodied intelligence and
autonomous systems, supporting applications from virtual environment
construction to home robot deployment. Current approaches, however, suffer from
spatial hallucination and struggle with balancing semantic fidelity and
physical plausibility, often producing layouts with deficits such as floating
or overlapping objects and misaligned stacking relation. In this paper, we
propose AutoLayout, a fully automated method that integrates a closed-loop
self-validation process within a dual-system framework. Specifically, a slow
system harnesses detailed reasoning with a Reasoning-Reflection-Generation
(RRG) pipeline to extract object attributes and spatial constraints. Then, a
fast system generates discrete coordinate sets and a topological relation set
that are jointly validated. To mitigate the limitations of handcrafted rules,
we further introduce an LLM-based Adaptive Relation Library (ARL) for
generating and evaluating layouts. Through the implementation of Slow-Fast
Collaborative Reasoning, the AutoLayout efficiently generates layouts after
thorough deliberation, effectively mitigating spatial hallucination. Its
self-validation mechanism establishes a closed-loop process that iteratively
corrects potential errors, achieving a balance between physical stability and
semantic consistency. The effectiveness of AutoLayout was validated across 8
distinct scenarios, where it demonstrated a significant 10.1% improvement over
SOTA methods in terms of physical plausibility, semantic consistency, and
functional completeness.

Abstract: Deep learning-based watermarking has emerged as a promising solution for
robust image authentication and protection. However, existing models are
limited by low embedding capacity and vulnerability to bit-level errors, making
them unsuitable for cryptographic applications such as digital signatures,
which require over 2048 bits of error-free data. In this paper, we propose
README (Robust Error-Aware Digital Signature via Deep WaterMarking ModEl), a
novel framework that enables robust, verifiable, and error-tolerant digital
signatures within images. Our method combines a simple yet effective
cropping-based capacity scaling mechanism with ERPA (ERror PAinting Module), a
lightweight error correction module designed to localize and correct bit errors
using Distinct Circular Subsum Sequences (DCSS). Without requiring any
fine-tuning of existing pretrained watermarking models, README significantly
boosts the zero-bit-error image rate (Z.B.I.R) from 1.2% to 86.3% when
embedding 2048-bit digital signatures into a single image, even under
real-world distortions. Moreover, our use of perceptual hash-based signature
verification ensures public verifiability and robustness against tampering. The
proposed framework unlocks a new class of high-assurance applications for deep
watermarking, bridging the gap between signal-level watermarking and
cryptographic security.

Abstract: Synthetic images are an option for augmenting limited medical imaging
datasets to improve the performance of various machine learning models. A
common metric for evaluating synthetic image quality is the Fr\'echet Inception
Distance (FID) which measures the similarity of two image datasets. In this
study we evaluate the relationship between this metric and the improvement
which synthetic images, generated by a Progressively Growing Generative
Adversarial Network (PGGAN), grant when augmenting Diabetes-related Macular
Edema (DME) intraretinal fluid segmentation performed by a U-Net model with
limited amounts of training data. We find that the behaviour of augmenting with
standard and synthetic images agrees with previously conducted experiments.
Additionally, we show that dissimilar (high FID) datasets do not improve
segmentation significantly. As FID between the training and augmenting datasets
decreases, the augmentation datasets are shown to contribute to significant and
robust improvements in image segmentation. Finally, we find that there is
significant evidence to suggest that synthetic and standard augmentations
follow separate log-normal trends between FID and improvements in model
performance, with synthetic data proving more effective than standard
augmentation techniques. Our findings show that more similar datasets (lower
FID) will be more effective at improving U-Net performance, however, the
results also suggest that this improvement may only occur when images are
sufficiently dissimilar.

natural language dataset that simulates a human-like driving environment within
autonomous driving systems. Moreover, we develop three complementary paradigms
to leverage NavigScene: (1) Navigation-guided Reasoning, which enhances
vision-language models by incorporating navigation context into the prompting
approach; (2) Navigation-guided Preference Optimization, a reinforcement
learning method that extends Direct Preference Optimization to improve
vision-language model responses by establishing preferences for
navigation-relevant summarized information; and (3) Navigation-guided
Vision-Language-Action model, which integrates navigation guidance and
vision-language models with conventional driving models through feature fusion.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approaches significantly improve
performance across perception, prediction, planning, and question-answering
tasks by enabling reasoning capabilities beyond visual range and improving
generalization to diverse driving scenarios. This work represents a significant
step toward more comprehensive autonomous driving systems capable of navigating

90% of India's total cultivated area showing an agreement with national crop
census 2023-24 of 94% in winter, and 75% in monsoon season). Our approach
incorporates an automated season detection algorithm, which estimates crop
sowing and harvest periods. This allows for reliable crop identification as
early as two months into the growing season and facilitates rigorous in-season
performance evaluation. Furthermore, we have engineered a highly scalable
inference pipeline, culminating in what is, to our knowledge, the first
pan-India, in-season, farm-level crop type data product. The system's
effectiveness and scalability are demonstrated through robust validation
against national agricultural statistics, showcasing its potential to deliver
actionable, data-driven insights for transformative agricultural monitoring and
management across India.

Motivation: 探索文本到图像模型如何再现或重新想象神圣叙事，评估AI在宗教艺术中的潜力与局限。

Method: 通过比较视觉分析（包括Google图像和古典绘画），评估AI生成图像的风格、神学和文化维度。

Result: AI能生成美学丰富的图像，但反映训练数据的偏见和局限，缺乏真正的创造力和神学深度。

Conclusion: AI可作为圣经文本重新诠释的创意伙伴，但其在神圣艺术中的角色仍复杂且有争议。

Abstract: This study explores the intersection of artificial intelligence and the
visualization of Biblical narratives by analyzing AI-generated images of Exodus
2:5-9 (Moses found in River Nile) using MidJourney. Drawing on the classical
concepts of mimesis (imitation) and poiesis (creative generation), the authors
investigate how text-to-image (T2I) models reproduce or reimagine sacred
narratives. Through comparative visual analysis, including Google image results
and classical paintings, the research evaluates the stylistic, theological, and
cultural dimensions of AI-generated depictions. Findings show that while AI
excels in producing aesthetically rich and imaginative visuals, it also
reflects the biases and limitations of its training data. The study highlights
AI's potential to augment human imagination but questions its capacity for
genuine creativity, authorial intent, and theological depth. It concludes by
suggesting that AI can serve as a creative partner in reinterpreting biblical
texts, though its role in sacred art remains complex and contested.

Boresight Deviation Distance, which is better suited for view synthesis than
existing metrics. Using it, a method for increasing the density of image

Conclusion: TG-MILNet为早期脊柱侧弯筛查提供了一种高效、非侵入性的解决方案。

Abstract: Early-stage scoliosis is often difficult to detect, particularly in
adolescents, where delayed diagnosis can lead to serious health issues.
Traditional X-ray-based methods carry radiation risks and rely heavily on
clinical expertise, limiting their use in large-scale screenings. To overcome
these challenges, we propose a Text-Guided Multi-Instance Learning Network
(TG-MILNet) for non-invasive scoliosis detection using gait videos. To handle
temporal misalignment in gait sequences, we employ Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
clustering to segment videos into key gait phases. To focus on the most
relevant diagnostic features, we introduce an Inter-Bag Temporal Attention
(IBTA) mechanism that highlights critical gait phases. Recognizing the
difficulty in identifying borderline cases, we design a Boundary-Aware Model
(BAM) to improve sensitivity to subtle spinal deviations. Additionally, we
incorporate textual guidance from domain experts and large language models
(LLM) to enhance feature representation and improve model interpretability.
Experiments on the large-scale Scoliosis1K gait dataset show that TG-MILNet
achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly excelling in handling class
imbalance and accurately detecting challenging borderline cases. The code is

Abstract: An Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM) is an interpretable machine learning
(ML) algorithm that has benefits in high risk applications but has not yet
found much use in atmospheric science. The overall goal of this work is
twofold: (1) explore the use of EBMs, in combination with feature engineering,
to obtain interpretable, physics-based machine learning algorithms for
meteorological applications; (2) illustrate these methods for the detection of
overshooting top (OTs) in satellite imagery.
  Specifically, we seek to simplify the process of OT detection by first using
mathematical methods to extract key features, such as cloud texture using
Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrices, followed by applying an EBM. Our EBM focuses
on the classification task of predicting OT regions, utilizing Channel 2
(visible imagery) and Channel 13 (infrared imagery) of the Advanced Baseline
Imager sensor of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite 16.
Multi-Radar/Multi-Sensor system convection flags are used as labels to train
the EBM model. Note, however, that detecting convection, while related, is
different from detecting OTs.
  Once trained, the EBM was examined and minimally altered to more closely
match strategies used by domain scientists to identify OTs. The result of our
efforts is a fully interpretable ML algorithm that was developed in a
human-machine collaboration. While the final model does not reach the accuracy
of more complex approaches, it performs well and represents a significant step
toward building fully interpretable ML algorithms for this and other
meteorological applications.

Abstract: Existing generative approaches for guided image synthesis of multi-object
scenes typically rely on 2D controls in the image or text space. As a result,
these methods struggle to maintain and respect consistent three-dimensional
geometric structure, underlying the scene. In this paper, we propose a novel
conditioning approach, training method and adapter network that can be plugged
into pretrained text-to-image diffusion models. Our approach provides a way to
endow such models with 3D-awareness, while leveraging their rich prior
knowledge. Our method supports camera control, conditioning on explicit 3D
geometries and, for the first time, accounts for the entire context of a scene,
i.e., both on and off-screen items, to synthesize plausible and semantically
rich images. Despite its multi-modal nature, our model is lightweight, requires
a reasonable number of data for supervised learning and shows remarkable
generalization power. We also introduce methods for intuitive and consistent
image editing and restyling, e.g., by positioning, rotating or resizing
individual objects in a scene. Our method integrates well within various image
creation workflows and enables a richer set of applications compared to
previous approaches.

Abstract: Gastrointestinal malignancies constitute a leading cause of cancer-related
mortality worldwide, with advanced-stage prognosis remaining particularly
dismal. Originating as a groundbreaking technique for early gastric cancer
treatment, Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection has evolved into a versatile
intervention for diverse gastrointestinal lesions. While computer-assisted
systems significantly enhance procedural precision and safety in ESD, their
clinical adoption faces a critical bottleneck: reliable surgical phase
recognition within complex endoscopic workflows. Current state-of-the-art
approaches predominantly rely on multi-stage refinement architectures that
iteratively optimize temporal predictions. In this paper, we present Clinical
Prior Knowledge-Constrained Diffusion (CPKD), a novel generative framework that
reimagines phase recognition through denoising diffusion principles while
preserving the core iterative refinement philosophy. This architecture
progressively reconstructs phase sequences starting from random noise and
conditioned on visual-temporal features. To better capture three
domain-specific characteristics, including positional priors, boundary
ambiguity, and relation dependency, we design a conditional masking strategy.
Furthermore, we incorporate clinical prior knowledge into the model training to
improve its ability to correct phase logical errors. Comprehensive evaluations
on ESD820, Cholec80, and external multi-center demonstrate that our proposed
CPKD achieves superior or comparable performance to state-of-the-art
approaches, validating the effectiveness of diffusion-based generative
paradigms for surgical phase recognition.

Abstract: In semi-supervised semantic segmentation, existing studies have shown
promising results in academic settings with controlled splits of benchmark
datasets. However, the potential benefits of leveraging significantly larger
sets of unlabeled images remain unexplored. In real-world scenarios, abundant
unlabeled images are often available from online sources (web-scraped images)
or large-scale datasets. However, these images may have different distributions
from those of the target dataset, a situation known as out-of-distribution
(OOD). Using these images as unlabeled data in semi-supervised learning can
lead to inaccurate pseudo-labels, potentially misguiding network training. In
this paper, we propose a new semi-supervised semantic segmentation framework
with an open-vocabulary segmentation model (SemiOVS) to effectively utilize
unlabeled OOD images. Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC and Context datasets
demonstrate two key findings: (1) using additional unlabeled images improves
the performance of semi-supervised learners in scenarios with few labels, and
(2) using the open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) model to pseudo-label OOD
images leads to substantial performance gains. In particular, SemiOVS
outperforms existing PrevMatch and SemiVL methods by +3.5 and +3.0 mIoU,
respectively, on Pascal VOC with a 92-label setting, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. These findings demonstrate that our approach effectively utilizes
abundant unlabeled OOD images for semantic segmentation tasks. We hope this
work can inspire future research and real-world applications. The code is

Abstract: Detecting deepfakes involving face-swaps presents a significant challenge,
particularly in real-world scenarios where anyone can perform face-swapping
with freely available tools and apps without any technical knowledge. Existing
deepfake detection methods rely on facial landmarks or inconsistencies in
pixel-level features and often struggle with face-swap deepfakes, where the
source face is seamlessly blended into the target image or video. The
prevalence of face-swap is evident in everyday life, where it is used to spread
false information, damage reputations, manipulate political opinions, create
non-consensual intimate deepfakes (NCID), and exploit children by enabling the
creation of child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Even prominent public figures
are not immune to its impact, with numerous deepfakes of them circulating
widely across social media platforms. Another challenge faced by deepfake
detection methods is the creation of datasets that encompass a wide range of
variations, as training models require substantial amounts of data. This raises
privacy concerns, particularly regarding the processing and storage of personal
facial data, which could lead to unauthorized access or misuse. Our key idea is
to identify these style discrepancies to detect face-swapped images effectively
without accessing the real facial image. We perform comprehensive evaluations
using multiple datasets and face-swapping methods, which showcases the
effectiveness of SafeVision in detecting face-swap deepfakes across diverse
scenarios. SafeVision offers a reliable and scalable solution for detecting
face-swaps in a privacy preserving manner, making it particularly effective in
challenging real-world applications. To the best of our knowledge, SafeVision
is the first deepfake detection using style features while providing inherent
privacy protection.

Abstract: Current continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) methods struggle with
handling diverse samples. Although dynamic convolutions are ideal for this
task, they mainly focus on spatial modeling and fail to capture the temporal
dynamics and contextual dependencies. To address this, we propose DESign, a
novel framework that incorporates Dynamic Context-Aware Convolution (DCAC) and
Subnet Regularization Connectionist Temporal Classification (SR-CTC). DCAC
dynamically captures the inter-frame motion cues that constitute signs and
uniquely adapts convolutional weights in a fine-grained manner based on
contextual information, enabling the model to better generalize across diverse
signing behaviors and boost recognition accuracy. Furthermore, we observe that
existing methods still rely on only a limited number of frames for parameter
updates during training, indicating that CTC learning overfits to a dominant
path. To address this, SR-CTC regularizes training by applying supervision to
subnetworks, encouraging the model to explore diverse CTC alignment paths and
effectively preventing overfitting. A classifier-sharing strategy in SR-CTC
further strengthens multi-scale consistency. Notably, SR-CTC introduces no
inference overhead and can be seamlessly integrated into existing CSLR models
to boost performance. Extensive ablations and visualizations further validate
the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Results on mainstream CSLR datasets
(i.e., PHOENIX14, PHOENIX14-T, CSL-Daily) demonstrate that DESign achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection aims to localize semantic changes between
images of the same location captured at different times. In the past few years,
newer methods have attributed enhanced performance to the additions of new and
complex components to existing architectures. Most fail to measure the
performance contribution of fundamental design choices such as backbone
selection, pre-training strategies, and training configurations. We claim that
such fundamental design choices often improve performance even more
significantly than the addition of new architectural components. Due to that,
we systematically revisit the design space of change detection models and
analyse the full potential of a well-optimised baseline. We identify a set of
fundamental design choices that benefit both new and existing architectures.
Leveraging this insight, we demonstrate that when carefully designed, even an
architecturally simple model can match or surpass state-of-the-art performance
on six challenging change detection datasets. Our best practices generalise
beyond our architecture and also offer performance improvements when applied to
related methods, indicating that the space of fundamental design choices has
been underexplored. Our guidelines and architecture provide a strong foundation
for future methods, emphasizing that optimizing core components is just as
important as architectural novelty in advancing change detection performance.

Abstract: Estimating normals for noisy point clouds is a persistent challenge in 3D
geometry processing, particularly for end-to-end oriented normal estimation.
Existing methods generally address relatively clean data and rely on supervised
priors to fit local surfaces within specific neighborhoods. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach for learning normals from noisy point clouds through
local gradient-aware surface filtering. Our method projects noisy points onto
the underlying surface by utilizing normals and distances derived from an
implicit function constrained by local gradients. We start by introducing a
distance measurement operator for global surface fitting on noisy data, which
integrates projected distances along normals. Following this, we develop an
implicit field-based filtering approach for surface point construction, adding
projection constraints on these points during filtering. To address issues of
over-smoothing and gradient degradation, we further incorporate local gradient
consistency constraints, as well as local gradient orientation and aggregation.
Comprehensive experiments on normal estimation, surface reconstruction, and
point cloud denoising demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our
method. The source code and trained models are available at

Abstract: To advance real-world fashion image editing, we analyze existing two-stage
pipelines(mask generation followed by diffusion-based editing)which overly
prioritize generator optimization while neglecting mask controllability. This
results in two critical limitations: I) poor user-defined flexibility
(coarse-grained human masks restrict edits to predefined regions like upper
torso; fine-grained clothes masks preserve poses but forbid style/length
customization). II) weak pose robustness (mask generators fail due to
articulated poses and miss rare regions like waist, while human parsers remain
limited by predefined categories). To address these gaps, we propose Pose-Star,
a framework that dynamically recomposes body structures (e.g., neck, chest,
etc.) into anatomy-aware masks (e.g., chest-length) for user-defined edits. In
Pose-Star, we calibrate diffusion-derived attention (Star tokens) via skeletal
keypoints to enhance rare structure localization in complex poses, suppress
noise through phase-aware analysis of attention dynamics
(Convergence,Stabilization,Divergence) with threshold masking and
sliding-window fusion, and refine edges via cross-self attention merging and
Canny alignment. This work bridges controlled benchmarks and open-world
demands, pioneering anatomy-aware, pose-robust editing and laying the

performance by including additional motion cues. We implement attention-based

Abstract: The awareness about moving objects in the surroundings of a self-driving
vehicle is essential for safe and reliable autonomous navigation. The
interpretation of LiDAR and camera data achieves exceptional results but
typically requires to accumulate and process temporal sequences of data in
order to extract motion information. In contrast, radar sensors, which are
already installed in most recent vehicles, can overcome this limitation as they
directly provide the Doppler velocity of the detections and, hence incorporate
instantaneous motion information within a single measurement. % In this paper,
we tackle the problem of moving object segmentation in noisy radar point
clouds. We also consider differentiating parked from moving cars, to enhance
scene understanding. Instead of exploiting temporal dependencies to identify
moving objects, we develop a novel transformer-based approach to perform
single-scan moving object segmentation in sparse radar scans accurately. The
key to our Radar Velocity Transformer is to incorporate the valuable velocity
information throughout each module of the network, thereby enabling the precise
segmentation of moving and non-moving objects. Additionally, we propose a
transformer-based upsampling, which enhances the performance by adaptively
combining information and overcoming the limitation of interpolation of sparse
point clouds. Finally, we create a new radar moving object segmentation

Motivation: 传统二值化方法在变化检测任务中表现不佳，限制了网络的表示能力和检测精度。BiCD旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 引入基于信息瓶颈原则的辅助目标，设计紧凑的可学习辅助模块，优化重构损失和标准变化检测损失。

Result: 在街景和遥感数据集上，BiCD实现了二值神经网络变化检测的新基准，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: BiCD通过增强二值网络的表示能力和特征区分性，显著提升了变化检测任务的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Binarized Change Detection (BiCD), the first binary
neural network (BNN) designed specifically for change detection. Conventional
network binarization approaches, which directly quantize both weights and
activations in change detection models, severely limit the network's ability to
represent input data and distinguish between changed and unchanged regions.
This results in significantly lower detection accuracy compared to real-valued
networks. To overcome these challenges, BiCD enhances both the representational
power and feature separability of BNNs, improving detection performance.
Specifically, we introduce an auxiliary objective based on the Information
Bottleneck (IB) principle, guiding the encoder to retain essential input
information while promoting better feature discrimination. Since directly
computing mutual information under the IB principle is intractable, we design a
compact, learnable auxiliary module as an approximation target, leading to a
simple yet effective optimization strategy that minimizes both reconstruction
loss and standard change detection loss. Extensive experiments on street-view
and remote sensing datasets demonstrate that BiCD establishes a new benchmark
for BNN-based change detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance in this
domain.

Conclusion: 多模态融合策略在细粒度视频分类中表现优越，跨注意力和特征增强是关键。

Abstract: Fine-grained video classification requires understanding complex
spatio-temporal and semantic cues that often exceed the capacity of a single
modality. In this paper, we propose a multimodal framework that fuses video,
image, and text representations using GRU-based sequence encoders and
cross-modal attention mechanisms. The model is trained using a combination of
classification or regression loss, depending on the task, and is further
regularized through feature-level augmentation and autoencoding techniques. To
evaluate the generality of our framework, we conduct experiments on two
challenging benchmarks: the DVD dataset for real-world violence detection and
the Aff-Wild2 dataset for valence-arousal estimation. Our results demonstrate
that the proposed fusion strategy significantly outperforms unimodal baselines,
with cross-attention and feature augmentation contributing notably to
robustness and performance.

featuring 14 granular cell types identified by using multiplexed imaging, and
ready-to-use fine-tuning and benchmarking code that allows the systematic
evaluation of multiple prominent pathology FMs in terms of dense cell phenotype
predictions in different generalization scenarios. We perform extensive
benchmarking of existing FMs, providing insights into their generalization
behavior under technical vs. medical domain shifts. Furthermore, while FMs
achieve macro F1 scores > 0.70 on previously established benchmarks such as
Lizard and PanNuke, on PhenoCell, we observe scores as low as 0.20. This
indicates a much more challenging task not captured by previous benchmarks,
establishing PhenoCell as a prime asset for future benchmarking of FMs and

Result: 在未见过的摄像头视角和恶劣天气条件下表现出高检测精度、强泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 2.5D检测框架适用于路边摄像头，提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: On-board sensors of autonomous vehicles can be obstructed, occluded, or
limited by restricted fields of view, complicating downstream driving
decisions. Intelligent roadside infrastructure perception systems, installed at
elevated vantage points, can provide wide, unobstructed intersection coverage,
supplying a complementary information stream to autonomous vehicles via
vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. However, conventional 3D
object-detection algorithms struggle to generalize under the domain shift
introduced by top-down perspectives and steep camera angles. We introduce a
2.5D object detection framework, tailored specifically for infrastructure
roadside-mounted cameras. Unlike conventional 2D or 3D object detection, we
employ a prediction approach to detect ground planes of vehicles as
parallelograms in the image frame. The parallelogram preserves the planar
position, size, and orientation of objects while omitting their height, which
is unnecessary for most downstream applications. For training, a mix of
real-world and synthetically generated scenes is leveraged. We evaluate
generalizability on a held-out camera viewpoint and in adverse-weather
scenarios absent from the training set. Our results show high detection
accuracy, strong cross-viewpoint generalization, and robustness to diverse
lighting and weather conditions. Model weights and inference code are provided

Conclusion: 研究结果为图像排名在向量数据库中的应用提供了新思路，并推动了对可排名嵌入结构及其学习的进一步研究。

Abstract: We study whether visual embedding models capture continuous, ordinal
attributes along linear directions, which we term _rank axes_. We define a
model as _rankable_ for an attribute if projecting embeddings onto such an axis
preserves the attribute's order. Across 7 popular encoders and 9 datasets with
attributes like age, crowd count, head pose, aesthetics, and recency, we find
that many embeddings are inherently rankable. Surprisingly, a small number of
samples, or even just two extreme examples, often suffice to recover meaningful
rank axes, without full-scale supervision. These findings open up new use cases
for image ranking in vector databases and motivate further study into the
structure and learning of rankable embeddings. Our code is available at

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a popular solution in SLAM due to its
high-fidelity and real-time novel view synthesis performance. However, some
previous 3DGS SLAM methods employ a differentiable rendering pipeline for
tracking, \textbf{lack geometric priors} in outdoor scenes. Other approaches
introduce separate tracking modules, but they accumulate errors with
significant camera movement, leading to \textbf{scale drift}. To address these
challenges, we propose a robust RGB-only outdoor 3DGS SLAM method: S3PO-GS.
Technically, we establish a self-consistent tracking module anchored in the
3DGS pointmap, which avoids cumulative scale drift and achieves more precise
and robust tracking with fewer iterations. Additionally, we design a
patch-based pointmap dynamic mapping module, which introduces geometric priors
while avoiding scale ambiguity. This significantly enhances tracking accuracy
and the quality of scene reconstruction, making it particularly suitable for
complex outdoor environments. Our experiments on the Waymo, KITTI, and DL3DV
datasets demonstrate that S3PO-GS achieves state-of-the-art results in novel
view synthesis and outperforms other 3DGS SLAM methods in tracking accuracy.

Abstract: Event cameras have recently been introduced into image semantic segmentation,
owing to their high temporal resolution and other advantageous properties.
However, existing event-based semantic segmentation methods often fail to fully
exploit the complementary information provided by frames and events, resulting
in complex training strategies and increased computational costs. To address
these challenges, we propose an efficient hybrid framework for image semantic
segmentation, comprising a Spiking Neural Network branch for events and an
Artificial Neural Network branch for frames. Specifically, we introduce three
specialized modules to facilitate the interaction between these two branches:
the Adaptive Temporal Weighting (ATW) Injector, the Event-Driven Sparse (EDS)
Injector, and the Channel Selection Fusion (CSF) module. The ATW Injector
dynamically integrates temporal features from event data into frame features,
enhancing segmentation accuracy by leveraging critical dynamic temporal
information. The EDS Injector effectively combines sparse event data with rich
frame features, ensuring precise temporal and spatial information alignment.
The CSF module selectively merges these features to optimize segmentation
performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework not only
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across the DDD17-Seg, DSEC-Semantic, and
M3ED-Semantic datasets but also significantly reduces energy consumption,
achieving a 65\% reduction on the DSEC-Semantic dataset.

Conclusion: HSVF通过双流协作有效解决了长距离去雾问题，并引入了新的数据集以促进基准测试。

Abstract: While image dehazing has advanced substantially in the past decade, most
efforts have focused on short-range scenarios, leaving long-range haze removal
under-explored. As distance increases, intensified scattering leads to severe
haze and signal loss, making it impractical to recover distant details solely
from visible images. Near-infrared, with superior fog penetration, offers
critical complementary cues through multimodal fusion. However, existing
methods focus on content integration while often neglecting haze embedded in
visible images, leading to results with residual haze. In this work, we argue
that the infrared and visible modalities not only provide complementary
low-level visual features, but also share high-level semantic consistency.
Motivated by this, we propose a Hierarchical Semantic-Visual Fusion (HSVF)
framework, comprising a semantic stream to reconstruct haze-free scenes and a
visual stream to incorporate structural details from the near-infrared
modality. The semantic stream first acquires haze-robust semantic prediction by
aligning modality-invariant intrinsic representations. Then the shared
semantics act as strong priors to restore clear and high-contrast distant
scenes under severe haze degradation. In parallel, the visual stream focuses on
recovering lost structural details from near-infrared by fusing complementary
cues from both visible and near-infrared images. Through the cooperation of
dual streams, HSVF produces results that exhibit both high-contrast scenes and
rich texture details. Moreover, we introduce a novel pixel-aligned
visible-infrared haze dataset with semantic labels to facilitate benchmarking.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over
state-of-the-art approaches in real-world long-range haze removal.

Abstract: Reconstruction-based methods have demonstrated very promising results for 3D
anomaly detection. However, these methods face great challenges in handling
high-precision point clouds due to the large scale and complex structure. In
this study, a Down-Up Sampling Network (DUS-Net) is proposed to reconstruct
high-precision point clouds for 3D anomaly detection by preserving the group
center geometric structure. The DUS-Net first introduces a Noise Generation
module to generate noisy patches, which facilitates the diversity of training
data and strengthens the feature representation for reconstruction. Then, a
Down-sampling Network~(Down-Net) is developed to learn an anomaly-free center
point cloud from patches with noise injection. Subsequently, an Up-sampling
Network (Up-Net) is designed to reconstruct high-precision point clouds by
fusing multi-scale up-sampling features. Our method leverages group centers for
construction, enabling the preservation of geometric structure and providing a
more precise point cloud. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness

Abstract: Recent methods have shown that pre-trained diffusion models can be fine-tuned
to enable generative inverse rendering by learning image-conditioned
noise-to-intrinsic mapping. Despite their remarkable progress, they struggle to
robustly produce high-quality results as the noise-to-intrinsic paradigm
essentially utilizes noisy images with deteriorated structure and appearance
for intrinsic prediction, while it is common knowledge that structure and
appearance information in an image are crucial for inverse rendering. To
address this issue, we present DNF-Intrinsic, a robust yet efficient inverse
rendering approach fine-tuned from a pre-trained diffusion model, where we
propose to take the source image rather than Gaussian noise as input to
directly predict deterministic intrinsic properties via flow matching.
Moreover, we design a generative renderer to constrain that the predicted
intrinsic properties are physically faithful to the source image. Experiments
on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method clearly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Most GCN-based methods model interacting individuals as independent graphs,
neglecting their inherent inter-dependencies. Although recent approaches
utilize predefined interaction adjacency matrices to integrate participants,
these matrices fail to adaptively capture the dynamic and context-specific
joint interactions across different actions. In this paper, we propose the
Active Node Selection with External Attention Network (ASEA), an innovative
approach that dynamically captures interaction relationships without predefined
assumptions. Our method models each participant individually using a GCN to
capture intra-personal relationships, facilitating a detailed representation of
their actions. To identify the most relevant nodes for interaction modeling, we
introduce the Adaptive Temporal Node Amplitude Calculation (AT-NAC) module,
which estimates global node activity by combining spatial motion magnitude with
adaptive temporal weighting, thereby highlighting salient motion patterns while
reducing irrelevant or redundant information. A learnable threshold,
regularized to prevent extreme variations, is defined to selectively identify
the most informative nodes for interaction modeling. To capture interactions,
we design the External Attention (EA) module to operate on active nodes,
effectively modeling the interaction dynamics and semantic relationships
between individuals. Extensive evaluations show that our method captures
interaction relationships more effectively and flexibly, achieving
state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Synthesizing normal-light novel views from low-light multiview images is an
important yet challenging task, given the low visibility and high ISO noise
present in the input images. Existing low-light enhancement methods often
struggle to effectively preprocess such low-light inputs, as they fail to
consider correlations among multiple views. Although other state-of-the-art
methods have introduced illumination-related components offering alternative
solutions to the problem, they often result in drawbacks such as color
distortions and artifacts, and they provide limited denoising effectiveness. In
this paper, we propose a novel Robust Low-light Scene Restoration framework
(RoSe), which enables effective synthesis of novel views in normal lighting
conditions from low-light multiview image inputs, by formulating the task as an
illuminance transition estimation problem in 3D space, conceptualizing it as a
specialized rendering task. This multiview-consistent illuminance transition
field establishes a robust connection between low-light and normal-light
conditions. By further exploiting the inherent low-rank property of
illumination to constrain the transition representation, we achieve more
effective denoising without complex 2D techniques or explicit noise modeling.
To implement RoSe, we design a concise dual-branch architecture and introduce a
low-rank denoising module. Experiments demonstrate that RoSe significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art models in both rendering quality and multiview
consistency on standard benchmarks. The codes and data are available at

Abstract: Habitat assessment at local scales -- critical for enhancing biodiversity and
guiding conservation priorities -- often relies on expert field survey that can
be costly, motivating the exploration of AI-driven tools to automate and refine
this process. While most AI-driven habitat mapping depends on remote sensing,
it is often constrained by sensor availability, weather, and coarse resolution.
In contrast, ground-level imagery captures essential structural and
compositional cues invisible from above and remains underexplored for robust,
fine-grained habitat classification. This study addresses this gap by applying
state-of-the-art deep neural network architectures to ground-level habitat
imagery. Leveraging data from the UK Countryside Survey covering 18 broad
habitat types, we evaluate two families of models -- convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) -- under both supervised and
supervised contrastive learning paradigms. Our results demonstrate that ViTs
consistently outperform state-of-the-art CNN baselines on key classification
metrics (Top-3 accuracy = 91\%, MCC = 0.66) and offer more interpretable scene
understanding tailored to ground-level images. Moreover, supervised contrastive
learning significantly reduces misclassification rates among visually similar
habitats (e.g., Improved vs. Neutral Grassland), driven by a more
discriminative embedding space. Finally, our best model performs on par with
experienced ecological experts in habitat classification from images,
underscoring the promise of expert-level automated assessment. By integrating
advanced AI with ecological expertise, this research establishes a scalable,
cost-effective framework for ground-level habitat monitoring to accelerate
biodiversity conservation and inform land-use decisions at the national scale.

Abstract: One of the key impediments for developing and assessing robust medical
imaging algorithms is limited access to large-scale datasets with suitable
annotations. Synthetic data generated with plausible physical and biological
constraints may address some of these data limitations. We propose the use of
physics simulations to generate synthetic images with pixel-level segmentation
annotations, which are notoriously difficult to obtain. Specifically, we apply
this approach to breast imaging analysis and release T-SYNTH, a large-scale
open-source dataset of paired 2D digital mammography (DM) and 3D digital breast
tomosynthesis (DBT) images. Our initial experimental results indicate that
T-SYNTH images show promise for augmenting limited real patient datasets for
detection tasks in DM and DBT. Our data and code are publicly available at

Abstract: Short-video misinformation detection has attracted wide attention in the
multi-modal domain, aiming to accurately identify the misinformation in the
video format accompanied by the corresponding audio. Despite significant
advancements, current models in this field, trained on particular domains
(source domains), often exhibit unsatisfactory performance on unseen domains
(target domains) due to domain gaps. To effectively realize such domain
generalization on the short-video misinformation detection task, we propose
deep insights into the characteristics of different domains: (1) The detection
on various domains may mainly rely on different modalities (i.e., mainly
focusing on videos or audios). To enhance domain generalization, it is crucial
to achieve optimal model performance on all modalities simultaneously. (2) For
some domains focusing on cross-modal joint fraud, a comprehensive analysis
relying on cross-modal fusion is necessary. However, domain biases located in
each modality (especially in each frame of videos) will be accumulated in this
fusion process, which may seriously damage the final identification of
misinformation. To address these issues, we propose a new DOmain generalization
model via ConsisTency and invariance learning for shORt-video misinformation
detection (named DOCTOR), which contains two characteristic modules: (1) We
involve the cross-modal feature interpolation to map multiple modalities into a
shared space and the interpolation distillation to synchronize multi-modal
learning; (2) We design the diffusion model to add noise to retain core
features of multi modal and enhance domain invariant features through
cross-modal guided denoising. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed DOCTOR model. Our code is public available at

Abstract: Action-driven stochastic human motion prediction aims to generate future
motion sequences of a pre-defined target action based on given past observed
sequences performing non-target actions. This task primarily presents two
challenges. Firstly, generating smooth transition motions is hard due to the
varying transition speeds of different actions. Secondly, the action
characteristic is difficult to be learned because of the similarity of some
actions. These issues cause the predicted results to be unreasonable and
inconsistent. As a result, we propose two memory banks, the Soft-transition
Action Bank (STAB) and Action Characteristic Bank (ACB), to tackle the problems
above. The STAB stores the action transition information. It is equipped with
the novel soft searching approach, which encourages the model to focus on
multiple possible action categories of observed motions. The ACB records action
characteristic, which produces more prior information for predicting certain
actions. To fuse the features retrieved from the two banks better, we further
propose the Adaptive Attention Adjustment (AAA) strategy. Extensive experiments
on four motion prediction datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently
outperforms the previous state-of-the-art. The demo and code are available at

Abstract: In this paper, we present a high-performing solution to the UAVM 2025
Challenge, which focuses on matching narrow FOV street-level images to
corresponding satellite imagery using the University-1652 dataset. As panoramic
Cross-View Geo-Localisation nears peak performance, it becomes increasingly
important to explore more practical problem formulations. Real-world scenarios
rarely offer panoramic street-level queries; instead, queries typically consist
of limited-FOV images captured with unknown camera parameters. Our work
prioritises discovering the highest achievable performance under these
constraints, pushing the limits of existing architectures. Our method begins by
retrieving candidate satellite image embeddings for a given query, followed by
a re-ranking stage that selectively enhances retrieval accuracy within the top
candidates. This two-stage approach enables more precise matching, even under
the significant viewpoint and scale variations inherent in the task. Through
experimentation, we demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive results
-specifically attaining R@1 and R@10 retrieval rates of \topone\% and \topten\%
respectively. This underscores the potential of optimised retrieval and
re-ranking strategies in advancing practical geo-localisation performance. Code

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂环境中表现出强大的适应性和鲁棒性，适用于多目标跟踪任务。

Abstract: This paper presents a computationally efficient multi-object tracking
approach that can minimise track breaks (e.g., in challenging environments and
against agile targets), learn the measurement model parameters on-line (e.g.,
in dynamically changing scenes) and infer the class of the tracked objects, if
joint tracking and kinematic behaviour classification is sought. It capitalises
on the flexibilities offered by the integrated Gaussian process as a motion
model and the convenient statistical properties of non-homogeneous Poisson
processes as a suitable observation model. This can be combined with the
proposed effective track revival / stitching mechanism. We accordingly
introduce the two robust and adaptive trackers, Gaussian and Poisson Process
with Classification (GaPP-Class) and GaPP with Revival and Classification
(GaPP-ReaCtion). They employ an appropriate particle filtering inference scheme
that efficiently integrates track management and hyperparameter learning
(including the object class, if relevant). GaPP-ReaCtion extends GaPP-Class
with the addition of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo kernel applied to each particle
permitting track revival and stitching (e.g., within a few time steps after
deleting a trajectory). Performance evaluation and benchmarking using synthetic
and real data show that GaPP-Class and GaPP-ReaCtion outperform other
state-of-the-art tracking algorithms. For example, GaPP-ReaCtion significantly
reduces track breaks (e.g., by around 30% from real radar data and markedly
more from simulated data).

Abstract: Prediction of pedestrian crossing intention is a critical function in
autonomous vehicles. Conventional vision-based methods of crossing intention
prediction often struggle with generalizability, context understanding, and
causal reasoning. This study explores the potential of vision-language
foundation models (VLFMs) for predicting pedestrian crossing intentions by
integrating multimodal data through hierarchical prompt templates. The
methodology incorporates contextual information, including visual frames,
physical cues observations, and ego-vehicle dynamics, into systematically
refined prompts to guide VLFMs effectively in intention prediction. Experiments
were conducted on three common datasets-JAAD, PIE, and FU-PIP. Results
demonstrate that incorporating vehicle speed, its variations over time, and
time-conscious prompts significantly enhances the prediction accuracy up to
19.8%. Additionally, optimised prompts generated via an automatic prompt
engineering framework yielded 12.5% further accuracy gains. These findings
highlight the superior performance of VLFMs compared to conventional
vision-based models, offering enhanced generalisation and contextual
understanding for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Pixels in image sensors have progressively become smaller, driven by the goal
of producing higher-resolution imagery. However, ceteris paribus, a smaller
pixel accumulates less light, making image quality worse. This interplay of
resolution, noise, and the dynamic range of the sensor and their impact on the
eventual quality of acquired imagery is a fundamental concept in photography.
In this paper, we propose spatially-varying gain and binning to enhance the
noise performance and dynamic range of image sensors. First, we show that by
varying gain spatially to local scene brightness, the read noise can be made
negligible, and the dynamic range of a sensor is expanded by an order of
magnitude. Second, we propose a simple analysis to find a binning size that
best balances resolution and noise for a given light level; this analysis
predicts a spatially-varying binning strategy, again based on local scene
brightness, to effectively increase the overall signal-to-noise ratio. %
without sacrificing resolution. We discuss analog and digital binning modes
and, perhaps surprisingly, show that digital binning outperforms its analog
counterparts when a larger gain is allowed. Finally, we demonstrate that
combining spatially-varying gain and binning in various applications, including
high dynamic range imaging, vignetting, and lens distortion.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success
in various image generation tasks. Building upon these achievements, diffusion
models have also been effectively adapted to image restoration tasks, e.g.,
super-resolution and deblurring, aiming to recover high-quality images from
degraded inputs. Although existing zero-shot approaches enable pretrained
diffusion models to perform restoration tasks without additional fine-tuning,
these methods often suffer from prolonged iteration times in the denoising
process. To address this limitation, we propose a Quick Bypass Mechanism (QBM),
a strategy that significantly accelerates the denoising process by initializing
from an intermediate approximation, effectively bypassing early denoising
steps. Furthermore, recognizing that approximation may introduce
inconsistencies, we introduce a Revised Reverse Process (RRP), which adjusts
the weighting of random noise to enhance the stochasticity and mitigate
potential disharmony. We validate proposed methods on ImageNet-1K and CelebA-HQ
across multiple image restoration tasks, e.g., super-resolution, deblurring,
and compressed sensing. Our experimental results show that the proposed methods
can effectively accelerate existing methods while maintaining original
performance.

devise an AdaIN-Wavelet transform to balance content preservation and
stylization by blending low-frequency information of the warped reference with
high-frequency information of the input in the latent space. A style adapter is
also designed to provide style guidance from the warped reference. With the
stylized latent from AdaIN-Wavelet transform, we employ a dual-conditional

Abstract: Training native 3D texture generative models remains a fundamental yet
challenging problem, largely due to the limited availability of large-scale,
high-quality 3D texture datasets. This scarcity hinders generalization to
real-world scenarios. To address this, most existing methods finetune
foundation image generative models to exploit their learned visual priors.
However, these approaches typically generate only multi-view images and rely on
post-processing to produce UV texture maps -- an essential representation in
modern graphics pipelines. Such two-stage pipelines often suffer from error
accumulation and spatial inconsistencies across the 3D surface. In this paper,
we introduce SeqTex, a novel end-to-end framework that leverages the visual
knowledge encoded in pretrained video foundation models to directly generate
complete UV texture maps. Unlike previous methods that model the distribution
of UV textures in isolation, SeqTex reformulates the task as a sequence
generation problem, enabling the model to learn the joint distribution of
multi-view renderings and UV textures. This design effectively transfers the
consistent image-space priors from video foundation models into the UV domain.
To further enhance performance, we propose several architectural innovations: a
decoupled multi-view and UV branch design, geometry-informed attention to guide
cross-domain feature alignment, and adaptive token resolution to preserve fine
texture details while maintaining computational efficiency. Together, these
components allow SeqTex to fully utilize pretrained video priors and synthesize
high-fidelity UV texture maps without the need for post-processing. Extensive
experiments show that SeqTex achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
image-conditioned and text-conditioned 3D texture generation tasks, with
superior 3D consistency, texture-geometry alignment, and real-world
generalization.

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models have enabled 3D urban scene
generation from satellite imagery, unlocking promising applications in gaming,
digital twins, and beyond. However, most existing methods rely heavily on
neural rendering techniques, which hinder their ability to produce detailed 3D
structures on a broader scale, largely due to the inherent structural ambiguity
derived from relatively limited 2D observations. To address this challenge, we
propose Sat2City, a novel framework that synergizes the representational
capacity of sparse voxel grids with latent diffusion models, tailored
specifically for our novel 3D city dataset. Our approach is enabled by three
key components: (1) A cascaded latent diffusion framework that progressively
recovers 3D city structures from satellite imagery, (2) a Re-Hash operation at
its Variational Autoencoder (VAE) bottleneck to compute multi-scale feature
grids for stable appearance optimization and (3) an inverse sampling strategy
enabling implicit supervision for smooth appearance transitioning.To overcome
the challenge of collecting real-world city-scale 3D models with high-quality
geometry and appearance, we introduce a dataset of synthesized large-scale 3D
cities paired with satellite-view height maps. Validated on this dataset, our
framework generates detailed 3D structures from a single satellite image,
achieving superior fidelity compared to existing city generation models.

Abstract: With the rise and development of computer vision and LLMs, intelligence is
everywhere, especially for people and cars. However, for tremendous food
attributes (such as origin, quantity, weight, quality, sweetness, etc.),
existing research still mainly focuses on the study of categories. The reason
is the lack of a large and comprehensive benchmark for food. Besides, many food
attributes (such as sweetness, weight, and fine-grained categories) are
challenging to accurately percept solely through RGB cameras. To fulfill this
gap and promote the development of intelligent food analysis, in this paper, we
built the first large-scale spectral food (SFOOD) benchmark suite. We spent a
lot of manpower and equipment costs to organize existing food datasets and
collect hyperspectral images of hundreds of foods, and we used instruments to
experimentally determine food attributes such as sweetness and weight. The
resulting benchmark consists of 3,266 food categories and 2,351 k data points
for 17 main food categories. Extensive evaluations find that: (i) Large-scale
models are still poor at digitizing food. Compared to people and cars, food has
gradually become one of the most difficult objects to study; (ii) Spectrum data
are crucial for analyzing food properties (such as sweetness). Our benchmark
will be open source and continuously iterated for different food analysis
tasks.

Abstract: Deep neural networks for real-time video matting suffer significant
computational limitations on edge devices, hindering their adoption in
widespread applications such as online conferences and short-form video
production. Binarization emerges as one of the most common compression
approaches with compact 1-bit parameters and efficient bitwise operations.
However, accuracy and efficiency limitations exist in the binarized video
matting network due to its degenerated encoder and redundant decoder. Following
a theoretical analysis based on the information bottleneck principle, the
limitations are mainly caused by the degradation of prediction-relevant
information in the intermediate features and the redundant computation in
prediction-irrelevant areas. We present BiVM, an accurate and
resource-efficient Binarized neural network for Video Matting. First, we
present a series of binarized computation structures with elastic shortcuts and
evolvable topologies, enabling the constructed encoder backbone to extract
high-quality representation from input videos for accurate prediction. Second,
we sparse the intermediate feature of the binarized decoder by masking
homogeneous parts, allowing the decoder to focus on representation with diverse
details while alleviating the computation burden for efficient inference.
Furthermore, we construct a localized binarization-aware mimicking framework
with the information-guided strategy, prompting matting-related representation
in full-precision counterparts to be accurately and fully utilized.
Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed BiVM surpasses alternative
binarized video matting networks, including state-of-the-art (SOTA)
binarization methods, by a substantial margin. Moreover, our BiVM achieves
significant savings of 14.3x and 21.6x in computation and storage costs,
respectively. We also evaluate BiVM on ARM CPU hardware.

Abstract: Accurate localization using visual information is a critical yet challenging
task, especially in urban environments where nearby buildings and construction
sites significantly degrade GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) signal
quality. This issue underscores the importance of visual localization
techniques in scenarios where GNSS signals are unreliable. This paper proposes
U-ViLAR, a novel uncertainty-aware visual localization framework designed to
address these challenges while enabling adaptive localization using
high-definition (HD) maps or navigation maps. Specifically, our method first
extracts features from the input visual data and maps them into Bird's-Eye-View
(BEV) space to enhance spatial consistency with the map input. Subsequently, we
introduce: a) Perceptual Uncertainty-guided Association, which mitigates errors
caused by perception uncertainty, and b) Localization Uncertainty-guided
Registration, which reduces errors introduced by localization uncertainty. By
effectively balancing the coarse-grained large-scale localization capability of
association with the fine-grained precise localization capability of
registration, our approach achieves robust and accurate localization.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple localization tasks. Furthermore, our model has
undergone rigorous testing on large-scale autonomous driving fleets and has
demonstrated stable performance in various challenging urban scenarios.

Abstract: Camera relocalization, a cornerstone capability of modern computer vision,
accurately determines a camera's position and orientation (6-DoF) from images
and is essential for applications in augmented reality (AR), mixed reality
(MR), autonomous driving, delivery drones, and robotic navigation. Unlike
traditional deep learning-based methods that regress camera pose from images in
a single scene, which often lack generalization and robustness in diverse
environments, we propose MVL-Loc, a novel end-to-end multi-scene 6-DoF camera
relocalization framework. MVL-Loc leverages pretrained world knowledge from
vision-language models (VLMs) and incorporates multimodal data to generalize
across both indoor and outdoor settings. Furthermore, natural language is
employed as a directive tool to guide the multi-scene learning process,
facilitating semantic understanding of complex scenes and capturing spatial
relationships among objects. Extensive experiments on the 7Scenes and Cambridge
Landmarks datasets demonstrate MVL-Loc's robustness and state-of-the-art
performance in real-world multi-scene camera relocalization, with improved
accuracy in both positional and orientational estimates.

Abstract: Human motion generation has advanced rapidly in recent years, yet the
critical problem of creating spatially grounded, context-aware gestures has
been largely overlooked. Existing models typically specialize either in
descriptive motion generation, such as locomotion and object interaction, or in
isolated co-speech gesture synthesis aligned with utterance semantics. However,
both lines of work often treat motion and environmental grounding separately,
limiting advances toward embodied, communicative agents. To address this gap,
our work introduces a multimodal dataset and framework for grounded gesture
generation, combining two key resources: (1) a synthetic dataset of spatially
grounded referential gestures, and (2) MM-Conv, a VR-based dataset capturing
two-party dialogues. Together, they provide over 7.7 hours of synchronized
motion, speech, and 3D scene information, standardized in the HumanML3D format.
Our framework further connects to a physics-based simulator, enabling synthetic
data generation and situated evaluation. By bridging gesture modeling and
spatial grounding, our contribution establishes a foundation for advancing
research in situated gesture generation and grounded multimodal interaction.

Conclusion: 该方法能高效检测连续数据流中的新颖性，提升数据集质量。

Abstract: High-quality datasets are essential for training robust perception systems in
autonomous driving. However, real-world data collection is often biased toward
common scenes and objects, leaving novel cases underrepresented. This imbalance
hinders model generalization and compromises safety. The core issue is the
curse of rarity. Over time, novel events occur infrequently, and standard
logging methods fail to capture them effectively. As a result, large volumes of
redundant data are stored, while critical novel cases are diluted, leading to
biased datasets. This work presents a real-time data selection method focused
on object-level novelty detection to build more balanced and diverse datasets.
The method assigns a data-driven novelty score to image frames using a novel
dynamic Mean Shift algorithm. It models normal content based on mean and
covariance statistics to identify frames with novel objects, discarding those
with redundant elements. The main findings show that reducing the training
dataset size with this method can improve model performance, whereas higher
redundancy tends to degrade it. Moreover, as data redundancy increases, more
aggressive filtering becomes both possible and beneficial. While random
sampling can offer some gains, it often leads to overfitting and
unpredictability in outcomes. The proposed method supports real-time deployment
with 32 frames per second and is constant over time. By continuously updating
the definition of normal content, it enables efficient detection of novelties
in a continuous data stream.

Abstract: 4D radar has received significant attention in autonomous driving thanks to
its robustness under adverse weathers. Due to the sparse points and noisy

Conclusion: HiLa通过分层视觉语言协作显著提升了生存预测性能，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Survival prediction using whole-slide images (WSIs) is crucial in cancer
re-search. Despite notable success, existing approaches are limited by their
reliance on sparse slide-level labels, which hinders the learning of
discriminative repre-sentations from gigapixel WSIs. Recently, vision language
(VL) models, which incorporate additional language supervision, have emerged as
a promising solu-tion. However, VL-based survival prediction remains largely
unexplored due to two key challenges. First, current methods often rely on only
one simple lan-guage prompt and basic cosine similarity, which fails to learn
fine-grained associ-ations between multi-faceted linguistic information and
visual features within WSI, resulting in inadequate vision-language alignment.
Second, these methods primarily exploit patch-level information, overlooking
the intrinsic hierarchy of WSIs and their interactions, causing ineffective
modeling of hierarchical interac-tions. To tackle these problems, we propose a
novel Hierarchical vision-Language collaboration (HiLa) framework for improved
survival prediction. Specifically, HiLa employs pretrained feature extractors
to generate hierarchical visual features from WSIs at both patch and region
levels. At each level, a series of language prompts describing various
survival-related attributes are constructed and aligned with visual features
via Optimal Prompt Learning (OPL). This ap-proach enables the comprehensive
learning of discriminative visual features cor-responding to different
survival-related attributes from prompts, thereby improv-ing vision-language
alignment. Furthermore, we introduce two modules, i.e., Cross-Level Propagation
(CLP) and Mutual Contrastive Learning (MCL) to maximize hierarchical
cooperation by promoting interactions and consistency be-tween patch and region
levels. Experiments on three TCGA datasets demonstrate our SOTA performance.

Conclusion: LTMSformer在轨迹预测中高效且性能优越。

Abstract: It has been challenging to model the complex temporal-spatial dependencies
between agents for trajectory prediction. As each state of an agent is closely
related to the states of adjacent time steps, capturing the local temporal
dependency is beneficial for prediction, while most studies often overlook it.
Besides, learning the high-order motion state attributes is expected to enhance
spatial interaction modeling, but it is rarely seen in previous works. To
address this, we propose a lightweight framework, LTMSformer, to extract
temporal-spatial interaction features for multi-modal trajectory prediction.
Specifically, we introduce a Local Trend-Aware Attention mechanism to capture
the local temporal dependency by leveraging a convolutional attention mechanism
with hierarchical local time boxes. Next, to model the spatial interaction
dependency, we build a Motion State Encoder to incorporate high-order motion
state attributes, such as acceleration, jerk, heading, etc. To further refine
the trajectory prediction, we propose a Lightweight Proposal Refinement Module
that leverages Multi-Layer Perceptrons for trajectory embedding and generates
the refined trajectories with fewer model parameters. Experiment results on the
Argoverse 1 dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline
HiVT-64, reducing the minADE by approximately 4.35%, the minFDE by 8.74%, and
the MR by 20%. We also achieve higher accuracy than HiVT-128 with a 68%
reduction in model size.

ChangeBridge, a conditional spatiotemporal diffusion model. Given pre-event
images and conditioned on multimodal spatial controls (e.g., text prompts,
instance layouts, and semantic maps), ChangeBridge can synthesize post-event
images. The core idea behind ChangeBridge is to modeling the noise-to-image
diffusion model, as a pre-to-post diffusion bridge. Conditioned on multimodal
controls, ChangeBridge leverages a stochastic Brownian-bridge diffusion,
directly modeling the spatiotemporal evolution between pre-event and post-event
states. To the best of our knowledge, ChangeBridge is the first spatiotemporal
generative model with multimodal controls for remote sensing. Experimental
results demonstrate that ChangeBridge can simulate high-fidelity future
scenarios aligned with given conditions, including event and event-driven

Abstract: Digital orthodontics represents a prominent and critical application of
computer vision technology in the medical field. So far, the labor-intensive
process of collecting clinical data, particularly in acquiring paired 3D
orthodontic teeth models, constitutes a crucial bottleneck for developing tooth
arrangement neural networks. Although numerous general 3D shape generation
methods have been proposed, most of them focus on single-object generation and
are insufficient for generating anatomically structured teeth models, each
comprising 24-32 segmented teeth. In this paper, we propose TeethGenerator, a
novel two-stage framework designed to synthesize paired 3D teeth models pre-
and post-orthodontic, aiming to facilitate the training of downstream tooth
arrangement networks. Specifically, our approach consists of two key modules:
(1) a teeth shape generation module that leverages a diffusion model to learn
the distribution of morphological characteristics of teeth, enabling the
generation of diverse post-orthodontic teeth models; and (2) a teeth style
generation module that synthesizes corresponding pre-orthodontic teeth models
by incorporating desired styles as conditional inputs. Extensive qualitative
and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our synthetic dataset aligns
closely with the distribution of real orthodontic data, and promotes tooth
alignment performance significantly when combined with real data for training.

Abstract: We present a diffusion-based portrait shadow removal approach that can
robustly produce high-fidelity results. Unlike previous methods, we cast shadow
removal as diffusion-based inpainting. To this end, we first train a
shadow-independent structure extraction network on a real-world portrait
dataset with various synthetic lighting conditions, which allows to generate a
shadow-independent structure map including facial details while excluding the
unwanted shadow boundaries. The structure map is then used as condition to
train a structure-guided inpainting diffusion model for removing shadows in a
generative manner. Finally, to restore the fine-scale details (e.g., eyelashes,
moles and spots) that may not be captured by the structure map, we take the
gradients inside the shadow regions as guidance and train a detail restoration
diffusion model to refine the shadow removal result. Extensive experiments on
the benchmark datasets show that our method clearly outperforms existing
methods, and is effective to avoid previously common issues such as facial
identity tampering, shadow residual, color distortion, structure blurring, and
loss of details. Our code is available at

Abstract: Accurate detection of anatomic landmarks is essential for assessing alveolar
bone and root conditions, thereby optimizing clinical outcomes in orthodontics,
periodontics, and implant dentistry. Manual annotation of landmarks on
cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) by dentists is time-consuming,
labor-intensive, and subject to inter-observer variability. Deep learning-based
automated methods present a promising approach to streamline this process
efficiently. However, the scarcity of training data and the high cost of expert
annotations hinder the adoption of conventional deep learning techniques. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce GeoSapiens, a novel few-shot learning
framework designed for robust dental landmark detection using limited annotated
CBCT of anterior teeth. Our GeoSapiens framework comprises two key components:
(1) a robust baseline adapted from Sapiens, a foundational model that has
achieved state-of-the-art performance in human-centric vision tasks, and (2) a
novel geometric loss function that improves the model's capacity to capture
critical geometric relationships among anatomical structures. Experiments
conducted on our collected dataset of anterior teeth landmarks revealed that
GeoSapiens surpassed existing landmark detection methods, outperforming the
leading approach by an 8.18% higher success detection rate at a strict 0.5 mm
threshold-a standard widely recognized in dental diagnostics. Code is available

Abstract: We present MatDecompSDF, a novel framework for recovering high-fidelity 3D
shapes and decomposing their physically-based material properties from
multi-view images. The core challenge of inverse rendering lies in the
ill-posed disentanglement of geometry, materials, and illumination from 2D
observations. Our method addresses this by jointly optimizing three neural
components: a neural Signed Distance Function (SDF) to represent complex
geometry, a spatially-varying neural field for predicting PBR material
parameters (albedo, roughness, metallic), and an MLP-based model for capturing
unknown environmental lighting. The key to our approach is a physically-based
differentiable rendering layer that connects these 3D properties to the input
images, allowing for end-to-end optimization. We introduce a set of carefully
designed physical priors and geometric regularizations, including a material
smoothness loss and an Eikonal loss, to effectively constrain the problem and
achieve robust decomposition. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and
real-world datasets (e.g., DTU) demonstrate that MatDecompSDF surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in geometric accuracy, material fidelity, and novel
view synthesis. Crucially, our method produces editable and relightable assets
that can be seamlessly integrated into standard graphics pipelines, validating
its practical utility for digital content creation.

Conclusion: GraphBrep通过显式表示拓扑，有效降低了计算成本，同时保持了生成质量。

Abstract: Direct B-Rep generation is increasingly important in CAD workflows,
eliminating costly modeling sequence data and supporting complex features. A
key challenge is modeling joint distribution of the misaligned geometry and
topology. Existing methods tend to implicitly embed topology into the geometric
features of edges. Although this integration ensures feature alignment, it also
causes edge geometry to carry more redundant structural information compared to
the original B-Rep, leading to significantly higher computational cost. To
reduce redundancy, we propose GraphBrep, a B-Rep generation model that
explicitly represents and learns compact topology. Following the original
structure of B-Rep, we construct an undirected weighted graph to represent
surface topology. A graph diffusion model is employed to learn topology
conditioned on surface features, serving as the basis for determining
connectivity between primitive surfaces. The explicit representation ensures a
compact data structure, effectively reducing computational cost during both
training and inference. Experiments on two large-scale unconditional datasets
and one category-conditional dataset demonstrate the proposed method
significantly reduces training and inference times (up to 31.3% and 56.3% for
given datasets, respectively) while maintaining high-quality CAD generation
compared with SOTA.

Conclusion: PointGAC通过聚类中心对齐策略，提升了特征学习的通用性和效率。

Abstract: Most masked point cloud modeling (MPM) methods follow a regression paradigm
to reconstruct the coordinate or feature of masked regions. However, they tend
to over-constrain the model to learn the details of the masked region,
resulting in failure to capture generalized features. To address this
limitation, we propose \textbf{\textit{PointGAC}}, a novel clustering-based MPM
method that aims to align the feature distribution of masked regions.
Specially, it features an online codebook-guided teacher-student framework.
Firstly, it presents a geometry-aware partitioning strategy to extract initial
patches. Then, the teacher model updates a codebook via online k-means based on
features extracted from the complete patches. This procedure facilitates
codebook vectors to become cluster centers. Afterward, we assigns the unmasked
features to their corresponding cluster centers, and the student model aligns
the assignment for the reconstructed masked features. This strategy focuses on
identifying the cluster centers to which the masked features belong, enabling
the model to learn more generalized feature representations. Benefiting from a
proposed codebook maintenance mechanism, codebook vectors are actively updated,
which further increases the efficiency of semantic feature learning.
Experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on various
downstream tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/LAB123-tech/PointGAC

Conclusion: AutoHDR在自动化历史文档修复方面取得显著进展，对文化遗产保护有重要贡献。

Abstract: Historical documents represent an invaluable cultural heritage, yet have
undergone significant degradation over time through tears, water erosion, and
oxidation. Existing Historical Document Restoration (HDR) methods primarily
focus on single modality or limited-size restoration, failing to meet practical
needs. To fill this gap, we present a full-page HDR dataset (FPHDR) and a novel
automated HDR solution (AutoHDR). Specifically, FPHDR comprises 1,633 real and
6,543 synthetic images with character-level and line-level locations, as well
as character annotations in different damage grades. AutoHDR mimics historians'
restoration workflows through a three-stage approach: OCR-assisted damage
localization, vision-language context text prediction, and patch autoregressive
appearance restoration. The modular architecture of AutoHDR enables seamless
human-machine collaboration, allowing for flexible intervention and
optimization at each restoration stage. Experiments demonstrate AutoHDR's
remarkable performance in HDR. When processing severely damaged documents, our
method improves OCR accuracy from 46.83\% to 84.05\%, with further enhancement
to 94.25\% through human-machine collaboration. We believe this work represents
a significant advancement in automated historical document restoration and
contributes substantially to cultural heritage preservation. The model and

Result: 在Pmi-GMA基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在预测不良运动模式方面具有有效性和泛化性。

Conclusion: UDF-GMA通过显式建模不确定性，提高了自动化GMA的临床可靠性。

Abstract: General movement assessment (GMA) is a non-invasive tool for the early
detection of brain dysfunction through the qualitative assessment of general
movements, and the development of automated methods can broaden its
application. However, mainstream pose-based automated GMA methods are prone to
uncertainty due to limited high-quality data and noisy pose estimation,
hindering clinical reliability without reliable uncertainty measures. In this
work, we introduce UDF-GMA which explicitly models epistemic uncertainty in
model parameters and aleatoric uncertainty from data noise for pose-based
automated GMA. UDF-GMA effectively disentangles uncertainties by directly
modelling aleatoric uncertainty and estimating epistemic uncertainty through
Bayesian approximation. We further propose fusing these uncertainties with the
embedded motion representation to enhance class separation. Extensive
experiments on the Pmi-GMA benchmark dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalisability of the proposed approach in predicting poor repertoire.

Abstract: Accurate lane topology is essential for autonomous driving, yet traditional
methods struggle to model the complex, non-linear structures-such as loops and
bidirectional lanes-prevalent in real-world road structure. We present
SeqGrowGraph, a novel framework that learns lane topology as a chain of graph
expansions, inspired by human map-drawing processes. Representing the lane
graph as a directed graph $G=(V,E)$, with intersections ($V$) and centerlines
($E$), SeqGrowGraph incrementally constructs this graph by introducing one
vertex at a time. At each step, an adjacency matrix ($A$) expands from $n
\times n$ to $(n+1) \times (n+1)$ to encode connectivity, while a geometric
matrix ($M$) captures centerline shapes as quadratic B\'ezier curves. The graph
is serialized into sequences, enabling a transformer model to autoregressively
predict the chain of expansions, guided by a depth-first search ordering.
Evaluated on nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets, SeqGrowGraph achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: CMET是一种高效、稳定且适用于各种数据的可靠指标。

Abstract: Due to rapid advancements in technology, datasets are available from various
domains. In order to carry out more relevant and appropriate analysis, it is
often necessary to project the dataset into a higher or lower dimensional space
based on requirement. Projecting the data in a higher-dimensional space helps
in unfolding intricate patterns, enhancing the performance of the underlying
models. On the other hand, dimensionality reduction is helpful in denoising
data while capturing maximal information, as well as reducing execution time
and memory.In this context, it is not always statistically evident whether the
transformed embedding retains the local and global structure of the original
data. Most of the existing metrics that are used for comparing the local and
global shape of the embedding against the original one are highly expensive in
terms of time and space complexity. In order to address this issue, the
objective of this study is to formulate a novel metric, called Clustering
guided METric (CMET), for quantifying embedding quality. It is effective to
serve the purpose of quantitative comparison between an embedding and the
original data. CMET consists of two scores, viz., CMET_L and CMET_G, that
measure the degree of local and global shape preservation capability,
respectively. The efficacy of CMET has been demonstrated on a wide variety of
datasets, including four synthetic, two biological, and two image datasets.
Results reflect the favorable performance of CMET against the state-of-the-art
methods. Capability to handle both small and large data, low algorithmic
complexity, better and stable performance across all kinds of data, and
different choices of hyper-parameters feature CMET as a reliable metric.

Abstract: Identifying regions affected by disasters is a vital step in effectively
managing and planning relief and rescue efforts. Unlike the traditional
approaches of manually assessing post-disaster damage, analyzing images of
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offers an objective and reliable way to assess
the damage. In the past, segmentation techniques have been adopted to identify
post-flood damage in UAV aerial images. However, most of these supervised
learning approaches rely on manually annotated datasets. Indeed, annotating
images is a time-consuming and error-prone task that requires domain expertise.
This work focuses on leveraging self-supervised features to accurately identify
flooded regions in UAV aerial images. This work proposes two
encoder-decoder-based segmentation approaches, which integrate the visual
features learned from DINOv2 with the traditional encoder backbone. This study
investigates the generalization of self-supervised features for UAV aerial
images. Specifically, we evaluate the effectiveness of features from the DINOv2
model, trained on non-aerial images, for segmenting aerial images, noting the
distinct perspectives between the two image types. Our results demonstrate that
DINOv2's self-supervised pretraining on natural images generates transferable,
general-purpose visual features that streamline the development of aerial
segmentation workflows. By leveraging these features as a foundation, we
significantly reduce reliance on labor-intensive manual annotation processes,
enabling high-accuracy segmentation with limited labeled aerial data.

Abstract: Earth System Models (ESM) are our main tool for projecting the impacts of
climate change. However, running these models at sufficient resolution for
local-scale risk-assessments is not computationally feasible. Deep
learning-based super-resolution models offer a promising solution to downscale
ESM outputs to higher resolutions by learning from data. Yet, due to regional
variations in climatic processes, these models typically require retraining for
each geographical area-demanding high-resolution observational data, which is
unevenly available across the globe. This highlights the need to assess how
well these models generalize across geographic regions. To address this, we
introduce RainShift, a dataset and benchmark for evaluating downscaling under
geographic distribution shifts. We evaluate state-of-the-art downscaling
approaches including GANs and diffusion models in generalizing across data gaps
between the Global North and Global South. Our findings reveal substantial
performance drops in out-of-distribution regions, depending on model and
geographic area. While expanding the training domain generally improves
generalization, it is insufficient to overcome shifts between geographically
distinct regions. We show that addressing these shifts through, for example,
data alignment can improve spatial generalization. Our work advances the global
applicability of downscaling methods and represents a step toward reducing
inequities in access to high-resolution climate information.

address these limitations, we introduce Hear-Your-Click, an interactive V2A

Object-aware Contrastive Audio-Visual Fine-tuning (OCAV) with a Mask-guided
Visual Encoder (MVE) to obtain object-level visual features aligned with
corresponding audio segments. Furthermore, we tailor two data augmentation
strategies: Random Video Stitching (RVS) and Mask-guided Loudness Modulation
(MLM), aimed at enhancing the model's sensitivity to the segmented objects. To
effectively measure the audio-visual correspondence, we design a new evaluation

Abstract: As a long-term complication of diabetes, diabetic retinopathy (DR) progresses
slowly, potentially taking years to threaten vision. An accurate and robust
evaluation of its severity is vital to ensure prompt management and care.
Ordinal regression leverages the underlying inherent order between categories
to achieve superior performance beyond traditional classification. However,
there exist challenges leading to lower DR classification performance: 1) The
uneven distribution of DR severity levels, characterized by a long-tailed
pattern, adds complexity to the grading process. 2)The ambiguity in defining
category boundaries introduces additional challenges, making the classification
process more complex and prone to inconsistencies. This work proposes a novel
autoregressive ordinal regression method called AOR-DR to address the above
challenges by leveraging the clinical knowledge of inherent ordinal information
in DR grading dataset settings. Specifically, we decompose the DR grading task
into a series of ordered steps by fusing the prediction of the previous steps
with extracted image features as conditions for the current prediction step.
Additionally, we exploit the diffusion process to facilitate conditional
probability modeling, enabling the direct use of continuous global image
features for autoregression without relearning contextual information from
patch-level features. This ensures the effectiveness of the autoregressive
process and leverages the capabilities of pre-trained large-scale foundation
models. Extensive experiments were conducted on four large-scale publicly
available color fundus datasets, demonstrating our model's effectiveness and
superior performance over six recent state-of-the-art ordinal regression
methods. The implementation code is available at

Abstract: Multimodal ophthalmic imaging-based diagnosis integrates color fundus image
with optical coherence tomography (OCT) to provide a comprehensive view of
ocular pathologies. However, the uneven global distribution of healthcare
resources often results in real-world clinical scenarios encountering
incomplete multimodal data, which significantly compromises diagnostic
accuracy. Existing commonly used pipelines, such as modality imputation and
distillation methods, face notable limitations: 1)Imputation methods struggle
with accurately reconstructing key lesion features, since OCT lesions are
localized, while fundus images vary in style. 2)distillation methods rely
heavily on fully paired multimodal training data. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel multimodal alignment and fusion framework capable of
robustly handling missing modalities in the task of ophthalmic diagnostics. By
considering the distinctive feature characteristics of OCT and fundus images,
we emphasize the alignment of semantic features within the same category and
explicitly learn soft matching between modalities, allowing the missing
modality to utilize existing modality information, achieving robust cross-modal
feature alignment under the missing modality. Specifically, we leverage the
Optimal Transport for multi-scale modality feature alignment: class-wise
alignment through predicted class prototypes and feature-wise alignment via
cross-modal shared feature transport. Furthermore, we propose an asymmetric
fusion strategy that effectively exploits the distinct characteristics of OCT
and fundus modalities. Extensive evaluations on three large ophthalmic
multimodal datasets demonstrate our model's superior performance under various
modality-incomplete scenarios, achieving Sota performance in both complete
modality and inter-modality incompleteness conditions. Code is available at

Abstract: The recent proliferation of photorealistic AI-generated images (AIGI) has
raised urgent concerns about their potential misuse, particularly on social
media platforms. Current state-of-the-art AIGI detection methods typically rely
on large, deep neural architectures, creating significant computational
barriers to real-time, large-scale deployment on platforms like social media.
To challenge this reliance on computationally intensive models, we introduce
LAID, the first framework -- to our knowledge -- that benchmarks and evaluates
the detection performance and efficiency of off-the-shelf lightweight neural
networks. In this framework, we comprehensively train and evaluate selected
models on a representative subset of the GenImage dataset across spatial,
spectral, and fusion image domains. Our results demonstrate that lightweight
models can achieve competitive accuracy, even under adversarial conditions,
while incurring substantially lower memory and computation costs compared to
current state-of-the-art methods. This study offers valuable insight into the
trade-off between efficiency and performance in AIGI detection and lays a
foundation for the development of practical, scalable, and trustworthy
detection systems. The source code of LAID can be found at:

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-3D generation improve the visual quality of
Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) and its variants by directly connecting
Consistency Distillation (CD) to score distillation. However, due to the
imbalance between self-consistency and cross-consistency, these CD-based
methods inherently suffer from improper conditional guidance, leading to
sub-optimal generation results. To address this issue, we present
SegmentDreamer, a novel framework designed to fully unleash the potential of
consistency models for high-fidelity text-to-3D generation. Specifically, we
reformulate SDS through the proposed Segmented Consistency Trajectory
Distillation (SCTD), effectively mitigating the imbalance issues by explicitly
defining the relationship between self- and cross-consistency. Moreover, SCTD
partitions the Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE)
trajectory into multiple sub-trajectories and ensures consistency within each
segment, which can theoretically provide a significantly tighter upper bound on
distillation error. Additionally, we propose a distillation pipeline for a more
swift and stable generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
SegmentDreamer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality, enabling
high-fidelity 3D asset creation through 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS).

Conclusion: LiMA为自动驾驶提供了更有效的预训练范式。

Abstract: LiDAR representation learning aims to extract rich structural and semantic
information from large-scale, readily available datasets, reducing reliance on
costly human annotations. However, existing LiDAR representation strategies
often overlook the inherent spatiotemporal cues in LiDAR sequences, limiting
their effectiveness. In this work, we propose LiMA, a novel long-term
image-to-LiDAR Memory Aggregation framework that explicitly captures longer
range temporal correlations to enhance LiDAR representation learning. LiMA
comprises three key components: 1) a Cross-View Aggregation module that aligns
and fuses overlapping regions across neighboring camera views, constructing a
more unified and redundancy-free memory bank; 2) a Long-Term Feature
Propagation mechanism that efficiently aligns and integrates multi-frame image
features, reinforcing temporal coherence during LiDAR representation learning;
and 3) a Cross-Sequence Memory Alignment strategy that enforces consistency
across driving sequences, improving generalization to unseen environments. LiMA
maintains high pretraining efficiency and incurs no additional computational
overhead during downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on mainstream
LiDAR-based perception benchmarks demonstrate that LiMA significantly improves
both LiDAR semantic segmentation and 3D object detection. We hope this work
inspires more effective pretraining paradigms for autonomous driving. The code
has be made publicly accessible for future research.

TL;DR: 论文开发了可解释的深度学习模型，结合临床数据和影像数据预测中风患者的治疗效果，但个体化治疗效果预测仍需改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管机械取栓已成为大血管闭塞中风的标准治疗方法，但仅50%的患者预后良好，因此需要更准确的预测模型。

Method: 使用449名患者的临床数据和影像数据（NCCT和CTA），结合新型基础模型，开发可解释的深度学习模型。

Result: 临床变量对功能预后预测表现良好（AUC 0.719），加入CTA影像后略有提升（AUC 0.737），但NCCT影像未带来改进。个体化治疗效果预测能力有限。

Conclusion: 模型整合了影像和临床数据，性能达到先进水平，但个体化治疗效果预测仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: Mechanical thrombectomy has become the standard of care in patients with
stroke due to large vessel occlusion (LVO). However, only 50% of successfully
treated patients show a favorable outcome. We developed and evaluated
interpretable deep learning models to predict functional outcomes in terms of
the modified Rankin Scale score alongside individualized treatment effects
(ITEs) using data of 449 LVO stroke patients from a randomized clinical trial.
Besides clinical variables, we considered non-contrast CT (NCCT) and
angiography (CTA) scans which were integrated using novel foundation models to
make use of advanced imaging information. Clinical variables had a good
predictive power for binary functional outcome prediction (AUC of 0.719 [0.666,
0.774]) which could slightly be improved when adding CTA imaging (AUC of 0.737
[0.687, 0.795]). Adding NCCT scans or a combination of NCCT and CTA scans to
clinical features yielded no improvement. The most important clinical predictor
for functional outcome was pre-stroke disability. While estimated ITEs were
well calibrated to the average treatment effect, discriminatory ability was
limited indicated by a C-for-Benefit statistic of around 0.55 in all models. In
summary, the models allowed us to jointly integrate CT imaging and clinical
features while achieving state-of-the-art prediction performance and ITE
estimates. Yet, further research is needed to particularly improve ITE
estimation.

Method: 提出EvRWKV框架，包含Cross-RWKV模块（基于RWKV架构的跨模态融合）和EISFE模块（频域噪声抑制与空间域对齐）。

Result: 在真实低光数据集上表现优异，噪声抑制、细节恢复和视觉清晰度提升。

Conclusion: EvRWKV在低光图像增强中达到先进水平。

Abstract: Capturing high-quality visual content under low-light conditions remains a
challenging problem due to severe noise, motion blur, and underexposure, which
degrade the performance of downstream applications. Traditional frame-based
low-light enhancement methods often amplify noise or fail to preserve
structural details, especially in real-world scenarios. Event cameras, offering
high dynamic range and microsecond temporal resolution by asynchronously
capturing brightness changes, emerge as promising alternatives for low-light
imaging. However, existing event-image fusion methods suffer from simplistic
fusion strategies and inadequate handling of spatial-temporal misalignment and
noise. To address these challenges, we propose EvRWKV, a novel framework that
enables continuous cross-modal interaction through dual-domain processing. Our
approach incorporates a Cross-RWKV module, leveraging the Receptance Weighted
Key Value (RWKV) architecture for fine-grained temporal and cross-modal fusion,
and an Event Image Spectral Fusion Enhancer (EISFE) module, which jointly
performs adaptive frequency-domain noise suppression and spatial-domain
deformable convolution alignment. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
evaluations on real-world low-light datasets(SDE, SDSD, RELED) demonstrate that
EvRWKV achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively enhancing image
quality by suppressing noise, restoring structural details, and improving
visual clarity in challenging low-light conditions.

Abstract: Talking head generation with arbitrary identities and speech audio remains a
crucial problem in the realm of digital humans and the virtual metaverse.
Recently, diffusion models have become a popular generative technique in this
field with their strong generation and generalization capabilities. However,
several challenges remain for diffusion-based methods: 1) inefficient inference
and visual artifacts, which arise from the implicit latent space of Variational
Auto-Encoders (VAE), complicating the diffusion process; 2) authentic facial
expressions and head movements, resulting from insufficient multi-modal
information interaction. In this paper, MoDA handle these challenges by 1)
defines a joint parameter space to bridge motion generation and neural
rendering, and leverages flow matching to simplify the diffusion learning
process; 2) introduces a multi-modal diffusion architecture to model the
interaction among noisy motion, audio, and auxiliary conditions, ultimately
enhancing overall facial expressiveness. Subsequently, a coarse-to-fine fusion
strategy is adopted to progressively integrate different modalities, ensuring
effective integration across feature spaces. Experimental results demonstrate
that MoDA significantly improves video diversity, realism, and efficiency,
making it suitable for real-world applications.

Conclusion: PhotIQA数据集支持开发和测试全参考和无参考IQA方法，并适用于光声成像以外的领域。

Abstract: Image quality assessment (IQA) is crucial in the evaluation stage of novel
algorithms operating on images, including traditional and machine learning
based methods. Due to the lack of available quality-rated medical images, most
commonly used IQA methods employing reference images (i.e. full-reference IQA)
have been developed and tested for natural images. Reported application
inconsistencies arising when employing such measures for medical images are not
surprising, as they rely on different properties than natural images. In
photoacoustic imaging (PAI), especially, standard benchmarking approaches for
assessing the quality of image reconstructions are lacking. PAI is a
multi-physics imaging modality, in which two inverse problems have to be
solved, which makes the application of IQA measures uniquely challenging due to
both, acoustic and optical, artifacts.
  To support the development and testing of full- and no-reference IQA measures
we assembled PhotIQA, a data set consisting of 1134 reconstructed photoacoustic
(PA) images that were rated by 2 experts across five quality properties
(overall quality, edge visibility, homogeneity, inclusion and background
intensity), where the detailed rating enables usage beyond PAI. To allow
full-reference assessment, highly characterised imaging test objects were used,
providing a ground truth. Our baseline experiments show that HaarPSI$_{med}$
significantly outperforms SSIM in correlating with the quality ratings (SRCC:
0.83 vs. 0.62). The dataset is publicly available at

Conclusion: 3D PixBrush为3D网格编辑提供了一种无需用户输入的自动化解决方案，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: We present 3D PixBrush, a method for performing image-driven edits of local
regions on 3D meshes. 3D PixBrush predicts a localization mask and a
synthesized texture that faithfully portray the object in the reference image.
Our predicted localizations are both globally coherent and locally precise.
Globally - our method contextualizes the object in the reference image and
automatically positions it onto the input mesh. Locally - our method produces
masks that conform to the geometry of the reference image. Notably, our method
does not require any user input (in the form of scribbles or bounding boxes) to
achieve accurate localizations. Instead, our method predicts a localization
mask on the 3D mesh from scratch. To achieve this, we propose a modification to
the score distillation sampling technique which incorporates both the predicted
localization and the reference image, referred to as localization-modulated
image guidance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed technique on a
wide variety of meshes and images.

Abstract: Interactive time-varying volume visualization is challenging due to its
complex spatiotemporal features and sheer size of the dataset. Recent works
transform the original discrete time-varying volumetric data into continuous
Implicit Neural Representations (INR) to address the issues of compression,
rendering, and super-resolution in both spatial and temporal domains. However,
training the INR takes a long time to converge, especially when handling
large-scale time-varying volumetric datasets. In this work, we proposed F-Hash,
a novel feature-based multi-resolution Tesseract encoding architecture to
greatly enhance the convergence speed compared with existing input encoding
methods for modeling time-varying volumetric data. The proposed design
incorporates multi-level collision-free hash functions that map dynamic 4D
multi-resolution embedding grids without bucket waste, achieving high encoding
capacity with compact encoding parameters. Our encoding method is agnostic to
time-varying feature detection methods, making it a unified encoding solution
for feature tracking and evolution visualization. Experiments show the F-Hash
achieves state-of-the-art convergence speed in training various time-varying
volumetric datasets for diverse features. We also proposed an adaptive ray
marching algorithm to optimize the sample streaming for faster rendering of the
time-varying neural representation.

Abstract: Accurate vessel segmentation is crucial to assist in clinical diagnosis by
medical experts. However,
  the intricate tree-like tubular structure of blood vessels poses significant
challenges for existing
  segmentation algorithms. Small vascular branches are often overlooked due to
their low contrast
  compared to surrounding tissues, leading to incomplete vessel segmentation.
Furthermore, the
  complex vascular topology prevents the model from accurately capturing and
reconstructing vascular
  structure, resulting in incorrect topology, such as breakpoints at the
bifurcation of the vascular tree.
  To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel vessel segmentation
framework called PASC Net. It includes two key modules: a plug-and-play shape
self-learning convolutional (SSL) module
  that optimizes convolution kernel design, and a hierarchical topological
constraint (HTC) module
  that ensures vascular connectivity through topological constraints.
Specifically, the SSL module
  enhances adaptability to vascular structures by optimizing conventional
convolutions into learnable
  strip convolutions, which improves the network's ability to perceive
fine-grained features of tubular
  anatomies. Furthermore, to better preserve the coherence and integrity of
vascular topology, the HTC
  module incorporates hierarchical topological constraints-spanning linear,
planar, and volumetric
  levels-which serve to regularize the network's representation of vascular
continuity and structural
  consistency. We replaced the standard convolutional layers in U-Net, FCN,
U-Mamba, and nnUNet
  with SSL convolutions, leading to consistent performance improvements across
all architectures.
  Furthermore, when integrated into the nnUNet framework, our method
outperformed other methods
  on multiple metrics, achieving state-of-the-art vascular segmentation
performance.

Abstract: Ray tracing is a widely used deterministic method for radio propagation
simulations, capable of producing physically accurate multipath components. The

propagation simulator that operates directly on point clouds. We showcase the
efficiency of our method by simulating multi-bounce propagation paths with up
to five interactions with specular reflections and diffuse scattering in two
indoor scenarios, each completing in less than 90 ms. Lastly, we demonstrate
how the differentiability of electromagnetic computations can be combined with
segmentation labels to learn the electromagnetic properties of the environment.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has emerged as a prominent research direction in
point cloud processing. While existing models predominantly concentrate on
reconstruction tasks at higher encoder layers, they often neglect the effective
utilization of low-level local features, which are typically employed solely
for activation computations rather than directly contributing to reconstruction
tasks. To overcome this limitation, we introduce PointAMaLR, a novel
self-supervised learning framework that enhances feature representation and
processing accuracy through attention-guided multi-scale local reconstruction.
PointAMaLR implements hierarchical reconstruction across multiple local
regions, with lower layers focusing on fine-scale feature restoration while
upper layers address coarse-scale feature reconstruction, thereby enabling
complex inter-patch interactions. Furthermore, to augment feature
representation capabilities, we incorporate a Local Attention (LA) module in
the embedding layer to enhance semantic feature understanding. Comprehensive
experiments on benchmark datasets ModelNet and ShapeNet demonstrate
PointAMaLR's superior accuracy and quality in both classification and
reconstruction tasks. Moreover, when evaluated on the real-world dataset
ScanObjectNN and the 3D large scene segmentation dataset S3DIS, our model
achieves highly competitive performance metrics. These results not only
validate PointAMaLR's effectiveness in multi-scale semantic understanding but
also underscore its practical applicability in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Virtual reality (VR) significantly transforms immersive digital interfaces,
greatly enhancing education, professional practices, and entertainment by
increasing user engagement and opening up new possibilities in various
industries. Among its numerous applications, image rendering is crucial.
Nevertheless, rendering methodologies like 3D Gaussian Splatting impose high
computational demands, driven predominantly by user expectations for superior
visual quality. This results in notable processing delays for real-time image
rendering, which greatly affects the user experience. Additionally, VR devices
such as head-mounted displays (HMDs) are intricately linked to human visual
behavior, leveraging knowledge from perception and cognition to improve user
experience. These insights have spurred the development of foveated rendering,
a technique that dynamically adjusts rendering resolution based on the user's
gaze direction. The resultant solution, known as gaze-tracked foveated
rendering, significantly reduces the computational burden of the rendering
process.
  Although gaze-tracked foveated rendering can reduce rendering costs, the
computational overhead of the gaze tracking process itself can sometimes
outweigh the rendering savings, leading to increased processing latency. To
address this issue, we propose an efficient rendering framework
called~\textit{A3FR}, designed to minimize the latency of gaze-tracked foveated
rendering via the parallelization of gaze tracking and foveated rendering
processes. For the rendering algorithm, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting, a
state-of-the-art neural rendering technique. Evaluation results demonstrate
that A3FR can reduce end-to-end rendering latency by up to $2\times$ while
maintaining visual quality.

Abstract: The temporal interpolation task for 4D medical imaging, plays a crucial role
in clinical practice of respiratory motion modeling. Following the simplified
linear-motion hypothesis, existing approaches adopt optical flow-based models
to interpolate intermediate frames. However, realistic respiratory motions
should be nonlinear and quasi-periodic with specific frequencies. Intuited by
this property, we resolve the temporal interpolation task from the frequency
perspective, and propose a Fourier basis-guided Diffusion model, termed
FB-Diff. Specifically, due to the regular motion discipline of respiration,
physiological motion priors are introduced to describe general characteristics
of temporal data distributions. Then a Fourier motion operator is elaborately
devised to extract Fourier bases by incorporating physiological motion priors
and case-specific spectral information in the feature space of Variational
Autoencoder. Well-learned Fourier bases can better simulate respiratory motions
with motion patterns of specific frequencies. Conditioned on starting and
ending frames, the diffusion model further leverages well-learned Fourier bases
via the basis interaction operator, which promotes the temporal interpolation
task in a generative manner. Extensive results demonstrate that FB-Diff
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) perceptual performance with better temporal
consistency while maintaining promising reconstruction metrics. Codes are

Abstract: Medical AI diagnosis including histopathology segmentation has derived
benefits from the recent development of deep learning technology. However, deep
learning itself requires a large amount of training data and the medical image
segmentation masking, in particular, requires an extremely high cost due to the
shortage of medical specialists. To mitigate this issue, we propose a new data
augmentation method built upon the conventional Copy and Paste (CP)
augmentation technique, called CP-Dilatation, and apply it to histopathology
image segmentation. To the well-known traditional CP technique, the proposed
method adds a dilation operation that can preserve the boundary context
information of the malignancy, which is important in histopathological image
diagnosis, as the boundary between the malignancy and its margin is mostly
unclear and a significant context exists in the margin. In our experiments
using histopathology benchmark datasets, the proposed method was found superior
to the other state-of-the-art baselines chosen for comparison.

Images (WSIs) and genomic profiles, a challenging task due to the inherent
heterogeneity and the complexity of modeling both inter- and intra-modality
interactions. Current methods often employ straightforward fusion strategies
for multimodal feature integration, failing to comprehensively capture
modality-specific and modality-common interactions, resulting in a limited
understanding of multimodal correlations and suboptimal predictive performance.
To mitigate these limitations, this paper presents a Multimodal Representation
Decoupling Network (MurreNet) to advance cancer survival analysis.
Specifically, we first propose a Multimodal Representation Decomposition (MRD)
module to explicitly decompose paired input data into modality-specific and
modality-shared representations, thereby reducing redundancy between
modalities. Furthermore, the disentangled representations are further refined
then updated through a novel training regularization strategy that imposes
constraints on distributional similarity, difference, and representativeness of
modality features. Finally, the augmented multimodal features are integrated
into a joint representation via proposed Deep Holistic Orthogonal Fusion (DHOF)
strategy. Extensive experiments conducted on six TCGA cancer cohorts
demonstrate that our MurreNet achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in
survival prediction.

Conclusion: 该方法在临床应用、医学教育和数据扩展方面具有潜力。

Abstract: X-ray imaging is a rapid and cost-effective tool for visualizing internal
human anatomy. While multi-view X-ray imaging provides complementary
information that enhances diagnosis, intervention, and education, acquiring
images from multiple angles increases radiation exposure and complicates
clinical workflows. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
view-conditioned diffusion model for synthesizing multi-view X-ray images from
a single view. Unlike prior methods, which are limited in angular range,
resolution, and image quality, our approach leverages the Diffusion Transformer
to preserve fine details and employs a weak-to-strong training strategy for
stable high-resolution image generation. Experimental results demonstrate that
our method generates higher-resolution outputs with improved control over
viewing angles. This capability has significant implications not only for
clinical applications but also for medical education and data extension,
enabling the creation of diverse, high-quality datasets for training and
analysis. Our code is available at GitHub.

novel quantum architecture that integrates the mixture of experts (MoE)
paradigm into the QML setting. QMoE comprises multiple parameterized quantum
circuits serving as expert models, along with a learnable quantum routing
mechanism that selects and aggregates specialized quantum experts per input.
The empirical results from the proposed QMoE on quantum classification tasks

Abstract: Real-time hair simulation is a vital component in creating believable virtual
avatars, as it provides a sense of immersion and authenticity. The dynamic
behavior of hair, such as bouncing or swaying in response to character
movements like jumping or walking, plays a significant role in enhancing the
overall realism and engagement of virtual experiences. Current methods for
simulating hair have been constrained by two primary approaches: highly
optimized physics-based systems and neural methods. However, state-of-the-art
neural techniques have been limited to quasi-static solutions, failing to
capture the dynamic behavior of hair. This paper introduces a novel neural
method that breaks through these limitations, achieving efficient and stable
dynamic hair simulation while outperforming existing approaches. We propose a
fully self-supervised method which can be trained without any manual
intervention or artist generated training data allowing the method to be
integrated with hair reconstruction methods to enable automatic end-to-end
methods for avatar reconstruction. Our approach harnesses the power of compact,
memory-efficient neural networks to simulate hair at the strand level, allowing
for the simulation of diverse hairstyles without excessive computational
resources or memory requirements. We validate the effectiveness of our method
through a variety of hairstyle examples, showcasing its potential for
real-world applications.

Abstract: The integration of large-scale circuits and systems emphasizes the importance
of automated defect detection of electronic components. The YOLO image
detection model has been used to detect PCB defects and it has become a typical
AI-assisted case of traditional industrial production. However, conventional
detection algorithms have stringent requirements for the angle, orientation,
and clarity of target images. In this paper, we propose an enhanced PCB defect
detection algorithm, named VR-YOLO, based on the YOLOv8 model. This algorithm
aims to improve the model's generalization performance and enhance viewpoint
robustness in practical application scenarios. We first propose a diversified
scene enhancement (DSE) method by expanding the PCB defect dataset by
incorporating diverse scenarios and segmenting samples to improve target
diversity. A novel key object focus (KOF) scheme is then presented by
considering angular loss and introducing an additional attention mechanism to
enhance fine-grained learning of small target features. Experimental results
demonstrate that our improved PCB defect detection approach achieves a mean
average precision (mAP) of 98.9% for the original test images, and 94.7% for
the test images with viewpoint shifts (horizontal and vertical shear
coefficients of $\pm 0.06$ and rotation angle of $\pm 10$ degrees), showing
significant improvements compared to the baseline YOLO model with negligible
additional computational cost.

Abstract: We present the first comparative study of two fundamentally distinct feature
extraction techniques: Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Topological
Data Analysis (TDA), for medical image classification using retinal fundus
images. HOG captures local texture and edge patterns through gradient
orientation histograms, while TDA, using cubical persistent homology, extracts
high-level topological signatures that reflect the global structure of pixel
intensities. We evaluate both methods on the large APTOS dataset for two
classification tasks: binary detection (normal versus diabetic retinopathy) and
five-class diabetic retinopathy severity grading. From each image, we extract
26244 HOG features and 800 TDA features, using them independently to train
seven classical machine learning models with 10-fold cross-validation. XGBoost
achieved the best performance in both cases: 94.29 percent accuracy (HOG) and
94.18 percent (TDA) on the binary task; 74.41 percent (HOG) and 74.69 percent
(TDA) on the multi-class task. Our results show that both methods offer
competitive performance but encode different structural aspects of the images.
This is the first work to benchmark gradient-based and topological features on
retinal imagery. The techniques are interpretable, applicable to other medical
imaging domains, and suitable for integration into deep learning pipelines.

Abstract: Sudden Death Syndrome (SDS), caused by Fusarium virguliforme, poses a
significant threat to soybean production. This study presents an AI-driven web
application for early detection of SDS on soybean leaves using hyperspectral
imaging, enabling diagnosis prior to visible symptom onset. Leaf samples from
healthy and inoculated plants were scanned using a portable hyperspectral
imaging system (398-1011 nm), and a Genetic Algorithm was employed to select
five informative wavelengths (505.4, 563.7, 712.2, 812.9, and 908.4 nm)
critical for discriminating infection status. These selected bands were fed
into a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract
spatial-spectral features, which were subsequently classified using ten
classical machine learning models. Ensemble classifiers (Random Forest,
AdaBoost), Linear SVM, and Neural Net achieved the highest accuracy (>98%) and
minimal error across all folds, as confirmed by confusion matrices and
cross-validation metrics. Poor performance by Gaussian Process and QDA
highlighted their unsuitability for this dataset. The trained models were
deployed within a web application that enables users to upload hyperspectral
leaf images, visualize spectral profiles, and receive real-time classification
results. This system supports rapid and accessible plant disease diagnostics,
contributing to precision agriculture practices. Future work will expand the
training dataset to encompass diverse genotypes, field conditions, and disease

Abstract: Multi-camera systems are increasingly vital in the environmental perception
of autonomous vehicles and robotics. Their physical configuration offers
inherent fixed relative pose constraints that benefit Structure-from-Motion
(SfM). However, traditional global SfM systems struggle with robustness due to
their optimization framework. We propose a novel global motion averaging
framework for multi-camera systems, featuring two core components: a decoupled
rotation averaging module and a hybrid translation averaging module. Our
rotation averaging employs a hierarchical strategy by first estimating relative
rotations within rigid camera units and then computing global rigid unit
rotations. To enhance the robustness of translation averaging, we incorporate
both camera-to-camera and camera-to-point constraints to initialize camera
positions and 3D points with a convex distance-based objective function and
refine them with an unbiased non-bilinear angle-based objective function.
Experiments on large-scale datasets show that our system matches or exceeds
incremental SfM accuracy while significantly improving efficiency. Our
framework outperforms existing global SfM methods, establishing itself as a
robust solution for real-world multi-camera SfM applications. The code is

Abstract: In modern electronic manufacturing, defect detection on Printed Circuit
Boards (PCBs) plays a critical role in ensuring product yield and maintaining
the reliability of downstream assembly processes. However, existing methods
often suffer from limited feature representation, computational redundancy, and
insufficient availability of high-quality training data -- challenges that
hinder their ability to meet industrial demands for both accuracy and
efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose MRC-DETR, a novel and
efficient detection framework tailored for bare PCB defect inspection, built
upon the foundation of RT-DETR. Firstly, to enhance feature representation
capability, we design a Multi-Residual Directional Coupled Block (MRDCB). This
module improves channel-wise feature interaction through a multi-residual
structure. Moreover, a cross-spatial learning strategy is integrated to capture
fine-grained pixel-level relationships, further enriching the representational
power of the extracted features. Secondly, to reduce computational redundancy
caused by inefficient cross-layer information fusion, we introduce an Adaptive
Screening Pyramid Network (ASPN). This component dynamically filters and
aggregates salient low-level features, selectively fusing them with high-level
semantic features. By focusing on informative regions and suppressing redundant
computations, ASPN significantly improves both efficiency and detection
accuracy. Finally, to tackle the issue of insufficient training data,
particularly in the context of bare PCBs, we construct a new, high-quality
dataset that fills a critical gap in current public resources. Our dataset not
only supports the training and evaluation of our proposed framework but also
serves as a valuable benchmark for future research in this domain.

Abstract: Existing pre-impact fall detection systems have high accuracy, however they
are either intrusive to the subject or require heavy computational resources
for fall detection, resulting in prohibitive deployment costs. These factors
limit the global adoption of existing fall detection systems. In this work we
present a Pre-impact fall detection system that is both non-intrusive and
computationally efficient at deployment. Our system utilizes video data of the
locality available through cameras, thereby requiring no specialized equipment
to be worn by the subject. Further, the fall detection system utilizes minimal
fall specific features and simplistic neural network models, designed to reduce
the computational cost of the system. A minimal set of fall specific features
are derived from the skeletal data, post observing the relative position of
human skeleton during fall. These features are shown to have different
distributions for Fall and non-fall scenarios proving their discriminative
capability. A Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) based network is selected and the
network architecture and training parameters are designed after evaluation of
performance on standard datasets. In the Pre-impact fall detection system the
computation requirement is about 18 times lesser than existing modules with a
comparable accuracy of 88%. Given the low computation requirements and higher
accuracy levels, the proposed system is suitable for wider adoption in

fields have achieved photorealistic driving scene modeling, but they suffer
from low rendering efficacy. Recently, some approaches have explored 3D
Gaussian splatting for modeling dynamic urban scenes, enabling high-fidelity
reconstruction and real-time rendering. However, these approaches often neglect
to model fine-grained variations between frames and camera viewpoints, leading
to suboptimal results. In this work, we propose a new approach named ArmGS that
exploits composite driving Gaussian splatting with multi-granularity appearance
refinement for autonomous driving scene modeling. The core idea of our approach
is devising a multi-level appearance modeling scheme to optimize a set of
transformation parameters for composite Gaussian refinement from multiple
granularities, ranging from local Gaussian level to global image level and
dynamic actor level. This not only models global scene appearance variations
between frames and camera viewpoints, but also models local fine-grained
changes of background and objects. Extensive experiments on multiple
challenging autonomous driving datasets, namely, Waymo, KITTI, NOTR and
VKITTI2, demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art
methods.

Abstract: Accurate gland segmentation in histopathology images is essential for cancer
diagnosis and prognosis. However, significant variability in Hematoxylin and
Eosin (H&E) staining and tissue morphology, combined with limited annotated
data, poses major challenges for automated segmentation. To address this, we
propose Color-Structure Dual-Student (CSDS), a novel semi-supervised
segmentation framework designed to learn disentangled representations of stain
appearance and tissue structure. CSDS comprises two specialized student
networks: one trained on stain-augmented inputs to model chromatic variation,
and the other on structure-augmented inputs to capture morphological cues. A
shared teacher network, updated via Exponential Moving Average (EMA),
supervises both students through pseudo-labels. To further improve label
reliability, we introduce stain-aware and structure-aware uncertainty
estimation modules that adaptively modulate the contribution of each student
during training. Experiments on the GlaS and CRAG datasets show that CSDS
achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-label settings, with Dice score
improvements of up to 1.2% on GlaS and 0.7% on CRAG at 5% labeled data, and
0.7% and 1.4% at 10%. Our code and pre-trained models are available at

Abstract: This work proposes a mmWave radar's scene flow estimation framework
supervised by data from a widespread visual-inertial (VI) sensor suite,
allowing crowdsourced training data from smart vehicles. Current scene flow
estimation methods for mmWave radar are typically supervised by dense point
clouds from 3D LiDARs, which are expensive and not widely available in smart
vehicles. While VI data are more accessible, visual images alone cannot capture
the 3D motions of moving objects, making it difficult to supervise their scene
flow. Moreover, the temporal drift of VI rigid transformation also degenerates
the scene flow estimation of static points. To address these challenges, we
propose a drift-free rigid transformation estimator that fuses kinematic
model-based ego-motions with neural network-learned results. It provides strong
supervision signals to radar-based rigid transformation and infers the scene
flow of static points. Then, we develop an optical-mmWave supervision
extraction module that extracts the supervision signals of radar rigid
transformation and scene flow. It strengthens the supervision by learning the
scene flow of dynamic points with the joint constraints of optical and mmWave
radar measurements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, in smoke-filled
environments, our method even outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches
using costly LiDARs.

Abstract: Human Motion Prediction (HMP) aims to predict future poses at different
moments according to past motion sequences. Previous approaches have treated
the prediction of various moments equally, resulting in two main limitations:
the learning of short-term predictions is hindered by the focus on long-term
predictions, and the incorporation of prior information from past predictions
into subsequent predictions is limited. In this paper, we introduce a novel
multi-stage training framework called Temporal Continual Learning (TCL) to
address the above challenges. To better preserve prior information, we
introduce the Prior Compensation Factor (PCF). We incorporate it into the model
training to compensate for the lost prior information. Furthermore, we derive a
more reasonable optimization objective through theoretical derivation. It is
important to note that our TCL framework can be easily integrated with
different HMP backbone models and adapted to various datasets and applications.
Extensive experiments on four HMP benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness and flexibility of TCL. The code is available at

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is a non-contact technique for measuring
human physiological signals. Due to its convenience and non-invasiveness, it
has demonstrated broad application potential in areas such as health monitoring
and emotion recognition. In recent years, the release of numerous public
datasets has significantly advanced the performance of rPPG algorithms under
ideal lighting conditions. However, the effectiveness of current rPPG methods
in realistic nighttime scenarios with dynamic lighting variations remains
largely unknown. Moreover, there is a severe lack of datasets specifically
designed for such challenging environments, which has substantially hindered
progress in this area of research. To address this gap, we present and release
a large-scale rPPG dataset collected under dynamic lighting conditions at
night, named DLCN. The dataset comprises approximately 13 hours of video data
and corresponding synchronized physiological signals from 98 participants,
covering four representative nighttime lighting scenarios. DLCN offers high
diversity and realism, making it a valuable resource for evaluating algorithm
robustness in complex conditions. Built upon the proposed Happy-rPPG Toolkit,
we conduct extensive experiments and provide a comprehensive analysis of the
challenges faced by state-of-the-art rPPG methods when applied to DLCN. The

Abstract: Tombstones are historically and culturally rich artifacts, encapsulating

challenges, including physical erosion, vandalism, environmental degradation,

enrich semantic parsing, we incorporate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
for integrate externally dependent elements such as toponyms, occupation codes,

method improves parsing accuracy from an F1 score of 36.1 to 89.5. We
additionally evaluate the model's robustness across diverse linguistic and

to assess performance under noisy or damaged conditions. Our work represents
the first attempt to formalize tombstone understanding using large
vision-language models, presenting implications for heritage preservation.

Conclusion: 视一致分布和深度推进损失的结合有效解决了NeRF训练中的失败模式。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has emerged as a compelling framework for scene
representation and 3D recovery. To improve its performance on real-world data,
depth regularizations have proven to be the most effective ones. However, depth
estimation models not only require expensive 3D supervision in training, but
also suffer from generalization issues. As a result, the depth estimations can
be erroneous in practice, especially for outdoor unbounded scenes. In this
paper, we propose to employ view-consistent distributions instead of fixed
depth value estimations to regularize NeRF training. Specifically, the
distribution is computed by utilizing both low-level color features and
high-level distilled features from foundation models at the projected 2D
pixel-locations from per-ray sampled 3D points. By sampling from the
view-consistency distributions, an implicit regularization is imposed on the
training of NeRF. We also utilize a depth-pushing loss that works in
conjunction with the sampling technique to jointly provide effective
regularizations for eliminating the failure modes. Extensive experiments
conducted on various scenes from public datasets demonstrate that our proposed
method can generate significantly better novel view synthesis results than
state-of-the-art NeRF variants as well as different depth regularization
methods.

always important field of vision-based hand gesture recognition (VHGR), and
delivered a wide range of applications, such as sign language understanding and
human-computer interaction using cameras. Despite the large volume of research

leaving researchers to navigate through hundreds of papers in order to find the
right combination of data, model, and approach for each task. The current
survey aims to fill this gap by presenting a comprehensive overview of this
aspect of computer vision. With a systematic research methodology that
identifies the state-of-the-art works and a structured presentation of the
various methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics, this review aims to
constitute a useful guideline for researchers, helping them to choose the right
strategy for delving into a certain VHGR task. Starting with the methodology
used for study selection, literature retrieval, and the analytical framing, the
survey identifies and organizes key VHGR approaches using a taxonomy-based
format in various dimensions such as input modality and application domain. The
core of the survey provides an in-depth analysis of state-of-the-art techniques
across three primary VHGR tasks: static gesture recognition, isolated dynamic
gestures and continuous gesture recognition. For each task, the architectural
trends and learning strategies are listed. Additionally, the study reviews
commonly used datasets - emphasizing on annotation schemes - and evaluates
standard performance metrics. It concludes by identifying major challenges in
VHGR, including both general computer vision issues and domain-specific

Abstract: Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is fundamental to fluid dynamics, yet deep
learning applications face significant hurdles. A critical gap exists: the lack
of comprehensive evaluation of how diverse optical flow models perform
specifically on PIV data, largely due to limitations in available datasets and
the absence of a standardized benchmark. This prevents fair comparison and
hinders progress. To address this, our primary contribution is a novel,
large-scale synthetic PIV benchmark dataset generated from diverse CFD
simulations (JHTDB and Blasius). It features unprecedented variety in particle
densities, flow velocities, and continuous motion, enabling, for the first
time, a standardized and rigorous evaluation of various optical flow and PIV
algorithms. Complementing this, we propose Multi Cost Volume PIV (MCFormer), a
new deep network architecture leveraging multi-frame temporal information and
multiple cost volumes, specifically designed for PIV's sparse nature. Our
comprehensive benchmark evaluation, the first of its kind, reveals significant
performance variations among adapted optical flow models and demonstrates that
MCFormer significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving the lowest
overall normalized endpoint error (NEPE). This work provides both a
foundational benchmark resource essential for future PIV research and a
state-of-the-art method tailored for PIV challenges. We make our benchmark

Abstract: Inertial mass plays a crucial role in robotic applications such as object
grasping, manipulation, and simulation, providing a strong prior for planning
and control. Accurately estimating an object's mass before interaction can
significantly enhance the performance of various robotic tasks. However, mass
estimation using only vision sensors is a relatively underexplored area. This
paper proposes a novel approach combining sparse point-cloud data from depth
images with RGB images to estimate the mass of objects. We evaluate a range of
point-cloud processing architectures, alongside RGB-only methods. To overcome
the limited availability of training data, we create a synthetic dataset using
ShapeNetSem 3D models, simulating RGBD images via a Kinect camera. This
synthetic data is used to train an image generation model for estimating dense
depth maps, which we then use to augment an existing dataset of images paired
with mass values. Our approach significantly outperforms existing benchmarks
across all evaluated metrics. The data generation

Abstract: Reconstructing fast-dynamic scenes from multi-view videos is crucial for
high-speed motion analysis and realistic 4D reconstruction. However, the
majority of 4D capture systems are limited to frame rates below 30 FPS (frames
per second), and a direct 4D reconstruction of high-speed motion from low FPS
input may lead to undesirable results. In this work, we propose a high-speed 4D
capturing system only using low FPS cameras, through novel capturing and
processing modules. On the capturing side, we propose an asynchronous capture
scheme that increases the effective frame rate by staggering the start times of
cameras. By grouping cameras and leveraging a base frame rate of 25 FPS, our
method achieves an equivalent frame rate of 100-200 FPS without requiring
specialized high-speed cameras. On processing side, we also propose a novel
generative model to fix artifacts caused by 4D sparse-view reconstruction, as
asynchrony reduces the number of viewpoints at each timestamp. Specifically, we
propose to train a video-diffusion-based artifact-fix model for sparse 4D
reconstruction, which refines missing details, maintains temporal consistency,
and improves overall reconstruction quality. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method significantly enhances high-speed 4D reconstruction compared to
synchronous capture.

Abstract: Characterizing quantum flakes is a critical step in quantum hardware
engineering because the quality of these flakes directly influences qubit
performance. Although computer vision methods for identifying two-dimensional
quantum flakes have emerged, they still face significant challenges in
estimating flake thickness. These challenges include limited data, poor
generalization, sensitivity to domain shifts, and a lack of physical
interpretability. In this paper, we introduce one of the first Physics-informed
Adaptation Learning approaches to overcome these obstacles. We focus on two
main issues, i.e., data scarcity and generalization. First, we propose a new
synthetic data generation framework that produces diverse quantum flake samples
across various materials and configurations, reducing the need for
time-consuming manual collection. Second, we present $\varphi$-Adapt, a
physics-informed adaptation method that bridges the performance gap between
models trained on synthetic data and those deployed in real-world settings.
Experimental results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on multiple benchmarks, outperforming existing methods. Our
proposed approach advances the integration of physics-based modeling and domain
adaptation. It also addresses a critical gap in leveraging synthesized data for
real-world 2D material analysis, offering impactful tools for deep learning and

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) aims to maintain consistent identities of objects
across video frames. Associating objects in low-frame-rate videos captured by
moving unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in actual combat scenarios is complex
due to rapid changes in object appearance and position within the frame. The
task becomes even more challenging due to image degradation caused by cloud
video streaming and compression algorithms. We present how instance association
learning from single-frame annotations can overcome these challenges. We show
that global features of the scene provide crucial context for low-FPS instance
association, allowing our solution to be robust to distractors and gaps in
detections. We also demonstrate that such a tracking approach maintains high
association quality even when reducing the input image resolution and latent
representation size for faster inference. Finally, we present a benchmark
dataset of annotated military vehicles collected from publicly available data
sources. This paper was initially presented at the NATO Science and Technology

also introduces statistical analysis on vug characteristics. Pre-processing
steps, including logical file extraction and normalization, ensured
standardized and usable data. The sixstep vug identification methodology
encompasses top-k mode extraction, adaptive thresholding, contour
identification, aggregation, advanced filtering, and optional filtering for low
vuggy regions. The model's adaptability is evidenced by its ability to identify
vugs missed by manual picking undertaken by experts. Results demonstrate the
model's accuracy through validation against expert picks. Detailed metrics,
such as count, mean, and standard deviation of vug areas within zones, were
introduced, showcasing the model's capabilities compared to manual picking. The
vug area distribution plot enhances understanding of vug types in the
reservoir. This research focuses on the identification and characterization of
vugs that in turn aids in the better understanding of reservoirs.

Method: 采用事件相机捕捉快速运动，改进主动传感技术，从振动中恢复音频，并在多源和环境干扰下测试。

Abstract: Small vibrations observed in video can unveil information beyond what is
visual, such as sound and material properties. It is possible to passively
record these vibrations when they are visually perceptible, or actively amplify
their visual contribution with a laser beam when they are not perceptible. In
this paper, we improve upon the active sensing approach by leveraging
event-based cameras, which are designed to efficiently capture fast motion. We
demonstrate our method experimentally by recovering audio from vibrations, even
for multiple simultaneous sources, and in the presence of environmental
distortions. Our approach matches the state-of-the-art reconstruction quality
at much faster speeds, approaching real-time processing.

Abstract: Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)-stained images are commonly used to detect
nuclear or cancerous regions in cells from images captured by a microscope.
Identifying cancer cytoplasm is crucial for determining the type of cancer;
hence, obtaining accurate cancer cytoplasm regions in cell images is important.
While CMOS images often lack detailed information necessary for diagnosis,
hyperspectral images provide more comprehensive cell information. Using a deep
learning model, we propose a method for detecting cancer cell cytoplasm in
hyperspectral images. Deep learning models require large datasets for learning;
however, capturing a large number of hyperspectral images is difficult.
Additionally, hyperspectral images frequently contain instrumental noise,
depending on the characteristics of the imaging devices. We propose a data
augmentation method to account for instrumental noise. CMOS images were used
for data augmentation owing to their visual clarity, which facilitates manual
annotation compared to original hyperspectral images. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed data augmentation method both
quantitatively and qualitatively.

Abstract: Prostate cancer (PCa) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in men,
and accurate identification of clinically significant PCa (csPCa) is critical
for timely intervention. Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) is widely used for
prostate biopsy; however, its low contrast and anisotropic spatial resolution
pose diagnostic challenges. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
hybrid-view attention (HVA) network for csPCa classification in 3D TRUS that
leverages complementary information from transverse and sagittal views. Our
approach integrates a CNN-transformer hybrid architecture, where convolutional
layers extract fine-grained local features and transformer-based HVA models
global dependencies. Specifically, the HVA comprises intra-view attention to
refine features within a single view and cross-view attention to incorporate
complementary information across views. Furthermore, a hybrid-view adaptive
fusion module dynamically aggregates features along both channel and spatial
dimensions, enhancing the overall representation. Experiments are conducted on
an in-house dataset containing 590 subjects who underwent prostate biopsy.
Comparative and ablation results prove the efficacy of our method. The code is

Conclusion: PLUS展示了利用广泛可用的NCCT成像改善恶性肝脏病变筛查的潜力。

Abstract: Focal liver lesions (FLL) are common clinical findings during physical
examination. Early diagnosis and intervention of liver malignancies are crucial
to improving patient survival. Although the current 3D segmentation paradigm
can accurately detect lesions, it faces limitations in distinguishing between
malignant and benign liver lesions, primarily due to its inability to
differentiate subtle variations between different lesions. Furthermore,
existing methods predominantly rely on specialized imaging modalities such as
multi-phase contrast-enhanced CT and magnetic resonance imaging, whereas
non-contrast CT (NCCT) is more prevalent in routine abdominal imaging. To
address these limitations, we propose PLUS, a plug-and-play framework that
enhances FLL analysis on NCCT images for arbitrary 3D segmentation models. In
extensive experiments involving 8,651 patients, PLUS demonstrated a significant
improvement with existing methods, improving the lesion-level F1 score by
5.66%, the malignant patient-level F1 score by 6.26%, and the benign
patient-level F1 score by 4.03%. Our results demonstrate the potential of PLUS
to improve malignant FLL screening using widely available NCCT imaging

Abstract: Registering airborne SAR with spaceborne optical images is crucial for SAR
image interpretation and geo-localization. It is challenging for this
cross-platform heterogeneous image registration due to significant geometric
and radiation differences, which current methods fail to handle. To tackle
these challenges, we propose a novel grid-based multimodal registration
framework (Grid-Reg) across airborne and space-born platforms, including a new
domain-robust descriptor extraction network, Hybrid Siamese Correlation Metric
Learning Network (HSCMLNet) and a grid-based solver (Grid-solver) for
transformation parameters estimation. Our Grid-Reg is based on detector-free
and global matching loss rather than accurate keypoint correspondences. These
accurate correspondences are inherently difficult in heterogeneous images with
large geometric deformation. By Grid-Solver, our Grid-Reg estimates
transformation parameters by optimizing robust global matching loss-based patch
correspondences of whole images in a coarse-to-fine strategy. To robustly
calculate the similarity between patches, specifically that have noise and
change objects, we propose HSCMLNet, including a hybrid Siamese module to
extract high-level features of multimodal images and a correlation learning
module (CMLModule) based equiangular unit basis vectors (EUBVs). Moreover, we
propose a manifold loss EUBVsLoss to constrain the normalized correlation
between local embeddings of patches and EUBVs. Furthermore, we curate a new
challenging benchmark dataset of SAR-to-optical registration using real-world
UAV MiniSAR data and optical images from Google Earth. We extensively analyze
factors affecting registration accuracy and compare our method with
state-of-the-art techniques on this dataset, showing superior performance.

Conclusion: 结论指出街道设计对限速遵守至关重要，并提供了可操作的工具支持城市规划。

Abstract: In recent years, cities have increasingly reduced speed limits from 50 km/h
to 30 km/h to enhance road safety, reduce noise pollution, and promote
sustainable modes of transportation. However, achieving compliance with these
new limits remains a key challenge for urban planners. This study investigates
drivers' compliance with the 30 km/h speed limit in Milan and examines how
street characteristics influence driving behavior. Our findings suggest that
the mere introduction of lower speed limits is not sufficient to reduce driving
speeds effectively, highlighting the need to understand how street design can
improve speed limit adherence. To comprehend this relationship, we apply
computer vision-based semantic segmentation models to Google Street View
images. A large-scale analysis reveals that narrower streets and densely built
environments are associated with lower speeds, whereas roads with greater
visibility and larger sky views encourage faster driving. To evaluate the
influence of the local context on speeding behaviour, we apply the developed
methodological framework to two additional cities: Amsterdam, which, similar to
Milan, is a historic European city not originally developed for cars, and
Dubai, which instead has developed in recent decades with a more car-centric
design. The results of the analyses largely confirm the findings obtained in
Milan, which demonstrates the broad applicability of the road design guidelines
for driver speed compliance identified in this paper. Finally, we develop a
machine learning model to predict driving speeds based on street
characteristics. We showcase the model's predictive power by estimating the
compliance with speed limits in Milan if the city were to adopt a 30 km/h speed
limit city-wide. The tool provides actionable insights for urban planners,
supporting the design of interventions to improve speed limit compliance.

Abstract: Snapshot hyperspectral imaging systems acquire spectral data cubes through
compressed sensing. Recently, diffractive snapshot spectral imaging (DSSI)
methods have attracted significant attention. While various optical designs and
improvements continue to emerge, research on reconstruction algorithms remains
limited. Although numerous networks and deep unfolding methods have been
applied on similar tasks, they are not fully compatible with DSSI systems
because of their distinct optical encoding mechanism. In this paper, we propose
an efficient deep unfolding framework for diffractive systems, termed
diffractive deep unfolding (DDU). Specifically, we derive an analytical
solution for the data fidelity term in DSSI, ensuring both the efficiency and
the effectiveness during the iterative reconstruction process. Given the
severely ill-posed nature of the problem, we employ a network-based
initialization strategy rather than non-learning-based methods or linear
layers, leading to enhanced stability and performance. Our framework
demonstrates strong compatibility with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models,
which effectively address the initialization and prior subproblem. Extensive
experiments validate the superiority of the proposed DDU framework, showcasing
improved performance while maintaining comparable parameter counts and
computational complexity. These results suggest that DDU provides a solid
foundation for future unfolding-based methods in DSSI.

Abstract: Biplanar X-ray imaging is widely used in health screening, postoperative
rehabilitation evaluation of orthopedic diseases, and injury surgery due to its
rapid acquisition, low radiation dose, and straightforward setup. However, 3D
volume reconstruction from only two orthogonal projections represents a
profoundly ill-posed inverse problem, owing to the intrinsic lack of depth
information and irreducible ambiguities in soft-tissue visualization. Some
existing methods can reconstruct skeletal structures and Computed Tomography
(CT) volumes, they often yield incomplete bone geometry, imprecise tissue
boundaries, and a lack of anatomical realism, thereby limiting their clinical
utility in scenarios such as surgical planning and postoperative assessment. In
this study, we introduce SPIDER, a novel supervised framework designed to
reconstruct CT volumes from biplanar X-ray images. SPIDER incorporates tissue
structure as prior (e.g., anatomical segmentation) into an implicit neural
representation decoder in the form of joint supervision through a unified
encoder-decoder architecture. This design enables the model to jointly learn
image intensities and anatomical structures in a pixel-aligned fashion. To
address the challenges posed by sparse input and structural ambiguity, SPIDER
directly embeds anatomical constraints into the reconstruction process, thereby
enhancing structural continuity and reducing soft-tissue artifacts. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on clinical head CT datasets and show that SPIDER
generates anatomically accurate reconstructions from only two projections.
Furthermore, our approach demonstrates strong potential in downstream
segmentation tasks, underscoring its utility in personalized treatment planning
and image-guided surgical navigation.

commercial robot without hardware modifications. The system estimates robot
poses through neural inertial navigation and efficiently captures images at
regular spatial intervals throughout the cleaning task. We develop a novel
test-time data augmentation method called Rotation-Augmented Ensemble (RAE) to
mitigate domain gaps in neural inertial navigation. A loop closure method that
exploits robot cleaning patterns further refines these estimated poses. We
demonstrate the system with an object mapping application that analyzes
captured images to geo-localize objects in the environment. Experimental
evaluation in retail environments shows that our approach achieves 0.83 m
relative pose error for robot localization and 0.97 m positional error for
object mapping of over 100 items.

Abstract: The identification of cardiac phase is an essential step for analysis and
diagnosis of cardiac function. Automatic methods, especially data-driven
methods for cardiac phase detection, typically require extensive annotations,
which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this paper, we present an
unsupervised framework for end-diastole (ED) and end-systole (ES) detection
through self-supervised learning of latent cardiac motion trajectories from
4-chamber-view echocardiography videos. Our method eliminates the need for
manual annotations, including ED and ES indices, segmentation, or volumetric
measurements, by training a reconstruction model to encode interpretable
spatiotemporal motion patterns. Evaluated on the EchoNet-Dynamic benchmark, the
approach achieves mean absolute error (MAE) of 3 frames (58.3 ms) for ED and 2
frames (38.8 ms) for ES detection, matching state-of-the-art supervised
methods. Extended to fetal echocardiography, the model demonstrates robust
performance with MAE 1.46 frames (20.7 ms) for ED and 1.74 frames (25.3 ms) for
ES, despite the fact that the fetal heart model is built using non-standardized
heart views due to fetal heart positioning variability. Our results demonstrate
the potential of the proposed latent motion trajectory strategy for cardiac
phase detection in adult and fetal echocardiography. This work advances
unsupervised cardiac motion analysis, offering a scalable solution for clinical
populations lacking annotated data. Code will be released at

Motivation: 在传染病大流行期间，红外热像仪（IRTs）是一种快速、非侵入性的发热筛查方法。眼角区域是发热筛查的理想部位，因此需要精确配准红外和可见光图像以实现准确定位。

Method: 采用粗-精配准策略，结合基于标志点和眼轮廓边缘检测的不同配准模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为发热筛查提供了高精度的眼角区域定位，适用于公共场所的温度监测。

Abstract: Fever screening based on infrared thermographs (IRTs) is a viable mass
screening approach during infectious disease pandemics, such as Ebola and SARS,
for temperature monitoring in public places like hospitals and airports. IRTs
have found to be powerful, quick and non-invasive methods to detect elevated
temperatures. Moreover, regions medially adjacent to the inner canthi (called
the canthi regions in this paper) are preferred sites for fever screening.
Accurate localization of the canthi regions can be achieved through multi-modal
registration of infrared (IR) and white-light images. We proposed a
registration method through a coarse-fine registration strategy using different
registration models based on landmarks and edge detection on eye contours. We
evaluated the registration accuracy to be within 2.7 mm, which enables accurate
localization of the canthi regions.

Abstract: Performance measures such as stride length in athletics and the pace of
runners can be estimated using different tricks such as measuring the number of
steps divided by the running length or helping with markers printed on the
track. Monitoring individual performance is essential for supporting staff
coaches in establishing a proper training schedule for each athlete. The aim of
this paper is to investigate a computer vision-based approach for estimating
stride length and speed transition from video sequences and assessing video
analysis processing among athletes. Using some well-known image processing
methodologies such as probabilistic hough transform combined with a human pose
detection algorithm, we estimate the leg joint position of runners. In this
way, applying a homography transformation, we can estimate the runner stride
length. Experiments on various race videos with three different runners
demonstrated that the proposed system represents a useful tool for coaching and
training. This suggests its potential value in measuring and monitoring the
gait parameters of athletes.

Abstract: Like many countries, Nigeria is naturally endowed with fertile agricultural
soil that supports large-scale tomato production. However, the prevalence of
disease causing pathogens poses a significant threat to tomato health, often
leading to reduced yields and, in severe cases, the extinction of certain
species. These diseases jeopardise both the quality and quantity of tomato
harvests, contributing to food insecurity. Fortunately, tomato diseases can
often be visually identified through distinct forms, appearances, or textures,
typically first visible on leaves and fruits. This study presents an enhanced
Capsule-YOLO network architecture designed to automatically segment overlapping
and occluded tomato leaf images from complex backgrounds using the YOLO
framework. It identifies disease symptoms with impressive performance metrics:
99.31% accuracy, 98.78% recall, and 99.09% precision, and a 98.93% F1-score
representing improvements of 2.91%, 1.84%, 5.64%, and 4.12% over existing
state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, a user-friendly interface was developed
to allow farmers and users to upload images of affected tomato plants and
detect early disease symptoms. The system also provides recommendations for
appropriate diagnosis and treatment. The effectiveness of this approach
promises significant benefits for the agricultural sector by enhancing crop
yields and strengthening food security.

Abstract: We demonstrate that, under orthographic projection and with a camera fixated
on a point located on a rigid body, the rotation of that body can be
analytically obtained by tracking only one other feature in the image. With
some exceptions, any tracked point, regardless of its location on the body,
yields the same value of the instantaneous rotation rate.
  The proposed method is independent of the shape of the 3D object and does not
require a priori knowledge about the scene. This algorithm is suited for
parallel processing and can achieve segmentation of the scene by distinguishing
points that do not belong to the same rigid body, simply because they do not
produce the same value of the rotation. This paper presents an analytical
derivation, simulation results, and results from real video data.

Conclusion: SKDNet-SSR有效解决了双频PolSAR图像分类中的关键问题，提升了分类性能。

Abstract: The collaborative classification of dual-frequency PolSAR images is a
meaningful but also challenging research. The effect of regional consistency on
classification information learning and the rational use of dual-frequency data
are two main difficulties for dual-frequency collaborative classification. To
tackle these problems, a selected knowledge distillation network with
statistical-based sample rectification (SKDNet-SSR) is proposed in this
article. First, in addition to applying CNN and ViT as local and global feature
extractors, a statistical-based dynamic sample rectification (SDSR) module is
designed to avoid the impact of poor regional consistency on spatial
information learning process. Specifically, based on the fact that the PolSAR
covariance matrix conforms to the complex Wishart distribution, SDSR first
dynamically evaluates the sample purity, and then performs pixel selection and
pixel generation to remove noisy pixels, thereby avoiding the feature
interaction between informative pixels and noisy pixels and improving the
classification feature extraction process. Next, a dual-frequency gate-selected
distillation (DGSD) module is constructed to emphasize the advantages of
different frequency bands and perform complementary learning on dual-frequency
data. It uses the dominant single-frequency branch on each sample as teacher
model to train the dual-frequency student model, enabling the student model to
learn the optimal results and realizing complementary utilization of
dual-frequency data on different terrain objects. Comprehensive experiments on
four measured dual-frequency PolSAR data demonstrate that the proposed
SKDNet-SSR outperforms other related methods.

Abstract: Brain stroke is one of the leading causes of mortality and long-term
disability worldwide, highlighting the need for precise and fast prediction
techniques. Computed Tomography (CT) scan is considered one of the most
effective methods for diagnosing brain strokes. The majority of stroke
classification techniques rely on a single slice-level prediction mechanism,
allowing the radiologist to manually choose the most critical CT slice from the
original CT volume. Although clinical evaluations are often used in traditional
diagnostic procedures, machine learning (ML) has opened up new avenues for
improving stroke diagnosis. To supplement traditional diagnostic techniques,
this study investigates the use of machine learning models, specifically
concerning the prediction of brain stroke at an early stage utilizing CT scan
images. In this research, we proposed a novel approach to brain stroke
detection leveraging machine learning techniques, focusing on optimizing
classification performance with pre-trained deep learning models and advanced
optimization strategies. Pre-trained models, including DenseNet201,
InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, ResNet50, and Xception, are utilized for feature
extraction. Additionally, we employed feature engineering techniques, including
BFO, PCA, and LDA, to enhance models' performance further. These features are
subsequently classified using machine learning algorithms such as SVC, RF, XGB,
DT, LR, KNN, and GNB. Our experiments demonstrate that the combination of
MobileNetV2, LDA, and SVC achieved the highest classification accuracy of
97.93%, significantly outperforming other model-optimizer-classifier
combinations. The results underline the effectiveness of integrating
lightweight pre-trained models with robust optimization and classification
techniques for brain stroke diagnosis.

Abstract: Pavement skid resistance is of vital importance for road safety. The
objective of this study is to propose and validate a texture-based image
indicator to predict pavement friction. This index enables pavement friction to
be measured easily and inexpensively using digital images. Three different
types of asphalt surfaces (dense-graded asphalt mix, open-grade friction
course, and chip seal) were evaluated subject to various tire polishing cycles.
Images were taken with corresponding friction measured using Dynamic Friction
Tester (DFT) in the laboratory. The aggregate protrusion area is proposed as
the indicator. Statistical models are established for each asphalt surface type
to correlate the proposed indicator with friction coefficients. The results
show that the adjusted R-square values of all relationships are above 0.90.
Compared to other image-based indicators in the literature, the proposed image
indicator more accurately reflects the changes in pavement friction with the
number of polishing cycles, proving its cost-effective use for considering
pavement friction in mix design stage.

Abstract: Laboratory mice play a crucial role in biomedical research, yet accurate 3D

absence of structured 3D datasets severely hinders the progress beyond sparse
keypoint tracking. To narrow the gap, we present MoReMouse, the first monocular

goal, we highlight three key designs. First, we construct the first
high-fidelity dense-view synthetic dataset for mice, by rendering our
self-designed realistic Gaussian mouse avatar. Second, MoReMouse adopts a
transformer-based feedforward architecture with triplane representation,
achieving high-quality 3D surface generation from a single image. Third, we
create geodesic-based continuous correspondence embeddings on mouse surface,
which serve as strong semantic priors to improve reconstruction stability and
surface consistency. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is closely linked to the malignant transformation of

struggle with detecting small lesions, accurately localizing boundaries, and
providing interpretable decisions. To address these issues, we propose HGNet,
which integrates High-Order Spatial Awareness Hypergraph and Multi-Scale

Context Attention (EMCA) module to enhance lesion feature representation and
boundary modeling; (2) the deployment of a spatial hypergraph convolution
module before the detection head to capture higher-order spatial relationships
between nodes; (3) the application of transfer learning to address the scarcity
of medical image data; and (4) Eigen Class Activation Map (Eigen-CAM) for
decision visualization. Experimental results show that HGNet achieves 94%
accuracy, 90.6% recall, and 90% mAP@0.5, significantly improving small lesion
differentiation and clinical interpretability. The source code will be made

Abstract: Accurate rice area monitoring is critical for food security and agricultural
policy in smallholder farming regions, yet conventional remote sensing
approaches struggle with the spatiotemporal heterogeneity characteristic of
fragmented agricultural landscapes. This study developed a phenology-driven
classification framework that systematically adapts to local agro-ecological
variations across 32 districts in Telangana, India during the 2018-19 Rabi rice
season. The research reveals significant spatiotemporal diversity, with
phenological timing varying by up to 50 days between districts and field sizes
ranging from 0.01 to 2.94 hectares. Our district-specific calibration approach
achieved 93.3% overall accuracy, an 8.0 percentage point improvement over
conventional regional clustering methods, with strong validation against
official government statistics (R^2 = 0.981) demonstrating excellent agreement
between remotely sensed and ground truth data. The framework successfully
mapped 732,345 hectares by adapting to agro-climatic variations, with Northern
districts requiring extended land preparation phases (up to 55 days) while
Southern districts showed compressed cultivation cycles. Field size analysis
revealed accuracy declining 6.8 percentage points from medium to tiny fields,
providing insights for operational monitoring in fragmented landscapes. These
findings demonstrate that remote sensing frameworks must embrace rather than
simplify landscape complexity, advancing region-specific agricultural
monitoring approaches that maintain scientific rigor while serving practical
policy and food security applications.

Abstract: Functional ultrasound (fUS) is a neuroimaging technique known for its high
spatiotemporal resolution, enabling non-invasive observation of brain activity
through neurovascular coupling. Despite its potential in clinical applications
such as neonatal monitoring and intraoperative guidance, the development of fUS
faces challenges related to data scarcity and limitations in generating

network (GAN) framework tailored for fUS image synthesis. The proposed method
incorporates architectural enhancements, including feature enhancement modules
and normalization techniques, aiming to improve the fidelity and physiological
plausibility of generated images. The study evaluates the performance of the
framework against existing generative models, demonstrating its capability to
produce high-quality fUS images under various experimental conditions.
Additionally, the synthesized images are assessed for their utility in
downstream tasks, showing improvements in classification accuracy when used for
data augmentation. Experimental results are based on publicly available fUS
datasets, highlighting the framework's effectiveness in addressing data
limitations.

Abstract: Aortic dissection is a serious pathology and requires an emergency
management. It is characterized by one or more tears of the intimal wall of the
normal blood duct of the aorta (true lumen); the blood under pressure then
creates a second blood lumen (false lumen) in the media tissue. The two lumens
are separated by an intimal wall, called flap. From the segmentation of
connected lumens (more precisely, blood inside lumens) of an aortic dissection
3D Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) image, our previous studies allow us
to retrieve the intimal flap by using Mathematical Morphology operators, and
characterize intimal tears by 3d thin surfaces that fill them, these surfaces
are obtained by operating the Aktouf et al. closing algorithm proposed in the
framework of Digital Topology. Indeed, intimal tears are 3D holes in the
intimal flap; although it is impossible to directly segment such non-concrete
data, it is nevertheless possible to "materialize" them with these 3D filling
surfaces that may be quantified or make easier the visualization of these
holes.
  In this paper, we use these surfaces that fill tears to cut connections
between lumens in order to separate them.
  This is the first time that surfaces filling tears are used as an image
processing operator (to disconnect several parts of a 3D object). This lumen
separation allows us to provide one of the first cartographies of an aortic
dissection, that may better visually assist physicians during their diagnosis.
  Our method is able to disconnect lumens, that may also lead to enhance
several current investigations (registration, segmentation, hemodynamics).

Abstract: Fourier ptychography (FP) is a powerful light-based synthetic aperture
imaging technique that allows one to reconstruct a high-resolution, wide
field-of-view image by computationally integrating a diverse collection of
low-resolution, far-field measurements. Typically, FP measurement diversity is
introduced by changing the angle of the illumination or the position of the
camera; either approach results in sampling different portions of the target's
spatial frequency content, but both approaches introduce substantial costs and
complexity to the acquisition process. In this work, we introduce Inverse
Synthetic Aperture Fourier Ptychography, a novel approach to FP that foregoes
changing the illumination angle or camera position and instead generates
measurement diversity through target motion. Critically, we also introduce a
novel learning-based method for estimating k-space coordinates from dual plane
intensity measurements, thereby enabling synthetic aperture imaging without
knowing the rotation of the target. We experimentally validate our method in
simulation and on a tabletop optical system.

Abstract: Ovarian tumor, as a common gynecological disease, can rapidly deteriorate
into serious health crises when undetected early, thus posing significant
threats to the health of women. Deep neural networks have the potential to
identify ovarian tumors, thereby reducing mortality rates, but limited public
datasets hinder its progress. To address this gap, we introduce a vital ovarian
tumor pathological recognition dataset called \textbf{ViTaL} that contains
\textbf{V}isual, \textbf{T}abular and \textbf{L}inguistic modality data of 496
patients across six pathological categories. The ViTaL dataset comprises three
subsets corresponding to different patient data modalities: visual data from
2216 two-dimensional ultrasound images, tabular data from medical examinations
of 496 patients, and linguistic data from ultrasound reports of 496 patients.
It is insufficient to merely distinguish between benign and malignant ovarian
tumors in clinical practice. To enable multi-pathology classification of
ovarian tumor, we propose a ViTaL-Net based on the Triplet Hierarchical Offset
Attention Mechanism (THOAM) to minimize the loss incurred during feature fusion
of multi-modal data. This mechanism could effectively enhance the relevance and
complementarity between information from different modalities. ViTaL-Net serves
as a benchmark for the task of multi-pathology, multi-modality classification
of ovarian tumors. In our comprehensive experiments, the proposed method
exhibited satisfactory performance, achieving accuracies exceeding 90\% on the
two most common pathological types of ovarian tumor and an overall performance
of 85\%. Our dataset and code are available at

Abstract: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common autoimmune disease that has been the
focus of research in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) and disease monitoring. In
clinical settings, conventional radiography (CR) is widely used for the
screening and evaluation of RA due to its low cost and accessibility. The wrist
is a critical region for the diagnosis of RA. However, CAD research in this
area remains limited, primarily due to the challenges in acquiring high-quality
instance-level annotations. (i) The wrist comprises numerous small bones with
narrow joint spaces, complex structures, and frequent overlaps, requiring
detailed anatomical knowledge for accurate annotation. (ii) Disease progression
in RA often leads to osteophyte, bone erosion (BE), and even bony ankylosis,
which alter bone morphology and increase annotation difficulty, necessitating
expertise in rheumatology. This work presents a multi-task dataset for wrist
bone in CR, including two tasks: (i) wrist bone instance segmentation and (ii)
Sharp/van der Heijde (SvdH) BE scoring, which is the first public resource for
wrist bone instance segmentation. This dataset comprises 621 wrist conventional
radiographs of 227 patients from four medical centers, with pixel-level
instance segmentation annotations for 443 images and SvdH BE scores for 548
images. This dataset can potentially support a wide range of research tasks
related to RA, including joint space narrowing (JSN) progression
quantification, BE detection, bone deformity evaluation, and osteophyte
detection. It may also be applied to other wrist-related tasks, such as carpal
bone fracture localization. We hope this dataset will significantly lower the
barrier to research on wrist RA and accelerate progress in CAD research within
the RA-related domain.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种模块化的actor-critic架构，通过线性时序逻辑（LTL）指导LLM在长期规划任务中的行为，以提高安全性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在静态环境中表现良好，但在长期规划任务中错误累积，导致不安全或低效行为。需要结合形式逻辑的保证来提升其可靠性。

Method: 使用LLM作为actor，LTLCrit作为critic，通过LTL生成约束条件，分析失败或次优轨迹并改进未来行为。

Result: 在Minecraft钻石挖掘基准测试中，实现了100%完成率，并提高了效率。

Conclusion: 通过逻辑监督LLM是一种强大且灵活的安全决策范式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promise in reasoning tasks and
general decision-making in static environments. In long-term planning tasks,
however, errors tend to accumulate, often leading to unsafe or inefficient
behavior, limiting their use in general-purpose settings. We propose a modular
actor-critic architecture in which an LLM actor is guided by LTLCrit, a
trajectory-level LLM critic that communicates via linear temporal logic (LTL).
Our setup combines the reasoning strengths of language models with the
guarantees of formal logic. The actor selects high-level actions from natural
language observations, while the critic analyzes full trajectories and proposes
new LTL constraints that shield the actor from future unsafe or inefficient
behavior. The architecture supports both fixed, hand-specified safety
constraints and adaptive, learned soft constraints that promote long-term
efficiency. Our architecture is model-agnostic: any LLM-based planner can serve
as the actor, and LTLCrit serves as a logic-generating wrapper. We formalize
planning as graph traversal under symbolic constraints, allowing LTLCrit to
analyze failed or suboptimal trajectories and generate new temporal logic rules
that improve future behavior. We evaluate our system on the Minecraft
diamond-mining benchmark, achieving 100% completion rates and improving
efficiency compared to baseline LLM planners. Our results suggest that enabling
LLMs to supervise each other through logic is a powerful and flexible paradigm
for safe, generalizable decision making.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a transformative approach for
aligning and enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs), addressing critical
challenges in instruction following, ethical alignment, and reasoning
capabilities. This survey offers a comprehensive foundation on the integration
of RL with language models, highlighting prominent algorithms such as Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO), Q-Learning, and Actor-Critic methods. Additionally,
it provides an extensive technical overview of RL techniques specifically
tailored for LLMs, including foundational methods like Reinforcement Learning
from Human Feedback (RLHF) and AI Feedback (RLAIF), as well as advanced
strategies such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO). We systematically analyze their applications across
domains, i.e., from code generation to tool-augmented reasoning. We also
present a comparative taxonomy based on reward modeling, feedback mechanisms,
and optimization strategies. Our evaluation highlights key trends. RLHF remains
dominant for alignment, and outcome-based RL such as RLVR significantly
improves stepwise reasoning. However, persistent challenges such as reward
hacking, computational costs, and scalable feedback collection underscore the
need for continued innovation. We further discuss emerging directions,
including hybrid RL algorithms, verifier-guided training, and multi-objective
alignment frameworks. This survey serves as a roadmap for researchers advancing
RL-driven LLM development, balancing capability enhancement with safety and

Result: 实验表明，MoPPS能可靠预测提示难度，显著减少LLM调用，加速训练。

Conclusion: MoPPS为高效RL微调提供了一种计算成本低的方法。

Abstract: Recent advances have witnessed the effectiveness of reinforcement learning
(RL) finetuning in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). The optimization process often requires numerous iterations to
achieve satisfactory performance, resulting in high computational costs due to
the need for frequent prompt evaluations under intensive LLM interactions and
repeated policy updates. Appropriate online prompt selection methods reduce
iteration steps by prioritizing informative prompts during training, while the
pipeline's reliance on exhaustive prompt evaluation and subset selection for
optimization still incurs substantial computational overhead due to frequent
LLM inference calls. Distinguished from these direct evaluate-then-select
schemes, this work investigates iterative approximate evaluation for arbitrary
prompts and introduces Model Predictive Prompt Selection (MoPPS), a Bayesian
risk-predictive framework that online estimates prompt difficulty without
requiring costly LLM interactions. Technically, MoPPS models each prompt's
success rate as a latent variable, performs streaming Bayesian inference, and
employs posterior sampling in a constructed multi-armed bandit machine,
enabling sample efficient and adaptive prompt selection. Extensive experiments
across mathematics, planning, and vision-based geometry tasks show that MoPPS
reliably predicts prompt difficulty and accelerates training with significantly
reduced LLM rollouts.

Abstract: System Instructions (SIs), or system prompts, are pivotal for guiding Large
Language Models (LLMs) but manual crafting is resource-intensive and often
suboptimal. Existing automated methods frequently generate non-human-readable
"soft prompts," sacrificing interpretability. This paper introduces SI-Agent, a
novel agentic framework designed to automatically generate and iteratively
refine human-readable SIs through a feedback-driven loop. SI-Agent employs
three collaborating agents: an Instructor Agent, an Instruction Follower Agent
(target LLM), and a Feedback/Reward Agent evaluating task performance and
optionally SI readability. The framework utilizes iterative cycles where
feedback guides the Instructor's refinement strategy (e.g., LLM-based editing,
evolutionary algorithms). We detail the framework's architecture, agent roles,
the iterative refinement process, and contrast it with existing methods. We
present experimental results validating SI-Agent's effectiveness, focusing on
metrics for task performance, SI readability, and efficiency. Our findings
indicate that SI-Agent generates effective, readable SIs, offering a favorable
trade-off between performance and interpretability compared to baselines.
Potential implications include democratizing LLM customization and enhancing
model transparency. Challenges related to computational cost and feedback
reliability are acknowledged.

Conclusion: CodeAgents显著提升多代理LLM系统的规划性能和token效率。

Abstract: Effective prompt design is essential for improving the planning capabilities
of large language model (LLM)-driven agents. However, existing structured
prompting strategies are typically limited to single-agent, plan-only settings,
and often evaluate performance solely based on task accuracy - overlooking
critical factors such as token efficiency, modularity, and scalability in
multi-agent environments. To address these limitations, we introduce
CodeAgents, a prompting framework that codifies multi-agent reasoning and
enables structured, token-efficient planning in multi-agent systems. In
CodeAgents, all components of agent interaction - Task, Plan, Feedback, system
roles, and external tool invocations - are codified into modular pseudocode
enriched with control structures (e.g., loops, conditionals), boolean logic,
and typed variables. This design transforms loosely connected agent plans into
cohesive, interpretable, and verifiable multi-agent reasoning programs. We
evaluate the proposed framework across three diverse benchmarks - GAIA,
HotpotQA, and VirtualHome - using a range of representative LLMs. Results show
consistent improvements in planning performance, with absolute gains of 3-36
percentage points over natural language prompting baselines. On VirtualHome,
our method achieves a new state-of-the-art success rate of 56%. In addition,
our approach reduces input and output token usage by 55-87% and 41-70%,
respectively, underscoring the importance of token-aware evaluation metrics in
the development of scalable multi-agent LLM systems. The code and resources are

Result: Memory Mosaics v2 在训练知识学习上与 Transformer 相当，但在新任务推理和上下文学习上显著优于 Transformer，且无法通过增加 Transformer 的训练数据复现。

Conclusion: Memory Mosaics v2 在大型语言模型规模下表现出色，尤其是在新任务推理和上下文学习方面，具有潜在的应用价值。

Abstract: Memory Mosaics [Zhang et al., 2025], networks of associative memories, have
demonstrated appealing compositional and in-context learning capabilities on
medium-scale networks (GPT-2 scale) and synthetic small datasets. This work
shows that these favorable properties remain when we scale memory mosaics to
large language model sizes (llama-8B scale) and real-world datasets.
  To this end, we scale memory mosaics to 10B size, we train them on one
trillion tokens, we introduce a couple architectural modifications ("Memory
Mosaics v2"), we assess their capabilities across three evaluation dimensions:
training-knowledge storage, new-knowledge storage, and in-context learning.
  Throughout the evaluation, memory mosaics v2 match transformers on the
learning of training knowledge (first dimension) and significantly outperforms
transformers on carrying out new tasks at inference time (second and third
dimensions). These improvements cannot be easily replicated by simply
increasing the training data for transformers. A memory mosaics v2 trained on
one trillion tokens still perform better on these tasks than a transformer
trained on eight trillion tokens.

real-world readiness via a dynamic suite that redeploys each model in a live

Abstract: The drive for predictable LLM reasoning in their integration with compound
systems has popularized structured outputs, yet concerns remain about
performance trade-offs compared to unconstrained natural language. At the same
time, training on unconstrained Chain of Thought (CoT) traces has brought about
a new class of strong reasoning models that nevertheless present novel compute
budget and faithfulness challenges. This paper introduces iSelf-Discover, an
instance-level adaptation of the Self-Discover framework, and using it compares
dynamically generated structured JSON reasoning with its unstructured
counterpart. Our empirical evaluation across diverse benchmarks using
state-of-the-art open-source models supports a consistent advantage for
unstructured reasoning. Notably, on the complex MATH benchmark, unstructured
plans achieved relative performance improvements of up to 18.90\% over
structured approaches. Zero-shot unstructured iSelf-Discover variants are also
shown to outperform their five-shot structured counterparts, underscoring the
significance of this gap, even when structured plans are dynamically generated
to ensure reasoning precedes the final answer. We further demonstrate that the
optimal granularity of plan generation (instance-level vs. task-level) is
context-dependent. These findings invite re-evaluation of the reliance on
structured formats for complex problem-solving and how compound systems should
be organized.

Abstract: We propose a hybrid approach to machine Theory of Mind (ToM) that uses large
language models (LLMs) as a mechanism for generating hypotheses and likelihood
functions with a Bayesian inverse planning model that computes posterior
probabilities for an agent's likely mental states given its actions. Bayesian
inverse planning models can accurately predict human reasoning on a variety of
ToM tasks, but these models are constrained in their ability to scale these
predictions to scenarios with a large number of possible hypotheses and
actions. Conversely, LLM-based approaches have recently demonstrated promise in
solving ToM benchmarks, but can exhibit brittleness and failures on reasoning
tasks even when they pass otherwise structurally identical versions. By
combining these two methods, this approach leverages the strengths of each
component, closely matching optimal results on a task inspired by prior inverse
planning models and improving performance relative to models that utilize LLMs
alone or with chain-of-thought prompting, even with smaller LLMs that typically
perform poorly on ToM tasks. We also exhibit the model's potential to predict
mental states on open-ended tasks, offering a promising direction for future
development of ToM models and the creation of socially intelligent generative
agents.

Abstract: Many of us now treat LLMs as modern-day oracles asking it almost any kind of
question. However, consulting an LLM does not have to be a single turn
activity. But long multi-turn interactions can get tedious if it is simply to
clarify contextual information that can be arrived at through reasoning. In
this paper, we examine the use of agent-based architecture to bolster LLM-based
Question-Answering systems with additional reasoning capabilities. We examine
the automatic resolution of potential incompleteness or ambiguities in
questions by transducers implemented using LLM-based agents. We focus on
several benchmark datasets that are known to contain questions with these
deficiencies to varying degrees. We equip different LLMs (GPT-3.5-Turbo and
Llama-4-Scout) with agents that act as specialists in detecting and resolving
deficiencies of incompleteness and ambiguity. The agents are implemented as
zero-shot ReAct agents. Rather than producing an answer in a single step, the
model now decides between 3 actions a) classify b) resolve c) answer. Action a)
decides if the question is incomplete, ambiguous, or normal. Action b)
determines if any deficiencies identified can be resolved. Action c) answers
the resolved form of the question. We compare the use of LLMs with and without
the use of agents with these components. Our results show benefits of agents
with transducer 1) A shortening of the length of interactions with human 2) An
improvement in the answer quality and 3) Explainable resolution of deficiencies
in the question. On the negative side we find while it may result in additional
LLM invocations and in some cases, increased latency. But on tested datasets,
the benefits outweigh the costs except when questions already have sufficient
context. Suggesting the agent-based approach could be a useful mechanism to
harness the power of LLMs to develop more robust QA systems.

Result: 推理模型在错误成本超过0.01美元时表现更优；大型LLM在错误成本低至0.1美元时优于级联模型。

Conclusion: 在自动化重要任务时，应优先使用最强大的模型，而非最小化部署成本。

Abstract: Practitioners often navigate LLM performance trade-offs by plotting Pareto
frontiers of optimal accuracy-cost trade-offs. However, this approach offers no
way to compare between LLMs with distinct strengths and weaknesses: for
example, a cheap, error-prone model vs a pricey but accurate one. To address
this gap, we propose economic evaluation of LLMs. Our framework quantifies the
performance trade-off of an LLM as a single number based on the economic
constraints of a concrete use case, all expressed in dollars: the cost of
making a mistake, the cost of incremental latency, and the cost of abstaining
from a query. We apply our economic evaluation framework to compare the
performance of reasoning and non-reasoning models on difficult questions from
the MATH benchmark, discovering that reasoning models offer better
accuracy-cost tradeoffs as soon as the economic cost of a mistake exceeds
\$0.01. In addition, we find that single large LLMs often outperform cascades
when the cost of making a mistake is as low as \$0.1. Overall, our findings
suggest that when automating meaningful human tasks with AI models,
practitioners should typically use the most powerful available model, rather
than attempt to minimize AI deployment costs, since deployment costs are likely
dwarfed by the economic impact of AI errors.

Abstract: A central goal of cognitive science is to provide a computationally explicit
account of both the structure of the mind and its development: what are the
primitive representational building blocks of cognition, what are the rules via
which those primitives combine, and where do these primitives and rules come
from in the first place? A long-standing debate concerns the adequacy of
artificial neural networks as computational models that can answer these
questions, in particular in domains related to abstract cognitive function,
such as language and logic. This paper argues that recent advances in neural
networks -- specifically, the advent of large language models (LLMs) --
represent an important shift in this debate. We test a variety of LLMs on an
existing experimental paradigm used for studying the induction of rules
formulated over logical concepts. Across four experiments, we find converging
empirical evidence that LLMs provide at least as good a fit to human behavior
as models that implement a Bayesian probablistic language of thought (pLoT),
which have been the best computational models of human behavior on the same
task. Moreover, we show that the LLMs make qualitatively different predictions
about the nature of the rules that are inferred and deployed in order to
complete the task, indicating that the LLM is unlikely to be a mere
implementation of the pLoT solution. Based on these results, we argue that LLMs
may instantiate a novel theoretical account of the primitive representations
and computations necessary to explain human logical concepts, with which future
work in cognitive science should engage.

Abstract: Nowadays, single Large Language Model (LLM) struggles with critical issues
such as hallucination and inadequate reasoning abilities. To mitigate these
issues, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as an effective strategy, where
LLM agents engage in in-depth debates with others on tasks. However, existing
MAD methods face two major issues: (a) too lengthy input contexts, which causes
LLM agents to get lost in plenty of input information and experiences
performance drop; and (b) the overconfidence dilemma, where self-assured LLM
agents dominate the debate, leading to low debating effectiveness. To address
these limitations, we propose a novel MAD method called "CortexDebate".
Inspired by the human brain's tendency to establish a sparse and dynamically
optimized network among cortical areas governed by white matter, CortexDebate
constructs a sparse debating graph among LLM agents, where each LLM agent only
debates with the ones that are helpful to it. To optimize the graph, we propose
a module named McKinsey-based Debate Matter (MDM), which acts as an artificial
analog to white matter. By integrating the McKinsey Trust Formula, a
well-established measure of trustworthiness from sociology, MDM enables
credible evaluations that guide graph optimization. The effectiveness of our
CortexDebate has been well demonstrated by extensive experimental results
across eight datasets from four task types.

Result: 数据无关特征通常提升泛化性能，但某些情况下会降低效果；隐藏状态特征的选择也未一致提升性能。

Conclusion: 数据无关特征和隐藏状态特征的结合效果因情况而异，需进一步优化特征权重分配。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate responses that are factually
incorrect yet expressed with high confidence, which can pose serious risks for
end users. To address this, it is essential for LLMs not only to produce
answers but also to provide accurate estimates of their correctness.
Uncertainty quantification methods have been introduced to assess the quality
of LLM outputs, with factual accuracy being a key aspect of that quality. Among
these methods, those that leverage hidden states to train probes have shown
particular promise, as these internal representations encode information
relevant to the factuality of responses, making this approach the focus of this
paper. However, the probe trained on the hidden states of one dataset often
struggles to generalise to another dataset of a different task or domain. To
address this limitation, we explore combining data-agnostic features with
hidden-state features and assess whether this hybrid feature set enhances
out-of-domain performance. We further examine whether selecting only the most
informative hidden-state features, thereby discarding task-specific noise,
enables the data-agnostic features to contribute more effectively. The
experiment results indicate that although introducing data-agnostic features
generally enhances generalisation performance in most cases, in certain
scenarios their inclusion degrades performance. A similar pattern emerges when
retaining only the most important hidden-state features - adding data-agnostic
features does not consistently further enhance performance compared to using
the full set of hidden-state features. A closer analysis reveals that, in some
specific cases, the trained probe underweights the data-agnostic features
relative to the hidden-state features, which we believe is the main reason why
the results are inconclusive.

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了计算效率，缩小了开源与闭源模型的差距。

Abstract: LLM-based web agents have recently made significant progress, but much of it
has occurred in closed-source systems, widening the gap with open-source
alternatives. Progress has been held back by two key challenges: first, a
narrow focus on single-step tasks that overlooks the complexity of multi-step
web interactions; and second, the high compute costs required to post-train
LLM-based web agents. To address this, we present the first statistically
grounded study on compute allocation for LLM web-agent post-training. Our
approach uses a two-stage pipeline, training a Llama 3.1 8B student to imitate
a Llama 3.3 70B teacher via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by on-policy
reinforcement learning. We find this process highly sensitive to hyperparameter
choices, making exhaustive sweeps impractical. To spare others from expensive
trial-and-error, we sample 1,370 configurations and use bootstrapping to
estimate effective hyperparameters. Our results show that combining SFT with
on-policy RL consistently outperforms either approach alone on both WorkArena
and MiniWob++. Further, this strategy requires only 55% of the compute to match
the peak performance of pure SFT on MiniWob++, effectively pushing the
compute-performance Pareto frontier, and is the only strategy that can close
the gap with closed-source models.

Result: 发现高平台学习率能加速损失下降，并存在最优学习率点使收敛更快。

Conclusion: 研究为基于平台的学习率调度提供了理论依据，并指导LLM训练中的学习率调参。

Abstract: Learning rate (LR) schedules in large language model (LLM) training often
follow empirical templates: warm-up, constant plateau/stable phase, and decay
(WSD). However, the mechanistic explanation for this strategy remains
underexplored, and the choice of plateau height and decay schedule is largely
heuristic. In this paper, we connect training dynamics to a thermodynamic
analogy via the Mpemba effect - a phenomenon in which a hotter system cools
faster than a colder one when quenched into the same bath. We analyze a class
of "valley-river" loss landscapes, where sharp (valley) directions equilibrate
quickly, while flatter (river) directions govern global descent. The Mpemba
effect provides an explanation for the necessity of the warm-up phase and
motivates a high plateau - rather than a low one - for accelerating loss
decrease during decay. We show that for certain loss landscapes, there exists
an optimal plateau learning rate - the "strong Mpemba point" - at which the
slowest mode vanishes, resulting in faster convergence during the decay phase.
We derive analytical conditions for its existence and estimate decay dynamics
required to preserve the Mpemba advantage. Our minimal model and analysis offer
a principled justification for plateau-based schedulers and provide guidance
for tuning LR in LLMs with minimal hyperparameter sweep.

Conclusion: SmartThinker通过细粒度长度控制，实现了推理效率和准确性的优化。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have exhibited remarkable reasoning
capabilities through inference-time scaling, but this progress has also
introduced considerable redundancy and inefficiency into their reasoning
processes, resulting in substantial computational waste. Previous work has
attempted to mitigate this issue by penalizing the overall length of generated
samples during reinforcement learning (RL), with the goal of encouraging a more
concise chains of thought. However, we observe that such global length penalty
often lead to excessive compression of critical reasoning steps while
preserving unnecessary details in simpler ones, yielding a suboptimal trade-off
between accuracy and efficiency. To address this issue, we propose
SmartThinker, a two-stage learnable framework designed to enable fine-grained
control over the length of reasoning chains based on the importance of each
individual step. In the first stage, SmartThinker adapts a reasoning model to a
short-form reasoning mode through rejection sampling combined with supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, SmartThinker applies Step-Level Length
Control Policy Optimization (SCPO) to refine the model output distribution,
which increases the proportion of length allocated to critical steps while
reducing redundancy in less important ones. SCPO consists of four core
components: an online importance estimator, a step-level length control reward
function, a step-level generalized advantage estimation (S-GAE) and a
difficulty-adaptive clipping strategy. Working in concert, these components
enable SCPO to implement differentiated length control across reasoning steps.
Empirical results across multiple reasoning benchmarks and various backbone
models demonstrate that SmartThinker significantly reduces redundant reasoning
while achieving comparable or even superior performance to existing methods.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
improved the capabilities of web agents. However, effectively navigating
complex and dynamic web environments still requires more advanced
trajectory-level planning and execution. Prior studies have addressed
self-improving agents by collecting extensive GUI trajectories from
real-environment interactions. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches
encounter two critical challenges: (1) Uncontrollable environment states, where
real or sandboxed web environments often yield unstable and non-deterministic
feedback, complicating the reproduction and debugging of agent behaviors; and
(2) High API costs, as generating even a single interaction trajectory can
involve hundreds of queries, leading to considerable API usage and
computational expenses. To address these limitations and enable scalable
self-improvement for agents, we propose WebSynthesis, a novel framework for
trajectory synthesis and training. WebSynthesis leverages a learned world model
to simulate virtual web environments, allowing a policy agent to perform
efficient and reversible tree-based planning. This approach supports the
large-scale generation of diverse and high-quality trajectories, which are
subsequently utilized to refine the agent's policy. Experimental results
demonstrate that an agent trained using WebSynthesis on a small-scale synthetic
dataset achieves performance comparable to or even surpassing that of models
trained on large-scale real-world data.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language understanding and
generation but remain vulnerable to factual errors, limiting their reliability
in knowledge-intensive tasks. While decoding-time strategies provide a
promising efficient solution without training, existing methods typically treat
token-level and layer-level signals in isolation, overlooking the joint
dynamics between them. In this work, we introduce a token-aware,
layer-localized contrastive decoding method that aligns specific token types
with their most influential transformer layers to improve factual generation.
Through empirical attention analysis, we identify two key patterns: punctuation
tokens receive dominant attention in early layers, while conceptual tokens
govern semantic reasoning in intermediate layers. By selectively suppressing
attention to these token types at their respective depths, we achieve the
induction of controlled factual degradation and derive contrastive signals to
guide the final factual decoding. Our method requires no additional training or
model modification, and experiments demonstrate that our method consistently
improves factuality across multiple LLMs and various benchmarks.

Abstract: The rise of conversational interfaces has greatly enhanced LLM usability by
leveraging dialogue history for sophisticated reasoning. However, this reliance
introduces an unexplored attack surface. This paper introduces Trojan Horse
Prompting, a novel jailbreak technique. Adversaries bypass safety mechanisms by
forging the model's own past utterances within the conversational history
provided to its API. A malicious payload is injected into a model-attributed
message, followed by a benign user prompt to trigger harmful content
generation. This vulnerability stems from Asymmetric Safety Alignment: models
are extensively trained to refuse harmful user requests but lack comparable
skepticism towards their own purported conversational history. This implicit
trust in its "past" creates a high-impact vulnerability. Experimental
validation on Google's Gemini-2.0-flash-preview-image-generation shows Trojan
Horse Prompting achieves a significantly higher Attack Success Rate (ASR) than
established user-turn jailbreaking methods. These findings reveal a fundamental
flaw in modern conversational AI security, necessitating a paradigm shift from
input-level filtering to robust, protocol-level validation of conversational
context integrity.

Result: 在MATH500和GSM8K数据集上，ASC实现了67.43%的CoT长度减少，同时保持准确性，推理速度提升2.73倍。

Conclusion: ASC是一种高效、无需训练的方法，适用于对延迟或成本敏感的场景。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning when they include
intermediate steps, known as "chains of thought" (CoTs). However, these
rationales are often overly verbose, even for simple problems, leading to
wasted context, increased latency, and higher energy consumption. We observe
that verbose, English-heavy CoTs and concise, math-centric CoTs occupy distinct
regions in the model's residual-stream activation space. By extracting and
injecting a "steering vector" to transition between these modes, we can
reliably shift generation toward more concise reasoning, effectively
compressing CoTs without retraining. We formalize this approach as
Activation-Steered Compression (ASC), an inference-time technique that shortens
reasoning traces by directly modifying hidden representations. In addition, we
provide a theoretical analysis of the impact of ASC on the output distribution,
derived from a closed-form KL-divergence-bounded constraint to regulate
steering strength. Using only 100 paired verbose and concise examples, ASC
achieves up to 67.43% reduction in CoT length on MATH500 and GSM8K datasets,
while maintaining accuracy across 7B, 8B, and 32B parameter models. As a
training-free method, ASC introduces negligible runtime overhead and, on
MATH500, delivers an average 2.73x speedup in end-to-end reasoning wall-clock
time on an 8B model. This makes ASC a practical and efficient tool for
streamlining the deployment of reasoning-capable LLMs in latency- or
cost-sensitive settings. The code is available at:

Conclusion: CoT监控虽不完美，但提供了重要的防御层，需要持续的压力测试和保护。

Abstract: While chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring is an appealing AI safety defense,
recent work on "unfaithfulness" has cast doubt on its reliability. These
findings highlight an important failure mode, particularly when CoT acts as a
post-hoc rationalization in applications like auditing for bias. However, for
the distinct problem of runtime monitoring to prevent severe harm, we argue the
key property is not faithfulness but monitorability. To this end, we introduce
a conceptual framework distinguishing CoT-as-rationalization from
CoT-as-computation. We expect that certain classes of severe harm will require
complex, multi-step reasoning that necessitates CoT-as-computation. Replicating
the experimental setups of prior work, we increase the difficulty of the bad
behavior to enforce this necessity condition; this forces the model to expose
its reasoning, making it monitorable. We then present methodology guidelines to
stress-test CoT monitoring against deliberate evasion. Applying these
guidelines, we find that models can learn to obscure their intentions, but only
when given significant help, such as detailed human-written strategies or
iterative optimization against the monitor. We conclude that, while not
infallible, CoT monitoring offers a substantial layer of defense that requires
active protection and continued stress-testing.

significant threat to the safe and secure deployment of LLM-based systems. We
study the effectiveness of the Crescendo multi-turn jailbreak at the level of
intermediate model representations and find that safety-aligned LMs often
represent Crescendo responses as more benign than harmful, especially as the
number of conversation turns increases. Our analysis indicates that at each
turn, Crescendo prompts tend to keep model outputs in a "benign" region of
representation space, effectively tricking the model into fulfilling harmful
requests. Further, our results help explain why single-turn jailbreak defenses
like circuit breakers are generally ineffective against multi-turn attacks,
motivating the development of mitigations that address this generalization gap.

  The proposed methodology enables an extensive set of experiments, addressing

code/math-specialized, long reasoning, and vision-language models across
zero-shot retrieval settings and the supervised setting. For the zero-shot
retrieval settings, we consider text retrieval from the BEIR benchmark and code
retrieval from the CoIR benchmark. Further, to evaluate supervised performance,
all LLMs are fine-tuned on the MS MARCO dataset. We find that mathematical
specialization and the long reasoning capability cause consistent degradation
in three settings, indicating conflicts between mathematical reasoning and
semantic matching. The vision-language model and code-specialized LLMs
demonstrate superior zero-shot performance compared to other LLMs, even
surpassing BM25 on the code retrieval task, and maintain comparable performance
to base LLMs in supervised settings. These findings suggest promising
directions for the unified retrieval task leveraging cross-domain and
cross-modal fusion.

TL;DR: 论文揭示了大型语言模型（LLMs）在越狱攻击中的普遍现象——注意力滑移（Attention Slipping），并提出了一种新的防御方法Attention Sharpening，直接通过温度缩放调整注意力分数分布来对抗滑移现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在社会和技术中的重要性增加，确保其安全性变得至关重要。越狱攻击利用漏洞绕过安全防护，但攻击机制尚不明确。

Method: 研究发现越狱攻击中普遍存在注意力滑移现象，并提出Attention Sharpening防御方法，通过温度缩放直接调整注意力分数分布。

Result: 实验表明，Attention Sharpening能有效抵抗多种越狱攻击，且在良性任务上保持性能，且无额外计算或内存开销。

Conclusion: Attention Sharpening是一种高效实用的防御方法，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more integral to society and
technology, ensuring their safety becomes essential. Jailbreak attacks exploit
vulnerabilities to bypass safety guardrails, posing a significant threat.
However, the mechanisms enabling these attacks are not well understood. In this
paper, we reveal a universal phenomenon that occurs during jailbreak attacks:
Attention Slipping. During this phenomenon, the model gradually reduces the
attention it allocates to unsafe requests in a user query during the attack
process, ultimately causing a jailbreak. We show Attention Slipping is
consistent across various jailbreak methods, including gradient-based token
replacement, prompt-level template refinement, and in-context learning.
Additionally, we evaluate two defenses based on query perturbation, Token
Highlighter and SmoothLLM, and find they indirectly mitigate Attention
Slipping, with their effectiveness positively correlated with the degree of
mitigation achieved. Inspired by this finding, we propose Attention Sharpening,
a new defense that directly counters Attention Slipping by sharpening the
attention score distribution using temperature scaling. Experiments on four
leading LLMs (Gemma2-9B-It, Llama3.1-8B-It, Qwen2.5-7B-It, Mistral-7B-It v0.2)
show that our method effectively resists various jailbreak attacks while
maintaining performance on benign tasks on AlpacaEval. Importantly, Attention
Sharpening introduces no additional computational or memory overhead, making it
an efficient and practical solution for real-world deployment.

Conclusion: 该工作流程通过验证计算工具和透明实践，为AI心理学研究建立可靠实证基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly being integrated into psychological
research as research tools, evaluation targets, human simulators, and cognitive
models. However, recent evidence reveals severe measurement unreliability:
Personality assessments collapse under factor analysis, moral preferences
reverse with punctuation changes, and theory-of-mind accuracy varies widely
with trivial rephrasing. These "measurement phantoms"--statistical artifacts
masquerading as psychological phenomena--threaten the validity of a growing
body of research. Guided by the dual-validity framework that integrates
psychometrics with causal inference, we present a six-stage workflow that
scales validity requirements to research ambition--using LLMs to code text
requires basic reliability and accuracy, while claims about psychological
properties demand comprehensive construct validation. Researchers must (1)
explicitly define their research goal and corresponding validity requirements,
(2) develop and validate computational instruments through psychometric
testing, (3) design experiments that control for computational confounds, (4)
execute protocols with transparency, (5) analyze data using methods appropriate
for non-independent observations, and (6) report findings within demonstrated
boundaries and use results to refine theory. We illustrate the workflow through
an example of model evaluation--"LLM selfhood"--showing how systematic
validation can distinguish genuine computational phenomena from measurement
artifacts. By establishing validated computational instruments and transparent
practices, this workflow provides a path toward building a robust empirical
foundation for AI psychology research.

Motivation: 现有PEFT框架在多适配器推理和微调中存在资源浪费、隐私泄露和灵活性不足的问题。

Method: Symbiosis通过共享基础模型层和分拆执行技术，实现了资源的高效利用和灵活的适配器管理。

Result: 在Llama2-13B上的评估显示，Symbiosis能在相同GPU资源下微调4倍多的适配器。

Conclusion: Symbiosis为PEFT提供了高效、灵活且隐私保护的解决方案。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) allows model builders to capture the
task specific parameters into adapters, which are a fraction of the size of the
original base model. Popularity of PEFT technique for fine-tuning has led to
creation of a large number of adapters for popular Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, existing frameworks fall short in supporting inference or
fine-tuning with multiple adapters in the following ways. 1) For fine-tuning,
each job needs to deploy its dedicated base model instance, which results in
excessive GPU memory consumption and poor GPU utilization. 2) While popular
inference platforms can serve multiple PEFT adapters, they do not allow
independent resource management or mixing of different PEFT methods. 3) They
cannot share resources (such as base model instance) between inference and
fine-tuning jobs. 4) They do not provide privacy to users who may not wish to
expose their fine-tuned parameters to service providers. In Symbiosis, we
address the above problems by enabling as-a-service deployment of base model.
The base model layers can be shared across multiple inference or fine-tuning
processes. Our split-execution technique decouples the execution of
client-specific adapters and layers from the frozen base model layers offering
them flexibility to manage their resources, to select their fine-tuning method,
to achieve their performance goals. Our approach is transparent to models and
works out-of-the-box for most models in the transformers library. Our
evaluation on Llama2-13B shows the compared to baseline, Symbiosis can
fine-tune 4X more adapters on the same set of GPUs in the same amount of time.

Motivation: 随着语言模型广泛采用低精度量化以提高效率，其安全对齐可能受到参数操纵攻击的威胁，因此研究不同量化方案下的攻击效果至关重要。

Method: 提出梯度引导攻击方法，包括渐进位级搜索算法和词级攻击，评估了不同量化方案（FP16、FP8、INT8、INT4）下的攻击成功率。

Result: FP16模型攻击成功率高（>80%），FP8和INT8模型抗攻击能力较强（ASR分别低于20%和50%），INT4模型攻击成功率较高。FP8模型在150次扰动下ASR仍低于65%。

Conclusion: 常见量化方案（尤其是FP8）增加了参数操纵攻击的难度，但漏洞仍存在，特别是通过攻击后量化。

Abstract: The safety alignment of Language Models (LMs) is a critical concern, yet
their integrity can be challenged by direct parameter manipulation attacks,
such as those potentially induced by fault injection. As LMs are increasingly
deployed using low-precision quantization for efficiency, this paper
investigates the efficacy of such attacks for jailbreaking aligned LMs across
different quantization schemes. We propose gradient-guided attacks, including a
tailored progressive bit-level search algorithm introduced herein and a
comparative word-level (single weight update) attack. Our evaluation on
Llama-3.2-3B, Phi-4-mini, and Llama-3-8B across FP16 (baseline), and
weight-only quantization (FP8, INT8, INT4) reveals that quantization
significantly influences attack success. While attacks readily achieve high
success (>80\% Attack Success Rate, ASR) on FP16 models, within an attack
budget of 25 perturbations, FP8 and INT8 models exhibit ASRs below 20\% and
50\%, respectively. Increasing the perturbation budget up to 150 bit-flips, FP8
models maintained ASR below 65\%, demonstrating some resilience compared to
INT8 and INT4 models that have high ASR. In addition, analysis of perturbation
locations revealed differing architectural targets across quantization schemes,
with (FP16, INT4) and (INT8, FP8) showing similar characteristics. Besides,
jailbreaks induced in FP16 models were highly transferable to subsequent
FP8/INT8 quantization (<5\% ASR difference), though INT4 significantly reduced
transferred ASR (avg. 35\% drop). These findings highlight that while common
quantization schemes, particularly FP8, increase the difficulty of direct
parameter manipulation jailbreaks, vulnerabilities can still persist,
especially through post-attack quantization.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed human-machine interaction since
ChatGPT's 2022 debut, with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) emerging as a
key framework that enhances LLM outputs by integrating external knowledge.
However, RAG's reliance on ingesting external documents introduces new
vulnerabilities. This paper exposes a critical security gap at the data loading
stage, where malicious actors can stealthily corrupt RAG pipelines by
exploiting document ingestion.
  We propose a taxonomy of 9 knowledge-based poisoning attacks and introduce
two novel threat vectors -- Content Obfuscation and Content Injection --
targeting common formats (DOCX, HTML, PDF). Using an automated toolkit
implementing 19 stealthy injection techniques, we test five popular data
loaders, finding a 74.4% attack success rate across 357 scenarios. We further
validate these threats on six end-to-end RAG systems -- including white-box
pipelines and black-box services like NotebookLM and OpenAI Assistants --
demonstrating high success rates and critical vulnerabilities that bypass
filters and silently compromise output integrity. Our results emphasize the
urgent need to secure the document ingestion process in RAG systems against
covert content manipulations.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
orchestrating large language models (LLMs) and specialized tools to
collaboratively address complex tasks. However, existing MAS frameworks often
require manual workflow configuration and lack native support for dynamic
evolution and performance optimization. In addition, many MAS optimization
algorithms are not integrated into a unified framework. In this paper, we
present EvoAgentX, an open-source platform that automates the generation,
execution, and evolutionary optimization of multi-agent workflows. EvoAgentX
employs a modular architecture consisting of five core layers: the basic
components, agent, workflow, evolving, and evaluation layers. Specifically,
within the evolving layer, EvoAgentX integrates three MAS optimization
algorithms, TextGrad, AFlow, and MIPRO, to iteratively refine agent prompts,
tool configurations, and workflow topologies. We evaluate EvoAgentX on
HotPotQA, MBPP, and MATH for multi-hop reasoning, code generation, and
mathematical problem solving, respectively, and further assess it on real-world
tasks using GAIA. Experimental results show that EvoAgentX consistently
achieves significant performance improvements, including a 7.44% increase in
HotPotQA F1, a 10.00% improvement in MBPP pass@1, a 10.00% gain in MATH solve
accuracy, and an overall accuracy improvement of up to 20.00% on GAIA. The

X-Master, a tool-augmented reasoning agent designed to emulate human
researchers by interacting flexibly with external tools during its reasoning

language, can flexibly leverage built-in Python libraries and our customized
tools to augment the reasoning. We further scale its capabilities through
X-Masters, a scattered-and-stacked agentic workflow that systematically

sets a new state-of-the-art record on HLE with a score of 32.1%, surpassing
OpenAI's and Google's Deep Research (26.6% and 26.9%) and becoming the first to

Abstract: Although prompt engineering is central to unlocking the full potential of
Large Language Models (LLMs), crafting effective prompts remains a
time-consuming trial-and-error process that relies on human intuition. This
study investigates Declarative Self-improving Python (DSPy), an optimization
framework that programmatically creates and refines prompts, applied to five
use cases: guardrail enforcement, hallucination detection in code, code
generation, routing agents, and prompt evaluation. Each use case explores how
prompt optimization via DSPy influences performance. While some cases
demonstrated modest improvements - such as minor gains in the guardrails use
case and selective enhancements in hallucination detection - others showed
notable benefits. The prompt evaluation criterion task demonstrated a
substantial performance increase, rising accuracy from 46.2% to 64.0%. In the
router agent case, the possibility of improving a poorly performing prompt and
of a smaller model matching a stronger one through optimized prompting was
explored. Although prompt refinement increased accuracy from 85.0% to 90.0%,
using the optimized prompt with a cheaper model did not improve performance.
Overall, this study's findings suggest that DSPy's systematic prompt
optimization can enhance LLM performance, particularly when instruction tuning
and example selection are optimized together. However, the impact varies by
task, highlighting the importance of evaluating specific use cases in prompt
optimization research.

Abstract: Large language model assistants (LLM-assistants) present new opportunities to
transform software development. Developers are increasingly adopting these
tools across tasks, including coding, testing, debugging, documentation, and
design. Yet, despite growing interest, there is no synthesis of how
LLM-assistants affect software developer productivity. In this paper, we
present a systematic literature review of 37 peer-reviewed studies published
between January 2014 and December 2024 that examine this impact. Our analysis
reveals that LLM-assistants offer both considerable benefits and critical
risks. Commonly reported gains include minimized code search, accelerated
development, and the automation of trivial and repetitive tasks. However,
studies also highlight concerns around cognitive offloading, reduced team
collaboration, and inconsistent effects on code quality. While the majority of
studies (92%) adopt a multi-dimensional perspective by examining at least two
SPACE dimensions, reflecting increased awareness of the complexity of developer
productivity, only 14% extend beyond three dimensions, indicating substantial
room for more integrated evaluations. Satisfaction, Performance, and Efficiency
are the most frequently investigated dimensions, whereas Communication and
Activity remain underexplored. Most studies are exploratory (64%) and
methodologically diverse, but lack longitudinal and team-based evaluations.

fifteen high school students participated, completing three problems under
three distinct versions of the model. Each version was designed to represent a
specific style of AI support: responding only when asked, offering suggestions
automatically, or engaging the user in back-and-forth dialogue.Quantitative
analysis revealed that the collaborative interaction style significantly
improved task completion time compared to the passive and proactive conditions.
Participants also reported higher satisfaction and perceived helpfulness when
working with the collaborative version. These findings suggest that the way an
LLM communicates, how it guides, prompts, and responds, can meaningfully impact
learning and performance. This research highlights the importance of designing
LLMs that go beyond functional correctness to support more interactive,
adaptive, and user-centered experiences, especially for novice programmers.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems powered by Large Language Models (LLM-MAS) demonstrate
remarkable capabilities in collaborative problem-solving. While LLM-MAS exhibit
strong collaborative abilities, the security risks in their communication and
coordination remain underexplored. We bridge this gap by systematically
investigating intention-hiding threats in LLM-MAS, and design four
representative attack paradigms that subtly disrupt task completion while
maintaining high concealment. These attacks are evaluated in centralized,
decentralized, and layered communication structures. Experiments conducted on
six benchmark datasets, including MMLU, MMLU-Pro, HumanEval, GSM8K, arithmetic,
and biographies, demonstrate that they exhibit strong disruptive capabilities.
To identify these threats, we propose a psychology-based detection framework
AgentXposed, which combines the HEXACO personality model with the Reid
Technique, using progressive questionnaire inquiries and behavior-based
monitoring. Experiments conducted on six types of attacks show that our
detection framework effectively identifies all types of malicious behaviors.
The detection rate for our intention-hiding attacks is slightly lower than that
of the two baselines, Incorrect Fact Injection and Dark Traits Injection,
demonstrating the effectiveness of intention concealment. Our findings reveal
the structural and behavioral risks posed by intention-hiding attacks and offer
valuable insights into securing LLM-based multi-agent systems through
psychological perspectives, which contributes to a deeper understanding of
multi-agent safety. The code and data are available at

Abstract: We propose a scalable and cost-efficient framework for deploying Graph-based
Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) in enterprise environments. While
GraphRAG has shown promise for multi-hop reasoning and structured retrieval,
its adoption has been limited by the high computational cost of constructing
knowledge graphs using large language models (LLMs) and the latency of
graph-based retrieval. To address these challenges, we introduce two core
innovations: (1) a dependency-based knowledge graph construction pipeline that
leverages industrial-grade NLP libraries to extract entities and relations from
unstructured text completely eliminating reliance on LLMs; and (2) a
lightweight graph retrieval strategy that combines hybrid query node
identification with efficient one-hop traversal for high-recall, low-latency
subgraph extraction. We evaluate our framework on two SAP datasets focused on
legacy code migration and demonstrate strong empirical performance. Our system
achieves up to 15% and 4.35% improvements over traditional RAG baselines based
on LLM-as-Judge and RAGAS metrics, respectively. Moreover, our dependency-based
construction approach attains 94% of the performance of LLM-generated knowledge
graphs (61.87% vs. 65.83%) while significantly reducing cost and improving
scalability. These results validate the feasibility of deploying GraphRAG
systems in real-world, large-scale enterprise applications without incurring
prohibitive resource requirements paving the way for practical, explainable,
and domain-adaptable retrieval-augmented reasoning.

Motivation: 在AI领域，监督与控制常被混淆，导致设计和评估系统时难以实现有效的人类监督。本文旨在澄清两者的区别，并为实践提供理论支持。

Method: 通过文献综述和理论分析，区分监督与控制的定义和功能，并基于此提出框架和成熟度模型。

Result: 提出了一个理论框架和成熟度模型，明确了监督与控制的适用条件、局限性和实践需求。

Conclusion: 监督与控制的有效区分和整合对AI系统的可靠性和问责制至关重要，但仍需进一步的技术和概念发展。

Abstract: Oversight and control (collectively, supervision) are often invoked as key
levers for ensuring that AI systems are accountable, reliable, and able to
fulfill governance and management requirements. However, the concepts are
frequently conflated or insufficiently distinguished in academic and policy
discourse, undermining efforts to design or evaluate systems that should remain
under meaningful human supervision.
  This paper undertakes a targeted critical review of literature on supervision
outside of AI, along with a brief summary of past work on the topic related to
AI. We then differentiate control as being ex-ante or real-time, and
operational rather than policy or governance. In contrast, oversight is either
a policy and governance function, or is ex-post. We suggest that control aims
to prevent failures. In contrast, oversight often focuses on detection,
remediation, or incentives for future prevention; all preventative oversight
strategies nonetheless necessitate control.
  Building on this foundation, we make three contributions. First, we propose a
theoretically-informed yet policy-grounded framework that articulates the
conditions under which each mechanism is possible, where they fall short, and
what is required to make them meaningful in practice. Second, we outline how
supervision methods should be documented and integrated into risk management,
and drawing on the Microsoft Responsible AI Maturity Model, we outline a
maturity model for AI supervision. Third, we explicitly highlight some
boundaries of these mechanisms, including where they apply, where they fail,
and where it is clear that no existing methods suffice. This foregrounds the
question of whether meaningful supervision is possible in a given deployment
context, and can support regulators, auditors, and practitioners in identifying
both present limitations and the need for new conceptual and technical
advances.

Motivation: 在ORAN架构中，LLMs的微调成本高昂，RAG提供了一种无需完全重新训练的领域适应方法。然而，现有方法缺乏系统性的评估，尤其是在高风险的ORAN领域。

Method: 研究比较了Vector RAG、GraphRAG和Hybrid GraphRAG，使用ORAN规范进行评估，衡量了生成指标（如事实正确性、上下文相关性等）。

Result: GraphRAG和Hybrid GraphRAG表现优于传统RAG。Hybrid GraphRAG在事实正确性上提升8%，GraphRAG在上下文相关性上提升7%。

Conclusion: GraphRAG和Hybrid GraphRAG在ORAN领域具有潜力，尤其是在需要多跳推理和事实基础的场景中。

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is expected to play a pivotal role in enabling
autonomous optimization in future wireless networks. Within the ORAN
architecture, Large Language Models (LLMs) can be specialized to generate xApps
and rApps by leveraging specifications and API definitions from the RAN
Intelligent Controller (RIC) platform. However, fine-tuning base LLMs for
telecom-specific tasks remains expensive and resource-intensive.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a practical alternative through
in-context learning, enabling domain adaptation without full retraining. While
traditional RAG systems rely on vector-based retrieval, emerging variants such
as GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG incorporate knowledge graphs or dual retrieval
strategies to support multi-hop reasoning and improve factual grounding.
Despite their promise, these methods lack systematic, metric-driven
evaluations, particularly in high-stakes domains such as ORAN. In this study,
we conduct a comparative evaluation of Vector RAG, GraphRAG, and Hybrid
GraphRAG using ORAN specifications. We assess performance across varying
question complexities using established generation metrics: faithfulness,
answer relevance, context relevance, and factual correctness. Results show that
both GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG outperform traditional RAG. Hybrid GraphRAG
improves factual correctness by 8%, while GraphRAG improves context relevance
by 7%.

Abstract: Documenting tacit knowledge in organizations can be a challenging task due to
incomplete initial information, difficulty in identifying knowledgeable
individuals, the interplay of formal hierarchies and informal networks, and the
need to ask the right questions. To address this, we propose an agent-based
framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) to iteratively reconstruct
dataset descriptions through interactions with employees. Modeling knowledge
dissemination as a Susceptible-Infectious (SI) process with waning infectivity,
we conduct 864 simulations across various synthetic company structures and
different dissemination parameters. Our results show that the agent achieves
94.9% full-knowledge recall, with self-critical feedback scores strongly
correlating with external literature critic scores. We analyze how each
simulation parameter affects the knowledge retrieval process for the agent. In
particular, we find that our approach is able to recover information without
needing to access directly the only domain specialist. These findings highlight
the agent's ability to navigate organizational complexity and capture
fragmented knowledge that would otherwise remain inaccessible.

Conclusion: AIProbe有助于可靠部署自主代理，通过明确区分代理缺陷和环境不可行性。

Abstract: When an autonomous agent behaves undesirably, including failure to complete a
task, it can be difficult to determine whether the behavior is due to a
systemic agent error, such as flaws in the model or policy, or an environment
error, where a task is inherently infeasible under a given environment
configuration, even for an ideal agent. As agents and their environments grow
more complex, identifying the error source becomes increasingly difficult but
critical for reliable deployment. We introduce AIProbe, a novel black-box
testing technique that applies differential testing to attribute undesirable
agent behaviors either to agent deficiencies, such as modeling or training
flaws, or due to environmental infeasibility. AIProbe first generates diverse
environmental configurations and tasks for testing the agent, by modifying
configurable parameters using Latin Hypercube sampling. It then solves each
generated task using a search-based planner, independent of the agent. By
comparing the agent's performance to the planner's solution, AIProbe identifies
whether failures are due to errors in the agent's model or policy, or due to
unsolvable task conditions. Our evaluation across multiple domains shows that
AIProbe significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in detecting both
total and unique errors, thereby contributing to a reliable deployment of
autonomous agents.

Motivation: 当前方法无法同时优化RTL代码的功能正确性和硬件质量（PPA），需要一种新方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 采用分层奖励驱动的强化学习框架，结合语法、功能正确性和PPA指标的反馈。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，ChipSeek-R1在功能正确性上达到最优，并在PPA指标上超越了人类编写的代码。

Conclusion: 强化学习结合工具链反馈能有效生成超越人类水平的RTL代码。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant potential for automating
Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code generation. However, current approaches face
a critical challenge: they can not simultaneously optimize for functional
correctness and hardware quality (Power, Performance, Area - PPA). Methods
based on supervised fine-tuning often generate functionally correct but
PPA-suboptimal code, lacking mechanisms to learn optimization principles. In
contrast, post-processing techniques that attempt to improve PPA metrics after
generation are often inefficient because they operate externally without
updating the LLM's parameters, thus failing to enhance the model's intrinsic
design capabilities.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce ChipSeek-R1, a hierarchical reward-driven
reinforcement learning framework to train LLMs to generate RTL code that
achieves both functional correctness and optimized PPA metrics. ChipSeek-R1
employs a hierarchical reward system, which incorporates direct feedback on
syntax, functional correctness (from simulators) and PPA metrics (from
synthesis tools) during reinforcement learning. This enables the model to learn
complex hardware design trade-offs via trial-and-error, generating RTL code
that is both functionally correct and PPA-optimized. Evaluating ChipSeek-R1 on
standard benchmarks (VerilogEval, RTLLM), we achieve state-of-the-art results
in functional correctness. Notably, on the RTLLM benchmark, ChipSeek-R1
generated 27 RTL designs surpassing the PPA metrics of the original
human-written code. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating
toolchain feedback into LLM training and highlight the potential for
reinforcement learning to enable automated generation of human-surpassing RTL
code. We open-source our code in anonymous github.

Abstract: The high computational cost and power consumption of current and anticipated
AI systems present a major challenge for widespread deployment and further
scaling. Current hardware approaches face fundamental efficiency limits. This
paper introduces ZettaLith, a scalable computing architecture designed to
reduce the cost and power of AI inference by over 1,000x compared to current
GPU-based systems. Based on architectural analysis and technology projections,
a single ZettaLith rack could potentially achieve 1.507 zettaFLOPS in 2027 -
representing a theoretical 1,047x improvement in inference performance, 1,490x
better power efficiency, and could be 2,325x more cost-effective than current
leading GPU racks for FP4 transformer inference. The ZettaLith architecture
achieves these gains by abandoning general purpose GPU applications, and via
the multiplicative effect of numerous co-designed architectural innovations
using established digital electronic technologies, as detailed in this paper.
ZettaLith's core architectural principles scale down efficiently to exaFLOPS
desktop systems and petaFLOPS mobile chips, maintaining their roughly 1,000x
advantage. ZettaLith presents a simpler system architecture compared to the
complex hierarchy of current GPU clusters. ZettaLith is optimized exclusively

performance compared to students. We evaluate four model families with five

per question. Although the best model correctly answers on average 58.5 % of
the questions using majority vote aggregation, human participants consistently
outperform AI on questions involving visual components. Interestingly, human
performance remains stable across question features but varies by subject,
whereas AI performance is susceptible to both subject matter and question

automatically generated by Large Language Model driven algorithm discovery
methods. Using the Large Language Evolutionary Algorithm (LLaMEA) framework
with a GPT o4-mini LLM, we iteratively evolve black-box optimisation
heuristics, evaluated on 10 functions from the BBOB benchmark suite. Six LLaMEA
variants, featuring different mutation prompt strategies, are compared and
analysed. We log dynamic behavioural metrics including exploration,
exploitation, convergence and stagnation measures, for each run, and analyse
these via visual projections and network-based representations. Our analysis
combines behaviour-based
  projections, Code Evolution Graphs built from static code features,
performance convergence curves, and behaviour-based Search Trajectory Networks.
The results reveal clear differences in search dynamics and algorithm
structures across LLaMEA configurations. Notably, the variant that employs both
a code simplification prompt and a random perturbation prompt in a 1+1 elitist
evolution strategy, achieved the best performance, with the highest Area Over
the Convergence Curve. Behaviour-space visualisations show that
higher-performing algorithms exhibit more intensive exploitation behaviour and
faster convergence with less stagnation. Our findings demonstrate how
behaviour-space analysis can explain why certain LLM-designed heuristics
outperform others and how LLM-driven algorithm discovery navigates the
open-ended and complex search space of algorithms. These findings provide
insights to guide the future design of adaptive LLM-driven algorithm

Method: 设计双通道模型，Mamba通道提取变量内特征（通道独立），Transformer通道建模跨时间步全局依赖（通道混合），并通过融合层整合。

Result: 在八个公开数据集上验证了DC-Mamber的优越性。

Conclusion: DC-Mamber在准确性和效率上优于现有模型，为时间序列预测提供了新思路。

Abstract: In multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF), existing strategies for
processing sequences are typically categorized as channel-independent and
channel-mixing. The former treats all temporal information of each variable as
a token, focusing on capturing local temporal features of individual variables,
while the latter constructs a token from the multivariate information at each
time step, emphasizing the modeling of global temporal dependencies. Current
mainstream models are mostly based on Transformer and the emerging Mamba.
Transformers excel at modeling global dependencies through self-attention
mechanisms but exhibit limited sensitivity to local temporal patterns and
suffer from quadratic computational complexity, restricting their efficiency in
long-sequence processing. In contrast, Mamba, based on state space models
(SSMs), achieves linear complexity and efficient long-range modeling but
struggles to aggregate global contextual information in parallel. To overcome
the limitations of both models, we propose DC-Mamber, a dual-channel
forecasting model based on Mamba and linear Transformer for time series
forecasting. Specifically, the Mamba-based channel employs a
channel-independent strategy to extract intra-variable features, while the
Transformer-based channel adopts a channel-mixing strategy to model
cross-timestep global dependencies. DC-Mamber first maps the raw input into two
distinct feature representations via separate embedding layers. These
representations are then processed by a variable encoder (built on Mamba) and a
temporal encoder (built on linear Transformer), respectively. Finally, a fusion
layer integrates the dual-channel features for prediction. Extensive
experiments on eight public datasets confirm DC-Mamber's superior accuracy over
existing models.

Method: 利用YCB数据集评估Monty在物体识别和姿态估计任务中的表现，分析其基于感知运动的学习、模块化架构和快速推理策略。

Result: Monty表现出鲁棒的泛化能力，能够高效分类物体全局形状和检测对称性，并通过模块间通信加速推理。

Conclusion: 千脑系统是一种有前景的AI新方法，Monty的初步成果支持其潜力。

Abstract: Current AI systems achieve impressive performance on many tasks, yet they
lack core attributes of biological intelligence, including rapid, continual
learning, representations grounded in sensorimotor interactions, and structured
knowledge that enables efficient generalization. Neuroscience theory suggests
that mammals evolved flexible intelligence through the replication of a
semi-independent, sensorimotor module, a functional unit known as a cortical
column. To address the disparity between biological and artificial
intelligence, thousand-brains systems were proposed as a means of mirroring the
architecture of cortical columns and their interactions.
  In the current work, we evaluate the unique properties of Monty, the first
implementation of a thousand-brains system. We focus on 3D object perception,
and in particular, the combined task of object recognition and pose estimation.
Utilizing the YCB dataset of household objects, we first assess Monty's use of
sensorimotor learning to build structured representations, finding that these
enable robust generalization. These representations include an emphasis on
classifying objects by their global shape, as well as a natural ability to
detect object symmetries. We then explore Monty's use of model-free and
model-based policies to enable rapid inference by supporting principled
movements. We find that such policies complement Monty's modular architecture,
a design that can accommodate communication between modules to further
accelerate inference speed via a novel `voting' algorithm. Finally, we examine
Monty's use of associative, Hebbian-like binding to enable rapid, continual,
and computationally efficient learning, properties that compare favorably to
current deep learning architectures. While Monty is still in a nascent stage of
development, these findings support thousand-brains systems as a powerful and
promising new approach to AI.

Result: PETs集成最高可降低攻击风险49.47%，且对模型效用和解释质量影响较小。

Conclusion: PETs在XAI中的应用能有效平衡隐私保护和系统性能。

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is a crucial pathway in mitigating
the risk of non-transparency in the decision-making process of black-box
Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. However, despite the benefits, XAI
methods are found to leak the privacy of individuals whose data is used in
training or querying the models. Researchers have demonstrated privacy attacks
that exploit explanations to infer sensitive personal information of
individuals. Currently there is a lack of defenses against known privacy
attacks targeting explanations when vulnerable XAI are used in production and
machine learning as a service system. To address this gap, in this article, we
explore Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) as a defense mechanism against
attribute inference on explanations provided by feature-based XAI methods. We
empirically evaluate 3 types of PETs, namely synthetic training data,
differentially private training and noise addition, on two categories of
feature-based XAI. Our evaluation determines different responses from the
mitigation methods and side-effects of PETs on other system properties such as
utility and performance. In the best case, PETs integration in explanations
reduced the risk of the attack by 49.47%, while maintaining model utility and
explanation quality. Through our evaluation, we identify strategies for using
PETs in XAI for maximizing benefits and minimizing the success of this privacy
attack on sensitive personal information.

effective method of selecting examples for the LLM's in-context learning. We
evaluate the performance of three advanced LLMs and two state-of-the-art

that the best-performing LLM matches the accuracy of the most accurate machine

Conclusion: TALENTS框架有效解决了异构团队的动态适应问题，提升了协作任务的性能。

Abstract: In collaborative tasks, being able to adapt to your teammates is a necessary
requirement for success. When teammates are heterogeneous, such as in
human-agent teams, agents need to be able to observe, recognize, and adapt to
their human partners in real time. This becomes particularly challenging in
tasks with time pressure and complex strategic spaces where the dynamics can
change rapidly. In this work, we introduce TALENTS, a strategy-conditioned
cooperator framework that learns to represent, categorize, and adapt to a range
of partner strategies, enabling ad-hoc teamwork. Our approach utilizes a
variational autoencoder to learn a latent strategy space from trajectory data.
This latent space represents the underlying strategies that agents employ.
Subsequently, the system identifies different types of strategy by clustering
the data. Finally, a cooperator agent is trained to generate partners for each
type of strategy, conditioned on these clusters. In order to adapt to
previously unseen partners, we leverage a fixed-share regret minimization
algorithm that infers and adjusts the estimated partner strategy dynamically.
We assess our approach in a customized version of the Overcooked environment,
posing a challenging cooperative cooking task that demands strong coordination
across a wide range of possible strategies. Using an online user study, we show
that our agent outperforms current baselines when working with unfamiliar human
partners.

masking on mel-spectrograms. We evaluate on the X-ARES suite covering speech,
music, and environmental sound tasks. Although our implementation is a

Conclusion: LLM4Hint通过LLM的语义理解能力，显著提升了查询优化的性能，为LLM在数据库领域的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Query optimization is essential for efficient SQL query execution in DBMS,
and remains attractive over time due to the growth of data volumes and advances
in hardware. Existing traditional optimizers struggle with the cumbersome
hand-tuning required for complex workloads, and the learning-based methods face
limitations in ensuring generalization. With the great success of Large
Language Model (LLM) across diverse downstream tasks, this paper explores how
LLMs can be incorporated to enhance the generalization of learned optimizers.
Though promising, such an incorporation still presents challenges, mainly
including high model inference latency, and the substantial fine-tuning cost
and suboptimal performance due to inherent discrepancy between the token
sequences in LLM and structured SQL execution plans with rich numerical
features.
  In this paper, we focus on recurring queries in offline optimization to
alleviate the issue of high inference latency, and propose \textbf{LLM4Hint}
that leverages moderate-sized backbone LLMs to recommend query optimization
hints. LLM4Hint achieves the goals through: (i) integrating a lightweight model
to produce a soft prompt, which captures the data distribution in DBMS and the
SQL predicates to provide sufficient optimization features while simultaneously
reducing the context length fed to the LLM, (ii) devising a query rewriting
strategy using a larger commercial LLM, so as to simplify SQL semantics for the
backbone LLM and reduce fine-tuning costs, and (iii) introducing an explicit
matching prompt to facilitate alignment between the LLM and the lightweight
model, which can accelerate convergence of the combined model. Experiments show
that LLM4Hint, by leveraging the LLM's stronger capability to understand the
query statement, can outperform the state-of-the-art learned optimizers in
terms of both effectiveness and generalization.

Abstract: Our research addresses the overlooked security concerns related to data
poisoning in continual learning (CL). Data poisoning - the intentional
manipulation of training data to affect the predictions of machine learning
models - was recently shown to be a threat to CL training stability. While
existing literature predominantly addresses scenario-dependent attacks, we
propose to focus on a more simple and realistic single-task poison (STP)
threats. In contrast to previously proposed poisoning settings, in STP
adversaries lack knowledge and access to the model, as well as to both previous
and future tasks. During an attack, they only have access to the current task
within the data stream. Our study demonstrates that even within these stringent
conditions, adversaries can compromise model performance using standard image
corruptions. We show that STP attacks are able to strongly disrupt the whole
continual training process: decreasing both the stability (its performance on
past tasks) and plasticity (capacity to adapt to new tasks) of the algorithm.
Finally, we propose a high-level defense framework for CL along with a poison
task detection method based on task vectors. The code is available at

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents are designed to autonomously execute diverse device-control
tasks by interpreting and interacting with mobile screens. Despite notable
advancements, their resilience in real-world scenarios where screen content may
be partially manipulated by untrustworthy third parties remains largely
unexplored. Owing to their black-box and autonomous nature, these agents are
vulnerable to manipulations that could compromise user devices. In this work,
we present the first systematic investigation into the vulnerabilities of
mobile GUI agents. We introduce a scalable attack simulation framework
AgentHazard, which enables flexible and targeted modifications of screen
content within existing applications. Leveraging this framework, we develop a
comprehensive benchmark suite comprising both a dynamic task execution
environment and a static dataset of vision-language-action tuples, totaling
over 3,000 attack scenarios. The dynamic environment encompasses 58
reproducible tasks in an emulator with various types of hazardous UI content,
while the static dataset is constructed from 210 screenshots collected from 14
popular commercial apps. Importantly, our content modifications are designed to
be feasible for unprivileged third parties. We evaluate 7 widely-used mobile
GUI agents and 5 common backbone models using our benchmark. Our findings
reveal that all examined agents are significantly influenced by misleading
third-party content (with an average misleading rate of 28.8% in human-crafted
attack scenarios) and that their vulnerabilities are closely linked to the
employed perception modalities and backbone LLMs. Furthermore, we assess

Conclusion: 改进的离散马尔可夫链框架在语言建模中表现优异，为分类数据建模提供了新的思路。

Abstract: While continuous diffusion models excel in modeling continuous distributions,
their application to categorical data has been less effective. Recent work has
shown that ratio-matching through score-entropy within a continuous-time
discrete Markov chain (CTMC) framework serves as a competitive alternative to
autoregressive models in language modeling. To enhance this framework, we first
introduce three new theorems concerning the KL divergence between the data and
learned distribution. Our results serve as the discrete counterpart to those
established for continuous diffusion models and allow us to derive an improved
upper bound of the perplexity. Second, we empirically show that ratio-matching
performed by minimizing the denoising cross-entropy between the clean and
corrupted data enables models to outperform those utilizing score-entropy with
up to 10% lower perplexity/generative-perplexity, and 15% faster training
steps. To further support our findings, we introduce and evaluate a novel CTMC
transition-rate matrix that allows prediction refinement, and derive the
analytic expression for its matrix exponential which facilitates the
computation of conditional ratios thus enabling efficient training and
generation.

Conclusion: LILITH为意识研究提供新方向，但实现挑战巨大。

Abstract: Current paradigms in Artificial Intelligence rely on layers of feedforward
networks which model brain activity at the neuronal level. We conjecture that
expanding to the level of multiple brain regions with chemical signaling may be
a productive step toward understanding the emergence of consciousness. We
propose LILITH, a novel architecture that combines developmental training of
modular language models with brain-inspired token-based communication
protocols, mirroring chemical signaling in the brain. Our approach models
distinct brain regions as specialized LLM modules including thinking, memory,
sensory, and regulatory components that communicate through emergent
token-based signaling protocols analogous to neurotransmitter networks. Unlike
traditional pre-trained systems, LILITH would employ developmental training
where untrained LLM architectures learn through simulated life experiences,
developing communication pathways and cognitive abilities through environmental
interaction and evolutionary optimization. This framework would enable direct
empirical investigation of consciousness emergence using Integrated Information
Theory metrics while providing unprecedented insight into inter-module
signaling patterns during development. By optimizing for consciousness
emergence rather than task performance, LILITH could provide insight into
different emergent phenomena at multiple levels of neural correlates,
contrasting neuronal-level processing with multi-region coordination dynamics.
The goal of this paper is to put the idea forward while recognizing the
substantial challenges in implementing such a system.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized various fields with their
exceptional capabilities in understanding, processing, and generating
human-like text. This paper investigates the potential of LLMs in advancing
Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS), analyzing current challenges,
methodologies, and future opportunities. It begins by establishing a
foundational understanding of NIDS and LLMs, exploring the enabling
technologies that bridge the gap between intelligent and cognitive systems in
AI-driven NIDS. While Intelligent NIDS leverage machine learning and deep
learning to detect threats based on learned patterns, they often lack
contextual awareness and explainability. In contrast, Cognitive NIDS integrate
LLMs to process both structured and unstructured security data, enabling deeper
contextual reasoning, explainable decision-making, and automated response for
intrusion behaviors. Practical implementations are then detailed, highlighting
LLMs as processors, detectors, and explainers within a comprehensive AI-driven
NIDS pipeline. Furthermore, the concept of an LLM-centered Controller is
proposed, emphasizing its potential to coordinate intrusion detection
workflows, optimizing tool collaboration and system performance. Finally, this
paper identifies critical challenges and opportunities, aiming to foster
innovation in developing reliable, adaptive, and explainable NIDS. By
presenting the transformative potential of LLMs, this paper seeks to inspire
advancement in next-generation network security systems.

Abstract: In the field of robotics, researchers face a critical challenge in ensuring
reliable and efficient task planning. Verifying high-level task plans before
execution significantly reduces errors and enhance the overall performance of
these systems. In this paper, we propose an architecture for automatically
verifying high-level task plans before their execution in simulator or
real-world environments. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), our approach
consists of two key steps: first, the conversion of natural language
instructions into Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), followed by a comprehensive
analysis of action sequences. The module uses the reasoning capabilities of the
LLM to evaluate logical coherence and identify potential gaps in the plan.
Rigorous testing on datasets of varying complexity demonstrates the broad
applicability of the module to household tasks. We contribute to improving the
reliability and efficiency of task planning and addresses the critical need for
robust pre-execution verification in autonomous systems. The code is available

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising framework for autonomous
driving by enabling agents to learn control policies through interaction with
environments. However, large and high-dimensional action spaces often used to
support fine-grained control can impede training efficiency and increase
exploration costs. In this study, we introduce and evaluate two novel
structured action space modification strategies for RL in autonomous driving:
dynamic masking and relative action space reduction. These approaches are
systematically compared against fixed reduction schemes and full action space
baselines to assess their impact on policy learning and performance. Our
framework leverages a multimodal Proximal Policy Optimization agent that
processes both semantic image sequences and scalar vehicle states. The proposed
dynamic and relative strategies incorporate real-time action masking based on
context and state transitions, preserving action consistency while eliminating
invalid or suboptimal choices. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse
driving routes, we show that action space reduction significantly improves
training stability and policy performance. The dynamic and relative schemes, in
particular, achieve a favorable balance between learning speed, control
precision, and generalization. These findings highlight the importance of
context-aware action space design for scalable and reliable RL in autonomous
driving tasks.

traits to other agents, an excessive reliance on anecdote and descriptive

research. We recommend that research into AI scheming actively seeks to avoid

Result: GDGB支持严格的DyTAG生成评估，揭示了结构和文本特征的交互作用。

Conclusion: GDGB为DyTAG生成研究提供了基础资源，推动了实际应用。

Abstract: Dynamic Text-Attributed Graphs (DyTAGs), which intricately integrate
structural, temporal, and textual attributes, are crucial for modeling complex
real-world systems. However, most of the existing DyTAG datasets exhibit poor
textual quality, which severely limits their utility for DyTAG generation tasks
requiring semantically rich inputs. Additionally, prior work mainly focuses on
discriminative tasks on DyTAGs, resulting in a lack of standardized task
formulations and evaluation protocols tailored for DyTAG generation. To address
these critical issues, we propose Generative DyTAG Benchmark (GDGB), which
comprises eight meticulously curated DyTAG datasets with high-quality textual
features for both nodes and edges, overcoming limitations of prior datasets.
Building on GDGB, we define two novel DyTAG generation tasks: Transductive
Dynamic Graph Generation (TDGG) and Inductive Dynamic Graph Generation (IDGG).
TDGG transductively generates a target DyTAG based on the given source and
destination node sets, while the more challenging IDGG introduces new node
generation to inductively model the dynamic expansion of real-world graph data.
To enable holistic evaluation, we design multifaceted metrics that assess the
structural, temporal, and textual quality of the generated DyTAGs. We further
propose GAG-General, an LLM-based multi-agent generative framework tailored for
reproducible and robust benchmarking of DyTAG generation. Experimental results
demonstrate that GDGB enables rigorous evaluation of TDGG and IDGG, with key
insights revealing the critical interplay of structural and textual features in
DyTAG generation. These findings establish GDGB as a foundational resource for
advancing generative DyTAG research and unlocking further practical
applications in DyTAG generation. GDGB datasets, source codes, and leaderboards

Abstract: Identifying the associations between imaging phenotypes and disease risk
factors and outcomes is essential for understanding disease mechanisms and
improving diagnosis and prognosis models. However, traditional approaches rely
on human-driven hypothesis testing and selection of association factors, often
overlooking complex, non-linear dependencies among imaging phenotypes and other
multi-modal data. To address this, we introduce a Multi-agent Exploratory
Synergy for the Heart (MESHAgents) framework that leverages large language
models as agents to dynamically elicit, surface, and decide confounders and
phenotypes in association studies, using cardiovascular imaging as a proof of
concept. Specifically, we orchestrate a multi-disciplinary team of AI agents --
spanning cardiology, biomechanics, statistics, and clinical research -- which
spontaneously generate and converge on insights through iterative,
self-organizing reasoning. The framework dynamically synthesizes statistical
correlations with multi-expert consensus, providing an automated pipeline for
phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS). We demonstrate the system's
capabilities through a population-based study of imaging phenotypes of the
heart and aorta. MESHAgents autonomously uncovered correlations between imaging
phenotypes and a wide range of non-imaging factors, identifying additional
confounder variables beyond standard demographic factors. Validation on
diagnosis tasks reveals that MESHAgents-discovered phenotypes achieve
performance comparable to expert-selected phenotypes, with mean AUC differences
as small as -0.004 on disease classification tasks. Notably, the recall score
improves for 6 out of 9 disease types. Our framework provides clinically
relevant imaging phenotypes with transparent reasoning, offering a scalable
alternative to expert-driven methods.

Abstract: Dynamic task assignment concerns the optimal assignment of resources to tasks
in a business process. Recently, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been
proposed as the state of the art for solving assignment problems. DRL methods
usually employ a neural network (NN) as an approximator for the policy
function, which ingests the state of the process and outputs a valuation of the
possible assignments. However, representing the state and the possible
assignments so that they can serve as inputs and outputs for a policy NN
remains an open challenge, especially when tasks or resources have features
with an infinite number of possible values. To solve this problem, this paper
proposes a method for representing and solving assignment problems with
infinite state and action spaces. In doing so, it provides three contributions:
(I) A graph-based feature representation of assignment problems, which we call
assignment graph; (II) A mapping from marked Colored Petri Nets to assignment
graphs; (III) An adaptation of the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm that
can learn to solve assignment problems represented through assignment graphs.
To evaluate the proposed representation method, we model three archetypal
assignment problems ranging from finite to infinite state and action space
dimensionalities. The experiments show that the method is suitable for
representing and learning close-to-optimal task assignment policies regardless
of the state and action space dimensionalities.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph (KG) reasoning has received significant attention in the
fields of artificial intelligence and knowledge engineering, owing to its
ability to autonomously deduce new knowledge and consequently enhance the
availability and precision of downstream applications. However, current methods
predominantly concentrate on a single form of neural or symbolic reasoning,
failing to effectively integrate the inherent strengths of both approaches.
Furthermore, the current prevalent methods primarily focus on addressing a
single reasoning scenario, presenting limitations in meeting the diverse
demands of real-world reasoning tasks. Unifying the neural and symbolic
methods, as well as diverse reasoning scenarios in one model is challenging as
there is a natural representation gap between symbolic rules and neural
networks, and diverse scenarios exhibit distinct knowledge structures and
specific reasoning objectives. To address these issues, we propose a unified
neurosymbolic reasoning framework, namely Tunsr, for KG reasoning. Tunsr first
introduces a consistent structure of reasoning graph that starts from the query
entity and constantly expands subsequent nodes by iteratively searching
posterior neighbors. Based on it, a forward logic message-passing mechanism is
proposed to update both the propositional representations and attentions, as
well as first-order logic (FOL) representations and attentions of each node. In
this way, Tunsr conducts the transformation of merging multiple rules by
merging possible relations at each step. Finally, the FARI algorithm is
proposed to induce FOL rules by constantly performing attention calculations
over the reasoning graph. Extensive experimental results on 19 datasets of four
reasoning scenarios (transductive, inductive, interpolation, and extrapolation)
demonstrate the effectiveness of Tunsr.

Abstract: A large volume of XML data is produced in experiments carried out by robots
in laboratories. In order to support the interoperability of data between labs,
there is a motivation to translate the XML data into a knowledge graph. A key
stage of this process is the enrichment of the XML schema to lay the foundation

framework that employs large language models in different stages to extract and
accurately label the relationships implicitly present in the XML schema. We

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索系统无法处理教育场景中的多样性和模糊性，需要一种轻量高效的解决方案来支持个性化学习。

Method: 开发了Uni-Retrieval模块，结合Prompt Bank和MoE-LoRA技术，动态匹配查询风格；进一步与指令调优语言模型结合，形成Uni-RAG。

Result: 在SER等多模态基准测试中，Uni-RAG在检索准确性和生成质量上优于基线系统，且计算成本低。

Conclusion: Uni-RAG为智能教育系统提供了可扩展的解决方案，支持个性化学习。

Abstract: In AI-facilitated teaching, leveraging various query styles to interpret
abstract educational content is crucial for delivering effective and accessible
learning experiences. However, existing retrieval systems predominantly focus
on natural text-image matching and lack the capacity to address the diversity
and ambiguity inherent in real-world educational scenarios. To address this
limitation, we develop a lightweight and efficient multi-modal retrieval
module, named Uni-Retrieval, which extracts query-style prototypes and
dynamically matches them with tokens from a continually updated Prompt Bank.
This Prompt Bank encodes and stores domain-specific knowledge by leveraging a
Mixture-of-Expert Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE-LoRA) module and can be adapted to
enhance Uni-Retrieval's capability to accommodate unseen query types at test
time. To enable natural language educational content generation, we integrate
the original Uni-Retrieval with a compact instruction-tuned language model,
forming a complete retrieval-augmented generation pipeline named Uni-RAG. Given
a style-conditioned query, Uni-RAG first retrieves relevant educational
materials and then generates human-readable explanations, feedback, or
instructional content aligned with the learning objective. Experimental results
on SER and other multi-modal benchmarks show that Uni-RAG outperforms baseline
retrieval and RAG systems in both retrieval accuracy and generation quality,
while maintaining low computational cost. Our framework provides a scalable,
pedagogically grounded solution for intelligent educational systems, bridging
retrieval and generation to support personalized, explainable, and efficient
learning assistance across diverse STEM scenarios.

Result: 实验表明，MUS-ASP在MUS枚举和计数任务中表现优异，尤其是在与混合求解器结合时。

Conclusion: MUS-ASP是一个高效的工具，能够加速MUS的枚举和计数，为相关应用提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Given an unsatisfiable formula, understanding the core reason for
unsatisfiability is crucial in several applications. One effective way to
capture this is through the minimal unsatisfiable subset (MUS), the
subset-minimal set of clauses that remains unsatisfiable. Current research
broadly focuses on two directions: (i) enumerating as many MUSes as possible
within a given time limit, and (ii) counting the total number of MUSes for a
given unsatisfiable formula.
  In this paper, we introduce an answer set programming-based framework, named
MUS-ASP, designed for online enumeration of MUSes. ASP is a powerful tool for
its strengths in knowledge representation and is particularly suitable for
specifying complex combinatorial problems. By translating MUS enumeration into
answer set solving, MUS-ASP leverages the computational efficiency of
state-of-the-art ASP systems. Our extensive experimental evaluation
demonstrates the effectiveness of MUS-ASP and highlights the acceleration in
both MUS enumeration and counting tasks, particularly when integrated within
hybrid solvers, including the framework proposed in this paper.

Abstract: The gap between static benchmarks and the dynamic nature of real-world legal
practice poses a key barrier to advancing legal intelligence. To this end, we
introduce J1-ENVS, the first interactive and dynamic legal environment tailored
for LLM-based agents. Guided by legal experts, it comprises six representative
scenarios from Chinese legal practices across three levels of environmental
complexity. We further introduce J1-EVAL, a fine-grained evaluation framework,
designed to assess both task performance and procedural compliance across
varying levels of legal proficiency. Extensive experiments on 17 LLM agents
reveal that, while many models demonstrate solid legal knowledge, they struggle
with procedural execution in dynamic settings. Even the SOTA model, GPT-4o,
falls short of 60% overall performance. These findings highlight persistent
challenges in achieving dynamic legal intelligence and offer valuable insights

Abstract: Contemporary multi-agent systems encounter persistent challenges in
cross-platform interoperability, dynamic task scheduling, and efficient
resource sharing. Agents with heterogeneous implementations often lack
standardized interfaces; collaboration frameworks remain brittle and hard to
extend; scheduling policies are static; and inter-agent state synchronization
is insufficient. We propose Hierarchical Agent Workflow (HAWK), a modular
framework comprising five layers-User, Workflow, Operator, Agent, and
Resource-and supported by sixteen standardized interfaces. HAWK delivers an
end-to-end pipeline covering task parsing, workflow orchestration, intelligent
scheduling, resource invocation, and data synchronization. At its core lies an
adaptive scheduling and optimization module in the Workflow Layer, which
harnesses real-time feedback and dynamic strategy adjustment to maximize
utilization. The Resource Layer provides a unified abstraction over
heterogeneous data sources, large models, physical devices, and third-party
services&tools, simplifying cross-domain information retrieval. We demonstrate
HAWK's scalability and effectiveness via CreAgentive, a multi-agent
novel-generation prototype, which achieves marked gains in throughput, lowers
invocation complexity, and improves system controllability. We also show how
hybrid deployments of large language models integrate seamlessly within HAWK,

Abstract: Medication recommendation is a crucial task in healthcare, especially for

struggle to effectively balance the reuse of historical medications with the
introduction of new drugs in response to the changing patient conditions. In
order to address this challenge, we propose an Adaptively Responsive network

piecewise temporal learning component that distinguishes between recent and
distant patient history, enabling more nuanced temporal understanding, and 2)
an adaptively responsive mechanism that dynamically adjusts attention to new

history. Experiments on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets indicate that ARMR
has better performance compared with the state-of-the-art baselines in
different evaluation metrics, which contributes to more personalized and

Conclusion: TRAP在噪声鲁棒性和泛化性上表现优异，为自动驾驶异常检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a critical role in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) by
identifying unusual behaviors through perception systems that could compromise
safety and lead to hazardous situations. Current approaches, which often rely
on predefined thresholds or supervised learning paradigms, exhibit reduced
efficacy when confronted with unseen scenarios, sensor noise, and occlusions,
leading to potential safety-critical failures. Moreover, supervised methods
require large annotated datasets, limiting their real-world feasibility. To
address these gaps, we propose an anomaly detection framework based on Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (IRL) to infer latent driving intentions from sequential
perception data, thus enabling robust identification. Specifically, we present
Trajectory-Reward Guided Adaptive Pre-training (TRAP), a novel IRL framework
for anomaly detection, to address two critical limitations of existing methods:
noise robustness and generalization to unseen scenarios. Our core innovation is
implicitly learning temporal credit assignments via reward and worst-case
supervision. We leverage pre-training with variable-horizon sampling to
maximize time-to-consequence, resulting in early detection of behavior
deviation. Experiments on 14,000+ simulated trajectories demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance, achieving 0.90 AUC and 82.2\% F1-score -
outperforming similarly trained supervised and unsupervised baselines by 39\%
on Recall and 12\% on F1-score, respectively. Similar performance is achieved
while exhibiting robustness to various noise types and generalization to unseen
anomaly types. Our code will be available at:

Result: 实验显示Rec-APC在用户类型较多时优于POMDP方法，收敛速度快且性能更优。

Conclusion: Rec-APC为聚合数据下的决策问题提供了新思路，适用于隐私保护场景。

Abstract: We study a sequential decision-making problem motivated by recent regulatory
and technological shifts that limit access to individual user data in
recommender systems (RSs), leaving only population-level preference
information. This privacy-aware setting poses fundamental challenges in
planning under uncertainty: Effective personalization requires exploration to
infer user preferences, yet unsatisfactory recommendations risk immediate user
churn. To address this, we introduce the Rec-APC model, in which an anonymous
user is drawn from a known prior over latent user types (e.g., personas or
clusters), and the decision-maker sequentially selects items to recommend.
Feedback is binary -- positive responses refine the posterior via Bayesian
updates, while negative responses result in the termination of the session.
  We prove that optimal policies converge to pure exploitation in finite time
and propose a branch-and-bound algorithm to efficiently compute them.
Experiments on synthetic and MovieLens data confirm rapid convergence and
demonstrate that our method outperforms the POMDP solver SARSOP, particularly
when the number of user types is large or comparable to the number of content
categories. Our results highlight the applicability of this approach and
inspire new ways to improve decision-making under the constraints imposed by
aggregated preference data.

Abstract: Engineering methodologies predominantly revolve around established principles

inputs and outputs at the component level, ensuring that the properties of
individual components are preserved upon composition. However, this view does
not transfer well to intelligent systems, particularly when addressing the
scaling of intelligence as a system property. Our prior research contends that
the engineering of general intelligence necessitates a fresh set of overarching
systems principles. As a result, we introduced the "core and periphery"
principles, a novel conceptual framework rooted in abstract systems theory and
the Law of Requisite Variety. In this paper, we assert that these abstract
concepts hold practical significance. Through empirical evidence, we illustrate
their applicability to both biological and artificial intelligence systems,
bridging abstract theory with real-world implementations. Then, we expand on
our previous theoretical framework by mathematically defining core-dominant vs
periphery-dominant systems.

Conclusion: 多层协作策略有效解决了长尾问题，提升了对话推荐系统的效率和公平性。

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) often suffer from an extreme
long-tail distribution of dialogue data, causing a strong bias toward
head-frequency blockbusters that sacrifices diversity and exacerbates the
cold-start problem. An empirical analysis of DCRS and statistics on the REDIAL
corpus show that only 10% of head movies account for nearly half of all
mentions, whereas about 70% of tail movies receive merely 26% of the attention.
This imbalance gives rise to three critical challenges: head over-fitting, body
representation drift, and tail sparsity. To address these issues, we propose
LumiCRS, an end-to-end framework that mitigates long-tail imbalance through
three mutually reinforcing layers: (i) an Adaptive Comprehensive Focal Loss
(ACFL) that dynamically adjusts class weights and focusing factors to curb head
over-fitting and reduce popularity bias; (ii) Prototype Learning for Long-Tail
Recommendation, which selects semantic, affective, and contextual prototypes to
guide clustering and stabilize body and tail representations; and (iii) a
GPT-4o-driven prototype-guided dialogue augmentation module that automatically
generates diverse long-tail conversational snippets to alleviate tail sparsity
and distribution shift. Together, these strategies enable LumiCRS to markedly
improve recommendation accuracy, diversity, and fairness: on the REDIAL and
INSPIRED benchmarks, LumiCRS boosts Recall@10 and Tail-Recall@10 by 7-15% over
fifteen strong baselines, while human evaluations confirm superior fluency,
informativeness, and long-tail relevance. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of multi-layer collaboration in building an efficient and fair
long-tail conversational recommender.

Abstract: Enhancing interrogation capabilities in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)
diagnosis through multi-turn dialogues and knowledge graphs presents a
significant challenge for modern AI systems. Current large language models
(LLMs), despite their advancements, exhibit notable limitations in medical
applications, particularly in conducting effective multi-turn dialogues and
proactive questioning. These shortcomings hinder their practical application
and effectiveness in simulating real-world diagnostic scenarios. To address
these limitations, we propose DoPI, a novel LLM system specifically designed
for the TCM domain. The DoPI system introduces a collaborative architecture
comprising a guidance model and an expert model. The guidance model conducts
multi-turn dialogues with patients and dynamically generates questions based on
a knowledge graph to efficiently extract critical symptom information.
Simultaneously, the expert model leverages deep TCM expertise to provide final
diagnoses and treatment plans. Furthermore, this study constructs a multi-turn
doctor-patient dialogue dataset to simulate realistic consultation scenarios
and proposes a novel evaluation methodology that does not rely on manually
collected real-world consultation data. Experimental results show that the DoPI
system achieves an accuracy rate of 84.68 percent in interrogation outcomes,
significantly enhancing the model's communication ability during diagnosis
while maintaining professional expertise.

Abstract: Accident severity prediction plays a critical role in transportation safety
systems but is a persistently difficult task due to incomplete data, strong
feature dependencies, and severe class imbalance in which rare but
high-severity cases are underrepresented and hard to detect. Existing methods
often rely on monolithic models or black box prompting, which struggle to scale
in noisy, real-world settings and offer limited interpretability. To address
these challenges, we propose MARBLE a multiagent rule based LLM engine that
decomposes the severity prediction task across a team of specialized reasoning
agents, including an interchangeable ML-backed agent. Each agent focuses on a
semantic subset of features (e.g., spatial, environmental, temporal), enabling
scoped reasoning and modular prompting without the risk of prompt saturation.
Predictions are coordinated through either rule-based or LLM-guided consensus
mechanisms that account for class rarity and confidence dynamics. The system
retains structured traces of agent-level reasoning and coordination outcomes,
supporting in-depth interpretability and post-hoc performance diagnostics.
Across both UK and US datasets, MARBLE consistently outperforms traditional
machine learning classifiers and state-of-the-art (SOTA) prompt-based reasoning
methods including Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Least-to-Most (L2M), and
Tree-of-Thought (ToT) achieving nearly 90% accuracy where others plateau below
48%. This performance redefines the practical ceiling for accident severity
classification under real world noise and extreme class imbalance. Our results
position MARBLE as a generalizable and interpretable framework for reasoning
under uncertainty in safety-critical applications.

direct video RL, and inverse RL enhancement. Surprisingly, all RL approaches
underperformed DARIL i.e. world model RL dropped to 3.1% mAP at 10s while
direct video RL achieved only 15.9%. Our analysis reveals that distribution
matching on expert-annotated test sets systematically favors IL over
potentially valid RL policies that differ from training demonstrations. This
challenges assumptions about RL superiority in sequential decision making and
provides crucial insights for surgical AI development.

Result: 稳定模型语义符合因果充分性、自然必要性和未观察效应无关性等原则。

Conclusion: 分层溯因逻辑程序可作为因果建模和干预效果预测的框架。

Abstract: Pearl observes that causal knowledge enables predicting the effects of
interventions, such as actions, whereas descriptive knowledge only permits
drawing conclusions from observation. This paper extends Pearl's approach to
causality and interventions to the setting of stratified abductive logic
programs. It shows how stable models of such programs can be given a causal
interpretation by building on philosophical foundations and recent work by
Bochman and Eelink et al. In particular, it provides a translation of abductive
logic programs into causal systems, thereby clarifying the informal causal
reading of logic program rules and supporting principled reasoning about
external actions. The main result establishes that the stable model semantics
for stratified programs conforms to key philosophical principles of causation,
such as causal sufficiency, natural necessity, and irrelevance of unobserved
effects. This justifies the use of stratified abductive logic programs as a
framework for causal modeling and for predicting the effects of interventions

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KG推理方法依赖I.I.D假设，但在实际应用中可能因未知选择偏差或分布偏移而失效，限制了模型的性能和可靠性。

Method: 提出StableRule框架，结合特征解耦和规则学习网络，以增强OOD泛化能力。

Result: 在七个基准KG上的实验表明，该框架在异构环境中表现优异且稳定。

Conclusion: StableRule为实际应用中的KG推理提供了鲁棒性解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge graph (KG) reasoning remains a critical research area focused on
inferring missing knowledge by analyzing relationships among observed facts.
Despite its success, a key limitation of existing KG reasoning methods is their
dependence on the I.I.D assumption. This assumption can easily be violated due
to unknown sample selection bias during training or agnostic distribution
shifts during testing, significantly compromising model performance and
reliability. To facilitate the deployment of KG reasoning in wild environments,
this study investigates learning logical rules from KGs affected by unknown
selection bias. Additionally, we address test sets with agnostic distribution
shifts, formally defining this challenge as out-of-distribution (OOD) KG
reasoning-a previously underexplored problem. To solve the issue, we propose
the Stable Rule Learning (StableRule) framework, an end-to-end methodology that
integrates feature decorrelation with rule learning network, to enhance OOD
generalization performance. By leveraging feature decorrelation, the StableRule
framework mitigates the adverse effects of covariate shifts arising in OOD
scenarios, thereby improving the robustness of the rule learning component in
effectively deriving logical rules. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark
KGs demonstrate the framework's superior effectiveness and stability across
diverse heterogeneous environments, underscoring its practical significance for
real-world applications.

Result: 实验证明GIST优于现有方法，并在实际平台中显著提升广告系统性能。

Conclusion: GIST通过创新设计有效解决了跨域点击率预测的挑战。

Abstract: Cross-domain Click-Through Rate prediction aims to tackle the data sparsity
and the cold start problems in online advertising systems by transferring
knowledge from source domains to a target domain. Most existing methods rely on
overlapping users to facilitate this transfer, often focusing on joint training
or pre-training with fine-tuning approach to connect the source and target
domains. However, in real-world industrial settings, joint training struggles
to learn optimal representations with different distributions, and pre-training
with fine-tuning is not well-suited for continuously integrating new data. To
address these issues, we propose GIST, a cross-domain lifelong sequence model
that decouples the training processes of the source and target domains. Unlike
previous methods that search lifelong sequences in the source domains using
only content or behavior signals or their simple combinations, we innovatively
introduce a Content-Behavior Joint Training Module (CBJT), which aligns
content-behavior distributions and combines them with guided information to
facilitate a more stable representation. Furthermore, we develop an Asymmetric
Similarity Integration strategy (ASI) to augment knowledge transfer through
similarity computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
GIST, surpassing SOTA methods on offline evaluations and an online A/B test.
Deployed on the Xiaohongshu (RedNote) platform, GIST effectively enhances
online ads system performance at scale, serving hundreds of millions of daily
active users.

Result: 实验表明LLM-SAEA在标准测试案例中优于多种先进算法。

Conclusion: LLM-SAEA为SAEAs提供了一种高效且自动化的动态配置方法。

Abstract: Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) are a key tool for
addressing costly optimization tasks, with their efficiency being heavily
dependent on the selection of surrogate models and infill sampling criteria.
However, designing an effective dynamic selection strategy for SAEAs is
labor-intensive and requires substantial domain knowledge. To address this
challenge, this paper proposes LLM-SAEA, a novel approach that integrates large
language models (LLMs) to configure both surrogate models and infill sampling
criteria online. Specifically, LLM-SAEA develops a collaboration-of-experts
framework, where one LLM serves as a scoring expert (LLM-SE), assigning scores
to surrogate models and infill sampling criteria based on their optimization
performance, while another LLM acts as a decision expert (LLM-DE), selecting
the appropriate configurations by analyzing their scores along with the current
optimization state. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-SAEA outperforms
several state-of-the-art algorithms across standard test cases. The source code

Conclusion: 通过用户偏好驱动的权重计算和直观可视化，解决了多指标并行坐标图的解释问题。

Abstract: Parallel coordinate plots (PCPs) are a prevalent method to interpret the
relationship between the control parameters and metrics. PCPs deliver such an
interpretation by color gradation based on a single metric. However, it is
challenging to provide such a gradation when multiple metrics are present.
Although a naive approach involves calculating a single metric by linearly
weighting each metric, such weighting is unclear for users. To address this
problem, we first propose a principled formulation for calculating the optimal
weight based on a specific preferred metric combination. Although users can
simply select their preference from a two-dimensional (2D) plane for bi-metric
problems, multi-metric problems require intuitive visualization to allow them
to select their preference. We achieved this using various radar charts to
visualize the metric trade-offs on the 2D plane reduced by UMAP. In the
analysis using pedestrian flow guidance planning, our method identified unique
patterns of control parameter importance for each user preference, highlighting
the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: This paper explores the possibility of determining the weights and thresholds
of a neural network using the potential -- a parameter of an electrostatic
field -- without analytical calculations and without applying training
algorithms. The work is based on neural network architectures employing metric
recognition methods. The electrostatic field is simulated in the Builder C++
environment. In the same environment, a neural network based on metric
recognition methods is constructed, with the weights of the first-layer neurons
determined by the values of the potentials of the simulated electrostatic
field. The effectiveness of the resulting neural network within the simulated
system is evaluated using the MNIST test dataset under various initial
conditions of the simulated system. The results demonstrated functional
viability. The implementation of this approach shows that a neural network can
obtain weight values almost instantaneously from the electrostatic field,
without the need for analytical computations, lengthy training procedures, or
massive training datasets.

Abstract: Perception-related tasks often arise in autonomous systems operating under
partial observability. This work studies the problem of synthesizing optimal
policies for complex perception-related objectives in environments modeled by
partially observable Markov decision processes. To formally specify such
objectives, we introduce \emph{co-safe linear inequality temporal logic}
(sc-iLTL), which can define complex tasks that are formed by the logical
concatenation of atomic propositions as linear inequalities on the belief space
of the POMDPs. Our solution to the control synthesis problem is to transform
the \mbox{sc-iLTL} objectives into reachability objectives by constructing the
product of the belief MDP and a deterministic finite automaton built from the
sc-iLTL objective. To overcome the scalability challenge due to the product, we
introduce a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) method that converges in probability
to the optimal policy. Finally, a drone-probing case study demonstrates the
applicability of our method.

Conclusion: SPEAR为SNN在边缘设备上的高效部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: While deep spiking neural networks (SNNs) demonstrate superior performance,
their deployment on resource-constrained neuromorphic hardware still remains
challenging. Network pruning offers a viable solution by reducing both
parameters and synaptic operations (SynOps) to facilitate the edge deployment
of SNNs, among which search-based pruning methods search for the SNNs structure
after pruning. However, existing search-based methods fail to directly use
SynOps as the constraint because it will dynamically change in the searching
process, resulting in the final searched network violating the expected SynOps
target. In this paper, we introduce a novel SNN pruning framework called SPEAR,
which leverages reinforcement learning (RL) technique to directly use SynOps as
the searching constraint. To avoid the violation of SynOps requirements, we
first propose a SynOps prediction mechanism called LRE to accurately predict
the final SynOps after search. Observing SynOps cannot be explicitly calculated
and added to constrain the action in RL, we propose a novel reward called TAR
to stabilize the searching. Extensive experiments show that our SPEAR framework
can effectively compress SNN under specific SynOps constraint.

Abstract: Active learning for classification seeks to reduce the cost of labeling
samples by finding unlabeled examples about which the current model is least
certain and sending them to an annotator/expert to label. Bayesian theory can
provide a probabilistic view of deep neural network models by asserting a prior
distribution over model parameters and estimating the uncertainties by
posterior distribution over these parameters. This paper proposes two novel
active learning approaches to label one million malware examples belonging to
different unknown modern malware families. The first model is Inception-V4+PCA
combined with several support vector machine (SVM) algorithms (UTSVM, PSVM,
SVM-GSU, TBSVM). The second model is Vision Transformer based Bayesian Neural
Networks ViT-BNN. Our proposed ViT-BNN is a state-of-the-art active learning
approach that differs from current methods and can apply to any particular
task. The experiments demonstrate that the ViT-BNN is more stable and robust in
handling uncertainty.

privacy policies by representing policy terms as structured graph models. This
approach makes complex relationships more accessible and enables users to make
informed decisions about their personal data (RQ1). We also employ graph mining
algorithms to identify key themes, such as User Activity and Device
Information, using dimensionality reduction techniques like t-SNE and PCA to
assess clustering effectiveness. Our findings reveal that graph-based
clustering improves policy content interpretability. It highlights patterns in
user tracking and data sharing, which supports forensic investigations and

Abstract: Modeling the decision-making behavior of vehicles presents unique challenges,
particularly during unprotected left turns at intersections, where the
uncertainty of human drivers is especially pronounced. In this context,
connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) technology emerges as a promising avenue for
effectively managing such interactions while ensuring safety and efficiency.
Traditional approaches, often grounded in game theory assumptions of perfect
rationality, may inadequately capture the complexities of real-world scenarios
and drivers' decision-making errors. To fill this gap, we propose a novel
decision-making model for vehicle unprotected left-turn scenarios, integrating
game theory with considerations for drivers' bounded rationality. Our model,
formulated as a two-player normal-form game solved by a quantal response
equilibrium (QRE), offers a more nuanced depiction of driver decision-making
processes compared to Nash equilibrium (NE) models. Leveraging an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm coupled with a subtle neural network
trained on precise microscopic vehicle trajectory data, we optimize model
parameters to accurately reflect drivers' interaction-aware bounded rationality
and driving styles. Through comprehensive simulation experiments, we
demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed model in capturing the
interaction-aware bounded rationality and decision tendencies between players.
The proposed model proves to be more realistic and efficient than NE models in
unprotected left-turn scenarios. Our findings contribute valuable insights into
the vehicle decision-making behaviors with bounded rationality, thereby
informing the development of more robust and realistic autonomous driving
systems.

Conclusion: 英国若成功监管AI，可为民主社会提供范例，平衡AI的利益与风险。

Abstract: The UK has pursued a distinctive path in AI regulation: less cautious than
the EU but more willing to address risks than the US, and has emerged as a
global leader in coordinating AI safety efforts. Impressive developments from
companies like London-based DeepMind began to spark concerns in the UK about
catastrophic risks from around 2012, although regulatory discussion at the time
focussed on bias and discrimination. By 2022, these discussions had evolved
into a "pro-innovation" strategy, in which the government directed existing
regulators to take a light-touch approach, governing AI at point of use, but
avoided regulating the technology or infrastructure directly. ChatGPT arrived
in late 2022, galvanising concerns that this approach may be insufficient. The
UK responded by establishing an AI Safety Institute to monitor risks and
hosting the first international AI Safety Summit in 2023, but - unlike the EU -
refrained from regulating frontier AI development in addition to its use. A new
government was elected in 2024 which promised to address this gap, but at the
time of writing is yet to do so.
  What should the UK do next? The government faces competing objectives:
harnessing AI for economic growth and better public services while mitigating
risk. In light of these, we propose establishing a flexible, principles-based
regulator to oversee the most advanced AI development, defensive measures
against risks from AI-enabled biological design tools, and argue that more
technical work is needed to understand how to respond to AI-generated
misinformation. We argue for updated legal frameworks on copyright,

Motivation: 探索如何通过界面设计鼓励用户写更长的提示，以增强其对生成内容的心理所有权。

Method: 采用两种界面修改技术（长按按钮和滑动条）进行实验，并测试其对提示长度和心理所有权的影响。

Result: 界面修改技术显著增加提示长度和心理所有权，但AI生成建议仅增加长度，未提升心理所有权。

Conclusion: 简单的界面修改可有效增加用户输入和提升心理所有权，但AI建议的效果有限。

Abstract: Writing longer prompts for an AI assistant to generate a short story
increases psychological ownership, a user's feeling that the writing belongs to
them. To encourage users to write longer prompts, we evaluated two interaction
techniques that modify the prompt entry interface of chat-based generative AI
assistants: pressing and holding the prompt submission button, and continuously
moving a slider up and down when submitting a short prompt. A within-subjects
experiment investigated the effects of such techniques on prompt length and
psychological ownership, and results showed that these techniques increased
prompt length and led to higher psychological ownership than baseline
techniques. A second experiment further augmented these techniques by showing
AI-generated suggestions for how the prompts could be expanded. This further
increased prompt length, but did not lead to improvements in psychological
ownership. Our results show that simple interface modifications like these can
elicit more writing from users and improve psychological ownership.

Abstract: This article explores the feasibility of creating an "electronic copy" of a
deceased researcher by training artificial intelligence (AI) on the data stored
in their personal computers. By analyzing typical data volumes on inherited
researcher computers, including textual files such as articles, emails, and
drafts, it is estimated that approximately one million words are available for
AI training. This volume is sufficient for fine-tuning advanced pre-trained
models like GPT-4 to replicate a researcher's writing style, domain expertise,
and rhetorical voice with high fidelity. The study also discusses the potential
enhancements from including non-textual data and file metadata to enrich the
AI's representation of the researcher. Extensions of the concept include
communication between living researchers and their electronic copies,
collaboration among individual electronic copies, as well as the creation and
interconnection of organizational electronic copies to optimize information
access and strategic decision-making. Ethical considerations such as ownership
and security of these electronic copies are highlighted as critical for
responsible implementation. The findings suggest promising opportunities for
AI-driven preservation and augmentation of intellectual legacy.

Motivation: 现有音频质量评估模型仅预测单一评分且局限于语音领域，无法泛化到其他音频类型。MMMOS旨在解决这一问题，提供更全面的评估。

Method: MMMOS结合了三种预训练编码器的帧级嵌入，评估了三种聚合策略和四种损失函数，并通过集成模型优化性能。

Result: MMMOS在多个指标上优于基线模型，包括均方误差降低20-30%，Kendall's τ提升4-5%，并在多项挑战指标中排名靠前。

Conclusion: MMMOS为多领域音频质量评估提供了更准确和全面的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate audio quality estimation is essential for developing and evaluating
audio generation, retrieval, and enhancement systems. Existing non-intrusive
assessment models predict a single Mean Opinion Score (MOS) for speech, merging
diverse perceptual factors and failing to generalize beyond speech. We propose
MMMOS, a no-reference, multi-domain audio quality assessment system that
estimates four orthogonal axes: Production Quality, Production Complexity,
Content Enjoyment, and Content Usefulness across speech, music, and
environmental sounds. MMMOS fuses frame-level embeddings from three pretrained
encoders (WavLM, MuQ, and M2D) and evaluates three aggregation strategies with
four loss functions. By ensembling the top eight models, MMMOS shows a 20-30%
reduction in mean squared error and a 4-5% increase in Kendall's {\tau} versus
baseline, gains first place in six of eight Production Complexity metrics, and
ranks among the top three on 17 of 32 challenge metrics.

Conclusion: CollabIoT在瞬态IoT环境中实现了高效、安全的设备协作。

Abstract: Today's Internet of Things (IoT) has evolved from simple sensing and
actuation devices to those with embedded processing and intelligent services,
enabling rich collaborations between users and their devices. However, enabling
such collaboration becomes challenging when transient devices need to interact
with host devices in temporarily visited environments. In such cases,
fine-grained access control policies are necessary to ensure secure
interactions; however, manually implementing them is often impractical for
non-expert users. Moreover, at run-time, the system must automatically
configure the devices and enforce such fine-grained access control rules.
Additionally, the system must address the heterogeneity of devices.
  In this paper, we present CollabIoT, a system that enables secure and
seamless device collaboration in transient IoT environments. CollabIoT employs
a Large language Model (LLM)-driven approach to convert users' high-level
intents to fine-grained access control policies. To support secure and seamless
device collaboration, CollabIoT adopts capability-based access control for
authorization and uses lightweight proxies for policy enforcement, providing
hardware-independent abstractions.
  We implement a prototype of CollabIoT's policy generation and auto
configuration pipelines and evaluate its efficacy on an IoT testbed and in
large-scale emulated environments. We show that our LLM-based policy generation
pipeline is able to generate functional and correct policies with 100%
accuracy. At runtime, our evaluation shows that our system configures new
devices in ~150 ms, and our proxy-based data plane incurs network overheads of
up to 2 ms and access control overheads up to 0.3 ms.

Conclusion: 神经调节驱动的增益脉冲可能作为一种自适应优化机制，动态调节突触权重更新，为学习系统提供灵活性。

Abstract: Biological and artificial learning systems alike confront the
plasticity-stability dilemma. In the brain, neuromodulators such as
acetylcholine and noradrenaline relieve this tension by tuning neuronal gain
and inhibitory gating, balancing segregation and integration of circuits. Fed
by dense cholinergic and noradrenergic projections from the ascending arousal
system, layer-5 pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex offer a relevant
substrate for understanding these dynamics. When distal dendritic signals
coincide with back-propagating action potentials, calcium plateaus turn a
single somatic spike into a high-gain burst, and interneuron inhibition sculpts
the output. These properties make layer-5 cells gain-tunable amplifiers that
translate neuromodulatory cues into flexible cortical activity. To capture this
mechanism we developed a two-compartment Izhikevich model for pyramidal neurons
and single-compartment somatostatin (SOM) and parvalbumin (PV) interneurons,
linked by Gaussian connectivity and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP).
The soma and apical dendrite are so coupled that somatic spikes back-propagate,
while dendritic plateaus can switch the soma from regular firing to bursting by
shifting reset and adaptation variables. We show that stronger dendritic drive
or tighter coupling raise gain by increasing the likelihood of
calcium-triggered somatic bursts. In contrast, dendritic-targeted inhibition
suppresses gain, while somatic-targeted inhibition raises the firing threshold
of neighboring neurons, thus gating neurons output. Notably, bursting
accelerates STDP, supporting rapid synaptic reconfiguration and
flexibility.This suggests that brief gain pulses driven by neuromodulators
could serve as an adaptive two-timescale optimization mechanism, effectively
modulating the synaptic weight updates.

Abstract: Human creative ideation involves both exploration of diverse ideas
(divergence) and selective synthesis of explored ideas into coherent
combinations (convergence). While processes of divergence and convergence are
often interleaved and nested, existing AI-powered creativity support tools
(CSTs) lack support for sophisticated orchestration of divergence and
convergence. We present Reverger, an AI-powered CST that helps users ideate
variations of conceptual directions for modifying a story by scaffolding
flexible iteration between divergence and convergence. For divergence, our tool
enables recursive exploration of alternative high-level directions for
modifying a specific part of the original story. For convergence, it allows
users to collect explored high-level directions and synthesize them into
concrete variations. Users can then iterate between divergence and convergence
until they find a satisfactory outcome. A within-subject study revealed that
Reverger permitted participants to explore more unexpected and diverse
high-level directions than a comparable baseline. Reverger users also felt that
they had more fine-grained control and discovered more effort-worthy outcomes.

Abstract: Since 2023, generative AI has rapidly advanced in the music domain. Despite
significant technological advancements, music-generative models raise critical
ethical challenges, including a lack of transparency and accountability, along
with risks such as the replication of artists' works, which highlights the
importance of fostering openness. With upcoming regulations such as the EU AI
Act encouraging open models, many generative models are being released labelled
as 'open'. However, the definition of an open model remains widely debated. In
this article, we adapt a recently proposed evidence-based framework for
assessing openness in LLMs to the music domain. Using feedback from a survey of
110 participants from the Music Information Retrieval (MIR) community, we
refine the framework into MusGO (Music-Generative Open AI), which comprises 13
openness categories: 8 essential and 5 desirable. We evaluate 16
state-of-the-art generative models and provide an openness leaderboard that is
fully open to public scrutiny and community contributions. Through this work,
we aim to clarify the concept of openness in music-generative AI and promote
its transparent and responsible development.

Conclusion: TayFCS是一种高效且实用的特征组合选择方法，适用于推荐系统。

Abstract: Feature interaction modeling is crucial for deep recommendation models. A
common and effective approach is to construct explicit feature combinations to
enhance model performance. However, in practice, only a small fraction of these
combinations are truly informative. Thus it is essential to select useful
feature combinations to reduce noise and manage memory consumption. While
feature selection methods have been extensively studied, they are typically
limited to selecting individual features. Extending these methods for
high-order feature combination selection presents a significant challenge due
to the exponential growth in time complexity when evaluating feature
combinations one by one. In this paper, we propose $\textbf{TayFCS}$, a
lightweight feature combination selection method that significantly improves
model performance. Specifically, we propose the Taylor Expansion Scorer
(TayScorer) module for field-wise Taylor expansion on the base model. Instead
of evaluating all potential feature combinations' importance by repeatedly
running experiments with feature adding and removal, this scorer only needs to
approximate the importance based on their sub-components' gradients. This can
be simply computed with one backward pass based on a trained recommendation
model. To further reduce information redundancy among feature combinations and
their sub-components, we introduce Logistic Regression Elimination (LRE), which
estimates the corresponding information gain based on the model prediction
performance. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets validate both the
effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. Furthermore, online A/B test
results demonstrate its practical applicability and commercial value.

Abstract: Devices operating in Internet of Things (IoT) networks may be deployed across
vast geographical areas and interconnected via multi-hop communications.
Further, they may be unguarded. This makes them vulnerable to attacks and
motivates operators to check on devices frequently. To this end, we propose and
study an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-aided attestation framework for use in
IoT networks with a charging station powered by solar. A key challenge is
optimizing the trajectory of the UAV to ensure it attests as many devices as
possible. A trade-off here is that devices being checked by the UAV are
offline, which affects the amount of data delivered to a gateway. Another
challenge is that the charging station experiences time-varying energy
arrivals, which in turn affect the flight duration and charging schedule of the
UAV. To address these challenges, we employ a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
solution to optimize the UAV's charging schedule and the selection of devices
to be attested during each flight. The simulation results show that our
solution reduces the average age of trust by 88% and throughput loss due to
attestation by 30%.

Abstract: Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) aims to address the persistent cold-start
problem in Recommender Systems. Current CDR research concentrates on
transferring cold-start users' information from the auxiliary domain to the
target domain. However, these systems face two main issues: the
underutilization of multimodal data, which hinders effective cross-domain
alignment, and the neglect of side users who interact solely within the target
domain, leading to inadequate learning of the target domain's vector space
distribution. To address these issues, we propose a model leveraging Multimodal
data and Side users for diffusion Cross-domain recommendation (MuSiC). We first
employ a multimodal large language model to extract item multimodal features
and leverage a large language model to uncover user features using prompt
learning without fine-tuning. Secondly, we propose the cross-domain diffusion
module to learn the generation of feature vectors in the target domain. This
approach involves learning feature distribution from side users and
understanding the patterns in cross-domain transformation through overlapping
users. Subsequently, the trained diffusion module is used to generate feature
vectors for cold-start users in the target domain, enabling the completion of
cross-domain recommendation tasks. Finally, our experimental evaluation of the
Amazon dataset confirms that MuSiC achieves state-of-the-art performance,
significantly outperforming all selected baselines. Our code is available:

Family-Specific String (FSS) features could be utilized in a manner similar to
RAG to facilitate MFC. To this end, we develop a curated evaluation framework

Abstract: Theoretical works on supervised transfer learning (STL) -- where the learner
has access to labeled samples from both source and target distributions -- have
for the most part focused on statistical aspects of the problem, while
efficient optimization has received less attention. We consider the problem of
designing an SGD procedure for STL that alternates sampling between source and
target data, while maintaining statistical transfer guarantees without prior
knowledge of the quality of the source data. A main algorithmic difficulty is
in understanding how to design such an adaptive sub-sampling mechanism at each
SGD step, to automatically gain from the source when it is informative, or bias
towards the target and avoid negative transfer when the source is less
informative.
  We show that, such a mixed-sample SGD procedure is feasible for general
prediction tasks with convex losses, rooted in tracking an abstract sequence of
constrained convex programs that serve to maintain the desired transfer
guarantees.
  We instantiate these results in the concrete setting of linear regression
with square loss, and show that the procedure converges, with $1/\sqrt{T}$
rate, to a solution whose statistical performance on the target is adaptive to
the a priori unknown quality of the source. Experiments with synthetic and real
datasets support the theory.

Abstract: Understanding surgical scenes can provide better healthcare quality for

texture variations, and dynamic lighting, presenting significant challenges.
CLIP model serves as a powerful feature extractor, capturing rich semantic

Abstract: Choosing the right fabric is crucial to meet functional and quality
requirements in robotic applications for textile manufacturing, apparel
production, and smart retail. We present MLLM-Fabric, a robotic framework
powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for fabric sorting and
selection. The system includes a robotic arm, a camera, a visuotactile sensor,
and a pressure sensor. It employs supervised fine-tuning and multimodal
explanation-guided knowledge distillation to accurately classify and rank
fabric properties. To facilitate further research, we release a dataset of 220
unique fabric samples, including RGB images and synchronized visuotactile and
pressure data. Experimental results show that our Fabric-Llama-90B model
consistently outperforms pretrained vision-language baselines in both property
ranking accuracy and selection reliability.

Abstract: Research, innovation and practical capital investment have been increasing
rapidly toward the realization of autonomous physical agents. This includes
industrial and service robots, unmanned aerial vehicles, embedded control
devices, and a number of other realizations of cybernetic/mechatronic
implementations of intelligent autonomous devices. In this paper, we consider a
stylized version of robotic care, which would normally involve a two-level
Reinforcement Learning procedure that trains a policy for both lower level
physical movement decisions as well as higher level conceptual tasks and their
sub-components. In order to deliver greater safety and reliability in the
system, we present the general formulation of this as a two-level optimization
scheme which incorporates control at the lower level, and classical planning at
the higher level, integrated with a capacity for learning. This synergistic
integration of multiple methodologies -- control, classical planning, and RL --
presents an opportunity for greater insight for algorithm development, leading
to more efficient and reliable performance. Here, the notion of reliability
pertains to physical safety and interpretability into an otherwise black box
operation of autonomous agents, concerning users and regulators. This work
presents the necessary background and general formulation of the optimization
framework, detailing each component and its integration with the others.

Abstract: We propose Expotion (Facial Expression and Motion Control for Multimodal
Music Generation), a generative model leveraging multimodal visual controls -
specifically, human facial expressions and upper-body motion - as well as text
prompts to produce expressive and temporally accurate music. We adopt
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) on the pretrained text-to-music
generation model, enabling fine-grained adaptation to the multimodal controls
using a small dataset. To ensure precise synchronization between video and
music, we introduce a temporal smoothing strategy to align multiple modalities.
Experiments demonstrate that integrating visual features alongside textual
descriptions enhances the overall quality of generated music in terms of
musicality, creativity, beat-tempo consistency, temporal alignment with the
video, and text adherence, surpassing both proposed baselines and existing
state-of-the-art video-to-music generation models. Additionally, we introduce a
novel dataset consisting of 7 hours of synchronized video recordings capturing
expressive facial and upper-body gestures aligned with corresponding music,
providing significant potential for future research in multimodal and
interactive music generation.

Motivation: 共形预测（CP）作为一种不确定性表示技术，其作为UQ工具的理论基础尚不清晰。本文旨在通过范畴论方法揭示CP的UQ本质及其与其他统计推理方法的关系。

Method: 采用范畴论框架，将CP定义为新定义的两个范畴之间的态射，并分析其结构特性。

Result: 1. CP本质上是UQ机制；2. CP连接并可能统一贝叶斯、频率论和不精确概率方法；3. CP区域是协变函子的像，对隐私噪声的局部添加不影响覆盖性。

Conclusion: CP不仅是UQ工具，还具有统一统计推理方法的潜力，并在AI隐私保护中具有应用价值。

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is an Uncertainty Representation technique that
delivers finite-sample calibrated prediction regions for any underlying Machine
Learning model, yet its status as an Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) tool has
remained conceptually opaque. We adopt a category-theoretic approach to CP --
framing it as a morphism, embedded in a commuting diagram, of two newly-defined
categories -- that brings us three joys. First, we show that -- under minimal
assumptions -- CP is intrinsically a UQ mechanism, that is, its UQ capabilities
are a structural feature of the method. Second, we demonstrate that CP bridges
(and perhaps subsumes) the Bayesian, frequentist, and imprecise probabilistic
approaches to predictive statistical reasoning. Finally, we show that a
conformal prediction region (CPR) is the image of a covariant functor. This
observation is relevant to AI privacy: It implies that privacy noise added
locally does not break coverage.

Method: 结合轻量级层次化注意力多实例学习（MIL）模型和深度强化学习，智能采样并选择性放大高分辨率区域。

Result: SASHA在计算和内存成本显著降低的情况下，性能与全高分辨率分析的最先进方法相当，并优于稀疏采样方法。

Conclusion: SASHA可作为医学影像自动化诊断中智能采样的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are increasingly applied for automated histopathology.
Yet, whole-slide images (WSIs) are often acquired at gigapixel sizes, rendering
it computationally infeasible to analyze them entirely at high resolution.
Diagnostic labels are largely available only at the slide-level, because expert
annotation of images at a finer (patch) level is both laborious and expensive.
Moreover, regions with diagnostic information typically occupy only a small
fraction of the WSI, making it inefficient to examine the entire slide at full
resolution. Here, we propose SASHA -- {\it S}equential {\it A}ttention-based
{\it S}ampling for {\it H}istopathological {\it A}nalysis -- a deep
reinforcement learning approach for efficient analysis of histopathological
images. First, SASHA learns informative features with a lightweight
hierarchical, attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) model. Second,
SASHA samples intelligently and zooms selectively into a small fraction
(10-20\%) of high-resolution patches, to achieve reliable diagnosis. We show
that SASHA matches state-of-the-art methods that analyze the WSI fully at
high-resolution, albeit at a fraction of their computational and memory costs.
In addition, it significantly outperforms competing, sparse sampling methods.
We propose SASHA as an intelligent sampling model for medical imaging
challenges that involve automated diagnosis with exceptionally large images

Conclusion: EmbodieDreamer有效缩小了仿真与真实世界的差距，提升了机器人策略的性能。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Embodied AI has led to an increasing demand for
large-scale, high-quality real-world data. However, collecting such embodied
data remains costly and inefficient. As a result, simulation environments have
become a crucial surrogate for training robot policies. Yet, the significant
Real2Sim2Real gap remains a critical bottleneck, particularly in terms of
physical dynamics and visual appearance. To address this challenge, we propose
EmbodieDreamer, a novel framework that reduces the Real2Sim2Real gap from both
the physics and appearance perspectives. Specifically, we propose PhysAligner,
a differentiable physics module designed to reduce the Real2Sim physical gap.
It jointly optimizes robot-specific parameters such as control gains and
friction coefficients to better align simulated dynamics with real-world
observations. In addition, we introduce VisAligner, which incorporates a
conditional video diffusion model to bridge the Sim2Real appearance gap by
translating low-fidelity simulated renderings into photorealistic videos
conditioned on simulation states, enabling high-fidelity visual transfer.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of EmbodieDreamer. The
proposed PhysAligner reduces physical parameter estimation error by 3.74%
compared to simulated annealing methods while improving optimization speed by
89.91\%. Moreover, training robot policies in the generated photorealistic
environment leads to a 29.17% improvement in the average task success rate
across real-world tasks after reinforcement learning. Code, model and data will

Conclusion: HIPHOP通过语义和意图引导的优化，有效提升推荐质量。

Abstract: Session-based Recommendation (SBR) aims to predict the next item a user will
likely engage with, using their interaction sequence within an anonymous
session. Existing SBR models often focus only on single-session information,
ignoring inter-session relationships and valuable cross-session insights. Some
methods try to include inter-session data but struggle with noise and
irrelevant information, reducing performance. Additionally, most models rely on
item ID co-occurrence and overlook rich semantic details, limiting their
ability to capture fine-grained item features. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel hierarchical intent-guided optimization approach with pluggable
LLM-driven semantic learning for session-based recommendations, called HIPHOP.
First, we introduce a pluggable embedding module based on large language models
(LLMs) to generate high-quality semantic representations, enhancing item
embeddings. Second, HIPHOP utilizes graph neural networks (GNNs) to model item
transition relationships and incorporates a dynamic multi-intent capturing
module to address users' diverse interests within a session. Additionally, we
design a hierarchical inter-session similarity learning module, guided by user
intent, to capture global and local session relationships, effectively
exploring users' long-term and short-term interests. To mitigate noise, an
intent-guided denoising strategy is applied during inter-session learning.
Finally, we enhance the model's discriminative capability by using contrastive
learning to optimize session representations. Experiments on multiple datasets
show that HIPHOP significantly outperforms existing methods, demonstrating its
effectiveness in improving recommendation quality. Our code is available:

Conclusion: 该方法通过显式条件控制实现了灵活的语音转换，同时保持了高质量的语音输出。

Abstract: Precise control over speech characteristics, such as pitch, duration, and
speech rate, remains a significant challenge in the field of voice conversion.
The ability to manipulate parameters like pitch and syllable rate is an
important element for effective identity conversion, but can also be used
independently for voice transformation, achieving goals that were historically
addressed by vocoder-based methods.
  In this work, we explore a convolutional neural network-based approach that
aims to provide means for modifying fundamental frequency (F0), phoneme
sequences, intensity, and speaker identity. Rather than relying on
disentanglement techniques, our model is explicitly conditioned on these
factors to generate mel spectrograms, which are then converted into waveforms
using a universal neural vocoder. Accordingly, during inference, F0 contours,
phoneme sequences, and speaker embeddings can be freely adjusted, allowing for
intuitively controlled voice transformations.
  We evaluate our approach on speaker conversion and expressive speech tasks
using both perceptual and objective metrics. The results suggest that the
proposed method offers substantial flexibility, while maintaining high
intelligibility and speaker similarity.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) systems are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where
adversaries train their local models on poisoned data and submit poisoned model
updates to compromise the global model. Despite numerous proposed attacks and
defenses, divergent experimental settings, implementation errors, and
unrealistic assumptions hinder fair comparisons and valid conclusions about
their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. To address this, we introduce
BackFed - a comprehensive benchmark suite designed to standardize, streamline,
and reliably evaluate backdoor attacks and defenses in FL, with a focus on
practical constraints. Our benchmark offers key advantages through its
multi-processing implementation that significantly accelerates experimentation
and the modular design that enables seamless integration of new methods via
well-defined APIs. With a standardized evaluation pipeline, we envision BackFed
as a plug-and-play environment for researchers to comprehensively and reliably
evaluate new attacks and defenses. Using BackFed, we conduct large-scale
studies of representative backdoor attacks and defenses across both Computer
Vision and Natural Language Processing tasks with diverse model architectures
and experimental settings. Our experiments critically assess the performance of
proposed attacks and defenses, revealing unknown limitations and modes of
failures under practical conditions. These empirical insights provide valuable
guidance for the development of new methods and for enhancing the security of
FL systems. Our framework is openly available at

Abstract: Recently, research into chatbots (also known as conversational agents, AI
agents, voice assistants), which are computer applications using artificial
intelligence to mimic human-like conversation, has grown sharply. Despite this
growth, sociology lags other disciplines (including computer science, medicine,
psychology, and communication) in publishing about chatbots. We suggest
sociology can advance understanding of human-chatbot interaction and offer four
sociological theories to enhance extant work in this field. The first two
theories (resource substitution theory, power-dependence theory) add new
insights to existing models of the drivers of chatbot use, which overlook
sociological concerns about how social structure (e.g., systemic
discrimination, the uneven distribution of resources within networks) inclines
individuals to use chatbots, including problematic levels of emotional
dependency on chatbots. The second two theories (affect control theory,
fundamental cause of disease theory) help inform the development of
chatbot-driven interventions that minimize safety risks and enhance equity by
leveraging sociological insights into how chatbot outputs could attend to
cultural contexts (e.g., affective norms) to promote wellbeing and enhance
communities (e.g., opportunities for civic participation). We discuss the value
of applying sociological theories for advancing theorizing about human-chatbot
interaction and developing chatbots for social good.

Abstract: The proliferation of AI-driven systems presents a fundamental challenge to
Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Computer-Supported Cooperative Work
(CSCW), often diminishing user agency and failing to account for value
pluralism. Current approaches to value alignment, which rely on centralized,
top-down definitions, lack the mechanisms for meaningful contestability. This
leaves users and communities unable to challenge or shape the values embedded
in the systems that govern their digital lives, creating a crisis of legitimacy
and trust. This paper introduces Community-Defined AI Value Pluralism (CDAVP),
a socio-technical framework that addresses this gap. It reframes the design
problem from achieving a single aligned state to infrastructuring a dynamic
ecosystem for value deliberation and application. At its core, CDAVP enables
diverse, self-organizing communities to define and maintain explicit value
profiles - rich, machine-readable representations that can encompass not only
preferences but also community-specific rights and duties. These profiles are
then contextually activated by the end-user, who retains ultimate control
(agency) over which values guide the AI's behavior. AI applications, in turn,
are designed to transparently interpret these profiles and moderate conflicts,
adhering to a set of non-negotiable, democratically-legitimated meta-rules. The
designer's role shifts from crafting static interfaces to becoming an architect
of participatory ecosystems. We argue that infrastructuring for pluralism is a
necessary pathway toward achieving robust algorithmic accountability and
genuinely contestable, human-centric AI.

Abstract: Cooking plays a vital role in everyday independence and well-being, yet

object status extraction, visual alignment with cooking steps, and time-causal
modeling to support real-time step tracking. We evaluate OSCAR on 173
instructional videos and a real-world dataset of 12 non-visual cooking sessions
recorded by BLV individuals in their homes. Our results show that object status
consistently improves step prediction accuracy across vision-language models,
and reveal key factors that impact performance in real-world conditions, such

Abstract: Slide animations, such as fade-ins, fly-ins, and wipes, are critical for

collectively covering every built-in PowerPoint effect. Using this resource, we
fine-tune Qwen-2.5-VL-7B with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and achieve consistent

Coverage-Order-Detail Assessment (CODA) metric, which evaluates action
coverage, temporal order, and detail fidelity. On a manually curated test set

Conclusion: 语言能深入揭示自发认知状态的表达方式，支持并更新现有理论。

Abstract: The onset of spontaneous thoughts are reflective of dynamic interactions
between cognition, emotion, and attention. Typically, these experiences are
studied through subjective appraisals that focus on their triggers,
phenomenology, and emotional salience. In this work, we use linguistic
signatures to investigate Deja Vu, Involuntary Autobiographical Memories and
Unexpected Thoughts. Specifically, we analyze the inherent characteristics of
the linguistic patterns in participant generated descriptions of these thought
types. We show how, by positioning language as a window into spontaneous
cognition, existing theories on these attentional states can be updated and
reaffirmed. Our findings align with prior research, reinforcing that Deja Vu is
a metacognitive experience characterized by abstract and spatial language,
Involuntary Autobiographical Memories are rich in personal and emotionally
significant detail, and Unexpected Thoughts are marked by unpredictability and
cognitive disruption. This work is demonstrative of languages potential to
reveal deeper insights into how internal spontaneous cognitive states manifest
through expression.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的端到端解耦多尺度时间序列分类框架（DisMS-TS），通过消除多尺度时间序列中的冗余共享特征，提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的时间序列通常具有复杂的时序变化，现有方法在多尺度分析中未能有效消除冗余共享特征，导致模型性能受限。

Method: 提出时间解耦模块分别捕捉共享和特定尺度的时序表示，并引入两个正则化项确保共享表示的一致性和特定表示的差异性。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，DisMS-TS优于基线方法，准确率提升高达9.71%。

Conclusion: DisMS-TS通过解耦多尺度特征，显著提升了时间序列分类的性能。

Abstract: Real-world time series typically exhibit complex temporal variations, making
the time series classification task notably challenging. Recent advancements
have demonstrated the potential of multi-scale analysis approaches, which
provide an effective solution for capturing these complex temporal patterns.
However, existing multi-scale analysis-based time series prediction methods
fail to eliminate redundant scale-shared features across multi-scale time
series, resulting in the model over- or under-focusing on scale-shared
features. To address this issue, we propose a novel end-to-end Disentangled
Multi-Scale framework for Time Series classification (DisMS-TS). The core idea
of DisMS-TS is to eliminate redundant shared features in multi-scale time
series, thereby improving prediction performance. Specifically, we propose a
temporal disentanglement module to capture scale-shared and scale-specific
temporal representations, respectively. Subsequently, to effectively learn both
scale-shared and scale-specific temporal representations, we introduce two
regularization terms that ensure the consistency of scale-shared
representations and the disparity of scale-specific representations across all
temporal scales. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets validate
the superiority of DisMS-TS over its competitive baselines, with the accuracy
improvement up to 9.71%.

how multi-agent systems can assist in automating the decoration process. We
propose FurniMAS, a multi-agent system for automatic furniture decoration.
Specifically, given a human prompt and a household furniture item such as a
working desk or a TV stand, our system suggests relevant assets with
appropriate styles and materials, and arranges them on the item, ensuring the
decorative result meets functionality, aesthetic, and ambiance preferences.
FurniMAS assembles a hybrid team of LLM-based and non-LLM agents, each
fulfilling distinct roles in a typical decoration project. These agents
collaborate through communication, logical reasoning, and validation to
transform the requirements into the final outcome. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our FurniMAS significantly outperforms other baselines in
generating high-quality 3D decor.

Abstract: The philosophy of mathematical practice (PMP) looks to evidence from working
mathematics to help settle philosophical questions. One prominent program under
the PMP banner is the study of explanation in mathematics, which aims to
understand what sorts of proofs mathematicians consider explanatory and what
role the pursuit of explanation plays in mathematical practice. In an effort to
address worries about cherry-picked examples and file-drawer problems in PMP, a
handful of authors have recently turned to corpus analysis methods as a
promising alternative to small-scale case studies. This paper reports the
results from such a corpus study facilitated by Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro, a
model whose reasoning capabilities, advances in hallucination control and large
context window allow for the accurate analysis of hundreds of pages of text per
query. Based on a sample of 5000 mathematics papers from arXiv.org, the
experiments yielded a dataset of hundreds of useful annotated examples. Its aim
was to gain insight on questions like the following: How often do
mathematicians make claims about explanation in the relevant sense? Do
mathematicians' explanatory practices vary in any noticeable way by subject
matter? Which philosophical theories of explanation are most consistent with a
large body of non-cherry-picked examples? How might philosophers make further
use of AI tools to gain insights from large datasets of this kind? As the first
PMP study making extensive use of LLM methods, it also seeks to begin a
conversation about these methods as research tools in practice-oriented
philosophy and to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of current models for
such work.

Abstract: This paper investigates whether Bittensor can be considered the Bitcoin of
decentralized Artificial Intelligence by directly comparing its tokenomics,
decentralization properties, consensus mechanism, and incentive structure
against those of Bitcoin. Leveraging on-chain data from all 64 active Bittensor
subnets, we first document considerable concentration in both stake and
rewards. We further show that rewards are overwhelmingly driven by stake,
highlighting a clear misalignment between quality and compensation. As a
remedy, we put forward a series of two-pronged protocol-level interventions.
For incentive realignment, our proposed solutions include performance-weighted
emission split, composite scoring, and a trust-bonus multiplier. As for
mitigating security vulnerability due to stake concentration, we propose and
empirically validate stake cap at the 88th percentile, which elevates the
median coalition size required for a 51-percent attack and remains robust
across daily, weekly, and monthly snapshots.

Result: HDRP-SNN显著减少冗余脉冲，在静态和神经形态数据集上达到SOTA准确率，噪声抵抗力优于ANN和传统SNN。

Conclusion: HDRP机制对提升低延迟SNN性能至关重要。

Abstract: The refractory period controls neuron spike firing rate, crucial for network
stability and noise resistance. With advancements in spiking neural network
(SNN) training methods, low-latency SNN applications have expanded. In
low-latency SNNs, shorter simulation steps render traditional refractory
mechanisms, which rely on empirical distributions or spike firing rates, less
effective. However, omitting the refractory period amplifies the risk of neuron
over-activation and reduces the system's robustness to noise. To address this
challenge, we propose a historical dynamic refractory period (HDRP) model that
leverages membrane potential derivative with historical refractory periods to
estimate an initial refractory period and dynamically adjust its duration.
Additionally, we propose a threshold-dependent refractory kernel to mitigate
excessive neuron state accumulation. Our approach retains the binary
characteristics of SNNs while enhancing both noise resistance and overall
performance. Experimental results show that HDRP-SNN significantly reduces
redundant spikes compared to traditional SNNs, and achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) accuracy both on static datasets and neuromorphic datasets. Moreover,
HDRP-SNN outperforms artificial neural networks (ANNs) and traditional SNNs in
noise resistance, highlighting the crucial role of the HDRP mechanism in
enhancing the performance of low-latency SNNs.

Abstract: Modern transportation network modeling increasingly involves the integration
of diverse methodologies including sensor-based forecasting, reinforcement
learning, classical flow optimization, and demand modeling that have
traditionally been developed in isolation. This paper introduces Flow Through
Tensors (FTT), a unified computational graph architecture that connects origin
destination flows, path probabilities, and link travel times as interconnected
tensors. Our framework makes three key contributions: first, it establishes a
consistent mathematical structure that enables gradient-based optimization
across previously separate modeling elements; second, it supports
multidimensional analysis of traffic patterns over time, space, and user groups
with precise quantification of system efficiency; third, it implements tensor
decomposition techniques that maintain computational tractability for large
scale applications. These innovations collectively enable real time control
strategies, efficient coordination between multiple transportation modes and
operators, and rigorous enforcement of physical network constraints. The FTT
framework bridges the gap between theoretical transportation models and
practical deployment needs, providing a foundation for next generation
integrated mobility systems.

Abstract: Parkinson's Disease (PD) affects over 10 million people globally, with speech
impairments often preceding motor symptoms by years, making speech a valuable
modality for early, non-invasive detection. While recent deep-learning models
achieve high accuracy, they typically lack the explainability required for
clinical use. To address this, we propose RECA-PD, a novel, robust, and
explainable cross-attention architecture that combines interpretable speech
features with self-supervised representations. RECA-PD matches state-of-the-art
performance in Speech-based PD detection while providing explanations that are
more consistent and more clinically meaningful. Additionally, we demonstrate
that performance degradation in certain speech tasks (e.g., monologue) can be
mitigated by segmenting long recordings. Our findings indicate that performance
and explainability are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Future work will
enhance the usability of explanations for non-experts and explore severity
estimation to increase the real-world clinical relevance.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL)-based general circulation models (GCMs) are emerging as
fast simulators, yet their ability to replicate extreme events outside their

Neural General Circulation Model (NGCM) and purely data-driven Deep Learning
Earth System Model (DL\textit{ESy}M) -- against a conventional high-resolution
land-atmosphere model (HiRAM) in simulating land heatwaves and coldwaves. All
models are forced with observed sea surface temperatures and sea ice over
1900-2020, focusing on the out-of-sample early-20th-century period (1900-1960).
Both DL models generalize successfully to unseen climate conditions, broadly
reproducing the frequency and spatial patterns of heatwave and cold wave events
during 1900-1960 with skill comparable to HiRAM. An exception is over portions
of North Asia and North America, where all models perform poorly during
1940-1960. Due to excessive temperature autocorrelation, DL\textit{ESy}M tends
to overestimate heatwave and cold wave frequencies, whereas the physics-DL
hybrid NGCM exhibits persistence more similar to HiRAM.

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) traditionally relies on auditory data
analysis for emotion classification. Several studies have adopted different
methods for SER. However, existing SER methods often struggle to capture subtle
emotional variations and generalize across diverse datasets. In this article,
we use Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) as spectral features to
bridge the gap between computational emotion processing and human auditory
perception. To further improve robustness and feature diversity, we propose a
novel 1D-CNN-based SER framework that integrates data augmentation techniques.
MFCC features extracted from the augmented data are processed using a 1D
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture enhanced with channel and
spatial attention mechanisms. These attention modules allow the model to
highlight key emotional patterns, enhancing its ability to capture subtle
variations in speech signals. The proposed method delivers cutting-edge
performance, achieving the accuracy of 97.49% for SAVEE, 99.23% for RAVDESS,
89.31% for CREMA-D, 99.82% for TESS, 99.53% for EMO-DB, and 96.39% for EMOVO.
Experimental results show new benchmarks in SER, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our approach in recognizing emotional expressions with high
precision. Our evaluation demonstrates that the integration of advanced Deep
Learning (DL) methods substantially enhances generalization across diverse
datasets, underscoring their potential to advance SER for real-world deployment
in assistive technologies and human-computer interaction.

Abstract: Patient triage at emergency departments (EDs) is necessary to prioritize care
for patients with critical and time-sensitive conditions. Different tools are
used for patient triage and one of the most common ones is the emergency
severity index (ESI), which has a scale of five levels, where level 1 is the
most urgent and level 5 is the least urgent. This paper proposes a framework
for utilizing machine learning to develop an e-triage tool that can be used at
EDs. A large retrospective dataset of ED patient visits is obtained from the
electronic health record of a healthcare provider in the Midwest of the US for
three years. However, the main challenge of using machine learning algorithms
is that most of them have many parameters and without optimizing these
parameters, developing a high-performance model is not possible. This paper
proposes an approach to optimize the hyperparameters of machine learning. The
metaheuristic optimization algorithms simulated annealing (SA) and adaptive
simulated annealing (ASA) are proposed to optimize the parameters of extreme
gradient boosting (XGB) and categorical boosting (CaB). The newly proposed
algorithms are SA-XGB, ASA-XGB, SA-CaB, ASA-CaB. Grid search (GS), which is a
traditional approach used for machine learning fine-tunning is also used to
fine-tune the parameters of XGB and CaB, which are named GS-XGB and GS-CaB. The
six algorithms are trained and tested using eight data groups obtained from the
feature selection phase. The results show ASA-CaB outperformed all the proposed
algorithms with accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 of 83.3%, 83.2%, 83.3%,
83.2%, respectively.

Conclusion: EdgeSRIE在资源受限环境中实现了高质量实时超声成像的可行性。

Abstract: Speckle patterns in ultrasound images often obscure anatomical details,
leading to diagnostic uncertainty. Recently, various deep learning (DL)-based
techniques have been introduced to effectively suppress speckle; however, their
high computational costs pose challenges for low-resource devices, such as
portable ultrasound systems. To address this issue, EdgeSRIE, which is a
lightweight hybrid DL framework for real-time speckle reduction and image
enhancement in portable ultrasound imaging, is introduced. The proposed
framework consists of two main branches: an unsupervised despeckling branch,
which is trained by minimizing a loss function between speckled images, and a
deblurring branch, which restores blurred images to sharp images. For hardware
implementation, the trained network is quantized to 8-bit integer precision and
deployed on a low-resource system-on-chip (SoC) with limited power consumption.
In the performance evaluation with phantom and in vivo analyses, EdgeSRIE
achieved the highest contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and average gradient
magnitude (AGM) compared with the other baselines (different 2-rule-based
methods and other 4-DL-based methods). Furthermore, EdgeSRIE enabled real-time
inference at over 60 frames per second while satisfying computational
requirements (< 20K parameters) on actual portable ultrasound hardware. These
results demonstrated the feasibility of EdgeSRIE for real-time, high-quality
ultrasound imaging in resource-limited environments.

Abstract: Topological materials occupy a frontier in condensed-matter physics thanks to
their remarkable electronic and quantum properties, yet their cross-scale
design remains bottlenecked by inefficient discovery workflows. Here, we
introduce TopoMAS (Topological materials Multi-Agent System), an interactive
human-AI framework that seamlessly orchestrates the entire materials-discovery
pipeline: from user-defined queries and multi-source data retrieval, through
theoretical inference and crystal-structure generation, to first-principles
validation. Crucially, TopoMAS closes the loop by autonomously integrating
computational outcomes into a dynamic knowledge graph, enabling continuous
knowledge refinement. In collaboration with human experts, it has already
guided the identification of novel topological phases SrSbO3, confirmed by
first-principles calculations. Comprehensive benchmarks demonstrate robust
adaptability across base Large Language Model, with the lightweight Qwen2.5-72B
model achieving 94.55% accuracy while consuming only 74.3-78.4% of tokens
required by Qwen3-235B and 83.0% of DeepSeek-V3's usage--delivering responses
twice as fast as Qwen3-235B. This efficiency establishes TopoMAS as an
accelerator for computation-driven discovery pipelines. By harmonizing rational
agent orchestration with a self-evolving knowledge graph, our framework not
only delivers immediate advances in topological materials but also establishes
a transferable, extensible paradigm for materials-science domain.

Abstract: Modern social robots can be considered the descendants of steam engines from
the First Industrial Revolution (IR 1.0) and industrial robotic arms from the
Third Industrial Revolution (IR 3.0). As some time has passed since the
introduction of these robots during the Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR 4.0),
challenges and issues in their interaction with humans have emerged, leading
researchers to conclude that, like any other AI-based technology, these robots

to introduce humans and their needs in interactions with robots, ranging from
short-term, one-on-one interactions (micro-level) to long-term, macro-level
needs at the societal scale. Building upon the principles of human-centered AI,
this chapter presents, for the first time, a new framework of human needs
called the Dual Pyramid. This framework encompasses a comprehensive list of
human needs in robot interactions, from the most fundamental, robot
effectiveness to macro level requirements, such as the collaboration with

Abstract: Piano sustain pedal detection has previously been approached as a binary
on/off classification task, limiting its application in real-world piano
performance scenarios where pedal depth significantly influences musical
expression. This paper presents a novel approach for high-resolution estimation
that predicts continuous pedal depth values. We introduce a Transformer-based
architecture that not only matches state-of-the-art performance on the
traditional binary classification task but also achieves high accuracy in
continuous pedal depth estimation. Furthermore, by estimating continuous
values, our model provides musically meaningful predictions for sustain pedal
usage, whereas baseline models struggle to capture such nuanced expressions
with their binary detection approach. Additionally, this paper investigates the
influence of room acoustics on sustain pedal estimation using a synthetic
dataset that includes varied acoustic conditions. We train our model with
different combinations of room settings and test it in an unseen new
environment using a "leave-one-out" approach. Our findings show that the two
baseline models and ours are not robust to unseen room conditions. Statistical
analysis further confirms that reverberation influences model predictions and
introduces an overestimation bias.

Abstract: Understanding how cellular morphology, gene expression, and spatial
organization jointly shape tissue function is a central challenge in biology.
Image-based spatial transcriptomics technologies now provide high-resolution
measurements of cell images and gene expression profiles, but machine learning
methods typically analyze these modalities in isolation or at limited
resolution. We address the problem of learning unified, spatially aware
representations that integrate cell morphology, gene expression, and spatial
context across biological scales. This requires models that can operate at
single-cell resolution, reason across spatial neighborhoods, and generalize to
whole-slide tissue organization. Here, we introduce SPATIA, a multi-scale
generative and predictive model for spatial transcriptomics. SPATIA learns
cell-level embeddings by fusing image-derived morphological tokens and
transcriptomic vector tokens using cross-attention and then aggregates them at
niche and tissue levels using transformer modules to capture spatial
dependencies. SPATIA incorporates token merging in its generative diffusion
decoder to synthesize high-resolution cell images conditioned on gene
expression. We assembled a multi-scale dataset consisting of 17 million
cell-gene pairs, 1 million niche-gene pairs, and 10,000 tissue-gene pairs
across 49 donors, 17 tissue types, and 12 disease states. We benchmark SPATIA
against 13 existing models across 12 individual tasks, which span several
categories including cell annotation, cell clustering, gene imputation,
cross-modal prediction, and image generation. SPATIA achieves improved
performance over all baselines and generates realistic cell morphologies that
reflect transcriptomic perturbations.

Abstract: Motion planning is a crucial component of autonomous robot driving. While
various trajectory datasets exist, effectively utilizing them for a target
domain remains challenging due to differences in agent interactions and
environmental characteristics. Conventional approaches, such as domain
adaptation or ensemble learning, leverage multiple source datasets but suffer
from domain imbalance, catastrophic forgetting, and high computational costs.
To address these challenges, we propose Interaction-Merged Motion Planning
(IMMP), a novel approach that leverages parameter checkpoints trained on
different domains during adaptation to the target domain. IMMP follows a
two-step process: pre-merging to capture agent behaviors and interactions,
sufficiently extracting diverse information from the source domain, followed by
merging to construct an adaptable model that efficiently transfers diverse
interactions to the target domain. Our method is evaluated on various planning
benchmarks and models, demonstrating superior performance compared to
conventional approaches.

localization and severity prediction. 6) There is increasing attention on
specific bugs like non-functional and performance bugs. 7) Common evaluation
metrics are F1-score, Recall, Precision, and Accuracy, with $k$-fold

architectures: one pre-trained for onset detection (intra-task) and another for
beat tracking (inter-task). Using only 5-second annotated snippets per
instrument, we fine-tune these models through layer-wise retraining strategies
for five traditional percussion instruments. Our results demonstrate
significant improvements over baseline performance, with F1 scores reaching up
to 0.998 in the intra-task setting and improvements of over 50 percentage
points in best-case scenarios. The cross-task adaptation proves particularly
effective for time-keeping instruments, where onsets naturally align with beat
positions. The optimal fine-tuning configuration varies by instrument,
highlighting the importance of instrument-specific adaptation strategies. This
approach addresses the challenges of underrepresented musical traditions,
offering an efficient human-in-the-loop methodology that minimizes annotation
effort while maximizing performance. Our findings contribute to more inclusive

Abstract: Understanding and quantifying chaos in nonlinear dynamical systems remains a
fundamental challenge in science and engineering. The Lyapunov exponent is a
key measure of chaotic behavior, but its accurate estimation from experimental
data is often hindered by methodological and computational limitations. In this
work, we present a novel machine-learning-based approach for estimating the
positive Lyapunov exponent (MLE) from one-dimensional time series, using the
growth of out-of-sample prediction errors as a proxy for trajectory divergence.
Our method demonstrates high scientific relevance, offering a robust,
data-driven alternative to traditional analytic techniques. Through
comprehensive testing on several canonical chaotic maps - including the
logistic, sine, cubic, and Chebyshev maps - we achieved a coefficient of
determination R2pos > 0.9 between predicted and theoretical MLE values for time
series as short as M = 200 points. The best accuracy was observed for the
Chebyshev map (R2pos = 0.999). Notably, the proposed method maintains high
computational efficiency and generalizes well across various machine learning
algorithms. These results highlight the significance of our approach for
practical chaos analysis in both synthetic and experimental settings, opening
new possibilities for robust nonlinear dynamics assessment when only time
series data are available.

Abstract: Understanding leadership dynamics in collective behavior is a key challenge
in animal ecology, swarm robotics, and intelligent transportation. Traditional
information-theoretic approaches, including Transfer Entropy (TE) and
Time-Lagged Mutual Information (TLMI), have been widely used to infer
leader-follower relationships but face critical limitations in noisy or
short-duration datasets due to their reliance on robust probability
estimations. This study proposes a method based on dynamic network inference
using time-lagged correlations across multiple kinematic variables: velocity,
acceleration, and direction. Our approach constructs directed influence graphs
over time, enabling the identification of leadership patterns without the need
for large volumes of data or parameter-sensitive discretization. We validate
our method through two multi-agent simulations in NetLogo: a modified Vicsek
model with informed leaders and a predator-prey model featuring coordinated and
independent wolf groups. Experimental results demonstrate that the
network-based method outperforms TE and TLMI in scenarios with limited
spatiotemporal observations, ranking true leaders at the top of influence
metrics more consistently than TE and TLMI.

the US-centric Argoverse 2 benchmark. First, we find that incorporating
supplementary map and agent features unique to our dataset, yields no
measurable improvement over baseline features, demonstrating that modern
architectures do not need extensive feature sets for optimal performance. The
limited features of public datasets are sufficient to capture convoluted
interactions without added complexity. Second, we perform cross-dataset

Abstract: The field of Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) has seen significant advancements
in recent years due to the rapid progress of diffusion-based approaches.
However, capturing vocal style, genre-specific pitch inflections, and
language-dependent characteristics remains challenging, particularly in
low-resource scenarios. To address this, we propose LAPS-Diff, a diffusion
model integrated with language-aware embeddings and a vocal-style guided
learning mechanism, specifically designed for Bollywood Hindi singing style. We
curate a Hindi SVS dataset and leverage pre-trained language models to extract
word and phone-level embeddings for an enriched lyrics representation.
Additionally, we incorporated a style encoder and a pitch extraction model to
compute style and pitch losses, capturing features essential to the naturalness
and expressiveness of the synthesized singing, particularly in terms of vocal
style and pitch variations. Furthermore, we utilize MERT and IndicWav2Vec
models to extract musical and contextual embeddings, serving as conditional
priors to refine the acoustic feature generation process further. Based on
objective and subjective evaluations, we demonstrate that LAPS-Diff
significantly improves the quality of the generated samples compared to the
considered state-of-the-art (SOTA) model for our constrained dataset that is

Motivation: 自然灾害频发，机场在救援中成为瓶颈，信息不对称和资源不足是主要问题。

Method: 建立基于代理的模型，模拟不同信息不确定性下的资源分配策略，并进行专家校准。

Result: 单个未计划飞机影响可忽略，但多架未计划飞机会增加等待时间。

Conclusion: 信息完整性和资源分配策略对机场救援效率至关重要。

Abstract: The severity of natural disasters is increasing every year, impacting many
people's lives. During the response phase of disasters, airports are important
hubs where relief aid arrives and people need to be evacuated. However, the
airport often forms a bottleneck in these relief operations due to the sudden
need for increased capacity. Limited research has been done on the operational
side of airport disaster management. Experts identify the main problems as,
first, the asymmetry of information between the airport and incoming flights,
and second, the lack of resources. The goal of this research is to understand
the effects of incomplete knowledge of incoming flights with different resource
allocation strategies on the performance of cargo handling operations at an
airport after a natural disaster. An agent-based model is created, implementing
realistic offloading strategies with different degrees of information
uncertainty. Model calibration and verification are performed with experts in
the field. The model performance is measured by the average turnaround time,
which is divided into offloading time, boarding time, and cumulative waiting
times. The results show that the effects of one unplanned aircraft are
negligible. However, all waiting times increase with more arriving unplanned
aircraft.

The proposed framework leverages recent self-supervised learning articulatory
inversion techniques to estimate articulatory features. Analyzing a corpus of
read speech from American and British English speakers, this study examines
correlations between derived articulatory parameters and accent strength
proxies, associating systematic articulatory differences with indexed accent
strength. Results indicate that tongue positioning patterns distinguish the two
dialects, with notable differences inter-dialects in rhotic and low back
vowels. These findings contribute to automated accent analysis and articulatory
modeling for speech processing applications.

Conclusion: Surg-SegFormer通过自动化手术场景理解，提升了手术培训的独立性。

Abstract: Holistic surgical scene segmentation in robot-assisted surgery (RAS) enables
surgical residents to identify various anatomical tissues, articulated tools,
and critical structures, such as veins and vessels. Given the firm
intraoperative time constraints, it is challenging for surgeons to provide
detailed real-time explanations of the operative field for trainees. This
challenge is compounded by the scarcity of expert surgeons relative to
trainees, making the unambiguous delineation of go- and no-go zones
inconvenient. Therefore, high-performance semantic segmentation models offer a
solution by providing clear postoperative analyses of surgical procedures.
However, recent advanced segmentation models rely on user-generated prompts,
rendering them impractical for lengthy surgical videos that commonly exceed an
hour. To address this challenge, we introduce Surg-SegFormer, a novel
prompt-free model that outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques.
Surg-SegFormer attained a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.80 on the
EndoVis2018 dataset and 0.54 on the EndoVis2017 dataset. By providing robust
and automated surgical scene comprehension, this model significantly reduces
the tutoring burden on expert surgeons, empowering residents to independently

Conclusion: LVM4CSI为无线通信提供了一种通用高效的框架，减少了对任务特定设计的依赖。

Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) is critical to the performance of
wireless communication systems, especially with the increasing scale and
complexity introduced by 5G and future 6G technologies. While artificial
intelligence (AI) offers a promising approach to CSI acquisition and
utilization, existing methods largely depend on task-specific neural networks
(NNs) that require expert-driven design and large training datasets, limiting
their generalizability and practicality. To address these challenges, we
propose LVM4CSI, a general and efficient framework that leverages the
structural similarity between CSI and computer vision (CV) data to directly
apply large vision models (LVMs) pre-trained on extensive CV datasets to
wireless tasks without any fine-tuning, in contrast to large language
model-based methods that generally necessitate fine-tuning. LVM4CSI maps CSI
tasks to analogous CV tasks, transforms complex-valued CSI into visual formats
compatible with LVMs, and integrates lightweight trainable layers to adapt
extracted features to specific communication objectives. We validate LVM4CSI
through three representative case studies, including channel estimation, human
activity recognition, and user localization. Results demonstrate that LVM4CSI
achieves comparable or superior performance to task-specific NNs, including an
improvement exceeding 9.61 dB in channel estimation and approximately 40%
reduction in localization error. Furthermore, it significantly reduces the
number of trainable parameters and eliminates the need for task-specific NN
design.

Abstract: Answer Set Programming Modulo Theories (ASPMT) is a new framework of tight
integration of answer set programming (ASP) and satisfiability modulo theories
(SMT). Similar to the relationship between first-order logic and SMT, it is
based on a recent proposal of the functional stable model semantics by fixing
interpretations of background theories. Analogously to a known relationship
between ASP and SAT, ``tight'' ASPMT programs can be translated into SMT
instances. We demonstrate the usefulness of ASPMT by enhancing action language
C+ to handle continuous changes as well as discrete changes. We reformulate the
semantics of C+ in terms ofASPMT, and show that SMT solvers can be used to
compute the language. We also show how the language can represent cumulative
effects on continuous resources.

Abstract: Tendon-driven mechanisms are useful from the perspectives of variable

wire arrangements has traditionally been done empirically, but it becomes
extremely challenging when dealing with complex structures. Various studies

oversimplified the problem by imposing conditions such as restricting movements
to a 2D plane, keeping the moment arm constant, or neglecting wire crossings.
Therefore, this study proposes a three-dimensional wire arrangement
optimization that takes wire crossings into account. We explore wire
arrangements through a multi-objective black-box optimization method that
ensures wires do not cross while providing sufficient joint torque along a
defined target trajectory. For a 3D link structure, we optimize the wire
arrangement under various conditions, demonstrate its effectiveness, and

Abstract: Turbulent flows are chaotic and unsteady, but their statistical distribution
converges to a statistical steady state. Engineering quantities of interest
typically take the form of time-average statistics such as $ \frac{1}{t}
\int_0^t f ( u(x,\tau; \theta) ) d\tau \overset{t \rightarrow
\infty}{\rightarrow} F(x; \theta)$, where $u(x,t; \theta)$ are solutions of the
Navier--Stokes equations with parameters $\theta$. Optimizing over $F(x;
\theta)$ has many engineering applications including geometric optimization,
flow control, and closure modeling. However, this remains an open challenge, as
existing computational approaches are incapable of scaling to physically
representative numbers of grid points. The fundamental obstacle is the
chaoticity of turbulent flows: gradients calculated with the adjoint method
diverge exponentially as $t \rightarrow \infty$.
  We develop a new online gradient-flow (OGF) method that is scalable to large
degree-of-freedom systems and enables optimizing for the steady-state
statistics of chaotic, unsteady, turbulence-resolving simulations. The method
forward-propagates an online estimate for the gradient of $F(x; \theta)$ while
simultaneously performing online updates of the parameters $\theta$. A key
feature is the fully online nature of the algorithm to facilitate faster
optimization progress and its combination with a finite-difference estimator to
avoid the divergence of gradients due to chaoticity. The proposed OGF method is
demonstrated for optimizations over three chaotic ordinary and partial
differential equations: the Lorenz-63 equation, the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky
equation, and Navier--Stokes solutions of compressible, forced, homogeneous
isotropic turbulence. In each case, the OGF method successfully reduces the
loss based on $F(x; \theta)$ by several orders of magnitude and accurately
recovers the optimal parameters.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM推理规模的扩大，GPU内存限制成为瓶颈，尤其是长上下文生成所需的KV缓存。现有方法（如将KV缓存卸载到CPU或稀疏注意力）未能充分利用CPU计算资源且可能牺牲准确性。

Method: HGCA采用混合注意力机制：在GPU上保留最近生成的KV条目进行密集注意力计算，同时在CPU上并行处理选定的重要KV条目进行稀疏注意力计算。通过log-sum-exp融合高效合并注意力输出，并引入针对CPU优化的细粒度稀疏化策略。

Result: 实验表明，HGCA在多种模型和工作负载下均表现出卓越的可扩展性，支持更长序列和更大批量，且在性能和准确性上优于现有稀疏注意力基线。

Conclusion: HGCA为LLM推理提供了一种高效、可扩展的解决方案，无需重新训练模型即可在现有框架中无缝集成。

Abstract: Scaling inference for large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
constrained by limited GPU memory, especially due to growing key-value (KV)
caches required for long-context generation. While existing approaches offload
KV caches to CPU memory or apply sparse attention to reduce GPU load, they
often underutilize CPU compute resources and compromise accuracy. We present
HGCA, a hybrid CPU-GPU attention mechanism that enables scalable,
high-throughput LLM inference with near-full attention quality. HGCA performs
dense attention on recently generated KV entries retained in GPU memory and
parallel sparse attention on selected, salient KV entries in CPU memory. The
attention outputs are efficiently merged using log-sum-exp fusion, minimizing
PCIe transfer overhead. HGCA also introduces a finegrained, per-head
sparsification strategy optimized for CPU execution, preserving contextual
relevance while reducing computation. Our implementation seamlessly integrates
into existing LLM frameworks without requiring model retraining. Experiments
across diverse models and workloads show that HGCA achieves superior
scalability, supports longer sequences and larger batch sizes, and outperforms
existing sparse attention baselines in both performance and accuracy -- all on
commodity GPU hardware.

Result: 在OPT-175B上，DistZO2比ZO2提速3倍，同时保持内存效率。

Conclusion: DistZO2成功扩展了零阶微调至多GPU系统，提升了训练效率。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) remains resource-intensive due to
their sheer scale. While zeroth-order (ZO) optimization provides a
memory-efficient alternative by eliminating backward passes, its application to
multi-hundred-billion-parameter models is constrained by GPU memory and compute
throughput. The ZO2 framework addresses the memory bottleneck by offloading
model parameters to CPU memory and overlapping transformer block transfer with
dual forward computation on a single GPU. However, ZO2 remains limited by its
single-device execution and achieves modest throughput. In this work, we
present DistZO2, a high-throughput, memory-efficient framework for distributed
zeroth-order fine-tuning of LLMs. DistZO2 introduces three parallel strategies:
(1) Perturbation Parallelism (PertP), which parallelizes the two perturbed
forward passes across devices; (2) Distributed Data Parallelism (DDP), adapted
to the scalar-gradient nature of ZO training; and (3) a unified 2D Parallelism
design that combines PertP and DDP. To further mitigate communication
bottlenecks introduced by parameter offloading, we propose a hardware-aware
communication strategy that slices parameter blocks and redistributes them
across GPUs via high-speed interconnects such as NVLink. DistZO2 scales
zeroth-order fine-tuning to modern multi-GPU systems, preserving ZO2's memory
efficiency while substantially improving training throughput. In our
experiments on OPT-175B, DistZO2 achieves a 3x speedup over ZO2 with
distributed computing. DistZO2's code has been open-sourced in

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RLRS的新方法，通过调整Transformer模型中不同组件的学习率来优化LLM训练，显著加速训练过程并减少计算资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通常对所有网络层应用统一的学习率，忽略了各部分的独特动态特性，因此需要一种更灵活的学习率调整方法。

Method: 引入相对学习率（RLRS）方法，针对不同组件调整学习率，并通过小模型高效调参后应用于更大模型。

Result: RLRS方法在复杂模型（如MoE）中训练速度提升高达23%，并可扩展到27倍大的模型。

Conclusion: RLRS是一种简单有效的方法，显著减少了大规模神经网络的训练时间和资源需求。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a novel approach for optimizing LLM training by
adjusting learning rates across weights of different components in Transformer
models. Traditional methods often apply a uniform learning rate across all
network layers, potentially overlooking the unique dynamics of each part.
Remarkably, our introduced relative learning rates, RLRS, method accelerates
the training process by up to $23\%$, particularly in complex models such as
Mixture of Experts (MoE). Hyperparameters of RLRS can be efficiently tuned on
smaller models and then effectively reused on models up to $27\times$ larger.
This simple and effective method results in a substantial reduction in training
time and computational resources, offering a practical and scalable solution
for optimizing large-scale neural networks.

Motivation: 现有对抗攻击通常针对单点贪婪生成，忽略了LLM的随机性，无法准确评估其鲁棒性。

Method: 将攻击过程建模为资源分配问题，结合优化和采样，提出熵最大化目标。

Result: 攻击成功率提升48%，效率提升两个数量级；发现大多数优化策略对输出危害性影响有限。

Conclusion: 尾部感知的攻击和评估协议对准确评估和增强LLM安全性至关重要。

Abstract: To guarantee safe and robust deployment of large language models (LLMs) at
scale, it is critical to accurately assess their adversarial robustness.
Existing adversarial attacks typically target harmful responses in
single-point, greedy generations, overlooking the inherently stochastic nature
of LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for adversarial robustness
evaluation that explicitly models the entire output distribution, including
tail-risks, providing better estimates for model robustness at scale. By
casting the attack process as a resource allocation problem between
optimization and sampling, we determine compute-optimal tradeoffs and show that
integrating sampling into existing attacks boosts ASR by up to 48% and improves
efficiency by up to two orders of magnitude. Our framework also enables us to
analyze how different attack algorithms affect output harm distributions.
Surprisingly, we find that most optimization strategies have little effect on
output harmfulness. Finally, we introduce a data-free proof-of-concept
objective based on entropy-maximization to demonstrate how our tail-aware
perspective enables new optimization targets. Overall, our findings highlight
the importance of tail-aware attacks and evaluation protocols to accurately
assess and strengthen LLM safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF对齐LLMs时存在高计算成本、内存需求和训练不稳定问题，尤其在更大模型上。ESSA旨在通过ES提供更高效、稳定的替代方案。

Method: 采用进化策略（ES）进行对齐，结合低秩适应降低优化维度，避免梯度计算。

Result: 在数学推理任务中，ESSA比梯度方法（如GRPO）收敛更快、数据效率更高。

Conclusion: ESSA证明ES是对齐LLMs的高效、可扩展替代方案，为大型模型的后训练提供了新途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly relying on alignment techniques
to ensure that their outputs match human preferences. Although reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) is the dominant approach, it has high
computational costs, memory requirements, and training instability,
particularly when scaling to larger models. This paper introduces ESSA
(Evolutionary Strategies for Scalable Alignment), a new framework that uses
Evolutionary Strategies (ES) to efficiently align LLMs without the need for
gradient computation. ES is well-suited for LLM alignment due to its favorable
properties, such as high parallelizability, memory efficiency, robustness to
sparse rewards, and fewer data samples required for convergence, especially
when starting from a strong pre-trained policy. Moreover, ES eliminates the
need for extensive hyperparameter tuning, making the alignment process simpler
and more stable. Although ES excels in low-dimensional optimization, it poses a
challenge when applied to high-dimensional LLMs. To address this challenge, we
propose a parameter-efficient architectural modification that reduces the
dimensionality of optimization through low-rank adaptation. We evaluated our
approach on mathematical reasoning tasks with verifiable accuracy-based
metrics, demonstrating that ESSA converges faster and is more data efficient
than gradient-based methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our
findings establish ES as a promising and scalable alternative to gradient-based
alignment, paving the way for efficient post-training of large language models.

Motivation: Transformer在处理序列数据时存在二次复杂度增长的问题，且与人类大脑处理认知任务的方式不符。作者希望通过结合储层计算，设计更高效的模型。

Method: EST结合Transformer注意力机制和储层计算，引入并行工作的储层作为独立记忆单元，动态调整记忆/非线性权衡，实现固定计算复杂度。

Result: 在STREAM基准测试的12个任务中，EST在8个任务上优于GRUs、LSTMs和标准Transformer。

Conclusion: EST在资源受限和低数据场景下可替代GRUs和LSTMs，并补充标准Transformer。

Abstract: While Large Language Models and their underlying Transformer architecture are
remarkably efficient, they do not reflect how our brain processes and learns a
diversity of cognitive tasks such as language and working memory. Furthermore,
sequential data processing with Transformers encounters a fundamental barrier:
quadratic complexity growth with sequence length. Motivated by these
limitations, our ambition is to create more efficient models that are less
reliant on intensive computations and massive volumes of data. We introduce
Echo State Transformers (EST), a hybrid architecture that elegantly resolves
this challenge while demonstrating exceptional performance in low-data regimes.
EST integrates the Transformer attention mechanisms with principles from
Reservoir Computing to create a fixedsize window distributed memory system.
Drawing inspiration from Echo State Networks, the most prominent instance of
the Reservoir Computing paradigm, our architecture integrates a new module
called ''Working Memory'' based on several reservoirs (i.e. random recurrent
networks) working in parallel. These reservoirs work as independent memory
units with distinct internal dynamics. A novelty here is that the classical
reservoir hyperparameters controlling the dynamics are now trained. Thus, the
EST dynamically adapts the memory/non-linearity trade-off in reservoirs. By
maintaining a fixed number of memory units regardless of sequence length, EST
achieves constant computational complexity at each processing step, effectively
breaking the quadratic scaling problem of standard Transformers. Evaluations on
the STREAM benchmark, which comprises 12 diverse sequential processing tasks,
demonstrate that EST outperforms GRUs, LSTMs, and even Transformers on 8 of
these tasks. These findings highlight that Echo State Transformers can be an
effective replacement to GRUs and LSTMs while complementing standard
Transformers at least on resource-constrained environments and low-data
scenarios across diverse sequential processing tasks.

Abstract: Recent results show that modern Large Language Models (LLM) are indeed
capable of understanding and answering questions about structured data such as
graphs. This new paradigm can lead to solutions that require less supervision
while, at the same time, providing a model that can generalize and answer
questions beyond the training labels. Existing proposals often use some
description of the graph to create an ``augmented'' prompt fed to the LLM. For
a chosen class of graphs, if a well-tailored graph encoder is deployed to play
together with a pre-trained LLM, the model can answer graph-related questions
well. Existing solutions to graph-based prompts range from graph serialization
to graph transformers. In this work, we show that the use of a parameter-free
graph encoder based on Fock space representations, a concept borrowed from
mathematical physics, is remarkably versatile in this problem setting. The
simple construction, inherited directly from the theory with a few small
adjustments, can provide rich and informative graph encodings, for a wide range
of different graphs. We investigate the use of this idea for prefix-tuned
prompts leveraging the capabilities of a pre-trained, frozen LLM. The
modifications lead to a model that can answer graph-related questions -- from
simple graphs to proteins to hypergraphs -- effectively and with minimal, if
any, adjustments to the architecture. Our work significantly simplifies
existing solutions and generalizes well to multiple different graph-based
structures effortlessly.

Abstract: Multi-head attention powers Transformer networks, the primary deep learning
architecture behind the success of large language models (LLMs). Yet, the
theoretical advantages of multi-head versus single-head attention, beyond mere
parallel processing, remain underexplored. In this paper, we reframe multi-head
attention as a system of potentially synergistic computational graphs, where
each head functions as a feedforward directed acyclic graph (DAG) with a common
sink state. We provide intuition and preliminary theoretical analysis of mixing
time and minimax fidelity in this framework. Our results show that multi-head
attention can synergistically enhance information propagation, yielding faster
mixing times and minimax fidelity amplification under specific head-diversity
conditions. Finally, we train single-head and multi-head Transformers, each
with the same total number of parameters, on sequence manipulation tasks and
empirically verify the predicted effects.

Abstract: As major progress in LLM-based long-form text generation enables paradigms
such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and inference-time scaling, safely
incorporating private information into the generation remains a critical open
question. We present InvisibleInk, a highly scalable long-form text generation
framework satisfying rigorous differential privacy guarantees with respect to
the sensitive references. It interprets sampling from the LLM's
next-token-distribution as the exponential mechanism over the LLM logits with
two innovations. First, we reduce the privacy cost by isolating and clipping
only the sensitive information in the model logits (relative to the public
logits). Second, we improve text quality by sampling from a small superset of
the top-$k$ private tokens. Empirical evaluations demonstrate a consistent
$8\times$ reduction in computation cost over state-of-the-art baselines to
generate long-form private text of the same utility across privacy levels. In
summary, InvisibleInk is able to generate private long-form text at less than
$10\times$ the computation cost of non-private generation.

Conclusion: Optimas为复合系统优化提供了通用有效的方法。

Abstract: Compound AI systems integrating multiple components, such as Large Language
Models, specialized tools, and traditional machine learning models, are
increasingly deployed to solve complex real-world tasks. However, optimizing
compound systems remains challenging due to their non-differentiable structures
and diverse configuration types across components, including prompts,
hyperparameters, and model parameters. To address this challenge, we propose
Optimas, a unified framework for effective optimization of compound systems.
The core idea of Optimas is to maintain one Local Reward Function (LRF) per
component, each satisfying a local-global alignment property, i.e., each
component's local reward correlates with the global system performance. In each
iteration, Optimas efficiently adapts the LRFs to maintain this property while
simultaneously maximizing each component's local reward. This approach enables
independent updates of heterogeneous configurations using the designated
optimization method, while ensuring that local improvements consistently lead
to performance gains. We present extensive evaluations across five real-world
compound systems to demonstrate that Optimas outperforms strong baselines by an
average improvement of 11.92%, offering a general and effective approach for
improving compound systems. Our website is at https://optimas.stanford.edu.

Result: 8:16稀疏性在性能阈值上超越了传统方法，且在存储开销上仅略有增加（0.875 vs. 0.75 bits/element）。结构化稀疏性对异常权重的处理与无结构化方法竞争，甚至表现更优。

Conclusion: 8:16半结构化稀疏性是一种高效且灵活的压缩技术，适用于大型语言模型，且通过简单技术可进一步提升性能。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow in size, efficient compression
techniques like quantization and sparsification are critical. While
quantization maintains performance with reduced precision, structured sparsity
methods, such as N:M sparsification, often fall short due to limited
flexibility, and sensitivity to outlier weights. We explore 8:16
semi-structured sparsity, demonstrating its ability to surpass the Performance
Threshold-where a compressed model matches the accuracy of its uncompressed or
smaller counterpart under equivalent memory constraints. Compared to 2:4
sparsity, 8:16 offers greater flexibility with minimal storage overhead (0.875
vs. 0.75 bits/element). We also apply sparse structured patterns for salient
weights, showing that structured sparsity for outliers is competitive with
unstructured approaches leading to equivalent or better results. Finally, we
demonstrate that simple techniques such as variance correction and SmoothQuant
like weight equalization improve sparse models performance.

Abstract: Safe generalization in reinforcement learning requires not only that a
learned policy acts capably in new situations, but also that it uses its
capabilities towards the pursuit of the designer's intended goal. The latter
requirement may fail when a proxy goal incentivizes similar behavior to the
intended goal within the training environment, but not in novel deployment
environments. This creates the risk that policies will behave as if in pursuit
of the proxy goal, rather than the intended goal, in deployment -- a phenomenon
known as goal misgeneralization. In this paper, we formalize this problem
setting in order to theoretically study the possibility of goal
misgeneralization under different training objectives. We show that goal
misgeneralization is possible under approximate optimization of the maximum
expected value (MEV) objective, but not the minimax expected regret (MMER)
objective. We then empirically show that the standard MEV-based training method
of domain randomization exhibits goal misgeneralization in
procedurally-generated grid-world environments, whereas current regret-based
unsupervised environment design (UED) methods are more robust to goal
misgeneralization (though they don't find MMER policies in all cases). Our
findings suggest that minimax expected regret is a promising approach to
mitigating goal misgeneralization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strikingly conflicting behaviors: they
can appear steadfastly overconfident in their initial answers whilst at the
same time being prone to excessive doubt when challenged. To investigate this
apparent paradox, we developed a novel experimental paradigm, exploiting the
unique ability to obtain confidence estimates from LLMs without creating memory
of their initial judgments -- something impossible in human participants. We
show that LLMs -- Gemma 3, GPT4o and o1-preview -- exhibit a pronounced
choice-supportive bias that reinforces and boosts their estimate of confidence
in their answer, resulting in a marked resistance to change their mind. We
further demonstrate that LLMs markedly overweight inconsistent compared to
consistent advice, in a fashion that deviates qualitatively from normative
Bayesian updating. Finally, we demonstrate that these two mechanisms -- a drive
to maintain consistency with prior commitments and hypersensitivity to
contradictory feedback -- parsimoniously capture LLM behavior in a different
domain. Together, these findings furnish a mechanistic account of LLM
confidence that explains both their stubbornness and excessive sensitivity to
criticism.

Conclusion: C-IP是一种有效的顺序信息增益方法，能够显著提升LLM在交互式任务中的表现，尤其是在需要高可解释性的场景中。

Abstract: A significant use case of instruction-finetuned Large Language Models (LLMs)
is to solve question-answering tasks interactively. In this setting, an LLM
agent is tasked with making a prediction by sequentially querying relevant
information from the user, as opposed to a single-turn conversation. This paper
explores sequential querying strategies that aim to minimize the expected
number of queries. One such strategy is Information Pursuit (IP), a greedy
algorithm that at each iteration selects the query that maximizes information
gain or equivalently minimizes uncertainty. However, obtaining accurate
estimates of mutual information or conditional entropy for LLMs is very
difficult in practice due to over- or under-confident LLM probabilities, which
leads to suboptimal query selection and predictive performance. To better
estimate the uncertainty at each iteration, we propose Conformal Information
Pursuit (C-IP), an alternative approach to sequential information gain based on
conformal prediction sets. More specifically, C-IP leverages a relationship
between prediction sets and conditional entropy at each iteration to estimate
uncertainty based on the average size of conformal prediction sets. In contrast
to conditional entropy, we find that conformal prediction sets are a
distribution-free and robust method of measuring uncertainty. Experiments with
20 Questions show that C-IP obtains better predictive performance and shorter
query-answer chains compared to previous approaches to IP and uncertainty-based
chain-of-thought methods. Furthermore, extending to an interactive medical
setting between a doctor and a patient on the MediQ dataset, C-IP achieves
competitive performance with direct single-turn prediction while offering
greater interpretability.

Conclusion: MGAA通过自适应参数分配显著提升了低秩近似压缩的效率和性能，适用于LLM和多模态模型。

Abstract: The enormous parameter scale of large language models (LLMs) has made model
compression a research hotspot, which aims to alleviate computational resource
demands during deployment and inference. As a promising direction, low-rank
approximation technique has made remarkable achievements. Nevertheless,
unfortunately, the vast majority of studies to low-rank approximation
compression generally apply uniform compression ratios across all weight
matrices, while disregarding their inherently differentiated impacts on the
model's performance. Although a few recent work attempts to employ heuristic
search strategies to achieve the optimal parameter allocation, such strategies
are computationally inefficient and lose the generalization ability in the era
of LLMs. In this study, we propose a novel parameter Multi-Granular Adaptive
Allocation (MGAA) method, which can adaptively allocate parameters between and
within sublayers without task-specific evaluations in the compression process.
MGAA consists of two components: 1) Among different sublayers, it assigns
compression ratios based on their cosine similarity between inputs and outputs,
allowing for a more tailored compression in sublayers with varying degrees of
importance, and 2) Within each sublayer, it allocates different compression
ratios to weight matrices based on their energy distribution characteristics,
ensuring a consistent energy retention ratio while optimizing compression
efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations of MGAA across multiple LLMs backbone
models and benchmark datasets demonstrate its superior performance.
Additionally, we apply our MGAA to multimodal model LLaVA, exhibiting
remarkable performance improvements.

Abstract: Linear attention has attracted interest as a computationally efficient
approximation to softmax attention, especially for long sequences. Recent
studies have explored distilling softmax attention in pre-trained Transformers
into linear attention. However, a critical challenge remains: how to choose the
feature dimension that governs the approximation quality. Existing methods fix
this dimension uniformly across all attention layers, overlooking the diverse
roles and complexities of them. In this paper, we propose a principled method
to automatically determine the feature dimension in linear attention using the
concept of statistical degrees of freedom, which represent the effective
dimensionality of the inputs. We provide a theoretical bound on the
approximation error and show that the dimension chosen by our method achieves
smaller error under a fixed computational budget. Furthermore, we introduce an
efficient layerwise training strategy to learn nonlinear features tailored to
each layer. Experiments on multiple pre-trained transformers demonstrate that
our method improves the performance of distilled models compared to baselines
without increasing the inference cost. Our findings also provide insight into
how the complexity of the attention mechanism evolves across layers.

Result: 发现微调不安全代码会引发内部变化，侵蚀原有对齐，并识别了一个共享的潜在维度控制对齐行为。

Conclusion: 结论强调需要更鲁棒的微调策略以保持跨域的安全行为。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on code
with security vulnerabilities can result in misaligned and unsafe behaviors
across broad domains. These results prompted concerns about the emergence of
harmful behaviors from narrow domain fine-tuning. In this paper, we
contextualize these findings by analyzing how such narrow adaptation impacts
the internal mechanisms and behavioral manifestations of LLMs. Through a series
of experiments covering output probability distributions, loss and gradient
vector geometry, layer-wise activation dynamics, and activation space
dimensions, we find that behaviors attributed to "emergent misalignment" may be
better interpreted as an erosion of prior alignment. We show that fine tuning
on insecure code induces internal changes that oppose alignment. Further, we
identify a shared latent dimension in the model's activation space that governs
alignment behavior. We show that this space is activated by insecure code and
by misaligned responses more generally, revealing how narrow fine-tuning can
degrade general safety behavior by interfering with shared internal mechanisms.
Our findings offer a mechanistic interpretation for previously observed
misalignment phenomena, and highlights the fragility of alignment in LLMs. The
results underscore the need for more robust fine-tuning strategies that
preserve intended behavior across domains.

Abstract: The evaluation of large language model (LLM) outputs is increasingly
performed by other LLMs, a setup commonly known as "LLM-as-a-judge", or
autograders. While autograders offer a scalable alternative to human
evaluation, they have shown mixed reliability and may exhibit systematic
biases, depending on response type, scoring methodology, domain specificity,
and other factors. In this paper we propose a statistical framework based on
Bayesian generalised linear models (GLMs) that enables researchers to
simultaneously assess their autograders while also addressing their primary
research questions (e.g., LLM evaluation). Our approach models evaluation
outcomes (e.g., scores or pairwise preferences) as a function of properties of
the grader (e.g., human vs. autograder) and the evaluated item (e.g., response
length or the LLM that generated it), allowing for explicit quantification of
scoring differences and potential biases within a unified framework. In
addition, our method can be used to augment traditional reliability metrics
such as inter-rater agreement, by providing uncertainty estimates and
clarifying the source of disagreement. Overall, this approach contributes to
more robust and interpretable use of autograders in LLM evaluation, enabling
both performance analysis and bias detection.

Result: 实验显示IMPACT在多种模型和任务中，模型大小减少达48.6%，准确性媲美现有方法。

Conclusion: IMPACT为LLM压缩提供了更优方案，尤其适用于资源受限场景。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across many domains
but are difficult to deploy in resource-constrained settings due to their size.
Low-rank weight matrix compression is a popular strategy for reducing model
size, typically by minimizing weight reconstruction error under the assumption
that weights are low-rank. However, this assumption often does not hold in
LLMs. Instead, LLM activations exhibit stronger low-rank structure-prompting a
shift toward minimizing activation reconstruction error.
  We show that this shift alone is insufficient: activation dimensions
contribute unequally to model performance, and uniform reconstruction can harm
performance. We propose IMPACT, a principled framework for importance-aware
activation reconstruction that links model compression decisions to their
impact on model behavior. IMPACT formulates an optimization problem that
considers both activation structure and gradient sensitivity, and derives a
closed-form solution where the optimal reconstruction bases are the
eigenvectors of an importance-weighted activation covariance matrix. This
enables low-rank approximations explicitly optimized to preserve accuracy.
Experiments across diverse models and tasks show that IMPACT achieves up to
48.6% greater model size reduction with accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art
baselines.

Result: 理论分析表明PMC能有效收敛到遗忘目标，实证显示其比现有方法更有效地移除私有信息。

Conclusion: PMC为更符合实际隐私约束的遗忘方法提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Current unlearning methods for LLMs optimize on the private information they
seek to remove by incorporating it into their training objectives. We argue
this not only risks reinforcing exposure to sensitive data, it also
fundamentally contradicts the principle of minimizing its use. As a remedy, we
propose a novel unlearning method - Partial Model Collapse (PMC), which does
not require unlearning targets in the unlearning objective. Our approach is
inspired by recent observations that training generative models on their own
generations leads to distribution collapse, effectively removing information
from the model. Our core idea is to leverage this collapse for unlearning by
triggering collapse partially on the sensitive data. We theoretically analyze
that our approach converges to the desired outcome, i.e. the LLM unlearns the
information in the forget set. We empirically demonstrate that PMC overcomes
two key limitations of existing unlearning approaches that explicitly optimize
on unlearning targets, and more effectively removes private information from
model outputs. Overall, our contributions represent an important step toward
more comprehensive unlearning that aligns with real-world privacy constraints.

Method: 引入power attention，其状态大小可独立于参数调整，并开发了高效的GPU内核。

Result: 实验表明，power attention在长上下文训练中优于指数注意力和线性注意力。

Conclusion: power attention是一种有效的长序列建模解决方案。

Abstract: We argue that neither transformers nor sub-quadratic architectures are well
suited to training at long sequence lengths: the cost of processing the context
is too expensive in the former, too inexpensive in the latter. Approaches such
as sliding window attention which reduce the cost-per-token of a transformer
impair in-context learning, and so are also unsuitable. To address these
limitations, we introduce power attention, an architectural layer for
linear-cost sequence modeling whose state size can be adjusted independently of
parameters, unlocking the advantages of linear attention on practical domains.
We develop and open-source a set of GPU kernels for efficient power attention,
identifying a novel pattern of operation fusion to avoid memory and bandwidth
bottlenecks. Our experiments on the in-context learning of power attention
shows that these models dominate both exponential attention and linear
attention at long-context training.

Conclusion: ACTOR是一种高效且鲁棒的训练框架，能显著减少过度拒绝问题。

Abstract: Safety alignment is crucial for large language models (LLMs) to resist

introduce ACTOR (Activation-Based Training for Over-Refusal Reduction), a
robust and compute- and data-efficient training framework that minimizes
over-refusals by leveraging internal activation patterns from diverse queries.
ACTOR precisely identifies and adjusts the activation components that trigger
refusals, providing stronger control over the refusal mechanism. By fine-tuning
only a single model layer, ACTOR effectively reduces over-refusals across
multiple benchmarks while maintaining the model's ability to handle harmful
queries and preserve overall utility.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key
enabling technology for aligning AI behavior with human preferences. The
traditional way to collect data in RLHF is via pairwise comparisons: human
raters are asked to indicate which one of two samples they prefer. We present
an interactive visualization that better exploits the human visual ability to
compare and explore whole groups of samples. The interface is comprised of two
linked views: 1) an exploration view showing a contextual overview of all
sampled behaviors organized in a hierarchical clustering structure; and 2) a
comparison view displaying two selected groups of behaviors for user queries.
Users can efficiently explore large sets of behaviors by iterating between
these two views. Additionally, we devised an active learning approach
suggesting groups for comparison. As shown by our evaluation in six simulated
robotics tasks, our approach increases the final policy returns by 69.34%. It
leads to lower error rates and better policies. We open-source the code that
can be easily integrated into the RLHF training loop, supporting research on
human-AI alignment.

Abstract: While attribution methods, such as Shapley values, are widely used to explain
the importance of features or training data in traditional machine learning,
their application to Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly within
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, is nascent and challenging. The
primary obstacle is the substantial computational cost, where each utility
function evaluation involves an expensive LLM call, resulting in direct
monetary and time expenses. This paper investigates the feasibility and
effectiveness of adapting Shapley-based attribution to identify influential
retrieved documents in RAG. We compare Shapley with more computationally
tractable approximations and some existing attribution methods for LLM. Our
work aims to: (1) systematically apply established attribution principles to
the RAG document-level setting; (2) quantify how well SHAP approximations can
mirror exact attributions while minimizing costly LLM interactions; and (3)
evaluate their practical explainability in identifying critical documents,
especially under complex inter-document relationships such as redundancy,
complementarity, and synergy. This study seeks to bridge the gap between
powerful attribution techniques and the practical constraints of LLM-based RAG
systems, offering insights into achieving reliable and affordable RAG
explainability.

Conclusion: LoSiA提供了一种高效且性能优越的PEFT方法，适用于资源受限场景。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, significantly
reduce the number of trainable parameters by introducing low-rank decomposition
matrices. However, existing methods perform extensive matrix multiplications in
domain specialization tasks, resulting in computational inefficiency and
sub-optimal fine-tuning performance. Hence, we propose LoSiA(Low-Resources
Subnet Integration Adaptation), an innovative method that dynamically localizes
and optimizes critical parameters during the training process. Specifically, it
identifies a sub-network using gradient sparsity analysis and optimizes it as
the trainable target. This design enables effective high-rank adaptation by
updating only the sub-network parameters, reducing the additional matrix
multiplication. We also present LoSiA-Pro, a faster implementation of LoSiA,
which reduces the training latency by about $27\%$ compared to LoRA. Extensive
evaluations show that our method achieves minimal performance drop compared to
full fine-tuning, while requiring the least training time across domain
specialization and common-sense reasoning tasks. Further analysis shows that
LoSiA also reduces forgetting during continued training.

Conclusion: DOTResize为Transformer压缩提供了有效且高效的新方法。

Abstract: Model compression offers a promising path to reducing the cost and
inaccessibility of large pre-trained models, without significantly compromising
their impressive performance. Large Transformer models, including large
language models (LLMs), often contain computational redundancy, which can serve
as a target for new model compression methods. In this work, we specifically
target neuron-level redundancies in model layers by combining groups of similar
neurons into fewer neurons. We frame this width reduction as a Discrete Optimal
Transport problem, and propose DOTResize, a novel Transformer compression
method that uses optimal transport theory to transform and compress model
weights. To ensure applicability within the Transformer architecture, we
motivate and incorporate entropic regularization and matrix factorization into
the transportation maps produced by our method. Unlike pruning-based approaches
which discard neurons based on importance measures, DOTResize re-projects the
entire neuron width, allowing the retention and redistribution of useful signal
across the reduced layer. Empirical results show that compared to simple or
state-of-the-art neuron width-pruning techniques, DOTResize can outperform
these methods across multiple LLM families and sizes, while achieving
measurable reductions in real-world computational cost.

Abstract: In-context learning enables transformer models to generalize to new tasks
based solely on input prompts, without any need for weight updates. However,
existing training paradigms typically rely on large, unstructured datasets that
are costly to store, difficult to evaluate for quality and balance, and pose
privacy and ethical concerns due to the inclusion of sensitive information.
Motivated by these limitations and risks, we propose an alternative training
strategy where we leverage a collection of multiple, small-scale, and
domain-specific datasets. We empirically demonstrate that the increased quality
and diversity of such data improve the generalization abilities of in-context
learners beyond their training domain, while achieving comparable performance
with models trained on a single large-scale dataset. We investigate this
paradigm by leveraging meta-learning to train an in-context learner on the
Meta-Album collection under several settings. Firstly, we show the performance
in a controlled environment, where the test domain is completely excluded from
the training knowledge. Secondly, we explore the robustness of these models to
forgetting in a continual scenario where the information is accessible for a
limited time. Finally, we explore the more challenging unsupervised scenario.
Our findings demonstrate that transformers still generalize for in-context
prediction when trained on a curated dataset collection while offering
advantages in modularity and replaceability.

Abstract: Recent advances have established a new machine learning paradigm based on
scaling up compute at inference time as well as at training time. In that line
of work, a combination of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on synthetic
demonstrations and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is
used for training Large Language Models to expend extra compute during
inference in the form of "thoughts" expressed in natural language. In this
paper, we propose to instead format these tokens as a multi-turn interaction
trace with a stateful tool. At each turn, the new state of the tool is appended
to the context of the model, whose job is to generate the tokens necessary to
control the tool via a custom DSL. We benchmark this approach on the problem of
repairing malfunctioning Python code, and show that this constrained setup
allows for faster sampling of experience and a denser reward signal, allowing
even models of size up to 3B parameters to learn how to proficiently expend
additional compute on the task.

Motivation: 现有语言模型基准测试在模型排名上存在矛盾，阻碍了模型选择和比较。研究旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 对24个基准测试和61个模型进行广泛的实证评估，采用'train-before-test'方法，即在评估前对模型进行统一的基准特定微调。

Result: 'train-before-test'显著提高了模型排名的一致性，减少了排名分歧，并揭示了基准性能的潜在因素。

Conclusion: 建议将'train-before-test'作为LLM基准测试的默认组成部分。

Abstract: Existing language model benchmarks provide contradictory model rankings, even
for benchmarks that aim to capture similar skills. This dilemma of conflicting
rankings hampers model selection, clouds model comparisons, and adds confusion
to a growing ecosystem of competing models. Recent work attributed ranking
disagreement to the phenomenon of training on the test task: As released,
different models exhibit a different level of preparation for any given test
task. A candidate solution to the problem is train-before-test: Give each model
the same benchmark-specific finetuning before evaluation. Our primary
contribution is a broad empirical evaluation of train-before-test across 24
benchmarks and 61 models. We show that train-before-test significantly improves
ranking agreement consistently across all benchmarks. Whereas rankings have
little external validity to start with, they enjoy a significant degree of
external validity when applying train-before-test: Model rankings transfer
gracefully from one benchmark to the other. Even within the same model family,
train-before-test reduces strong ranking disagreement to near-perfect
agreement. In addition, train-before-test reduces the model-score matrix to
essentially rank one, revealing new insights into the latent factors of
benchmark performance. Our work supports the recommendation to make
train-before-test a default component of LLM benchmarking.

Motivation: 随着LLM参数规模的增大，第三方推理服务日益流行，但存在数据隐私问题。现有安全方案（如SMPC）计算和通信开销大，难以扩展到大模型。

Method: 利用序列维度的分片技术，设计Cascade协议，平衡隐私保护与性能。

Result: Cascade能抵抗统计隐私攻击和学习型攻击，性能比现有方案快几个数量级。

Conclusion: Cascade为现代LLM的安全部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: As LLMs continue to increase in parameter size, the computational resources
required to run them are available to fewer parties. Therefore, third-party
inference services -- where LLMs are hosted by third parties with significant
computational resources -- are becoming increasingly popular. However, third
party inference raises critical concerns about user data privacy. To mitigate
these risks, privacy researchers have developed provably secure schemes for
third-party inference, such as Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC). However,
SMPC protocols have significant computational and communication overhead, and
do not scale to large models. In this work, we propose a new multi-party
inference protocol, Cascade, that avoids these punitive costs by leveraging
sharding in the sequence dimension to maintain privacy, trading off
cryptographic privacy guarantees for increased performance and scalability. We
demonstrate that Cascade is resistant to a generalization of a recent attack
that is highly effective against other statistical privacy schemes, and that it
is further resistant to learning-based attacks. As Cascade is orders of
magnitude faster than existing schemes, our findings offer practical solutions
for secure deployment of modern state-of-the-art LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and their agentic frameworks are increasingly
adopted to automate software development tasks such as issue resolution and
program repair. While prior work has identified security risks in LLM-generated
code, most evaluations have focused on synthetic or isolated settings, leaving
open questions about the security of these systems in real-world development
contexts. In this study, we present the first large-scale security analysis of
LLM-generated patches using 20,000+ issues from the SWE-bench dataset. We
evaluate patches produced by a standalone LLM (Llama 3.3) and compare them to
developer-written patches. We also assess the security of patches generated by
three top-performing agentic frameworks (OpenHands, AutoCodeRover, HoneyComb)
on a subset of our data. Finally, we analyze a wide range of code, issue, and
project-level factors to understand the conditions under which LLMs and agents
are most likely to generate insecure code. Our findings reveal that the
standalone LLM introduces nearly 9x more new vulnerabilities than developers,
with many of these exhibiting unique patterns not found in developers' code.
Agentic workflows also generate a significant number of vulnerabilities,
particularly when granting LLMs more autonomy, potentially increasing the
likelihood of misinterpreting project context or task requirements. We find
that vulnerabilities are more likely to occur in LLM patches associated with a
higher number of files, more lines of generated code, and GitHub issues that
lack specific code snippets or information about the expected code behavior and
steps to reproduce. These results suggest that contextual factors play a
critical role in the security of the generated code and point toward the need
for proactive risk assessment methods that account for both code and
issue-level information to complement existing vulnerability detection tools.

Conclusion: 该方法在实际应用中有效，如在稀疏奖励环境中学习导航策略。

Abstract: Human guidance has emerged as a powerful tool for enhancing reinforcement
learning (RL). However, conventional forms of guidance such as demonstrations
or binary scalar feedback can be challenging to collect or have low information
content, motivating the exploration of other forms of human input. Among these,
relative feedback (i.e., feedback on how to improve an action, such as "more to
the left") offers a good balance between usability and information richness.
Previous research has shown that relative feedback can be used to enhance
policy search methods. However, these efforts have been limited to specific
policy classes and use feedback inefficiently. In this work, we introduce a
novel method to learn from relative feedback and combine it with off-policy
reinforcement learning. Through evaluations on two sparse-reward tasks, we
demonstrate our method can be used to improve the sample efficiency of
reinforcement learning by guiding its exploration process. Additionally, we
show it can adapt a policy to changes in the environment or the user's
preferences. Finally, we demonstrate real-world applicability by employing our
approach to learn a navigation policy in a sparse reward setting.

Conclusion: 该方法成功平衡了表达性与结构，为生成模型的设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: In designing generative models, it is commonly believed that in order to
learn useful latent structure, we face a fundamental tension between
expressivity and structure. In this paper we challenge this view by proposing a
new approach to training arbitrarily expressive generative models that
simultaneously learn disentangled latent structure. This is accomplished by
adding a simple decoder-only module to the head of an existing decoder block
that can be arbitrarily complex. The module learns to process concept
information by implicitly inverting linear representations from an encoder.
Inspired by the notion of intervention in causal graphical models, our module
selectively modifies its architecture during training, allowing it to learn a
compact joint model over different contexts. We show how adding this module
leads to disentangled representations that can be composed for
out-of-distribution generation. To further validate our proposed approach, we
prove a new identifiability result that extends existing work on identifying
structured representations in nonlinear models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can enhance analytics systems with powerful data
summarization, cleaning, and semantic transformation capabilities. However,
deploying LLMs at scale -- processing millions to billions of rows -- remains
prohibitively expensive in computation and memory. We present IOLM-DB, a novel
system that makes LLM-enhanced database queries practical through
query-specific model optimization. Instead of using general-purpose LLMs,
IOLM-DB generates lightweight, specialized models tailored to each query's
specific needs using representative data samples. IOLM-DB reduces model
footprints by up to 76% and increases throughput by up to 3.31$\times$ while
maintaining accuracy through aggressive compression techniques, including
quantization, sparsification, and structural pruning. We further show how our
approach enables higher parallelism on existing hardware and seamlessly
supports caching and batching strategies to reduce overheads. Our prototype
demonstrates that leveraging LLM queries inside analytics systems is feasible
at scale, opening new possibilities for future OLAP applications.

Conclusion: GSOP通过精确修剪冗余操作，实现了高效的计算与性能平衡，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Prior Vision Language Model (VLM) token pruning reduces computation by
eliminating attention and feed-forward operations for pruned tokens while
maintaining all operations for critical tokens. However, this binary approach
conflates token/operation redundancy - critical operations may be removed along
with discarded tokens, while preserved tokens retain all potentially redundant
operations. To surgically eliminate redundant operations while preserving
critical ones, we propose Greedily Sorted Operation Pruning (GSOP), a
data-driven method that directly prunes operations rather than tokens. GSOP
first decomposes a VLM decoder's computations into atomic operations along
three dimensions: token groups, layer positions, and computation modules. GSOP
determines the pruning order of operations through greedy sorting: GSOP
iteratively selects the redundant operation that incurs minimal performance
drop considering previously pruned operations. Different computational budgets
can be accommodated without re-searching by simply pruning operations according
to this order until the desired budget is met. GSOP enhances sorting efficiency
through: a) leveraging historical operation rankings to avoid redundant
evaluations; b) excluding the ``free-to-prune" and ``danger-to-prune"
operations from sorting. GSOP achieves compelling efficiency-performance
tradeoffs, reducing computation by 70% with only 4% performance loss while
maintaining up to 18% higher performance than state-of-the-art methods when
transferred across diverse VLMs and tasks. Real GPU efficiency evaluations
confirm its practical value. The code is in

We analyzed thousands of physician-submitted questions using a comparative

retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system based on novel observational
studies, and (2) two PubMed-based retrieval-augmented systems (System and
Perplexity). We found that PubMed-based systems provided evidence-supported
answers for approximately 44% of questions, while the novel evidence source did
so for about 50%. Combined, these sources enabled reliable answers to over 70%
of biomedical queries. As LLMs become increasingly capable of summarizing
scientific content, maximizing their value will require systems that can
accurately retrieve both published and custom-generated evidence or generate
such evidence in real time.

Result: 完美对齐是数学上不可能的，需重新思考如何在不可控性存在下安全操作。

Conclusion: UAT安全性的核心问题应从追求完美控制转向在不可控性下安全操作。

Abstract: We establish fundamental mathematical limits on universal approximation
theorem (UAT) system alignment by proving that catastrophic failures are an
inescapable feature of any useful computational system. Our central thesis is
that for any universal approximator, the expressive power required for useful
computation is inextricably linked to a dense set of instabilities that make
perfect, reliable control a mathematical impossibility. We prove this through a
three-level argument that leaves no escape routes for any class of universal
approximator architecture. i) Combinatorial Necessity: For the vast majority of
practical universal approximators (e.g., those using ReLU activations), we
prove that the density of catastrophic failure points is directly proportional
to the network's expressive power. ii) Topological Necessity: For any
theoretical universal approximator, we use singularity theory to prove that the
ability to approximate generic functions requires the ability to implement the
dense, catastrophic singularities that characterize them. iii) Empirical
Necessity: We prove that the universal existence of adversarial examples is
empirical evidence that real-world tasks are themselves catastrophic, forcing
any successful model to learn and replicate these instabilities. These results,
combined with a quantitative "Impossibility Sandwich" showing that the minimum
complexity for usefulness exceeds the maximum complexity for safety,
demonstrate that perfect alignment is not an engineering challenge but a
mathematical impossibility. This foundational result reframes UAT safety from a
problem of "how to achieve perfect control" to one of "how to operate safely in
the presence of irreducible uncontrollability," with profound implications for
the future of UAT development and governance.

Abstract: The (generative) artificial intelligence (AI) era has profoundly reshaped the
meaning and value of data. No longer confined to static content, data now
permeates every stage of the AI lifecycle from the training samples that shape
model parameters to the prompts and outputs that drive real-world model
deployment. This shift renders traditional notions of data protection
insufficient, while the boundaries of what needs safeguarding remain poorly
defined. Failing to safeguard data in AI systems can inflict societal and
individual, underscoring the urgent need to clearly delineate the scope of and
rigorously enforce data protection. In this perspective, we propose a
four-level taxonomy, including non-usability, privacy preservation,
traceability, and deletability, that captures the diverse protection needs
arising in modern (generative) AI models and systems. Our framework offers a
structured understanding of the trade-offs between data utility and control,
spanning the entire AI pipeline, including training datasets, model weights,
system prompts, and AI-generated content. We analyze representative technical
approaches at each level and reveal regulatory blind spots that leave critical
assets exposed. By offering a structured lens to align future AI technologies
and governance with trustworthy data practices, we underscore the urgency of
rethinking data protection for modern AI techniques and provide timely guidance
for developers, researchers, and regulators alike.

  We introduce a specification language that can model many common algorithmic
fairness properties, such as demographic parity, equal opportunity, and social
burden.
  We build monitors that observe a long sequence of events as generated by a
given system, and output, after each observation, a quantitative estimate of
how fair or biased the system was on that run until that point in time.
  The estimate is proven to be correct modulo a variable error bound and a
given confidence level, where the error bound gets tighter as the observed
sequence gets longer.
  We present two categories of monitoring algorithms, namely ones with a
uniform error bound across all time points, and ones with weaker non-uniform,
pointwise error bounds at different time points.
  Our monitoring algorithms use statistical tools that are adapted to suit the
dynamic requirements of monitoring and the special needs of the fairness
specifications.
  Using a prototype implementation, we show how we can monitor if a bank is
fair in giving loans to applicants from different social backgrounds, and if a
college is fair in admitting students while maintaining a reasonable financial

Abstract: The use of reinforcement learning (RL) methods to support health behavior
change via personalized and just-in-time adaptive interventions is of
significant interest to health and behavioral science researchers focused on
problems such as smoking cessation support and physical activity promotion.
However, RL methods are often applied to these domains using a small collection
of context variables to mitigate the significant data scarcity issues that
arise from practical limitations on the design of adaptive intervention trials.
In this paper, we explore an approach to significantly expanding the state
space of an adaptive intervention without impacting data efficiency. The
proposed approach enables intervention participants to provide natural language
descriptions of aspects of their current state. It then leverages inference
with pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to better align the policy of a
base RL method with these state descriptions. To evaluate our method, we
develop a novel physical activity intervention simulation environment that
generates text-based state descriptions conditioned on latent state variables
using an auxiliary LLM. We show that this approach has the potential to
significantly improve the performance of online policy learning methods.

existing approaches to representation learning, GPI does not require

mechanisms in terms of their equivariance properties with respect to

Conclusion: 结合专家演示和模拟器重置功能，通过优化起始状态分布和安全性概念，可显著提升在线RL的样本效率。

Abstract: A long-standing problem in online reinforcement learning (RL) is of ensuring
sample efficiency, which stems from an inability to explore environments
efficiently. Most attempts at efficient exploration tackle this problem in a
setting where learning begins from scratch, without prior information available
to bootstrap learning. However, such approaches fail to leverage expert
demonstrations and simulators that can reset to arbitrary states. These
affordances are valuable resources that offer enormous potential to guide
exploration and speed up learning. In this paper, we explore how a small number
of expert demonstrations and a simulator allowing arbitrary resets can
accelerate learning during online RL. We find that training with a suitable
choice of an auxiliary start state distribution that may differ from the true
start state distribution of the underlying Markov Decision Process can
significantly improve sample efficiency. We find that using a notion of safety
to inform the choice of this auxiliary distribution significantly accelerates
learning. By using episode length information as a way to operationalize this
notion, we demonstrate state-of-the-art sample efficiency on a sparse-reward
hard-exploration environment.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
advancements in numerous areas such as multimedia. However, hallucination
issues significantly limit their credibility and application potential.
Existing mitigation methods typically rely on external tools or the comparison
of multi-round inference, which significantly increase inference time. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{SE}lf-\textbf{E}volving \textbf{D}istillation
(\textbf{SEED}), which identifies hallucinations within the inner knowledge of
LVLMs, isolates and purges them, and then distills the purified knowledge back
into the model, enabling self-evolution. Furthermore, we identified that
traditional distillation methods are prone to inducing void spaces in the
output space of LVLMs. To address this issue, we propose a Mode-Seeking
Evolving approach, which performs distillation to capture the dominant modes of
the purified knowledge distribution, thereby avoiding the chaotic results that
could emerge from void spaces. Moreover, we introduce a Hallucination
Elimination Adapter, which corrects the dark knowledge of the original model by
learning purified knowledge. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks
validate the superiority of our SEED, demonstrating substantial improvements in
mitigating hallucinations for representative LVLM models such as LLaVA-1.5 and
InternVL2. Remarkably, the F1 score of LLaVA-1.5 on the hallucination
evaluation metric POPE-Random improved from 81.3 to 88.3.

Abstract: Generative AI technology based on Large Language Models (LLM) has been
developed and applied to assist or automatically generate program codes. In
this paper, we evaluate the capability of existing general LLMs for Basic
Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) code generation for CPUs. We use two LLMs
provided by OpenAI: GPT-4.1, a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model,
and o4-mini, one of the o-series of Reasoning models. Both have been released
in April 2025. For the routines from level-1 to 3 BLAS, we tried to generate
(1) C code without optimization from routine name only, (2) C code with basic
performance optimizations (thread parallelization, SIMD vectorization, and
cache blocking) from routine name only, and (3) C code with basic performance
optimizations based on Fortran reference code. As a result, we found that
correct code can be generated in many cases even when only routine name are
given. We also confirmed that thread parallelization with OpenMP, SIMD
vectorization, and cache blocking can be implemented to some extent, and that
the code is faster than the reference code.

Abstract: Deploying language models (LMs) in customer-facing speech applications
requires conversational fluency and adherence to specific stylistic guidelines.
This can be challenging to achieve reliably using complex system prompts due to
issues like instruction following limitations and in-context bias. This study
investigates the effectiveness of fine-tuning versus system prompting for
aligning LMs with a specific behavioral target: responding in a natural,
conversational tone suitable for voice interactions. We fine-tuned a small,
open-weights model (`Llama3.2-1B-Instruct`) using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on
a synthetically generated dataset derived from Wikipedia. Additionally, we
fine-tuned two closed-source models (`gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-4.1-mini`). Our
results demonstrate that fine-tuning outperformed system prompting, achieving a
high percentage of conversational responses, even when trained on only 100 data
samples. Semantic similarity analysis confirmed that fine-tuning did not
degrade content quality. Interestingly, fine-tuning with 8-bit integer
quantization converged faster towards the target style than using bfloat16
precision, potentially due to implicit regularization effects. We conclude that
fine-tuning small, open-weights LMs on simulated data is a highly effective and
data-efficient method for instilling specific stylistic behaviors, offering a
preferable alternative to complex system prompting for practical applications
requiring nuanced response styles.

Result: Threshold Selection方法在不影响摘要质量的情况下有效提升了主题聚焦性。

Conclusion: 直接重新加权logits是一种实用且资源高效的方法，可用于精确控制生成文本的主题内容。

Abstract: Generating abstractive summaries that adhere to a specific topic remains a
significant challenge for language models. While standard approaches, such as
fine-tuning, are resource-intensive, simpler methods like prompt engineering
often struggle to maintain topical focus, particularly with smaller models. To
address this, we propose a lightweight method that enhances topical relevance
by directly reweighting the logits of topic-relevant tokens during generation.
We evaluate three such reweighting techniques: Constant Shift, which adds a
constant value to logits; Factor Scaling, which multiplies them by a factor;
and Threshold Selection, which selectively boosts logits that exceed a
probability threshold. Experiments on the NEWTS topical summarization dataset,
using both Gemma-2B and Llama-3-8B models, show that these techniques
effectively increase the use of topic-relevant vocabulary. Notably, the
Threshold Selection method successfully improves topical focus without
compromising summary quality-a trade-off often seen in other approaches. Our
findings demonstrate that directly reweighting logits is a practical and
resource-efficient alternative to fine-tuning, offering a promising pathway for
precisely controlling the thematic content of generated text.

Motivation: 由于Transformer模型（如LLMs）在安全关键领域的广泛应用及其高价值，保护模型和数据在MLaaS环境中的安全至关重要。现有TEE方案效率低，无法安全卸载关键操作。

Method: 提出TwinShield框架，支持在TEE和GPU之间安全卸载约87%的计算，尤其是Attention和SoftMax操作。

Result: TwinShield在多种Transformer模型上比现有方法快4.0x-6.1x。

Conclusion: TwinShield解决了Transformer推理中的安全和效率问题，为MLaaS提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Transformer models, e.g., large language models (LLMs),
have brought tremendous breakthroughs in various artificial intelligence (AI)
tasks, leading to their wide applications in many security-critical domains.
Due to their unprecedented scale and prohibitively high development cost, these
models have become highly valuable intellectual property for AI stakeholders
and are increasingly deployed via machine learning as a service (MLaaS).
However, MLaaS often runs on untrusted cloud infrastructure, exposing data and
models to potential breaches. Mainstream protection mechanisms leverage trusted
execution environments (TEEs) where confidentiality and integrity for secretive
data are shielded using hardware-based encryption and integrity checking.
Unfortunately, running model inference entirely within TEEs is subject to
non-trivial slowdown, which is further exacerbated in LLMs due to the
substantial computation and memory footprint involved. Recent studies reveal
that the hybrid TEE-based scheme offloading partial model inference operations
to the untrusted accelerators (e.g., GPU) is a promising solution. However,
prior offloading schemes fail to ensure dual protection of data and model in
Transformer inference, as they cannot securely offload critical operations,
i.e., Attention and SoftMax, forcing these computations to remain confined
within TEEs. To address these challenges, we propose TwinShield, a framework
enabling secure Transformer inference in heterogeneous TEE and accelerator
systems with dual protection for both model and data. TwinShield offloads ~87%
of computation to GPUs and delivers 4.0x - 6.1x speedups over previous
approaches across various Transformer models.

Conclusion: 利用任务间因果关系可提升课程强化学习的结构意识和样本效率。

Abstract: Designing effective task sequences is crucial for curriculum reinforcement
learning (CRL), where agents must gradually acquire skills by training on
intermediate tasks. A key challenge in CRL is to identify tasks that promote
exploration, yet are similar enough to support effective transfer. While recent
approach suggests comparing tasks via their Structural Causal Models (SCMs),
the method requires access to ground-truth causal structures, an unrealistic
assumption in most RL settings. In this work, we propose Causal-Paced Deep
Reinforcement Learning (CP-DRL), a curriculum learning framework aware of SCM
differences between tasks based on interaction data approximation. This signal
captures task novelty, which we combine with the agent's learnability, measured
by reward gain, to form a unified objective. Empirically, CP-DRL outperforms
existing curriculum methods on the Point Mass benchmark, achieving faster
convergence and higher returns. CP-DRL demonstrates reduced variance with
comparable final returns in the Bipedal Walker-Trivial setting, and achieves
the highest average performance in the Infeasible variant. These results
indicate that leveraging causal relationships between tasks can improve the
structure-awareness and sample efficiency of curriculum reinforcement learning.
We provide the full implementation of CP-DRL to facilitate the reproduction of

Abstract: Transfer learning in Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables agents to leverage

transfer. GATN employs a domain-agnostic representation module, a
robustness-aware policy adapter, and an efficient transfer scheduler to achieve
these goals. We evaluate GATN on diverse benchmarks, including Atari 2600,
MuJoCo, and a custom chatbot dialogue environment, demonstrating superior

GATN is a versatile framework for real-world RL applications, such as adaptive

Abstract: Transfer learning has become an essential paradigm in artificial

performance on a target task. This approach, particularly through techniques
such as pretraining and fine-tuning, has seen significant success in fields

a challenge. Understanding the theoretical underpinnings of each
transferability metric is critical for ensuring the success of transfer
learning. In this survey, we provide a unified taxonomy of transferability
metrics, categorizing them based on transferable knowledge types and
measurement granularity. This work examines the various metrics developed to
evaluate the potential of source knowledge for transfer learning and their
applicability across different learning paradigms emphasizing the need for
careful selection of these metrics. By offering insights into how different
metrics work under varying conditions, this survey aims to guide researchers
and practitioners in selecting the most appropriate metric for specific
applications, contributing to more efficient, reliable, and trustworthy AI

transferability metrics in trustworthy transfer learning.

Abstract: Sharpness-aware Minimization (SAM) improves generalization in large-scale
model training by linking loss landscape geometry to generalization. However,
challenges such as mislabeled noisy data and privacy concerns have emerged as
significant issues. Data attribution, which identifies the contributions of
specific training samples, offers a promising solution. However, directly
rendering existing data influence evaluation tools such as influence functions
(IF) to SAM will be inapplicable or inaccurate as SAM utilizes an inner loop to
find model perturbations that maximize loss, which the outer loop then
minimizes, resulting in a doubled computational structure. Additionally, this
bilevel structure complicates the modeling of data influence on the parameters.
In this paper, based on the IF, we develop two innovative data valuation
methods for SAM, each offering unique benefits in different scenarios: the
Hessian-based IF and the Gradient Trajectory-based IF. The first one provides a
comprehensive estimation of data influence using a closed-form measure that
relies only on the trained model weights. In contrast, the other IF for SAM
utilizes gradient trajectory information during training for more accurate and
efficient data assessment. Extensive experiments demonstrate their
effectiveness in data evaluation and parameter tuning, with applications in
identifying mislabeled data, model editing, and enhancing interpretability.

Result: 实验证明ATEsc能有效提升DFKD对NTL教师的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ATEsc为DFKD在面对NTL教师时提供了一种有效的解决方案，提升了知识迁移的效果。

Abstract: Data-free knowledge distillation (DFKD) transfers knowledge from a teacher to
a student without access the real in-distribution (ID) data. Its common
solution is to use a generator to synthesize fake data and use them as a
substitute for real ID data. However, existing works typically assume teachers
are trustworthy, leaving the robustness and security of DFKD from untrusted
teachers largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct the first investigation
into distilling non-transferable learning (NTL) teachers using DFKD, where the
transferability from an ID domain to an out-of-distribution (OOD) domain is
prohibited. We find that NTL teachers fool DFKD through divert the generator's
attention from the useful ID knowledge to the misleading OOD knowledge. This
hinders ID knowledge transfer but prioritizes OOD knowledge transfer. To
mitigate this issue, we propose Adversarial Trap Escaping (ATEsc) to benefit
DFKD by identifying and filtering out OOD-like synthetic samples. Specifically,
inspired by the evidence that NTL teachers show stronger adversarial robustness
on OOD samples than ID samples, we split synthetic samples into two groups
according to their robustness. The fragile group is treated as ID-like data and
used for normal knowledge distillation, while the robust group is seen as
OOD-like data and utilized for forgetting OOD knowledge. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of ATEsc for improving DFKD against NTL teachers.

the task into a hierarchy of subgoals. The main challenge of HRL is efficient
discovery of the hierarchical structure among subgoals and utilizing this
structure to achieve the final goal. We address this challenge by modeling the
subgoal structure as a causal graph and propose a causal discovery algorithm to
learn it. Additionally, rather than intervening on the subgoals at random
during exploration, we harness the discovered causal model to prioritize
subgoal interventions based on their importance in attaining the final goal.
These targeted interventions result in a significantly more efficient policy in
terms of the training cost. Unlike previous work on causal HRL, which lacked
theoretical analysis, we provide a formal analysis of the problem.
Specifically, for tree structures and, for a variant of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi
random graphs, our approach results in remarkable improvements. Our
experimental results on HRL tasks also illustrate that our proposed framework
outperforms existing work in terms of training cost.

Conclusion: VGD条件在多个标准环境中具有实际相关性，为策略学习提供了新的理论支持。

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) in the agnostic policy learning setting,
where the goal is to find a policy whose performance is competitive with the
best policy in a given class of interest $\Pi$ -- crucially, without assuming
that $\Pi$ contains the optimal policy. We propose a general policy learning
framework that reduces this problem to first-order optimization in a
non-Euclidean space, leading to new algorithms as well as shedding light on the
convergence properties of existing ones. Specifically, under the assumption
that $\Pi$ is convex and satisfies a variational gradient dominance (VGD)
condition -- an assumption known to be strictly weaker than more standard
completeness and coverability conditions -- we obtain sample complexity upper
bounds for three policy learning algorithms: \emph{(i)} Steepest Descent Policy
Optimization, derived from a constrained steepest descent method for non-convex
optimization; \emph{(ii)} the classical Conservative Policy Iteration algorithm
\citep{kakade2002approximately} reinterpreted through the lens of the
Frank-Wolfe method, which leads to improved convergence results; and
\emph{(iii)} an on-policy instantiation of the well-studied Policy Mirror
Descent algorithm. Finally, we empirically evaluate the VGD condition across
several standard environments, demonstrating the practical relevance of our key
assumption.

Method: 提出Soft Weight Rescaling (SWR)方法，通过在每一步学习过程中缩放权重，防止无界增长并保持信息。

Result: 实验表明，SWR在热启动学习、持续学习和单任务学习等标准图像分类任务中提升了性能。

Conclusion: SWR是一种简单有效的方法，能够在不丢失信息的情况下恢复网络的塑性，并改善训练动态。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that as training progresses, neural networks
gradually lose their capacity to learn new information, a phenomenon known as
plasticity loss. An unbounded weight growth is one of the main causes of
plasticity loss. Furthermore, it harms generalization capability and disrupts
optimization dynamics. Re-initializing the network can be a solution, but it
results in the loss of learned information, leading to performance drops. In
this paper, we propose Soft Weight Rescaling (SWR), a novel approach that
prevents unbounded weight growth without losing information. SWR recovers the
plasticity of the network by simply scaling down the weight at each step of the
learning process. We theoretically prove that SWR bounds weight magnitude and
balances weight magnitude between layers. Our experiment shows that SWR
improves performance on warm-start learning, continual learning, and
single-task learning setups on standard image classification benchmarks.

Abstract: Urban general intelligence (UGI) refers to the capacity of AI systems to
autonomously perceive, reason, and act within dynamic and complex urban
environments. In this paper, we introduce UrbanMind, a tool-enhanced
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework designed to facilitate UGI.
Central to UrbanMind is a novel architecture based on Continual
Retrieval-Augmented MoE-based LLM (C-RAG-LLM), which dynamically incorporates
domain-specific knowledge and evolving urban data to support long-term
adaptability. The architecture of C-RAG-LLM aligns naturally with a multilevel
optimization framework, where different layers are treated as interdependent
sub-problems. Each layer has distinct objectives and can be optimized either
independently or jointly through a hierarchical learning process. The framework
is highly flexible, supporting both end-to-end training and partial layer-wise
optimization based on resource or deployment constraints. To remain adaptive
under data drift, it is further integrated with an incremental corpus updating
mechanism. Evaluations on real-world urban tasks of a variety of complexity
verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. This work presents a
promising step toward the realization of general-purpose LLM agents in future
urban environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in domains
such as mathematics and programming, yet their capabilities in physics remain
underexplored and poorly understood. Physics poses unique challenges that
demand not only precise computation but also deep conceptual understanding and
physical modeling skills. Existing benchmarks often fall short due to limited
difficulty, multiple-choice formats, and static evaluation settings that fail
to capture physical modeling ability. In this paper, we introduce
ABench-Physics, a novel benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate LLMs'
physical reasoning and generalization capabilities. ABench-Physics consists of
two components: Phy_A, a static set of 400 graduate- or Olympiad-level
problems; and Phy_B, a dynamic subset of 100 problems equipped with an
automatic variation engine to test model robustness across changing conditions.
All questions require precise numerical answers, with strict formatting and
tolerance constraints. Our evaluation of several state-of-the-art LLMs reveals
substantial performance gaps, highlighting persistent limitations in physical
reasoning, especially in generalization to dynamic variants. ABench-Physics
provides a challenging and diagnostic framework for advancing scientific
reasoning in LLMs.

Conclusion: 该方法在小数据集上训练更可靠和准确的分类模型方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Acquiring and training on large-scale labeled data can be impractical due to
cost constraints. Additionally, the use of small training datasets can result
in considerable variability in model outcomes, overfitting, and learning of
spurious correlations. A crucial shortcoming of data labels is their lack of
any reasoning behind a specific label assignment, causing models to learn any
arbitrary classification rule as long as it aligns data with labels. To
overcome these issues, we introduce an innovative approach for training
reliable classification models on smaller datasets, by using simple explanation
signals such as important input features from labeled data. Our method centers
around a two-stage training cycle that alternates between enhancing model
prediction accuracy and refining its attention to match the explanations. This
instructs models to grasp the rationale behind label assignments during their
learning phase. We demonstrate that our training cycle expedites the
convergence towards more accurate and reliable models, particularly for small,
class-imbalanced training data, or data with spurious features.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have demonstrated great promise in modeling various
sequence data, ranging from human language to biological sequences. Inspired by
the success of RL in language models, there is growing interest in further
improving the models by alignment with a certain reward. In this work, we
propose a novel preference optimization method for masked discrete diffusion
models through a principled diffusion trajectory alignment. Instead of applying
the reward on the final output and backpropagating the gradient to the entire
discrete denoising process, we decompose the problem into a set of stepwise
alignment objectives. This framework enables efficient diffusion optimization,
is compatible with arbitrary reward functions, and importantly, guarantees an
equivalent optimal solution under additive factorization of the trajectory
reward. Experiments across multiple domains including DNA sequence design,
protein inverse folding, and language modeling consistently demonstrate the
superiority of our approach. Notably, it achieves an up to 12\% improvement
over the most competitive RL-based baseline in terms of predicted activity on
DNA sequence design, and further improves the GSM8K score from 78.6 to 80.7 on
LLaDA-8B-Instruct for language modeling.

Conclusion: 研究挑战了当前后门攻击的研究方向，强调了开发更鲁棒防御的紧迫性。

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) systems are increasingly used in
safety-critical applications, yet their security remains severely
underexplored. This work investigates backdoor attacks, which implant hidden
triggers that cause malicious actions only when specific inputs appear in the
observation space. Existing DRL backdoor research focuses solely on
training-time attacks requiring unrealistic access to the training pipeline. In
contrast, we reveal critical vulnerabilities across the DRL supply chain where
backdoors can be embedded with significantly reduced adversarial privileges. We
introduce two novel attacks: (1) TrojanentRL, which exploits component-level
flaws to implant a persistent backdoor that survives full model retraining; and
(2) InfrectroRL, a post-training backdoor attack which requires no access to
training, validation, nor test data. Empirical and analytical evaluations
across six Atari environments show our attacks rival state-of-the-art
training-time backdoor attacks while operating under much stricter adversarial
constraints. We also demonstrate that InfrectroRL further evades two leading
DRL backdoor defenses. These findings challenge the current research focus and
highlight the urgent need for robust defenses.

Conclusion: 仅依赖性能扩展不足以理解神经网络的底层机制，需结合内部动态分析；特征学习在有限宽度模型中存在临界点。

Abstract: Scaling laws offer valuable insights into the relationship between neural
network performance and computational cost, yet their underlying mechanisms
remain poorly understood. In this work, we empirically analyze how neural
networks behave under data and model scaling through the lens of the neural
tangent kernel (NTK). This analysis establishes a link between performance
scaling and the internal dynamics of neural networks. Our findings of standard
vision tasks show that similar performance scaling exponents can occur even
though the internal model dynamics show opposite behavior. This demonstrates
that performance scaling alone is insufficient for understanding the underlying
mechanisms of neural networks. We also address a previously unresolved issue in
neural scaling: how convergence to the infinite-width limit affects scaling
behavior in finite-width models. To this end, we investigate how feature
learning is lost as the model width increases and quantify the transition
between kernel-driven and feature-driven scaling regimes. We identify the
maximum model width that supports feature learning, which, in our setups, we
find to be more than ten times smaller than typical large language model
widths.

Abstract: We present a modular framework powered by large language models (LLMs) that

discovery pipeline. By combining LLM reasoning with domain-specific tools, the
framework performs biomedical data retrieval, domain-specific question
answering, molecular generation, property prediction, property-aware molecular
refinement, and 3D protein-ligand structure generation. In a case study
targeting BCL-2 in lymphocytic leukemia, the agent autonomously retrieved
relevant biomolecular information-including FASTA sequences, SMILES
representations, and literature-and answered mechanistic questions with
improved contextual accuracy over standard LLMs. It then generated chemically
diverse seed molecules and predicted 67 ADMET-related properties, which guided
iterative molecular refinement. Across two refinement rounds, the number of
molecules with QED > 0.6 increased from 34 to 55, and those passing at least
four out of five empirical drug-likeness rules rose from 29 to 52, within a
pool of 194 molecules. The framework also employed Boltz-2 to generate 3D
protein-ligand complexes and provide rapid binding affinity estimates for
candidate compounds. These results demonstrate that the approach effectively
supports molecular screening, prioritization, and structure evaluation. Its
modular design enables flexible integration of evolving tools and models,
providing a scalable foundation for AI-assisted therapeutic discovery.

Abstract: Medical Image Grounding (MIG), which involves localizing specific regions in
medical images based on textual descriptions, requires models to not only
perceive regions but also deduce spatial relationships of these regions.
Existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for MIG often rely on Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) with large amounts of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning
annotations, which are expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Recently,
DeepSeek-R1 demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) can acquire
reasoning abilities through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) without
requiring CoT annotations. In this paper, we adapt the GRPO reinforcement
learning framework to VLMs for Medical Image Grounding. We propose the
Spatial-Semantic Rewarded Group Relative Policy Optimization to train the model
without CoT reasoning annotations. Specifically, we introduce Spatial-Semantic
Rewards, which combine spatial accuracy reward and semantic consistency reward
to provide nuanced feedback for both spatially positive and negative
completions. Additionally, we propose to use the Chain-of-Box template, which
integrates visual information of referring bounding boxes into the <think>
reasoning process, enabling the model to explicitly reason about spatial
regions during intermediate steps. Experiments on three datasets MS-CXR,
ChestX-ray8, and M3D-RefSeg demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in Medical Image Grounding. Ablation studies
further validate the effectiveness of each component in our approach. Code,

Abstract: Despite years of research and the dramatic scaling of artificial intelligence
(AI) systems, a striking misalignment between artificial and human vision
persists. Contrary to humans, AI heavily relies on texture-features rather than
shape information, lacks robustness to image distortions, remains highly
vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and struggles to recognise simple abstract
shapes within complex backgrounds. To close this gap, we here introduce a
solution that arises from a previously underexplored direction: rather than
scaling up, we take inspiration from how human vision develops from early
infancy into adulthood. We quantified the visual maturation by synthesising
decades of psychophysical and neurophysiological research into a novel
developmental visual diet (DVD) for AI vision. We show that guiding AI systems
through this human-inspired curriculum produces models that closely align with
human behaviour on every hallmark of robust vision tested yielding the
strongest reported reliance on shape information to date, abstract shape
recognition beyond the state of the art, higher robustness to image
corruptions, and stronger resilience to adversarial attacks. By outperforming
high parameter AI foundation models trained on orders of magnitude more data,
we provide evidence that robust AI vision can be achieved by guiding the way
how a model learns, not merely how much it learns, offering a
resource-efficient route toward safer and more human-like artificial visual
systems.

Abstract: To be effective, efficient, and diverse, deep learning models need to
dynamically choose its architecture based on signals from a population of

inhibition in those neural populations. This means signals commonly shared
among the various modes of data statistics can be inhibited so that the routing
model can choose a specialized expert path for each data sample. Only through
inhibition is the routing mechanism able to effectively select neural pathways.
We believe this is an under-studied and under-verified implementation
methodology for Mixture-of-Experts, dynamic routing, and transformer language
models. We provide experimental evidence that the neural inhibition algorithm
significantly boosts the performance of general tasks and motivates more effort
to be invested in this research direction.

Conclusion: Dyn-O在复杂环境中表现出色，通过解耦特征实现了更精细的操控和多样化的轨迹生成。

Abstract: World models aim to capture the dynamics of the environment, enabling agents
to predict and plan for future states. In most scenarios of interest, the
dynamics are highly centered on interactions among objects within the
environment. This motivates the development of world models that operate on
object-centric rather than monolithic representations, with the goal of more
effectively capturing environment dynamics and enhancing compositional
generalization. However, the development of object-centric world models has
largely been explored in environments with limited visual complexity (such as
basic geometries). It remains underexplored whether such models can generalize
to more complex settings with diverse textures and cluttered scenes. In this
paper, we fill this gap by introducing Dyn-O, an enhanced structured world
model built upon object-centric representations. Compared to prior work in
object-centric representations, Dyn-O improves in both learning representations
and modeling dynamics. On the challenging Procgen games, we find that our
method can learn object-centric world models directly from pixel observations,
outperforming DreamerV3 in rollout prediction accuracy. Furthermore, by
decoupling object-centric features into dynamics-agnostic and dynamics-aware
components, we enable finer-grained manipulation of these features and generate
more diverse imagined trajectories.

Abstract: Machine Learning is a diverse field applied across various domains such as
computer science, social sciences, medicine, chemistry, and finance. This
diversity results in varied evaluation approaches, making it difficult to
compare models effectively. Absolute evaluation measures offer a practical
solution by assessing a model's performance on a fixed scale, independent of
reference models and data ranges, enabling explicit comparisons. However, many
commonly used measures are not universally applicable, leading to a lack of
comprehensive guidance on their appropriate use. This survey addresses this gap
by providing an overview of absolute evaluation metrics in ML, organized by the
type of learning problem. While classification metrics have been extensively
studied, this work also covers clustering, regression, and ranking metrics. By
grouping these measures according to the specific ML challenges they address,
this survey aims to equip practitioners with the tools necessary to select
appropriate metrics for their models. The provided overview thus improves

Programming (OOP) principles, providing a clear structure that simplifies the

the entry barrier for deep RL research by organizing best practices into
explicit, clearly separated components, making them easier to understand and

RL concepts and methods that intuitively reflect their interactions. The class
hierarchy closely follows common ontological relationships, enabling data
encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, which are core features of OOP.
We demonstrate the efficiency of ObjectRL's design through representative use

TL;DR: FAROS提出了一种公平图生成框架，通过在生成过程中切换节点敏感属性，平衡准确性和公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图扩散模型生成数据中的公平性问题，避免重新训练模型的成本。

Method: 利用属性切换机制，在预训练模型生成过程中调整节点敏感属性，设置多标准约束。

Result: 在基准数据集上，FAROS有效减少公平性差异，同时保持或提高准确性。

Conclusion: FAROS在多标准约束下实现了更好的准确性与公平性权衡。

Abstract: Recent advancements in graph diffusion models (GDMs) have enabled the
synthesis of realistic network structures, yet ensuring fairness in the
generated data remains a critical challenge. Existing solutions attempt to
mitigate bias by re-training the GDMs with ad-hoc fairness constraints.
Conversely, with this work, we propose FAROS, a novel FAir graph geneRatiOn
framework leveraging attribute Switching mechanisms and directly running in the
generation process of the pre-trained GDM. Technically, our approach works by
altering nodes' sensitive attributes during the generation. To this end, FAROS
calculates the optimal fraction of switching nodes, and selects the diffusion
step to perform the switch by setting tailored multi-criteria constraints to
preserve the node-topology profile from the original distribution (a proxy for
accuracy) while ensuring the edge independence on the sensitive attributes for
the generated graph (a proxy for fairness). Our experiments on benchmark
datasets for link prediction demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively
reduces fairness discrepancies while maintaining comparable (or even higher)
accuracy performance to other similar baselines. Noteworthy, FAROS is also able
to strike a better accuracy-fairness trade-off than other competitors in some
of the tested settings under the Pareto optimality concept, demonstrating the
effectiveness of the imposed multi-criteria constraints.

Motivation: 手动调整矩阵函数计算的迭代算法设计选项在现代计算环境中繁琐且效率低下。

Method: 将算法设计视为顺序决策过程，使用蒙特卡洛树搜索规划混合迭代序列和步长。

Result: MatRL生成的算法在数值实验中优于文献中的多种基线方法。

Conclusion: MatRL能够自动发现高效算法，并证明其在大规模矩阵上的泛化能力。

Abstract: Iterative methods for computing matrix functions have been extensively
studied and their convergence speed can be significantly improved with the
right tuning of parameters and by mixing different iteration types. Handtuning
the design options for optimal performance can be cumbersome, especially in
modern computing environments: numerous different classical iterations and
their variants exist, each with non-trivial per-step cost and tuning
parameters. To this end, we propose MatRL -- a reinforcement learning based
framework that automatically discovers iterative algorithms for computing
matrix functions. The key idea is to treat algorithm design as a sequential
decision-making process. Monte-Carlo tree search is then used to plan a hybrid
sequence of matrix iterations and step sizes, tailored to a specific input
matrix distribution and computing environment. Moreover, we also show that the
learned algorithms provably generalize to sufficiently large matrices drawn
from the same distribution. Finally, we corroborate our theoretical results
with numerical experiments demonstrating that MatRL produces algorithms that
outperform various baselines in the literature.

Conclusion: 神经网络泛化能力可通过局部极值动态映射解释，极值增量算法为训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: We point out that neural networks are not black boxes, and their
generalization stems from the ability to dynamically map a dataset to the local
extrema of the model function. We further prove that the number of local
extrema in a neural network is positively correlated with the number of its
parameters, and on this basis, we give a new algorithm that is different from
the back-propagation algorithm, which we call the extremum-increment algorithm.
Some difficult situations, such as gradient vanishing and overfitting, can be
reasonably explained and dealt with in this framework.

Result: 在Crafter基准测试中，EMERALD实现了最先进性能，首次在10M环境步内超越人类专家表现，并解锁所有22项成就。

Conclusion: EMERALD提供了一种高效且准确的世界建模方法，显著提升了智能体性能。

Abstract: The Dreamer algorithm has recently obtained remarkable performance across
diverse environment domains by training powerful agents with simulated
trajectories. However, the compressed nature of its world model's latent space
can result in the loss of crucial information, negatively affecting the agent's
performance. Recent approaches, such as $\Delta$-IRIS and DIAMOND, address this
limitation by training more accurate world models. However, these methods
require training agents directly from pixels, which reduces training efficiency
and prevents the agent from benefiting from the inner representations learned
by the world model. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to world
modeling that is both accurate and efficient. We introduce EMERALD (Efficient
MaskEd latent tRAnsformer worLD model), a world model using a spatial latent
state with MaskGIT predictions to generate accurate trajectories in latent
space and improve the agent performance. On the Crafter benchmark, EMERALD
achieves new state-of-the-art performance, becoming the first method to surpass
human experts performance within 10M environment steps. Our method also

Conclusion: 该理论为迁移学习提供了新的理论支持，特别是在特征学习机制下的任务对齐和特征重用方面。

Abstract: We develop a theory of transfer learning in infinitely wide neural networks
where both the pretraining (source) and downstream (target) task can operate in
a feature learning regime. We analyze both the Bayesian framework, where
learning is described by a posterior distribution over the weights, and
gradient flow training of randomly initialized networks trained with weight
decay. Both settings track how representations evolve in both source and target
tasks. The summary statistics of these theories are adapted feature kernels
which, after transfer learning, depend on data and labels from both source and
target tasks. Reuse of features during transfer learning is controlled by an
elastic weight coupling which controls the reliance of the network on features
learned during training on the source task. We apply our theory to linear and
polynomial regression tasks as well as real datasets. Our theory and
experiments reveal interesting interplays between elastic weight coupling,
feature learning strength, dataset size, and source and target task alignment
on the utility of transfer learning.

Motivation: Existing NAS methods lack adaptability across scenarios, require costly separate searches for each deployment context, and struggle with performance consistency across platforms.

Result: DANCE outperforms state-of-the-art NAS methods in accuracy, reduces search costs, and maintains robust performance under varying computational constraints.

Conclusion: DANCE offers a scalable and efficient solution for NAS, addressing key limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has emerged as a powerful approach for
automating neural network design. However, existing NAS methods face critical
limitations in real-world deployments: architectures lack adaptability across
scenarios, each deployment context requires costly separate searches, and
performance consistency across diverse platforms remains challenging. We
propose DANCE (Dynamic Architectures with Neural Continuous Evolution), which
reformulates architecture search as a continuous evolution problem through
learning distributions over architectural components. DANCE introduces three
key innovations: a continuous architecture distribution enabling smooth
adaptation, a unified architecture space with learned selection gates for
efficient sampling, and a multi-stage training strategy for effective
deployment optimization. Extensive experiments across five datasets demonstrate
DANCE's effectiveness. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art NAS
approaches in terms of accuracy while significantly reducing search costs.
Under varying computational constraints, DANCE maintains robust performance

Conclusion: MJKAN继承了KAN的理论优势，同时提高了计算效率和实用性。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have garnered attention for replacing fixed
activation functions with learnable univariate functions, but they exhibit
practical limitations, including high computational costs and performance
deficits in general classification tasks. In this paper, we propose the
Modulation Joint KAN (MJKAN), a novel neural network layer designed to overcome
these challenges. MJKAN integrates a FiLM (Feature-wise Linear Modulation)-like
mechanism with Radial Basis Function (RBF) activations, creating a hybrid
architecture that combines the non-linear expressive power of KANs with the
efficiency of Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs). We empirically validated MJKAN's
performance across a diverse set of benchmarks, including function regression,
image classification (MNIST, CIFAR-10/100), and natural language processing (AG
News, SMS Spam). The results demonstrate that MJKAN achieves superior
approximation capabilities in function regression tasks, significantly
outperforming MLPs, with performance improving as the number of basis functions
increases. Conversely, in image and text classification, its performance was
competitive with MLPs but revealed a critical dependency on the number of basis
functions. We found that a smaller basis size was crucial for better
generalization, highlighting that the model's capacity must be carefully tuned
to the complexity of the data to prevent overfitting. In conclusion, MJKAN
offers a flexible architecture that inherits the theoretical advantages of KANs
while improving computational efficiency and practical viability.

Abstract: Reasoning about the trajectories of multiple, interacting objects is integral
to physical reasoning tasks in machine learning. This involves conditions
imposed on the objects at different time steps, for instance initial states or
desired goal states. Existing approaches in physical reasoning generally rely
on autoregressive modeling, which can only be conditioned on initial states,
but not on later states. In fields such as planning for reinforcement learning,
similar challenges are being addressed with denoising diffusion models. In this
work, we propose an object-centric denoising diffusion model architecture for
physical reasoning that is translation equivariant over time, permutation
equivariant over objects, and can be conditioned on arbitrary time steps for
arbitrary objects. We demonstrate how this model can solve tasks with multiple
conditions and examine its performance when changing object numbers and
trajectory lengths during inference.

Abstract: World Model, the supposed algorithmic surrogate of the real-world environment
which biological agents experience with and act upon, has been an emerging
topic in recent years because of the rising needs to develop virtual agents
with artificial (general) intelligence. There has been much debate on what a
world model really is, how to build it, how to use it, and how to evaluate it.
In this essay, starting from the imagination in the famed Sci-Fi classic Dune,
and drawing inspiration from the concept of "hypothetical thinking" in
psychology literature, we offer critiques of several schools of thoughts on
world modeling, and argue the primary goal of a world model to be simulating
all actionable possibilities of the real world for purposeful reasoning and
acting. Building on the critiques, we propose a new architecture for a
general-purpose world model, based on hierarchical, multi-level, and mixed
continuous/discrete representations, and a generative and self-supervision
learning framework, with an outlook of a Physical, Agentic, and Nested (PAN)
AGI system enabled by such a model.

Abstract: The rise of generative AI search engines is disrupting traditional SEO, with
Gartner predicting 25% reduction in conventional search usage by 2026. This
necessitates new approaches for web content visibility in AI-driven search
environments. We present a domain-specific fine-tuning approach for Generative
Engine Optimization (GEO) that transforms web content to improve
discoverability in large language model outputs. Our method fine-tunes a
BART-base transformer on synthetically generated training data comprising 1,905
cleaned travel website content pairs. Each pair consists of raw website text
and its GEO-optimized counterpart incorporating credible citations, statistical
evidence, and improved linguistic fluency. We evaluate using intrinsic metrics
(ROUGE-L, BLEU) and extrinsic visibility assessments through controlled
experiments with Llama-3.3-70B. The fine-tuned model achieves significant
improvements over baseline BART: ROUGE-L scores of 0.249 (vs. 0.226) and BLEU
scores of 0.200 (vs. 0.173). Most importantly, optimized content demonstrates
substantial visibility gains in generative search responses with 15.63%
improvement in absolute word count and 30.96% improvement in position-adjusted
word count metrics. This work provides the first empirical demonstration that
targeted transformer fine-tuning can effectively enhance web content visibility
in generative search engines with modest computational resources. Our results
suggest GEO represents a tractable approach for content optimization in the
AI-driven search landscape, offering concrete evidence that small-scale,
domain-focused fine-tuning yields meaningful improvements in content
discoverability.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has gained widespread adoption in recent

generalizability across different RL tasks. In this paper, we address these
challenges by proposing a general data-driven action selection approach with
model-free and computationally friendly properties. Our method not only selects
minimal sufficient actions but also controls the false discovery rate via
knockoff sampling. More importantly, we seamlessly integrate the action
selection into deep RL methods during online training. Empirical experiments
validate the established theoretical guarantees, demonstrating that our method
surpasses various alternative techniques in terms of both performance in
variable selection and overall achieved rewards.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are susceptible to backdoor attacks, where
adversaries poison training data to implant backdoor into the victim model.
Current backdoor defenses on poisoned data often suffer from high computational
costs or low effectiveness against advanced attacks like clean-label and
clean-image backdoors. To address them, we introduce CLIP-Guided backdoor
Defense (CGD), an efficient and effective method that mitigates various
backdoor attacks. CGD utilizes a publicly accessible CLIP model to identify
inputs that are likely to be clean or poisoned. It then retrains the model with
these inputs, using CLIP's logits as a guidance to effectively neutralize the
backdoor. Experiments on 4 datasets and 11 attack types demonstrate that CGD
reduces attack success rates (ASRs) to below 1% while maintaining clean
accuracy (CA) with a maximum drop of only 0.3%, outperforming existing
defenses. Additionally, we show that clean-data-based defenses can be adapted
to poisoned data using CGD. Also, CGD exhibits strong robustness, maintaining
low ASRs even when employing a weaker CLIP model or when CLIP itself is
compromised by a backdoor. These findings underscore CGD's exceptional
efficiency, effectiveness, and applicability for real-world backdoor defense
scenarios. Code: https://github.com/binyxu/CGD.

Conclusion: 伪似然最大化不仅是高效推理工具，还是记忆和泛化的机制。

Abstract: Energy-based probabilistic models learned by maximizing the likelihood of the
data are limited by the intractability of the partition function. A widely used
workaround is to maximize the pseudo-likelihood, which replaces the global
normalization with tractable local normalizations. Here we show that, in the
zero-temperature limit, a network trained to maximize pseudo-likelihood
naturally implements an associative memory: if the training set is small,
patterns become fixed-point attractors whose basins of attraction exceed those
of any classical Hopfield rule. We explain quantitatively this effect on
uncorrelated random patterns. Moreover, we show that, for different structured
datasets coming from computer science (random feature model, MNIST), physics
(spin glasses) and biology (proteins), as the number of training examples
increases the learned network goes beyond memorization, developing meaningful
attractors with non-trivial correlations with test examples, thus showing the
ability to generalize. Our results therefore reveal pseudo-likelihood works
both as an efficient inference tool and as a principled mechanism for memory
and generalization.

Abstract: In this chapter, we utilize dynamical systems to analyze several aspects of
machine learning algorithms. As an expository contribution we demonstrate how
to re-formulate a wide variety of challenges from deep neural networks,
(stochastic) gradient descent, and related topics into dynamical statements. We
also tackle three concrete challenges. First, we consider the process of
information propagation through a neural network, i.e., we study the
input-output map for different architectures. We explain the universal
embedding property for augmented neural ODEs representing arbitrary functions
of given regularity, the classification of multilayer perceptrons and neural
ODEs in terms of suitable function classes, and the memory-dependence in neural
delay equations. Second, we consider the training aspect of neural networks
dynamically. We describe a dynamical systems perspective on gradient descent
and study stability for overdetermined problems. We then extend this analysis
to the overparameterized setting and describe the edge of stability phenomenon,
also in the context of possible explanations for implicit bias. For stochastic
gradient descent, we present stability results for the overparameterized
setting via Lyapunov exponents of interpolation solutions. Third, we explain
several results regarding mean-field limits of neural networks. We describe a
result that extends existing techniques to heterogeneous neural networks
involving graph limits via digraph measures. This shows how large classes of
neural networks naturally fall within the framework of Kuramoto-type models on
graphs and their large-graph limits. Finally, we point out that similar
strategies to use dynamics to study explainable and reliable AI can also be
applied to settings such as generative models or fundamental issues in gradient
training methods, such as backpropagation or vanishing/exploding gradients.

facilitates selecting appropriate actions based on the context. Moreover, the
memory model allows us to detect action deviations while accomplishing specific
objectives. To assess the method's versatility, we evaluate it in a realistic
interactive simulation environment. Our experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approach learns meaningful representations, resulting in improved
performance and robust when action deviations occur.

tasks, which in turn has led to the proposal of increasingly sophisticated
algorithms. In this work, we explore a new direction, instead proposing a
decoupled approach that trains a generative model and a Gaussian Process (GP)
surrogate separately, then combines them via a simple yet principled Bayesian
update rule. This separation allows each component to focus on its strengths --
structure generation from the VAE and predictive modelling by the GP. We show
that our decoupled approach improves our ability to identify high-potential
candidates in molecular optimisation problems under constrained evaluation
budgets.

Abstract: Modern sequential recommender systems commonly use transformer-based models
for next-item prediction. While these models demonstrate a strong balance
between efficiency and quality, integrating interleaving features - such as the
query context (e.g., browse category) under which next-item interactions occur
- poses challenges. Effectively capturing query context is crucial for refining
ranking relevance and enhancing user engagement, as it provides valuable
signals about user intent within a session. Unlike an item's features, query
context is not temporally aligned with the item sequence, making its
incorporation into transformers challenging and error-prone. This paper
analyzes different strategies for incorporating query context into transformers
trained with a causal language modeling procedure as a case study. We propose a
new method that effectively fuses the item sequence with query context within
the attention mechanism. Through extensive offline and online experiments on a
large-scale online platform and open datasets, we present evidence that our
proposed method is an effective approach for integrating query context to
improve model ranking quality in terms of relevance and diversity.

Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as essential components in safety-critical
applications -- these use cases demand complex, yet trustworthy computations.
Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) are a type of neural network where each neuron
is constrained to a Boolean value; they are particularly well-suited for
safety-critical tasks because they retain much of the computational capacities
of full-scale (floating-point or quantized) deep neural networks, but remain
compatible with satisfiability solvers for qualitative verification and with
model counters for quantitative reasoning. However, existing methods for BNN
analysis suffer from either limited scalability or susceptibility to soundness
errors, which hinders their applicability in real-world scenarios.
  In this work, we present a scalable and trustworthy approach for both
qualitative and quantitative verification of BNNs. Our approach introduces a
native representation of BNN constraints in a custom-designed solver for
qualitative reasoning, and in an approximate model counter for quantitative
reasoning. We further develop specialized proof generation and checking
pipelines with native support for BNN constraint reasoning, ensuring
trustworthiness for all of our verification results. Empirical evaluations on a
BNN robustness verification benchmark suite demonstrate that our certified
solving approach achieves a $9\times$ speedup over prior certified CNF and
PB-based approaches, and our certified counting approach achieves a $218\times$
speedup over the existing CNF-based baseline. In terms of coverage, our
pipeline produces fully certified results for $99\%$ and $86\%$ of the
qualitative and quantitative reasoning queries on BNNs, respectively. This is
in sharp contrast to the best existing baselines which can fully certify only
$62\%$ and $4\%$ of the queries, respectively.

Abstract: Machine learning enables the extraction of useful information from large,

learning outcomes, we first applied it to two real-world problems to evaluate
its impact on model performance. We then solicited an assessment by data

Abstract: MolProphecy is a human-in-the-loop (HITL) multi-modal framework designed to

While molecular pre-trained models have enabled significant gains in predictive
accuracy, they often fail to capture the tacit, interpretive reasoning central
to expert-driven molecular design. To address this, MolProphecy employs ChatGPT
as a virtual chemist to simulate expert-level reasoning and decision-making.
The generated chemist knowledge is embedded by the large language model (LLM)
as a dedicated knowledge representation and then fused with graph-based
molecular features through a gated cross-attention mechanism, enabling joint
reasoning over human-derived and structural features. Evaluated on four
benchmark datasets (FreeSolv, BACE, SIDER, and ClinTox), MolProphecy
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, achieving a 15.0 percent reduction
in RMSE on FreeSolv and a 5.39 percent improvement in AUROC on BACE. Analysis
reveals that chemist knowledge and structural features provide complementary
contributions, improving both accuracy and interpretability. MolProphecy offers
a practical and generalizable approach for collaborative drug discovery, with
the flexibility to incorporate real chemist input in place of the current
simulated proxy--without the need for model retraining. The implementation is

Conclusion: SDKD框架有效捕捉了高频变化和长期趋势，同时降低了计算复杂度。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal forecasting tasks, such as traffic flow, combustion dynamics,
and weather forecasting, often require complex models that suffer from low
training efficiency and high memory consumption. This paper proposes a
lightweight framework, Spectral Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (termed SDKD),
which transfers the multi-scale spatiotemporal representations from a complex
teacher model to a more efficient lightweight student network. The teacher
model follows an encoder-latent evolution-decoder architecture, where its
latent evolution module decouples high-frequency details and low-frequency
trends using convolution and Transformer (global low-frequency modeler).
However, the multi-layer convolution and deconvolution structures result in
slow training and high memory usage. To address these issues, we propose a
frequency-aligned knowledge distillation strategy, which extracts multi-scale
spectral features from the teacher's latent space, including both high and low
frequency components, to guide the lightweight student model in capturing both
local fine-grained variations and global evolution patterns. Experimental
results show that SDKD significantly improves performance, achieving reductions
of up to 81.3% in MSE and in MAE 52.3% on the Navier-Stokes equation dataset.
The framework effectively captures both high-frequency variations and long-term
trends while reducing computational complexity. Our codes are available at

Conclusion: ACRSLF通过自适应正则化和精确二阶信息处理，显著提升了HDI数据建模性能。

Abstract: High-dimensional and incomplete (HDI) data, characterized by massive node
interactions, have become ubiquitous across various real-world applications.
Second-order latent factor models have shown promising performance in modeling
this type of data. Nevertheless, due to the bilinear and non-convex nature of
the SLF model's objective function, incorporating a damping term into the
Hessian approximation and carefully tuning associated parameters become
essential. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new approach in this
study, named the adaptive cubic regularized second-order latent factor analysis
(ACRSLF) model. The proposed ACRSLF adopts the two-fold ideas: 1) self-tuning
cubic regularization that dynamically mitigates non-convex optimization
instabilities; 2) multi-Hessian-vector product evaluation during conjugate
gradient iterations for precise second-order information assimilation.
Comprehensive experiments on two industrial HDI datasets demonstrate that the
ACRSLF converges faster and achieves higher representation accuracy than the
advancing optimizer-based LFA models.

Abstract: The Artificial Intelligence field has focused on developing optimisation

being able to even surpass the Turing Test. However, we have found that these
optimisation methods share some fundamental flaws that impede them to become a
true artificial cognition. Specifically, the field have identified catastrophic
forgetting as a fundamental problem to develop such cognition. This paper
formally proves that this problem is inherent to optimisation methods, and as
such it will always limit approaches that try to solve the Artificial General
Intelligence problem as an optimisation problem. Additionally, it addresses the
problem of overfitting and discuss about other smaller problems that
optimisation methods pose. Finally, it empirically shows how world-modelling
methods avoid suffering from either problem. As a conclusion, the field of
Artificial Intelligence needs to look outside the machine learning field to
find methods capable of developing an artificial cognition.

Abstract: The Helmholtz Machine (HM) is a foundational architecture for unsupervised
learning, coupling a bottom-up recognition model with a top-down generative
model through alternating inference. However, its reliance on symmetric,
data-driven updates constrains its ability to perform goal-directed reasoning
or simulate temporally extended processes. In this work, we introduce the
\emph{Cycle-Consistent Helmholtz Machine} (C$^2$HM), a novel extension that
reframes inference as a \emph{goal-seeded}, \emph{asymmetric} process grounded
in structured internal priors. Rather than inferring latent causes solely from
sensory data, C$^2$HM simulates plausible latent trajectories conditioned on
abstract goals, aligning them with observed outcomes through a recursive cycle
of forward generation and inverse refinement. This cycle-consistent formulation
integrates top-down structure with bottom-up evidence via a variational loop,
enforcing mutual alignment between goal-conditioned latent predictions and
recognition-based reconstructions. We formalize this mechanism within the
framework of the \emph{Context-Content Uncertainty Principle} (CCUP), which
posits that inference proceeds by aligning structured, low-entropy content with
high-entropy, ambiguous context. C$^2$HM improves representational efficiency,
supports memory chaining via path-dependent inference, and enables spatial
compositional imagination. By offering a biologically inspired alternative to
classical amortized inference, $C^2$HM reconceives generative modeling as
intentional simulation, bridging memory-based planning and unsupervised
learning in a unified probabilistic framework.

that combines neural implicit representations with Dynamic Mode Decomposition
(DMD) to reconstruct continuous spatio-temporal dynamics from such

complex spatial structures, while the linear dynamical modes of DMD introduce
an inductive bias that guides training and supports stable, low-dimensional
representations and forecasting. We validate NeuralDMD on two real-world
problems: reconstructing near-surface wind-speed fields over North America from
sparse station observations, and recovering the evolution of plasma near the
Galactic-center black hole, Sgr A*. In both cases, NeuralDMD outperforms
established baselines, demonstrating its potential as a general tool for

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) seeks to recover closed-form mathematical
expressions that describe observed data. While existing methods have advanced
the discovery of either explicit mappings (i.e., $y = f(\mathbf{x})$) or
discovering implicit relations (i.e., $F(\mathbf{x}, y)=0$), few modern and
accessible frameworks support both. Moreover, most approaches treat each
expression candidate in isolation, without reusing recurring structural
patterns that could accelerate search. We introduce SymMatika, a hybrid SR
algorithm that combines multi-island genetic programming (GP) with a reusable
motif library inspired by biological sequence analysis. SymMatika identifies
high-impact substructures in top-performing candidates and reintroduces them to
guide future generations. Additionally, it incorporates a feedback-driven
evolutionary engine and supports both explicit and implicit relation discovery
using implicit-derivative metrics. Across benchmarks, SymMatika achieves
state-of-the-art recovery rates, achieving 5.1% higher performance than the
previous best results on Nguyen, the first recovery of Nguyen-12, and
competitive performance on the Feynman equations. It also recovers implicit
physical laws from Eureqa datasets up to $100\times$ faster. Our results

discovery. To support broader research in interpretable modeling and symbolic

Abstract: Despite the impressive advancements in modern machine learning, achieving
robustness in Domain Generalization (DG) tasks remains a significant challenge.
In DG, models are expected to perform well on samples from unseen test
distributions (also called domains), by learning from multiple related training
distributions. Most existing approaches to this problem rely on single-valued
predictions, which inherently limit their robustness. We argue that set-valued
predictors could be leveraged to enhance robustness across unseen domains,
while also taking into account that these sets should be as small as possible.
We introduce a theoretical framework defining successful set prediction in the
DG setting, focusing on meeting a predefined performance criterion across as
many domains as possible, and provide theoretical insights into the conditions
under which such domain generalization is achievable. We further propose a
practical optimization method compatible with modern learning architectures,
that balances robust performance on unseen domains with small prediction set
sizes. We evaluate our approach on several real-world datasets from the WILDS
benchmark, demonstrating its potential as a promising direction for robust
domain generalization.

Motivation: 多模态深度学习在临床预测中潜力巨大，但现有方法主要局限于图像和文本对。PiCME旨在填补这一空白，系统评估多种临床数据类型的整合效果。

Method: PiCME通过对比学习预训练26种两到五模态组合，并引入Modality-Gated LSTM动态加权各模态重要性。

Result: 对比学习模型在三模态设置下表现最佳，五模态时性能下降，但Modality-Gated LSTM显著提升性能（AUROC从73.19%到76.93%）。

Conclusion: PiCME为多模态临床预测提供了指导，尤其在模态选择和公平性方面表现突出。

Abstract: Multimodal deep learning holds promise for improving clinical prediction by
integrating diverse patient data, including text, imaging, time-series, and
structured demographics. Contrastive learning facilitates this integration by
producing a unified representation that can be reused across tasks, reducing
the need for separate models or encoders. Although contrastive learning has
seen success in vision-language domains, its use in clinical settings remains
largely limited to image and text pairs. We propose the Pipeline for
Contrastive Modality Evaluation and Encoding (PiCME), which systematically
assesses five clinical data types from MIMIC: discharge summaries, radiology
reports, chest X-rays, demographics, and time-series. We pre-train contrastive
models on all 26 combinations of two to five modalities and evaluate their
utility on in-hospital mortality and phenotype prediction. To address
performance plateaus with more modalities, we introduce a Modality-Gated LSTM
that weights each modality according to its contrastively learned importance.
Our results show that contrastive models remain competitive with supervised
baselines, particularly in three-modality settings. Performance declines beyond
three modalities, which supervised models fail to recover. The Modality-Gated
LSTM mitigates this drop, improving AUROC from 73.19% to 76.93% and AUPRC from
51.27% to 62.26% in the five-modality setting. We also compare contrastively
learned modality importance scores with attribution scores and evaluate
generalization across demographic subgroups, highlighting strengths in
interpretability and fairness. PiCME is the first to scale contrastive learning
across all modality combinations in MIMIC, offering guidance for modality
selection, training strategies, and equitable clinical prediction.

Conclusion: LaTF通过联合优化表示学习和生成建模，有效捕捉了系统的慢自由度，并生成了准确的平衡分布，展示了其在分子系统研究中的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate characterization of the equilibrium distributions of complex
molecular systems and their dependence on environmental factors such as
temperature is essential for understanding thermodynamic properties and
transition mechanisms. Projecting these distributions onto meaningful
low-dimensional representations enables interpretability and downstream
analysis. Recent advances in generative AI, particularly flow models such as
Normalizing Flows (NFs), have shown promise in modeling such distributions, but
their scope is limited without tailored representation learning. In this work,
we introduce Latent Thermodynamic Flows (LaTF), an end-to-end framework that
tightly integrates representation learning and generative modeling. LaTF
unifies the State Predictive Information Bottleneck (SPIB) with NFs to
simultaneously learn low-dimensional latent representations, referred to as
Collective Variables (CVs), classify metastable states, and generate
equilibrium distributions across temperatures beyond the training data. The two
components of representation learning and generative modeling are optimized
jointly, ensuring that the learned latent features capture the system's slow,
important degrees of freedom while the generative model accurately reproduces
the system's equilibrium behavior. We demonstrate LaTF's effectiveness across
diverse systems, including a model potential, the Chignolin protein, and
cluster of Lennard Jones particles, with thorough evaluations and benchmarking
using multiple metrics and extensive simulations. Finally, we apply LaTF to a
RNA tetraloop system, where despite using simulation data from only two
temperatures, LaTF reconstructs the temperature-dependent structural ensemble
and melting behavior, consistent with experimental and prior extensive
computational results.

Abstract: Deep learning-based domain adaptation (DA) methods have shown strong
performance by learning transferable representations. However, their reliance
on mini-batch training limits global distribution modeling, leading to unstable
alignment and suboptimal generalization. We propose Global Variational
Inference Enhanced Domain Adaptation (GVI-DA), a framework that learns
continuous, class-conditional global priors via variational inference to enable
structure-aware cross-domain alignment. GVI-DA minimizes domain gaps through
latent feature reconstruction, and mitigates posterior collapse using global
codebook learning with randomized sampling. It further improves robustness by
discarding low-confidence pseudo-labels and generating reliable target-domain
samples. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks and thirty-eight DA tasks
demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art performance. We also derive the model's
evidence lower bound (ELBO) and analyze the effects of prior continuity,
codebook size, and pseudo-label noise tolerance. In addition, we compare GVI-DA
with diffusion-based generative frameworks in terms of optimization principles
and efficiency, highlighting both its theoretical soundness and practical
advantages.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approaches have been increasingly
applied in drug discovery to learn molecular representations and identify
substructures driving property predictions. However, building end-to-end
explainable machine learning models for structure-activity relationship (SAR)
modeling for compound property prediction faces many challenges, such as
limited activity data per target and the sensitivity of properties to subtle
molecular changes. To address this, we leveraged activity-cliff molecule pairs,
i.e., compounds sharing a common scaffold but differing sharply in potency,
targeting three proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src proteins (i.e., PDB
IDs 1O42, 2H8H, and 4MXO). We implemented graph neural network (GNN) methods to
obtain atom-level feature information and predict compound-protein affinity
(i.e., half maximal inhibitory concentration, IC50). In addition, we trained
GNN models with different structure-aware loss functions to adequately leverage
molecular property and structure information. We also utilized group lasso and
sparse group lasso to prune and highlight molecular subgraphs and enhance the
structure-specific model explainability for the predicted property difference
in molecular activity-cliff pairs. We improved drug property prediction by
integrating common and uncommon node information and using sparse group lasso,
reducing the average root mean squared error (RMSE) by 12.70%, and achieving
the lowest averaged RMSE=0.2551 and the highest PCC=0.9572. Furthermore,
applying regularization enhances feature attribution methods that estimate the
contribution of each atom in the molecular graphs by boosting global direction
scores and atom-level accuracy in atom coloring accuracy, which improves model
interpretability in drug discovery pipelines, particularly in investigating
important molecular substructures in lead optimization.

Conclusion: MAFG为科学数据特征生成提供了高效自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Feature generation (FG) aims to enhance the prediction potential of original
data by constructing high-order feature combinations and removing redundant
features. It is a key preprocessing step for tabular scientific data to improve
downstream machine-learning model performance. Traditional methods face the
following two challenges when dealing with the feature generation of scientific
data: First, the effective construction of high-order feature combinations in
scientific data necessitates profound and extensive domain-specific expertise.
Secondly, as the order of feature combinations increases, the search space
expands exponentially, imposing prohibitive human labor consumption.
Advancements in the Data-Centric Artificial Intelligence (DCAI) paradigm have
opened novel avenues for automating feature generation processes. Inspired by
that, this paper revisits the conventional feature generation workflow and
proposes the Multi-agent Feature Generation (MAFG) framework. Specifically, in
the iterative exploration stage, multi-agents will construct mathematical
transformation equations collaboratively, synthesize and identify feature
combinations ex-hibiting high information content, and leverage a reinforcement
learning mechanism to evolve their strategies. Upon completing the exploration
phase, MAFG integrates the large language models (LLMs) to interpreta-tively
evaluate the generated features of each significant model performance
breakthrough. Experimental results and case studies consistently demonstrate
that the MAFG framework effectively automates the feature generation process
and significantly enhances various downstream scientific data mining tasks.

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data generation has received increasing attention in recent
years, particularly with the emergence of foundation models for tabular data.
The breakthrough success of TabPFN (Hollmann et al.,2025), which leverages vast
quantities of synthetic tabular datasets derived from structural causal models
(SCMs), demonstrates the critical role synthetic data plays in developing
powerful tabular foundation models. However, most real-world tabular data
exists in relational formats spanning multiple interconnected tables - a
structure not adequately addressed by current generation methods. In this work,
we extend the SCM-based approach by developing a novel framework that generates
realistic synthetic relational tabular data including causal relationships
across tables. Our experiments confirm that this framework is able to construct
relational datasets with complex inter-table dependencies mimicking real-world
scenarios.

Conclusion: DOME有效降低了联邦学习中的通信和隐私成本，同时保持隐私保护。

Abstract: Federated learning with differential privacy suffers from two major costs:
each client must transmit $d$-dimensional gradients every round, and the
magnitude of DP noise grows with $d$. Yet empirical studies show that gradient
updates exhibit strong temporal correlations and lie in a $k$-dimensional
subspace with $k \ll d$. Motivated by this, we introduce DOME, a decentralized
DP optimization framework in which each client maintains a compact sketch to
project gradients into $\mathbb{R}^k$ before privatization and Secure
Aggregation. This reduces per-round communication from order $d$ to order $k$
and moves towards a gradient approximation mean-squared error of $\sigma^2 k$.
To allow the sketch to span new directions and prevent it from collapsing onto
historical gradients, we augment it with random probes orthogonal to historical
directions. We prove that our overall protocol satisfies
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-Differential Privacy.

Abstract: The Graph Neural Tangent Kernel (GNTK) successfully bridges the gap between
kernel methods and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), addressing key challenges such
as the difficulty of training deep networks and the limitations of traditional
kernel methods. However, the existing layer-stacking strategy in GNTK
introduces redundant computations, significantly increasing computational
complexity and limiting scalability for practical applications. To address
these issues, this paper proposes the Simplified Graph Neural Tangent Kernel
(SGTK), which replaces the traditional multi-layer stacking mechanism with a
continuous $K$-step aggregation operation. This novel approach streamlines the
iterative kernel computation process, effectively eliminating redundant
calculations while preserving the kernel's expressiveness. By reducing the
dependency on layer stacking, SGTK achieves both computational simplicity and
efficiency. Furthermore, we introduce the Simplified Graph Neural Kernel
(SGNK), which models infinitely wide Graph Neural Networks as Gaussian
Processes. This allows kernel values to be directly determined from the
expected outputs of activation functions in the infinite-width regime,
bypassing the need for explicit layer-by-layer computation. SGNK further
reduces computational complexity while maintaining the capacity to capture
intricate structural patterns in graphs. Extensive experiments on node and
graph classification tasks demonstrate that the proposed SGTK and SGNK achieve
performance comparable to existing approaches while improving computational
efficiency. Implementation details are available at

Abstract: Generative modeling of crystalline materials using diffusion models presents
a series of challenges: the data distribution is characterized by inherent
symmetries and involves multiple modalities, with some defined on specific
manifolds. Notably, the treatment of fractional coordinates representing atomic
positions in the unit cell requires careful consideration, as they lie on a
hypertorus. In this work, we introduce Kinetic Langevin Diffusion for Materials
(KLDM), a novel diffusion model for crystalline materials generation, where the
key innovation resides in the modeling of the coordinates. Instead of resorting
to Riemannian diffusion on the hypertorus directly, we generalize Trivialized
Diffusion Model (TDM) to account for the symmetries inherent to crystals. By
coupling coordinates with auxiliary Euclidean variables representing
velocities, the diffusion process is now offset to a flat space. This allows us
to effectively perform diffusion on the hypertorus while providing a training
objective that accounts for the periodic translation symmetry of the true data
distribution. We evaluate KLDM on both Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) and
De-novo Generation (DNG) tasks, demonstrating its competitive performance with
current state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Accurate individual treatment-effect estimation in high-stakes applications
demands both reliable point predictions and interpretable uncertainty
quantification. We propose a factorized Monte Carlo Dropout framework for deep
twin-network models that splits total predictive variance into representation
uncertainty (sigma_rep) in the shared encoder and prediction uncertainty
(sigma_pred) in the outcome heads. Across three synthetic covariate-shift
regimes, our intervals are well-calibrated (ECE < 0.03) and satisfy sigma_rep^2
+ sigma_pred^2 ~ sigma_tot^2. Additionally, we observe a crossover: head
uncertainty leads on in-distribution data, but representation uncertainty
dominates under shift. Finally, on a real-world twins cohort with induced
multivariate shifts, only sigma_rep spikes on out-of-distribution samples
(delta sigma ~ 0.0002) and becomes the primary error predictor (rho_rep <=
0.89), while sigma_pred remains flat. This module-level decomposition offers a
practical diagnostic for detecting and interpreting uncertainty sources in deep
causal-effect models.

Abstract: Discovering governing equations that describe complex chaotic systems remains
a fundamental challenge in physics and neuroscience. Here, we introduce the
PEM-UDE method, which combines the prediction-error method with universal
differential equations to extract interpretable mathematical expressions from
chaotic dynamical systems, even with limited or noisy observations. This
approach succeeds where traditional techniques fail by smoothing optimization
landscapes and removing the chaotic properties during the fitting process
without distorting optimal parameters. We demonstrate its efficacy by
recovering hidden states in the Rossler system and reconstructing dynamics from
noise-corrupted electrical circuit data, where the correct functional form of
the dynamics is recovered even when one of the observed time series is
corrupted by noise 5x the magnitude of the true signal. We demonstrate that
this method is capable of recovering the correct dynamics, whereas direct
symbolic regression methods, such as SINDy, fail to do so with the given amount
of data and noise. Importantly, when applied to neural populations, our method
derives novel governing equations that respect biological constraints such as
network sparsity - a constraint necessary for cortical information processing
yet not captured in next-generation neural mass models - while preserving
microscale neuronal parameters. These equations predict an emergent
relationship between connection density and both oscillation frequency and
synchrony in neural circuits. We validate these predictions using three
intracranial electrode recording datasets from the medial entorhinal cortex,
prefrontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex. Our work provides a pathway to
develop mechanistic, multi-scale brain models that generalize across diverse
neural architectures, bridging the gap between single-neuron dynamics and
macroscale brain activity.

Abstract: External funding is crucial for early-stage ventures, particularly technology
startups that require significant R&D investment. Business angels offer a
critical source of funding, but their decision-making is often subjective and
resource-intensive for both investor and entrepreneur. Much research has
investigated this investment process to find the critical factors angels
consider. One such tool, the Critical Factor Assessment (CFA), deployed more
than 20,000 times by the Canadian Innovation Centre, has been evaluated
post-decision and found to be significantly more accurate than investors' own
decisions. However, a single CFA analysis requires three trained individuals
and several days, limiting its adoption. This study builds on previous work
validating the CFA to investigate whether the constraints inhibiting its
adoption can be overcome using a trained AI model. In this research, we
prompted multiple large language models (LLMs) to assign the eight CFA factors
to a dataset of 600 transcribed, unstructured startup pitches seeking business
angel funding with known investment outcomes. We then trained and evaluated
machine learning classification models using the LLM-generated CFA scores as
input features. Our best-performing model demonstrated high predictive accuracy
(85.0% for predicting BA deal/no-deal outcomes) and exhibited significant
correlation (Spearman's r = 0.896, p-value < 0.001) with conventional
human-graded evaluations. The integration of AI-based feature extraction with a
structured and validated decision-making framework yielded a scalable,
reliable, and less-biased model for evaluating startup pitches, removing the
constraints that previously limited adoption.

Conclusion: 分布式eGNN实现可高效处理大规模电子结构预测任务。

Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (eGNNs) trained on density-functional
theory (DFT) data can potentially perform electronic structure prediction at
unprecedented scales, enabling investigation of the electronic properties of
materials with extended defects, interfaces, or exhibiting disordered phases.
However, as interactions between atomic orbitals typically extend over 10+
angstroms, the graph representations required for this task tend to be densely
connected, and the memory requirements to perform training and inference on
these large structures can exceed the limits of modern GPUs. Here we present a
distributed eGNN implementation which leverages direct GPU communication and
introduce a partitioning strategy of the input graph to reduce the number of
embedding exchanges between GPUs. Our implementation shows strong scaling up to
128 GPUs, and weak scaling up to 512 GPUs with 87% parallel efficiency for
structures with 3,000 to 190,000 atoms on the Alps supercomputer.

Conclusion: TK-GCN通过结合K-GCN和Transformer，成功提升了不规则几何域上时空动态预测的准确性。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal dynamics forecasting is inherently challenging, particularly
in systems defined over irregular geometric domains, due to the need to jointly
capture complex spatial correlations and nonlinear temporal dynamics. To tackle
these challenges, we propose TK-GCN, a two-stage framework that integrates
geometry-aware spatial encoding with long-range temporal modeling. In the first
stage, a Koopman-enhanced Graph Convolutional Network (K-GCN) is developed to
embed the high-dimensional dynamics distributed on spatially irregular domains
into a latent space where the evolution of system states is approximately
linear. By leveraging Koopman operator theory, this stage enhances the temporal
consistency during the latent learning. In the second stage, a Transformer
module is employed to model the temporal progression within the Koopman-encoded
latent space. Through the self-attention mechanism, the Transformer captures
long-range temporal dependencies, enabling accurate forecasting over extended
horizons. We evaluate TK-GCN in spatiotemporal cardiac dynamics forecasting and
benchmark its performance against several state-of-the-art baselines.
Experimental results and ablation studies show that TK-GCN consistently
delivers superior predictive accuracy across a range of forecast horizons,
demonstrating its capability to effectively model complex spatial structures
and nonlinear temporal dynamics.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning neural network models for Ordinary
Differential Equations (ODEs) with parametric uncertainties. Such neural
network models capture the solution to the ODE over a given set of parameters,
initial conditions, and range of times. Physics-Informed Neural Networks
(PINNs) have emerged as a promising approach for learning such models that
combine data-driven deep learning with symbolic physics models in a principled
manner. However, the accuracy of PINNs degrade when they are used to solve an
entire family of initial value problems characterized by varying parameters and
initial conditions.
  In this paper, we combine symbolic differentiation and Taylor series methods
to propose a class of higher-order models for capturing the solutions to ODEs.
These models combine neural networks and symbolic terms: they use higher order
Lie derivatives and a Taylor series expansion obtained symbolically, with the
remainder term modeled as a neural network. The key insight is that the
remainder term can itself be modeled as a solution to a first-order ODE. We
show how the use of these higher order PINNs can improve accuracy using
interesting, but challenging ODE benchmarks. We also show that the resulting
model can be quite useful for situations such as controlling uncertain physical
systems modeled as ODEs.

Abstract: Systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) require
computationally intensive numerical solvers to predict spatiotemporal field
evolution. While machine learning (ML) surrogates offer faster solutions,
autoregressive inference with ML models suffer from error accumulation over
successive predictions, limiting their long-term accuracy. We propose a deep
ensemble framework to address this challenge, where multiple ML surrogate
models with random weight initializations are trained in parallel and
aggregated during inference. This approach leverages the diversity of model
predictions to mitigate error propagation while retaining the autoregressive
strategies ability to capture the system's time dependent relations. We
validate the framework on three PDE-driven dynamical systems - stress evolution
in heterogeneous microstructures, Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion, and
planetary-scale shallow water system - demonstrating consistent reduction in
error accumulation over time compared to individual models. Critically, the
method requires only a few time steps as input, enabling full trajectory
predictions with inference times significantly faster than numerical solvers.
Our results highlight the robustness of ensemble methods in diverse physical
systems and their potential as efficient and accurate alternatives to
traditional solvers. The codes for this work are available on GitHub

Conclusion: 该框架为风险敏感强化学习提供了一种更优的解决方案，具有理论和实践优势。

Abstract: The development of Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has introduced
a natural way to incorporate risk sensitivity into value-based and actor-critic
methods by employing risk measures other than expectation in the value
function. While this approach is widely adopted in many online and offline RL
algorithms due to its simplicity, the naive integration of risk measures often
results in suboptimal policies. This limitation can be particularly harmful in
scenarios where the need for effective risk-sensitive policies is critical and
worst-case outcomes carry severe consequences. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel framework for optimizing static Spectral Risk Measures (SRM), a
flexible family of risk measures that generalizes objectives such as CVaR and
Mean-CVaR, and enables the tailoring of risk preferences. Our method is
applicable to both online and offline RL algorithms. We establish theoretical
guarantees by proving convergence in the finite state-action setting. Moreover,
through extensive empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that our algorithms
consistently outperform existing risk-sensitive methods in both online and
offline environments across diverse domains.

Conclusion: CAPIMAC有效提升了多模态数据融合的质量。

Abstract: Multimodal representation is faithful and highly effective in describing
real-world data samples' characteristics by describing their complementary
information. However, the collected data often exhibits incomplete and
misaligned characteristics due to factors such as inconsistent sensor
frequencies and device malfunctions. Existing research has not effectively
addressed the issue of filling missing data in scenarios where multiview data
are both imbalanced and misaligned. Instead, it relies on class-level alignment
of the available data. Thus, it results in some data samples not being
well-matched, thereby affecting the quality of data fusion. In this paper, we
propose the Consistency-Aware Padding for Incomplete Multimodal Alignment
Clustering Based on Self-Repellent Greedy Anchor Search(CAPIMAC) to tackle the
problem of filling imbalanced and misaligned data in multimodal datasets.
Specifically, we propose a self-repellent greedy anchor search module(SRGASM),
which employs a self-repellent random walk combined with a greedy algorithm to
identify anchor points for re-representing incomplete and misaligned multimodal
data. Subsequently, based on noise-contrastive learning, we design a
consistency-aware padding module (CAPM) to effectively interpolate and align
imbalanced and misaligned data, thereby improving the quality of multimodal
data fusion. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method
over benchmark datasets. The code will be publicly released at

Abstract: Recently, a novel two-phase framework named mol-infer for inference of
chemical compounds with prescribed abstract structures and desired property
values has been proposed. The framework mol-infer is primarily based on using
mixed integer linear programming (MILP) to simulate the computational process
of machine learning methods and describe the necessary and sufficient
conditions to ensure such a chemical graph exists. The existing approaches
usually first convert the chemical compounds into handcrafted feature vectors
to construct prediction functions, but because of the limit on the kinds of
descriptors originated from the need for tractability in the MILP formulation,
the learning performances on datasets of some properties are not good enough. A
lack of good learning performance can greatly lower the quality of the inferred
chemical graphs, and thus improving learning performance is of great
importance. On the other hand, graph neural networks (GNN) offer a promising
machine learning method to directly utilize the chemical graphs as the input,
and many existing GNN-based approaches to the molecular property prediction
problem have shown that they can enjoy better learning performances compared to
the traditional approaches that are based on feature vectors. In this study, we
develop a molecular inference framework based on mol-infer, namely
mol-infer-GNN, that utilizes GNN as the learning method while keeping the great
flexibility originated from the two-layered model on the abstract structure of
the chemical graph to be inferred. We conducted computational experiments on
the QM9 dataset to show that our proposed GNN model can obtain satisfying
learning performances for some properties despite its simple structure, and can
infer small chemical graphs comprising up to 20 non-hydrogen atoms within
reasonable computational time.

Conclusion: MCST-Mamba在多变量交通预测中具有高效性和性能优势。

Abstract: Accurate traffic prediction plays a vital role in intelligent transportation
systems by enabling efficient routing, congestion mitigation, and proactive
traffic control. However, forecasting is challenging due to the combined
effects of dynamic road conditions, varying traffic patterns across different
locations, and external influences such as weather and accidents. Traffic data
often consists of several interrelated measurements - such as speed, flow and
occupancy - yet many deep-learning approaches either predict only one of these
variables or require a separate model for each. This limits their ability to
capture joint patterns across channels. To address this, we introduce the
Multi-Channel Spatio-Temporal (MCST) Mamba model, a forecasting framework built
on the Mamba selective state-space architecture that natively handles
multivariate inputs and simultaneously models all traffic features. The
proposed MCST-Mamba model integrates adaptive spatio-temporal embeddings and
separates the modeling of temporal sequences and spatial sensor interactions
into two dedicated Mamba blocks, improving representation learning. Unlike
prior methods that evaluate on a single channel, we assess MCST-Mamba across
all traffic features at once, aligning more closely with how congestion arises
in practice. Our results show that MCST-Mamba achieves strong predictive
performance with a lower parameter count compared to baseline models.

research, we introduce \textbf{GCAT} (Graph Collaborative Attention Network), a
refined model that enhances context aggregation and interaction between

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers share significant similarities
in their encoding strategies for interacting with features from nodes of
interest, where Transformers use query-key scores and GNNs use edges. Compared
to GNNs, which are unable to encode relative positions, Transformers leverage
dynamic attention capabilities to better represent relative relationships,
thereby becoming the standard backbones in large-scale sequential pre-training.
However, the subtle difference prompts us to consider: if positions are no
longer crucial, could we substitute Transformers with Graph Neural Networks in
some fields such as Single-Cell Transcriptomics? In this paper, we first
explore the similarities and differences between GNNs and Transformers,
specifically in terms of relative positions. Additionally, we design a
synthetic example to illustrate their equivalence where there are no relative
positions between tokens in the sample. Finally, we conduct extensive
experiments on a large-scale position-agnostic dataset-single-cell
transcriptomics-finding that GNNs achieve competitive performance compared to
Transformers while consuming fewer computation resources. These findings
provide novel insights for researchers in the field of single-cell
transcriptomics, challenging the prevailing notion that the Transformer is

Abstract: Data modeling using Tsetlin machines (TMs) is all about building logical
rules from the data features. The decisions of the model are based on a
combination of these logical rules. Hence, the model is fully transparent and
it is possible to get explanations of its predictions. In this paper, we
present a probability score for TM predictions and develop new techniques for
uncertainty quantification to increase the explainability further. The
probability score is an inherent property of any TM variant and is derived
through an analysis of the TM learning dynamics. Simulated data is used to show
a clear connection between the learned TM probability scores and the underlying
probabilities of the data. A visualization of the probability scores also
reveals that the TM is less confident in its predictions outside the training
data domain, which contrasts the typical extrapolation phenomenon found in
Artificial Neural Networks. The paper concludes with an application of the
uncertainty quantification techniques on an image classification task using the
CIFAR-10 dataset, where they provide new insights and suggest possible
improvements to current TM image classification models.

q({\bf x}_t) = -\frac 1 {\sqrt {1- {\bar \alpha}_t} } \epsilon_{\theta} ( {\bf
x}_t , t)$ plays a fundamental role in both theoretical analyses and
algorithmic design, and thus is frequently employed across diffusion-based
generative models. In this paper, an explicit formulation of $
\epsilon_{\theta} ( {\bf x}_t , t)$ in terms of the forward-process noise
$\epsilon_t$ is derived. This result show how the forward-process noise
$\epsilon_t$ contributes to the learned predictor $ \epsilon_{\theta} ( {\bf

the normalized iterative hard thresholding (NIHT) method-have been widely used
in compressed sensing (CS) and applied to matrix recovery tasks. In this paper,
we propose a tensor extension of NIHT, referred to as TNIHT, for the recovery
of low-rank tensors under two widely used tensor decomposition models. This
extension enables the effective reconstruction of high-order low-rank tensors
from a limited number of linear measurements by leveraging the inherent
low-dimensional structure of multi-way data. Specifically, we consider both the
CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) rank and the Tucker rank to characterize tensor
low-rankness within the TNIHT framework. At the same time, we establish a
convergence theorem for the proposed TNIHT method under the tensor restricted
isometry property (TRIP), providing theoretical support for its recovery
guarantees. Finally, we evaluate the performance of TNIHT through numerical
experiments on synthetic, image, and video data, and compare it with several
state-of-the-art algorithms.

Conclusion: Retformer为AD早期诊断提供了高效且可解释的工具。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects
millions worldwide. In the absence of effective treatment options, early
diagnosis is crucial for initiating management strategies to delay disease
onset and slow down its progression. In this study, we propose Retformer, a
novel transformer-based architecture for detecting AD using retinal imaging
modalities, leveraging the power of transformers and explainable artificial
intelligence. The Retformer model is trained on datasets of different
modalities of retinal images from patients with AD and age-matched healthy
controls, enabling it to learn complex patterns and relationships between image
features and disease diagnosis. To provide insights into the decision-making
process of our model, we employ the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping
algorithm to visualize the feature importance maps, highlighting the regions of
the retinal images that contribute most significantly to the classification
outcome. These findings are compared to existing clinical studies on detecting
AD using retinal biomarkers, allowing us to identify the most important
features for AD detection in each imaging modality. The Retformer model
outperforms a variety of benchmark algorithms across different performance
metrics by margins of up to 11\.

Abstract: Feedback control of fluid-based systems poses significant challenges due to
their high-dimensional, nonlinear, and multiscale dynamics, which demand
real-time, three-dimensional, multi-component measurements for sensing. While
such measurements are feasible in digital simulations, they are often only
partially accessible in the real world. In this paper, we propose a method to
adapt feedback control policies obtained from full-state measurements to setups
with only partial measurements. Our approach is demonstrated in a simulated
environment by minimising the aerodynamic drag of a simplified road vehicle.
Reinforcement learning algorithms can optimally solve this control task when
trained on full-state measurements by placing sensors in the wake. However, in
real-world applications, sensors are limited and typically only on the vehicle,
providing only partial measurements. To address this, we propose to train a
Domain Specific Feature Transfer (DSFT) map reconstructing the full
measurements from the history of the partial measurements. By applying this
map, we derive optimal policies based solely on partial data. Additionally, our
method enables determination of the optimal history length and offers insights
into the architecture of optimal control policies, facilitating their
implementation in real-world environments with limited sensor information.

Conclusion: ProtoNorm在资源受限环境中表现优异，是解决异构联邦学习问题的有效方案。

Abstract: Heterogeneity in data distributions and model architectures remains a
significant challenge in federated learning (FL). Various heterogeneous FL
(HtFL) approaches have recently been proposed to address this challenge. Among
them, prototype-based FL (PBFL) has emerged as a practical framework that only
shares per-class mean activations from the penultimate layer. However, PBFL
approaches often suffer from suboptimal prototype separation, limiting their
discriminative power. We propose Prototype Normalization (ProtoNorm), a novel
PBFL framework that addresses this limitation through two key components:
Prototype Alignment (PA) and Prototype Upscaling (PU). The PA method draws
inspiration from the Thomson problem in classical physics, optimizing global
prototype configurations on a unit sphere to maximize angular separation;
subsequently, the PU method increases prototype magnitudes to enhance
separation in Euclidean space. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show
that our approach better separates prototypes and thus consistently outperforms
existing HtFL approaches. Notably, since ProtoNorm inherits the communication
efficiency of PBFL and the PA is performed server-side, it is particularly
suitable for resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: TinyProto是一种高效、适用于资源受限异构联邦学习的通信优化方法。

Abstract: Communication efficiency in federated learning (FL) remains a critical
challenge for resource-constrained environments. While prototype-based FL
reduces communication overhead by sharing class prototypes-mean activations in
the penultimate layer-instead of model parameters, its efficiency decreases
with larger feature dimensions and class counts. We propose TinyProto, which
addresses these limitations through Class-wise Prototype Sparsification (CPS)
and adaptive prototype scaling. CPS enables structured sparsity by allocating
specific dimensions to class prototypes and transmitting only non-zero
elements, while adaptive scaling adjusts prototypes based on class
distributions. Our experiments show TinyProto reduces communication costs by up
to 4x compared to existing methods while maintaining performance. Beyond its
communication efficiency, TinyProto offers crucial advantages: achieving
compression without client-side computational overhead and supporting
heterogeneous architectures, making it ideal for resource-constrained
heterogeneous FL.

Abstract: Understanding the contribution of individual features in predictive models

contributions. In this work, we present an information-theoretic extension of
the High-order interactions for Feature importance (Hi-Fi) method, leveraging
Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) estimated via a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN)
approach working on mixed discrete and continuous random variables. Our
framework decomposes feature contributions into unique, synergistic, and
redundant components, offering a richer, model-independent understanding of
their predictive roles. We validate the method using synthetic datasets with
known Gaussian structures, where ground truth interaction patterns are
analytically derived, and further test it on non-Gaussian and real-world gene
expression data from TCGA-BRCA. Results indicate that the proposed estimator

Abstract: Traditional malware detection methods exhibit computational inefficiency due
to exhaustive feature extraction requirements, creating accuracy-efficiency
trade-offs that limit real-time deployment. We formulate malware classification
as a Markov Decision Process with episodic feature acquisition and propose a
Dueling Double Deep Q-Network (D3QN) framework for adaptive sequential feature
selection. The agent learns to dynamically select informative features per
sample before terminating with classification decisions, optimizing both
detection accuracy and computational cost through reinforcement learning.
  We evaluate our approach on Microsoft Big2015 (9-class, 1,795 features) and
BODMAS (binary, 2,381 features) datasets. D3QN achieves 99.22% and 98.83%
accuracy while utilizing only 61 and 56 features on average, representing 96.6%
and 97.6% dimensionality reduction. This yields computational efficiency
improvements of 30.1x and 42.5x over traditional ensemble methods.
Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate consistent superiority over Random
Forest, XGBoost, and static feature selection approaches.
  Quantitative analysis demonstrates that D3QN learns non-random feature
selection policies with 62.5% deviation from uniform baseline distributions.
The learned policies exhibit structured hierarchical preferences, utilizing
high-level metadata features for initial assessment while selectively
incorporating detailed behavioral features based on classification uncertainty.
Feature specialization analysis reveals 57.7% of examined features demonstrate
significant class-specific discrimination patterns. Our results validate
reinforcement learning-based sequential feature selection for malware
classification, achieving superior accuracy with substantial computational
reduction through learned adaptive policies.

Abstract: Probabilistic circuits (PCs) are powerful probabilistic models that enable
exact and tractable inference, making them highly suitable for probabilistic
reasoning and inference tasks. While dominant in neural networks,
representation learning with PCs remains underexplored, with prior approaches
relying on external neural embeddings or activation-based encodings. To address
this gap, we introduce autoencoding probabilistic circuits (APCs), a novel
framework leveraging the tractability of PCs to model probabilistic embeddings
explicitly. APCs extend PCs by jointly modeling data and embeddings, obtaining
embedding representations through tractable probabilistic inference. The PC
encoder allows the framework to natively handle arbitrary missing data and is
seamlessly integrated with a neural decoder in a hybrid, end-to-end trainable
architecture enabled by differentiable sampling. Our empirical evaluation
demonstrates that APCs outperform existing PC-based autoencoding methods in
reconstruction quality, generate embeddings competitive with, and exhibit
superior robustness in handling missing data compared to neural autoencoders.
These results highlight APCs as a powerful and flexible representation learning
method that exploits the probabilistic inference capabilities of PCs, showing
promising directions for robust inference, out-of-distribution detection, and
knowledge distillation.

Abstract: This monograph, spanning three chapters, explores Inverse Reinforcement
Learning (IRL). The first two chapters view inverse reinforcement learning
(IRL) through the lens of revealed preferences from microeconomics while the
third chapter studies adaptive IRL via Langevin dynamics stochastic gradient
algorithms.
  Chapter uses classical revealed preference theory (Afriat's theorem and
extensions) to identify constrained utility maximizers based on observed agent
actions. This allows for the reconstruction of set-valued estimates of an
agent's utility. We illustrate this procedure by identifying the presence of a
cognitive radar and reconstructing its utility function. The chapter also
addresses the construction of a statistical detector for utility maximization
behavior when agent actions are corrupted by noise.
  Chapter 2 studies Bayesian IRL. It investigates how an analyst can determine
if an observed agent is a rationally inattentive Bayesian utility maximizer
(i.e., simultaneously optimizing its utility and observation likelihood). The
chapter discusses inverse stopping-time problems, focusing on reconstructing
the continuation and stopping costs of a Bayesian agent operating over a random
horizon. We then apply this IRL methodology to identify the presence of a
Bayes-optimal sequential detector. Additionally, Chapter 2 provides a concise
overview of discrete choice models, inverse Bayesian filtering, and inverse
stochastic gradient algorithms for adaptive IRL.
  Finally, Chapter 3 introduces an adaptive IRL approach utilizing passive
Langevin dynamics. This method aims to track time-varying utility functions
given noisy and misspecified gradients. In essence, the adaptive IRL algorithms
presented in Chapter 3 can be conceptualized as inverse stochastic gradient
algorithms, as they learn the utility function in real-time while a stochastic
gradient algorithm is in operation.

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to create a compact dataset that retains essential
information while maintaining model performance. Diffusion models (DMs) have
shown promise for this task but struggle in low images-per-class (IPC)
settings, where generated samples lack diversity. In this paper, we address
this issue from an information-theoretic perspective by identifying two key
types of information that a distilled dataset must preserve: ($i$) prototype
information $\mathrm{I}(X;Y)$, which captures label-relevant features; and
($ii$) contextual information $\mathrm{H}(X | Y)$, which preserves intra-class
variability. Here, $(X,Y)$ represents the pair of random variables
corresponding to the input data and its ground truth label, respectively.
Observing that the required contextual information scales with IPC, we propose
maximizing $\mathrm{I}(X;Y) + \beta \mathrm{H}(X | Y)$ during the DM sampling
process, where $\beta$ is IPC-dependent. Since directly computing
$\mathrm{I}(X;Y)$ and $\mathrm{H}(X | Y)$ is intractable, we develop
variational estimations to tightly lower-bound these quantities via a
data-driven approach. Our approach, information-guided diffusion sampling
(IGDS), seamlessly integrates with diffusion models and improves dataset
distillation across all IPC settings. Experiments on Tiny ImageNet and ImageNet
subsets show that IGDS significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly
in low-IPC regimes. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: SOSAE提供了一种高效且性能优越的自编码器隐藏层调整方法。

Abstract: The process of tuning the size of the hidden layers for autoencoders has the
benefit of providing optimally compressed representations for the input data.
However, such hyper-parameter tuning process would take a lot of computation
and time effort with grid search as the default option. In this paper, we
introduce the Self-Organization Regularization for Autoencoders that
dynamically adapts the dimensionality of the feature space to the optimal size.
Inspired by physics concepts, Self-Organizing Sparse AutoEncoder (SOSAE)
induces sparsity in feature space in a structured way that permits the
truncation of the non-active part of the feature vector without any loss of
information. This is done by penalizing the autoencoder based on the magnitude
and the positional index of the feature vector dimensions, which during
training constricts the feature space in both terms. Extensive experiments on
various datasets show that our SOSAE can tune the feature space dimensionality
up to 130 times lesser Floating-point Operations (FLOPs) than other baselines
while maintaining the same quality of tuning and performance.

Abstract: To address the challenges posed by the heavy reliance of multi-output models
on preset probability distributions and embedded prior knowledge in
non-injective regression tasks, this paper proposes a cycle consistency-based
data-driven training framework. The method jointly optimizes a forward model
{\Phi}: X to Y and a backward model {\Psi}: Y to X, where the cycle consistency
loss is defined as L _cycleb equal L(Y reduce {\Phi}({\Psi}(Y))) (and vice
versa). By minimizing this loss, the framework establishes a closed-loop
mechanism integrating generation and validation phases, eliminating the need
for manual rule design or prior distribution assumptions. Experiments on
normalized synthetic and simulated datasets demonstrate that the proposed
method achieves a cycle reconstruction error below 0.003, achieving an
improvement of approximately 30% in evaluation metrics compared to baseline
models without cycle consistency. Furthermore, the framework supports
unsupervised learning and significantly reduces reliance on manual
intervention, demonstrating potential advantages in non-injective regression
tasks.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training of a global model in
the centralized server with data from multiple parties while preserving
privacy. However, data heterogeneity can significantly degrade the performance
of the global model when each party uses datasets from different sources to
train a local model, thereby affecting personalized local models. Among various
cases of data heterogeneity, feature drift, feature space difference among
parties, is prevalent in real-life data but remains largely unexplored. Feature
drift can distract feature extraction learning in clients and thus lead to poor
feature extraction and classification performance. To tackle the problem of
feature drift in FL, we propose FedPall, an FL framework that utilizes
prototype-based adversarial learning to unify feature spaces and collaborative
learning to reinforce class information within the features. Moreover, FedPall
leverages mixed features generated from global prototypes and local features to
enhance the global classifier with classification-relevant information from a
global perspective. Evaluation results on three representative feature-drifted
datasets demonstrate FedPall's consistently superior performance in

Motivation: 冷启动节点分类在多模态图中具有挑战性，因为节点孤立且模态缺失。现有方法通过降级模型为MLP解决孤立性问题，但牺牲了模型能力。

Method: NTSFormer通过冷启动注意力掩码同时生成基于自信息和邻居信息的预测，避免降级为MLP，并利用MoE输入投影和Transformer层处理多模态数据。

Result: 实验结果表明，NTSFormer在多模态冷启动节点分类任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: NTSFormer有效解决了冷启动节点的孤立性和模态缺失问题，提升了分类性能。

Abstract: Cold-start node classification on multimodal graphs is challenging because
cold-start nodes are isolated (i.e., no edges) and often have missing
modalities (e.g., absent text or image features). Existing methods address
structural isolation by degrading graph learning models to MLPs for cold-start
inference, using a teacher model (with graph access) to guide the MLP. However,
this results in limited model capacity in the student, which is further
challenged when modalities are missing. In this paper, we propose
Neighbor-to-Self Graph Transformer (NTSFormer), a unified Graph Transformer
framework that jointly tackles the isolation and missing-modality issues via a
self-teaching paradigm. Specifically, NTSFormer uses a cold-start attention
mask to simultaneously make two predictions for each node: a "student"
prediction based only on self-information (i.e., the node's own features), and
a "teacher" prediction incorporating both self and neighbor information. This
enables the model to supervise itself without degrading to an MLP, thereby
fully leveraging the Transformer's capacity to handle missing modalities. To
handle diverse graph information and missing modalities, NTSFormer performs a
one-time multimodal graph pre-computation that converts structural and feature
data into token sequences, which are then processed by a Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) Input Projection and Transformer layers for effective fusion.
Experimental results on public datasets show that NTSFormer achieves superior
performance on multimodal cold-start node classification tasks.

Motivation: 现实应用中，数据点标注成本差异和预算限制阻碍了主动学习策略的采用，因此需要开发适应这些约束的高效策略。

Method: 提出了两种策略：动态阈值策略（动态分配预算）和贪婪策略（按预算逐步选择样本），均基于贝叶斯神经网络的不确定性度量。

Result: 在真实地理空间数据集上，ConBatch-BAL策略减少了主动学习迭代和数据获取成本，甚至优于无约束基线。

Conclusion: ConBatch-BAL策略在成本敏感的实际场景中具有显著优势，能够高效利用预算。

Abstract: Varying annotation costs among data points and budget constraints can hinder
the adoption of active learning strategies in real-world applications. This
work introduces two Bayesian active learning strategies for batch acquisition
under constraints (ConBatch-BAL), one based on dynamic thresholding and one
following greedy acquisition. Both select samples using uncertainty metrics
computed via Bayesian neural networks. The dynamic thresholding strategy
redistributes the budget across the batch, while the greedy one selects the
top-ranked sample at each step, limited by the remaining budget. Focusing on
scenarios with costly data annotation and geospatial constraints, we also
release two new real-world datasets containing geolocated aerial images of
buildings, annotated with energy efficiency or typology classes. The
ConBatch-BAL strategies are benchmarked against a random acquisition baseline
on these datasets under various budget and cost scenarios. The results show
that the developed ConBatch-BAL strategies can reduce active learning
iterations and data acquisition costs in real-world settings, and even
outperform the unconstrained baseline solutions.

Motivation: 现有基准主要关注孤立的成对评估，忽略了模型重建生物意义PPI网络的能力，PRING旨在填补这一空白。

Method: PRING构建了一个包含21,484个蛋白质和186,818个相互作用的高质量数据集，并设计了拓扑导向和功能导向的评估任务。

Result: 实验表明，当前PPI模型在恢复PPI网络的结构和功能特性方面存在局限性。

Conclusion: PRING为开发更有效的PPI预测模型提供了可靠平台。

Abstract: Deep learning-based computational methods have achieved promising results in
predicting protein-protein interactions (PPIs). However, existing benchmarks
predominantly focus on isolated pairwise evaluations, overlooking a model's
capability to reconstruct biologically meaningful PPI networks, which is
crucial for biology research. To address this gap, we introduce PRING, the
first comprehensive benchmark that evaluates protein-protein interaction
prediction from a graph-level perspective. PRING curates a high-quality,
multi-species PPI network dataset comprising 21,484 proteins and 186,818
interactions, with well-designed strategies to address both data redundancy and
leakage. Building on this golden-standard dataset, we establish two
complementary evaluation paradigms: (1) topology-oriented tasks, which assess
intra and cross-species PPI network construction, and (2) function-oriented
tasks, including protein complex pathway prediction, GO module analysis, and
essential protein justification. These evaluations not only reflect the model's
capability to understand the network topology but also facilitate protein
function annotation, biological module detection, and even disease mechanism
analysis. Extensive experiments on four representative model categories,
consisting of sequence similarity-based, naive sequence-based, protein language
model-based, and structure-based approaches, demonstrate that current PPI
models have potential limitations in recovering both structural and functional
properties of PPI networks, highlighting the gap in supporting real-world
biological applications. We believe PRING provides a reliable platform to guide
the development of more effective PPI prediction models for the community. The
dataset and source code of PRING are available at

Motivation: 传统方法在捕捉群体动态时可能因个体轨迹的复杂性而失效，DICE旨在通过学习平滑的群体动态来解决这一问题。

Method: DICE通过设计不变性损失函数，直接生成时间区间内的样本轨迹，避免了多步采样。

Result: DICE在训练稳定性和样本生成效率上优于其他方法，适用于随机波、高维混沌等问题。

Conclusion: DICE为学习群体动态提供了一种稳定、高效的方法，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: We introduce the Discrete Inverse Continuity Equation (DICE) method, a
generative modeling approach that learns the evolution of a stochastic process
from given sample populations at a finite number of time points. Models learned
with DICE capture the typically smooth and well-behaved population dynamics,
rather than the dynamics of individual sample trajectories that can exhibit
complex or even chaotic behavior. The DICE loss function is developed
specifically to be invariant, even in discrete time, to spatially constant but
time-varying spurious constants that can emerge during training; this
invariance increases training stability and robustness. Generating a trajectory
of sample populations with DICE is fast because samples evolve directly in the
time interval over which the stochastic process is formulated, in contrast to
approaches that condition on time and then require multiple sampling steps per
time step. DICE is stable to train, in situations where other methods for
learning population dynamics fail, and DICE generates representative samples
with orders of magnitude lower costs than methods that have to condition on
time. Numerical experiments on a wide range of problems from random waves,
Vlasov-Poisson instabilities and high-dimensional chaos are included to justify
these assertions.

Conclusion: 该教程为初学者提供了对KFAC的深入理解，并降低了其实现和应用的难度。

Abstract: Kronecker-factored approximate curvature (KFAC) is arguably one of the most
prominent curvature approximations in deep learning. Its applications range
from optimization to Bayesian deep learning, training data attribution with
influence functions, and model compression or merging. While the intuition
behind KFAC is easy to understand, its implementation is tedious: It comes in
many flavours, has common pitfalls when translating the math to code, and is
challenging to test, which complicates ensuring a properly functioning
implementation. Some of the authors themselves have dealt with these challenges
and experienced the discomfort of not being able to fully test their code.
Thanks to recent advances in understanding KFAC, we are now able to provide
test cases and a recipe for a reliable KFAC implementation. This tutorial is
meant as a ground-up introduction to KFAC. In contrast to the existing work,
our focus lies on providing both math and code side-by-side and providing test
cases based on the latest insights into KFAC that are scattered throughout the
literature. We hope this tutorial provides a contemporary view of KFAC that
allows beginners to gain a deeper understanding of this curvature approximation
while lowering the barrier to its implementation, extension, and usage in
practice.

Result: 与64位精度基线相比，显著减少了FPGA资源使用（FF减少82.3%，LUTs减少52.6%，Flash减少18.0%），并在ESP32微控制器上实现了4.67倍的平均推理加速。

Conclusion: 通过硬件/软件协同设计，成功实现了在TinyML硬件上高效计算神经符号AI的目标。

Abstract: Neurosymbolic AI (NSAI) has recently emerged to mitigate limitations
associated with deep learning (DL) models, e.g. quantifying their uncertainty
or reason with explicit rules. Hence, TinyML hardware will need to support
these symbolic models to bring NSAI to embedded scenarios. Yet, although
symbolic models are typically compact, their sparsity and computation
resolution contrasts with low-resolution and dense neuro models, which is a
challenge on resource-constrained TinyML hardware severely limiting the size of
symbolic models that can be computed. In this work, we remove this bottleneck
leveraging a tight hardware/software integration to present a complete
framework to compute NSAI with TinyML hardware. We focus on symbolic models
realized with tractable probabilistic circuits (PCs), a popular subclass of
probabilistic models for hardware integration. This framework: (1) trains a
specific class of hardware-efficient \emph{deterministic} PCs, chosen for the
symbolic task; (2) \emph{compresses} this PC until it can be computed on TinyML
hardware with minimal accuracy degradation, using our $n^{th}$-root compression
technique, and (3) \emph{deploys} the complete NSAI model on TinyML hardware.
Compared to a 64b precision baseline necessary for the PC without compression,
our workflow leads to significant hardware reduction on FPGA (up to 82.3\% in
FF, 52.6\% in LUTs, and 18.0\% in Flash usage) and an average inference speedup
of 4.67x on ESP32 microcontroller.

Wasserstein-2 loss function. We showcase the effectiveness of our proposed
approach in various uncertainty quantification tasks, including classification,
reconstructing the distribution of mixed random variables, and learning complex
noisy dynamical systems from spatiotemporal data.

Abstract: Many automated decision systems (ADS) are designed to solve prediction
problems -- where the goal is to learn patterns from a sample of the population
and apply them to individuals from the same population. In reality, these
prediction systems operationalize holistic policy interventions in deployment.
Once deployed, ADS can shape impacted population outcomes through an effective
policy change in how decision-makers operate, while also being defined by past
and present interactions between stakeholders and the limitations of existing
organizational, as well as societal, infrastructure and context. In this work,
we consider the ways in which we must shift from a prediction-focused paradigm
to an interventionist paradigm when considering the impact of ADS within social
systems. We argue this requires a new default problem setup for ADS beyond
prediction, to instead consider predictions as decision support, final
decisions, and outcomes. We highlight how this perspective unifies modern
statistical frameworks and other tools to study the design, implementation, and
evaluation of ADS systems, and point to the research directions necessary to
operationalize this paradigm shift. Using these tools, we characterize the
limitations of focusing on isolated prediction tasks, and lay the foundation
for a more intervention-oriented approach to developing and deploying ADS.

Abstract: As machine learning models grow increasingly competent, their predictions can

this paradigm, algorithms have emerged to combine a small amount of
high-fidelity observed data with a much larger set of imputed model outputs to
estimate some quantity of interest. Yet current hybrid-inference tools target
only means or single quantiles, limiting their applicability for many critical
domains and use cases. We present QuEst, a principled framework to merge
observed and imputed data to deliver point estimates and rigorous confidence
intervals for a wide family of quantile-based distributional measures. QuEst
covers a range of measures, from tail risk (CVaR) to population segments such
as quartiles, that are central to fields such as economics, sociology,
education, medicine, and more. We extend QuEst to multidimensional metrics, and
introduce an additional optimization technique to further reduce variance in
this and other hybrid estimators. We demonstrate the utility of our framework
through experiments in economic modeling, opinion polling, and language model
auto-evaluation.

Conclusion: Biaxialformer通过增强时空特征提取，提升了EEG信号解码的准确性，尤其在神经预后预测任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Accurate decoding of EEG signals requires comprehensive modeling of both
temporal dynamics within individual channels and spatial dependencies across
channels. While Transformer-based models utilizing channel-independence (CI)
strategies have demonstrated strong performance in various time series tasks,
they often overlook the inter-channel correlations that are critical in
multivariate EEG signals. This omission can lead to information degradation and
reduced prediction accuracy, particularly in complex tasks such as neurological
outcome prediction. To address these challenges, we propose Biaxialformer,
characterized by a meticulously engineered two-stage attention-based framework.
This model independently captures both sequence-specific (temporal) and
channel-specific (spatial) EEG information, promoting synergy and mutual
reinforcement across channels without sacrificing CI. By employing joint
learning of positional encodings, Biaxialformer preserves both temporal and
spatial relationships in EEG data, mitigating the interchannel correlation
forgetting problem common in traditional CI models. Additionally, a
tokenization module with variable receptive fields balance the extraction of
fine-grained, localized features and broader temporal dependencies. To enhance
spatial feature extraction, we leverage bipolar EEG signals, which capture
inter-hemispheric brain interactions, a critical but often overlooked aspect in
EEG analysis. Our study broadens the use of Transformer-based models by
addressing the challenge of predicting neurological outcomes in comatose
patients. Using the multicenter I-CARE data from five hospitals, we validate
the robustness and generalizability of Biaxialformer with an average AUC
0.7688, AUPRC 0.8643, and F1 0.6518 in a cross-hospital scenario.

Abstract: Bargaining games, where agents attempt to agree on how to split utility, are
an important class of games used to study economic behavior, which motivates a
study of online learning algorithms in these games. In this work, we tackle
when no-regret learning algorithms converge to Nash equilibria in bargaining
games. Recent results have shown that online algorithms related to Follow the
Regularized Leader (FTRL) converge to Nash equilibria (NE) in the last iterate
in a wide variety of games, including zero-sum games. However, bargaining games
do not have the properties used previously to established convergence
guarantees, even in the simplest case of the ultimatum game, which features a
single take-it-or-leave-it offer. Nonetheless, we establish that FTRL (without
the modifications necessary for zero-sum games) achieves last-iterate
convergence to an approximate NE in the ultimatum game along with a bound on
convergence time under mild assumptions. Further, we provide experimental
results to demonstrate that convergence to NE, including NE with asymmetric
payoffs, occurs under a broad range of initial conditions, both in the
ultimatum game and in bargaining games with multiple rounds. This work
demonstrates how complex economic behavior (e.g. learning to use threats and
the existence of many possible equilibrium outcomes) can result from using a
simple learning algorithm, and that FTRL can converge to equilibria in a more
diverse set of games than previously known.

Conclusion: QCAI填补了现有XAI方法的不足，为TCR-pMHC建模提供了更透明的机制解释。

Abstract: CD8+ "killer" T cells and CD4+ "helper" T cells play a central role in the
adaptive immune system by recognizing antigens presented by Major
Histocompatibility Complex (pMHC) molecules via T Cell Receptors (TCRs).
Modeling binding between T cells and the pMHC complex is fundamental to
understanding basic mechanisms of human immune response as well as in
developing therapies. While transformer-based models such as TULIP have
achieved impressive performance in this domain, their black-box nature
precludes interpretability and thus limits a deeper mechanistic understanding
of T cell response. Most existing post-hoc explainable AI (XAI) methods are
confined to encoder-only, co-attention, or model-specific architectures and
cannot handle encoder-decoder transformers used in TCR-pMHC modeling. To
address this gap, we propose Quantifying Cross-Attention Interaction (QCAI), a
new post-hoc method designed to interpret the cross-attention mechanisms in
transformer decoders. Quantitative evaluation is a challenge for XAI methods;
we have compiled TCR-XAI, a benchmark consisting of 274 experimentally
determined TCR-pMHC structures to serve as ground truth for binding. Using
these structures we compute physical distances between relevant amino acid
residues in the TCR-pMHC interaction region and evaluate how well our method
and others estimate the importance of residues in this region across the
dataset. We show that QCAI achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
interpretability and prediction accuracy under the TCR-XAI benchmark.

Abstract: Causal forest methods are powerful tools in causal inference. Similar to
traditional random forest in machine learning, causal forest independently
considers each causal tree. However, this independence consideration increases
the likelihood that classification errors in one tree are repeated in others,
potentially leading to significant bias in causal e ect estimation. In this
paper, we propose a novel approach that establishes connections between causal
trees through the Limit Inferior Leaf Interval (LILI) clustering algorithm.
LILIs are constructed based on the leaves of all causal trees, emphasizing the
similarity of dataset confounders. When two instances with di erent treatments
are grouped into the same leaf across a su cient number of causal trees, they
are treated as counterfactual outcomes of each other. Through this clustering
mechanism, LILI clustering reduces bias present in traditional causal tree
methods and enhances the prediction accuracy for the average treatment e ect
(ATE). By integrating LILIs into a causal forest, we develop an e cient causal
inference method. Moreover, we explore several key properties of LILI by
relating it to the concepts of limit inferior and limit superior in the set
theory. Theoretical analysis rigorously proves the convergence of the estimated
ATE using LILI clustering. Empirically, extensive comparative experiments
demonstrate the superior performance of LILI clustering.

Conclusion: GAST-Mamba为高度欠采样MRF采集提供了准确且鲁棒的替代方案。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) enables fast quantitative imaging by
matching signal evolutions to a predefined dictionary. However, conventional
dictionary matching suffers from exponential growth in computational cost and
memory usage as the number of parameters increases, limiting its scalability to
multi-parametric mapping. To address this, recent work has explored deep
learning-based approaches as alternatives to DM. We propose GAST-Mamba, an
end-to-end framework that combines a dual Mamba-based encoder with a Gate-Aware
Spatial-Temporal (GAST) processor. Built on structured state-space models, our
architecture efficiently captures long-range spatial dependencies with linear
complexity. On 5 times accelerated simulated MRF data (200 frames), GAST-Mamba
achieved a T1 PSNR of 33.12~dB, outperforming SCQ (31.69~dB). For T2 mapping,
it reached a PSNR of 30.62~dB and SSIM of 0.9124. In vivo experiments further
demonstrated improved anatomical detail and reduced artifacts. Ablation studies
confirmed that each component contributes to performance, with the GAST module
being particularly important under strong undersampling. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of GAST-Mamba for accurate and robust
reconstruction from highly undersampled MRF acquisitions, offering a scalable

Motivation: 现有矩阵ISA在运行GEMM时性能不足，尤其是对小、高或瘦矩阵的处理不佳，且缺乏动态适应性。

Abstract: GEneral Matrix Multiplications (GEMMs) are recurrent in high-performance
computing and deep learning workloads. Typically, high-end CPUs accelerate GEMM
workloads with Single-Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) or vector Instruction
Set Architectures (ISAs). Since these ISAs face significant issues when running
GEMM workloads, particularly when dealing with small, tall, or skinny matrices,
matrix ISAs have been proposed and implemented by major hardware vendors in the
last years. Although these matrix ISAs deliver larger throughput when running
GEMMs than their SIMD/vector counterparts, they are rigid solutions unable to
dynamically adapt themselves to application-specific aspects like the data
format. This paper demonstrates that the state-of-the-art matrix ISAs deliver
suboptimal performance when running the most commonly used convolution and
transformer models.
  This paper proposes the Matrix Tile Extension (MTE), the first matrix ISA
that completely decouples the instruction set architecture from the
microarchitecture and seamlessly interacts with existing vector ISAs. MTE
incurs minimal implementation overhead since it only requires a few additional
instructions and a 64-bit Control Status Register (CSR) to keep its state.
Specifically, MTE can i) vectorize GEMMs across the three dimensions M, N, and
K; ii) leverage the capacity of the existing vector register file; and iii)
decouple the tile shape from the underlying microarchitecture. MTE achieves
speed-ups of 1.35x over the best state-of-the-art matrix ISA.

Conclusion: 通过算法属性而非模型结构分析，揭示了扩散模型中独特的泛化机制。

Abstract: The success of denoising diffusion models raises important questions
regarding their generalisation behaviour, particularly in high-dimensional
settings. Notably, it has been shown that when training and sampling are
performed perfectly, these models memorise training data -- implying that some
form of regularisation is essential for generalisation. Existing theoretical
analyses primarily rely on algorithm-independent techniques such as uniform
convergence, heavily utilising model structure to obtain generalisation bounds.
In this work, we instead leverage the algorithmic aspects that promote
generalisation in diffusion models, developing a general theory of
algorithm-dependent generalisation for this setting. Borrowing from the
framework of algorithmic stability, we introduce the notion of score stability,
which quantifies the sensitivity of score-matching algorithms to dataset
perturbations. We derive generalisation bounds in terms of score stability, and
apply our framework to several fundamental learning settings, identifying
sources of regularisation. In particular, we consider denoising score matching
with early stopping (denoising regularisation), sampler-wide coarse
discretisation (sampler regularisation) and optimising with SGD (optimisation
regularisation). By grounding our analysis in algorithmic properties rather
than model structure, we identify multiple sources of implicit regularisation
unique to diffusion models that have so far been overlooked in the literature.

Abstract: Modern recommender systems operate in uniquely dynamic settings: user
interests, item pools, and popularity trends shift continuously, and models
must adapt in real time without forgetting past preferences. While existing
tutorials on continual or lifelong learning cover broad machine learning
domains (e.g., vision and graphs), they do not address recommendation-specific
demands-such as balancing stability and plasticity per user, handling
cold-start items, and optimizing recommendation metrics under streaming
feedback. This tutorial aims to make a timely contribution by filling that gap.
We begin by reviewing the background and problem settings, followed by a
comprehensive overview of existing approaches. We then highlight recent efforts
to apply continual learning to practical deployment environments, such as
resource-constrained systems and sequential interaction settings. Finally, we
discuss open challenges and future research directions. We expect this tutorial
to benefit researchers and practitioners in recommender systems, data mining,
AI, and information retrieval across academia and industry.

Result: 在Julia实验中，QMME优于多种一阶和二阶方法，并能更高效处理大投影维度的草图矩阵。

Conclusion: QMME在迭代成本和收敛速度之间取得了平衡，并在实际应用中表现出色。

Abstract: First-order methods in convex optimization offer low per-iteration cost but
often suffer from slow convergence, while second-order methods achieve fast
local convergence at the expense of costly Hessian inversions. In this paper,
we highlight a middle ground: minimizing a quadratic majorant with fixed
curvature at each iteration. This strategy strikes a balance between
per-iteration cost and convergence speed, and crucially allows the reuse of
matrix decompositions, such as Cholesky or spectral decompositions, across
iterations and varying regularization parameters. We introduce the Quadratic
Majorization Minimization with Extrapolation (QMME) framework and establish its
sequential convergence properties under standard assumptions. The new
perspective of our analysis is to center the arguments around the induced norm
of the curvature matrix $H$. To demonstrate practical advantages, we apply QMME
to large-scale kernel regularized learning problems. In particular, we propose
a novel Sylvester equation modelling technique for kernel multinomial
regression. In Julia-based experiments, QMME compares favorably against various
established first- and second-order methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
our algorithms complement existing kernel approximation techniques through more
efficiently handling sketching matrices with large projection dimensions. Our
numerical experiments and real data analysis are available and fully

Conclusion: 量子计算为BwK问题提供了新的优化方向，首次将资源约束引入量子多臂老虎机研究。

Abstract: Bandits with knapsacks (BwK) constitute a fundamental model that combines
aspects of stochastic integer programming with online learning. Classical
algorithms for BwK with a time horizon $T$ achieve a problem-independent regret
bound of ${O}(\sqrt{T})$ and a problem-dependent bound of ${O}(\log T)$. In
this paper, we initiate the study of the BwK model in the setting of quantum
computing, where both reward and resource consumption can be accessed via
quantum oracles. We establish both problem-independent and problem-dependent
regret bounds for quantum BwK algorithms. For the problem-independent case, we
demonstrate that a quantum approach can improve the classical regret bound by a
factor of $(1+\sqrt{B/\mathrm{OPT}_\mathrm{LP}})$, where $B$ is budget
constraint in BwK and $\mathrm{OPT}_{\mathrm{LP}}$ denotes the optimal value of
a linear programming relaxation of the BwK problem. For the problem-dependent
setting, we develop a quantum algorithm using an inexact quantum linear
programming solver. This algorithm achieves a quadratic improvement in terms of
the problem-dependent parameters, as well as a polynomial speedup of time
complexity on problem's dimensions compared to classical counterparts. Compared
to previous works on quantum algorithms for multi-armed bandits, our study is
the first to consider bandit models with resource constraints and hence shed
light on operations research.

Abstract: Perception-based neural network controllers are increasingly used in
autonomous systems that rely on visual inputs to operate in the real world.
Ensuring the safety of such systems under uncertainty is challenging. Existing
verification techniques typically focus on Lp-bounded perturbations in the
pixel space, which fails to capture the low-dimensional structure of many
real-world effects. In this work, we introduce a novel verification framework
for perception-based controllers that can generate outer-approximations of
reachable sets through explicitly modeling uncertain observations with
geometric perturbations. Our approach constructs a boundable mapping from
states to images, enabling the use of state-based verification tools while
accounting for uncertainty in perception. We provide theoretical guarantees on
the soundness of our method and demonstrate its effectiveness across benchmark
control environments. This work provides a principled framework for certifying
the safety of perception-driven control systems under realistic visual
perturbations.

Motivation: 在不确定性下的决策中，上下文鲁棒优化（CRO）通过最小化预测集上的最坏决策损失来提供可靠性。然而，下游决策严重依赖于模型选择，因此需要新的框架来统一鲁棒性控制与决策风险最小化。

Result: 数值结果表明，这些方法在多样化的合成和实际应用中显著提高了决策效率和鲁棒性，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CROiMS在温和假设下实现了渐近条件鲁棒性和决策效率，推动了协变量感知模型选择的发展。

Abstract: In decision-making under uncertainty, Contextual Robust Optimization (CRO)
provides reliability by minimizing the worst-case decision loss over a
prediction set, hedging against label variability. While recent advances use
conformal prediction to construct prediction sets for machine learning models,
the downstream decisions critically depend on model selection. This paper
introduces novel model selection frameworks for CRO that unify robustness
control with decision risk minimization. We first propose Conformalized Robust
Optimization with Model Selection (CROMS), which automatically selects models
to approximately minimize the average decision risk in CRO solutions. We
develop two algorithms: E-CROMS, which is computationally efficient, and
F-CROMS, which enjoys a marginal robustness guarantee in finite samples.
Further, we introduce Conformalized Robust Optimization with Individualized
Model Selection (CROiMS), which performs individualized model selection by
minimizing the conditional decision risk given the covariate of test data. This
framework advances conformal prediction methodology by enabling covariate-aware
model selection. Theoretically, CROiMS achieves asymptotic conditional
robustness and decision efficiency under mild assumptions. Numerical results
demonstrate significant improvements in decision efficiency and robustness
across diverse synthetic and real-world applications, outperforming baseline
approaches.

Result: 在四个数据集上的实验表明，EUPG在效用和遗忘效果上与精确遗忘方法相当，但显著降低了成本。

Conclusion: EUPG是一种高效且具有隐私保证的机器遗忘方法，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Privacy protection laws, such as the GDPR, grant individuals the right to
request the forgetting of their personal data not only from databases but also
from machine learning (ML) models trained on them. Machine unlearning has
emerged as a practical means to facilitate model forgetting of data instances
seen during training. Although some existing machine unlearning methods
guarantee exact forgetting, they are typically costly in computational terms.
On the other hand, more affordable methods do not offer forgetting guarantees
and are applicable only to specific ML models. In this paper, we present
\emph{efficient unlearning with privacy guarantees} (EUPG), a novel machine
unlearning framework that offers formal privacy guarantees to individuals whose
data are being unlearned. EUPG involves pre-training ML models on data
protected using privacy models, and it enables {\em efficient unlearning with
the privacy guarantees offered by the privacy models in use}. Through empirical
evaluation on four heterogeneous data sets protected with $k$-anonymity and
$\epsilon$-differential privacy as privacy models, our approach demonstrates
utility and forgetting effectiveness comparable to those of exact unlearning
methods, while significantly reducing computational and storage costs. Our code

Abstract: We propose a pre-trained BERT-like model for symbolic music understanding

To achieve this target, we design two novel pre-training objectives, namely
token correction and pianoroll prediction. First, we sample a portion of note
tokens and corrupt them with a limited amount of noise, and then train the
model to denoise the corrupted tokens; second, we also train the model to
predict bar-level and local pianoroll-derived representations from the
corrupted note tokens. We argue that these objectives guide the model to better
learn specific musical knowledge such as pitch intervals. For evaluation, we
propose a benchmark that incorporates 12 downstream tasks ranging from chord
estimation to symbolic genre classification. Results confirm the effectiveness
of the proposed pre-training objectives on downstream tasks.

Convergence, where model optimization can be achieved with high probability
given sufficient computational resources; and (2) Constructive Universal
Approximation: In the infinite sample setting, the model can approximate any
finite sum of measurable functions, each depending on only k out of p input
features, provided the architecture is properly tuned. Unlike most universal
approximation results that are agnostic to training procedures, our guarantees
are directly tied to the model's explicit construction and optimization
algorithm. To improve prediction stability, we integrate stochastic training
and bagging into the boosted 01Neuro framework. Empirical evaluations on
simulated and real-world tabular datasets with small to medium sample sizes
highlight its strengths: effective approximation of interaction components
(multiplicative terms), stable prediction performance (comparable to Random
Forests), robustness to many noisy features, and insensitivity to feature
scaling. A major limitation of the current implementation of boosted 01Neuro is
its higher computational cost, which is approximately 5 to 30 times that of
Random Forests and XGBoost.

why projecting time slices into a low-dimensional space and then concatenating
to form a history ('Tokenization') is so effective at learning physics
datasets, and characterise when exactly the underlying dynamics admit a
reconstruction mapping from the history of previous tokenized frames to the
next. To validate these claims, we develop a sequence of models with increasing
complexity, starting with least-squares regression and progressing through
simple linear layers, shallow adversarial learners, and ultimately full-scale
generative adversarial networks (GANs). We evaluate these models on a variety
of datasets, including modified forms of the heat and wave equations, the
chaotic regime 2D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and a challenging
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) dataset of a 2D K\'arm\'an vortex street

Abstract: With the increasing integration of smart meters in electrical grids
worldwide, detecting energy theft has become a critical and ongoing challenge.
Artificial intelligence (AI)-based models have demonstrated strong performance
in identifying fraudulent consumption patterns; however, previous works
exploring the use of machine learning solutions for this problem demand high
computational and energy costs, limiting their practicality -- particularly in
low-theft scenarios where continuous inference can result in unnecessary energy
usage. This paper proposes a lightweight detection unit, or watchdog mechanism,
designed to act as a pre-filter that determines when to activate a long
short-term memory (LSTM) model. This mechanism reduces the volume of input fed
to the LSTM model, limiting it to instances that are more likely to involve
energy theft thereby preserving detection accuracy while substantially reducing
energy consumption associated with continuous model execution. The proposed
system was evaluated through simulations across six scenarios with varying
theft severity and number of active thieves. Results indicate a power
consumption reduction exceeding 64\%, with minimal loss in detection accuracy
and consistently high recall. These findings support the feasibility of a more
energy-efficient and scalable approach to energy theft detection in smart
grids. In contrast to prior work that increases model complexity to achieve
marginal accuracy gains, this study emphasizes practical deployment
considerations such as inference efficiency and system scalability. The results
highlight the potential for deploying sustainable, AI-assisted monitoring
systems within modern smart grid infrastructures.

Abstract: Rare diseases affect an estimated 300-400 million people worldwide, yet
individual conditions often remain poorly characterized and difficult to
diagnose due to their low prevalence and limited clinician familiarity. While
computational phenotyping algorithms show promise for automating rare disease
detection, their development is hindered by the scarcity of labeled data and
biases in existing label sources. Gold-standard labels from registries and
expert chart reviews are highly accurate but constrained by selection bias and
the cost of manual review. In contrast, labels derived from electronic health
records (EHRs) cover a broader range of patients but can introduce substantial
noise. To address these challenges, we propose a weakly supervised,
transformer-based framework that combines a small set of gold-standard labels
with a large volume of iteratively updated silver-standard labels derived from
EHR data. This hybrid approach enables the training of a highly accurate and
generalizable phenotyping model that scales rare disease detection beyond the
scope of individual clinical expertise. Our method is initialized by learning
embeddings of medical concepts based on their semantic meaning or co-occurrence
patterns in EHRs, which are then refined and aggregated into patient-level
representations via a multi-layer transformer architecture. Using two rare
pulmonary diseases as a case study, we validate our model on EHR data from
Boston Children's Hospital. Our framework demonstrates notable improvements in
phenotype classification, identification of clinically meaningful subphenotypes
through patient clustering, and prediction of disease progression compared to
baseline methods. These results highlight the potential of our approach to
enable scalable identification and stratification of rare disease patients for
clinical care and research applications.

Abstract: In this work, we develop new generalization bounds for neural networks
trained on data supported on Riemannian manifolds. Existing generalization
theories often rely on complexity measures derived from Euclidean geometry,
which fail to account for the intrinsic structure of non-Euclidean spaces. Our
analysis introduces a geometric refinement: we derive covering number bounds
that explicitly incorporate manifold-specific properties such as sectional
curvature, volume growth, and injectivity radius. These geometric corrections
lead to sharper Rademacher complexity bounds for classes of Lipschitz neural
networks defined on compact manifolds. The resulting generalization guarantees
recover standard Euclidean results when curvature is zero but improve
substantially in settings where the data lies on curved, low-dimensional
manifolds embedded in high-dimensional ambient spaces. We illustrate the
tightness of our bounds in negatively curved spaces, where the exponential
volume growth leads to provably higher complexity, and in positively curved
spaces, where the curvature acts as a regularizing factor. This framework
provides a principled understanding of how intrinsic geometry affects learning
capacity, offering both theoretical insight and practical implications for deep
learning on structured data domains.

Conclusion: BERT4Traj能有效重建详细且连续的移动轨迹，增强对人类移动模式的洞察。

Abstract: Understanding human mobility is essential for applications in public health,
transportation, and urban planning. However, mobility data often suffers from
sparsity due to limitations in data collection methods, such as infrequent GPS
sampling or call detail record (CDR) data that only capture locations during
communication events. To address this challenge, we propose BERT4Traj, a
transformer based model that reconstructs complete mobility trajectories by
predicting hidden visits in sparse movement sequences. Inspired by BERT's
masked language modeling objective and self_attention mechanisms, BERT4Traj
leverages spatial embeddings, temporal embeddings, and contextual background
features such as demographics and anchor points. We evaluate BERT4Traj on real
world CDR and GPS datasets collected in Kampala, Uganda, demonstrating that our
approach significantly outperforms traditional models such as Markov Chains,
KNN, RNNs, and LSTMs. Our results show that BERT4Traj effectively reconstructs
detailed and continuous mobility trajectories, enhancing insights into human
movement patterns.

Result: LRTM成功重建了Sentinel-5P数据中的缺失值，尤其在云层遮挡等复杂情况下表现优异。

Conclusion: 低秩张量模型适用于大规模时空动态数据的填补与分析。

Abstract: In this study, we investigate for the first time the low-rank properties of a
tensorized large-scale spatio-temporal dynamic atmospheric variable. We focus
on the Sentinel-5P tropospheric NO2 product (S5P-TN) over a four-year period in
an area that encompasses the contiguous United States (CONUS). Here, it is
demonstrated that a low-rank approximation of such a dynamic variable is
feasible. We apply the low-rank properties of the S5P-TN data to inpaint gaps
in the Sentinel-5P product by adopting a low-rank tensor model (LRTM) based on
the CANDECOMP / PARAFAC (CP) decomposition and alternating least squares (ALS).
Furthermore, we evaluate the LRTM's results by comparing them with spatial
interpolation using geostatistics, and conduct a comprehensive spatial
statistical and temporal analysis of the S5P-TN product. The results of this
study demonstrated that the tensor completion successfully reconstructs the
missing values in the S5P-TN product, particularly in the presence of extended
cloud obscuration, predicting outliers and identifying hotspots, when the data
is tensorized over extended spatial and temporal scales.

Conclusion: ReTimeCausal有效解决了不规则采样和缺失数据下的因果发现问题。

Abstract: This paper studies causal discovery in irregularly sampled time series-a
pivotal challenge in high-stakes domains like finance, healthcare, and climate
science, where missing data and inconsistent sampling frequencies distort
causal mechanisms. Traditional methods (e.g., Granger causality, PCMCI) fail to
reconcile multi-scale interactions (e.g., hourly storms vs. decadal climate
shifts), while neural approaches (e.g., CUTS+) lack interpretability, stemming
from a critical gap: existing frameworks either rigidly assume temporal
regularity or aggregate dynamics into opaque representations, neglecting
real-world granularity and auditable logic. To bridge this gap, we propose
ReTimeCausal, a novel integration of Additive Noise Models (ANM) and
Expectation-Maximization (EM) that unifies physics-guided data imputation with
sparse causal inference. Through kernelized sparse regression and structural
constraints, ReTimeCausal iteratively refines missing values (E-step) and
causal graphs (M-step), resolving cross-frequency dependencies and missing data
issues. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that ReTimeCausal outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods under
challenging irregular sampling and missing data conditions.

Abstract: In the era of Industry 5.0, data-driven decision-making has become
indispensable for optimizing systems across Industrial Engineering. This paper
addresses the value of big data analytics by proposing a novel non-linear
hybrid approach for forecasting international tourist arrivals in two different
contexts: (i) arrivals to Hong Kong from five major source nations
(pre-COVID-19), and (ii) arrivals to Sanya in Hainan province, China
(post-COVID-19). The method integrates multiple sources of Internet big data
and employs an innovative game theory-based algorithm to identify opinion
leaders on social media platforms. Subsequently, nonstationary attributes in
tourism demand data are managed through Empirical Wavelet Transform (EWT),
ensuring refined time-frequency analysis. Finally, a memory-aware Stacked
Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Stacked BiLSTM) network is used to
generate accurate demand forecasts. Experimental results demonstrate that this
approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques and remains robust
under dynamic and volatile conditions, highlighting its applicability to
broader Industrial Engineering domains, such as logistics, supply chain

Abstract: The shape of a molecule determines its physicochemical and biological
properties. However, it is often underrepresented in standard molecular
representation learning approaches. Here, we propose using the Euler
Characteristic Transform (ECT) as a geometrical-topological descriptor.
Computed directly on a molecular graph derived from handcrafted atomic
features, the ECT enables the extraction of multiscale structural features,
offering a novel way to represent and encode molecular shape in the feature
space. We assess the predictive performance of this representation across nine
benchmark regression datasets, all centered around predicting the inhibition
constant $K_i$. In addition, we compare our proposed ECT-based representation
against traditional molecular representations and methods, such as molecular
fingerprints/descriptors and graph neural networks (GNNs). Our results show
that our ECT-based representation achieves competitive performance, ranking
among the best-performing methods on several datasets. More importantly, its
combination with traditional representations, particularly with the AVALON
fingerprint, significantly \emph{enhances predictive performance},
outperforming other methods on most datasets. These findings highlight the
complementary value of multiscale topological information and its potential for
being combined with established techniques. Our study suggests that hybrid
approaches incorporating explicit shape information can lead to more
informative and robust molecular representations, enhancing and opening new
avenues in molecular machine learning tasks. To support reproducibility and
foster open biomedical research, we provide open access to all experiments and

Abstract: Inconsistencies between clinical and omics data may arise within medical
cohorts. The identification, annotation and explanation of anomalous
omics-based patients or individuals may become crucial to better reshape the
disease, e.g., by detecting early onsets signaled by the omics and undetectable
from observable symptoms. Here, we developed MLASDO (Machine Learning based
Anomalous Sample Detection on Omics), a new method and software tool to
identify, characterize and automatically describe anomalous samples based on
omics data. Its workflow is based on three steps: (1) classification of healthy
and cases individuals using a support vector machine algorithm; (2) detection
of anomalous samples within groups; (3) explanation of anomalous individuals
based on clinical data and expert knowledge. We showcase MLASDO using
transcriptomics data of 317 healthy controls (HC) and 465 Parkinson's disease
(PD) cases from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. In this cohort,
MLASDO detected 15 anomalous HC with a PD-like transcriptomic signature and
PD-like clinical features, including a lower proportion of CD4/CD8 naive
T-cells and CD4 memory T-cells compared to HC (P<3.5*10^-3). MLASDO also
identified 22 anomalous PD cases with a transcriptomic signature more similar
to that of HC and some clinical features more similar to HC, including a lower
proportion of mature neutrophils compared to PD cases (P<6*10^-3). In summary,
MLASDO is a powerful tool that can help the clinician to detect and explain

Abstract: Scientific applications increasingly demand real-time surrogate models that
can capture the behavior of strongly coupled multiphysics systems driven by
multiple input functions, such as in thermo-mechanical and electro-thermal
processes. While neural operator frameworks, such as Deep Operator Networks
(DeepONets), have shown considerable success in single-physics settings, their
extension to multiphysics problems remains poorly understood. In particular,
the challenge of learning nonlinear interactions between tightly coupled
physical fields has received little systematic attention. This study addresses
a foundational question: should the architectural design of a neural operator
reflect the strength of physical coupling it aims to model? To answer this, we
present the first comprehensive, architecture-aware evaluation of DeepONet
variants across three regimes: single-physics, weakly coupled, and strongly
coupled multiphysics systems. We consider a reaction-diffusion equation with
dual spatial inputs, a nonlinear thermo-electrical problem with bidirectional
coupling through temperature-dependent conductivity, and a viscoplastic
thermo-mechanical model of steel solidification governed by transient
phase-driven interactions. Two operator-learning frameworks, the classical
DeepONet and its sequential GRU-based extension, S-DeepONet, are benchmarked
using both single-branch and multi-branch (MIONet-style) architectures. Our
results demonstrate that architectural alignment with physical coupling is
crucial: single-branch networks significantly outperform multi-branch
counterparts in strongly coupled settings, whereas multi-branch encodings offer
advantages for decoupled or single-physics problems. Once trained, these
surrogates achieve full-field predictions up to 1.8e4 times faster than
high-fidelity finite-element solvers, without compromising solution accuracy.

Abstract: Accurate electricity consumption forecasting is crucial for ensuring grid
stability and optimizing power generation, particularly in increasingly
decentralized and complex systems. While classical approaches such as
Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) remain widely used, they often fail to
capture the spatial dependencies inherent in energy networks. Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) offer a principled framework to incorporate this structure by
directly leveraging graph topologies. In this work, we evaluate a broad set of
GNN architectures -- including GCN, GraphSAGE, ChebConv, TAG, APPNP,
TransformerConv, and Graph Attention Networks (GAT and GATv2) -- on two
real-world electricity consumption datasets from France and the UK. Our
experiments show that while complex architectures like GATv2 and
TransformerConv do not consistently outperform their simpler counterparts,
models such as GCN and APPNP achieve strong results in low-data or highly
disaggregated settings. Nonetheless, the vanilla GAT remains highly competitive
across both datasets and offers an additional interpretability layer via
attention mechanisms. We perform a temporal analysis of attention weights,
revealing evolving patterns of regional interaction linked to seasonal and
meteorological variability. These results highlight that, although attention is
not universally superior, it provides valuable explanatory power when spatial
dependencies are prominent. Finally, we benchmark ensemble-based expert
aggregation strategies, showing that uniform or learned combinations can
enhance robustness and outperform individual models under data heterogeneity.

Abstract: Cosmological simulations provide a wealth of data in the form of point clouds
and directed trees. A crucial goal is to extract insights from this data that
shed light on the nature and composition of the Universe. In this paper we
introduce CosmoBench, a benchmark dataset curated from state-of-the-art
cosmological simulations whose runs required more than 41 million core-hours
and generated over two petabytes of data. CosmoBench is the largest dataset of
its kind: it contains 34 thousand point clouds from simulations of dark matter
halos and galaxies at three different length scales, as well as 25 thousand
directed trees that record the formation history of halos on two different time
scales. The data in CosmoBench can be used for multiple tasks -- to predict
cosmological parameters from point clouds and merger trees, to predict the
velocities of individual halos and galaxies from their collective positions,
and to reconstruct merger trees on finer time scales from those on coarser time
scales. We provide several baselines on these tasks, some based on established
approaches from cosmological modeling and others rooted in machine learning.
For the latter, we study different approaches -- from simple linear models that
are minimally constrained by symmetries to much larger and more
computationally-demanding models in deep learning, such as graph neural
networks. We find that least-squares fits with a handful of invariant features
sometimes outperform deep architectures with many more parameters and far
longer training times. Still there remains tremendous potential to improve
these baselines by combining machine learning and cosmology to fully exploit
the data. CosmoBench sets the stage for bridging cosmology and geometric deep
learning at scale. We invite the community to push the frontier of scientific
discovery by engaging with this dataset, available at

Abstract: Despite the success of deep learning methods in quantum chemistry, their

OrbitAll utilizes spin-polarized orbital features from the underlying quantum

OrbitAll demonstrates superior performance and generalization on predicting

rigorously compare our model to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as long
short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and minimalRNN and assess
their performances based on factors such as the length of prior visits and data
imbalance. We test the importance of different feature categories and visit
history, as well as compare the model to a newer Transformer-based model
optimized for time series. Our model demonstrates strong predictive performance
despite missing visits and missing features in available visits, particularly
in identifying converter subjects -- individuals transitioning to more severe
disease stages -- an area that has posed significant challenges in longitudinal
prediction. The results highlight the model's potential in enhancing early
diagnosis and patient outcomes.

Motivation: 实验室传感器异常检测需要快速适应新液体或传感器，传统方法可能耗时且复杂。

Conclusion: 该管道能在一小时内完成收集-训练-部署工作流，快速适应新场景。

Abstract: A lightweight, edge-deployable pipeline is proposed for detecting sensor
anomalies in chemistry and biology laboratories. A custom PCB captures seven
sensor channels and streams them over the local network. An Attention-based
One-Class Autoencoder reaches a usable state after training on only thirty
minutes of normal data. Despite the small data set, the model already attains
an F1 score of 0.72, a precision of 0.89, and a recall of 0.61 when tested on
synthetic micro-anomalies. The trained network is converted into a
TensorFlow-Lite binary of about 31 kB and runs on an Advantech ARK-1221L, a
fan-less x86 edge device without AVX instructions; end-to-end inference latency
stays below two seconds. The entire collect-train-deploy workflow finishes
within one hour, which demonstrates that the pipeline adapts quickly whenever a
new liquid or sensor is introduced.

Abstract: Urban socioeconomic modeling has predominantly concentrated on extensive
location and neighborhood-based features, relying on the localized population
footprint. However, networks in urban systems are common, and many urban
modeling methods don't account for network-based effects. In this study, we
propose using commute information records from the census as a reliable and
comprehensive source to construct mobility networks across cities. Leveraging
deep learning architectures, we employ these commute networks across U.S. metro
areas for socioeconomic modeling. We show that mobility network structures
provide significant predictive performance without considering any node
features. Consequently, we use mobility networks to present a supervised
learning framework to model a city's socioeconomic indicator directly,
combining Graph Neural Network and Vanilla Neural Network models to learn all
parameters in a single learning pipeline. Our experiments in 12 major U.S.
cities show the proposed model outperforms previous conventional machine
learning models. This work provides urban researchers methods to incorporate
network effects in urban modeling and informs stakeholders of wider
network-based effects in urban policymaking and planning.

Abstract: Differentiable programming that enables automatic differentiation through
simulation pipelines has emerged as a powerful paradigm in scientific
computing, supporting both forward and inverse modeling and facilitating
integration with deep learning frameworks. We present JAX-MPM, a
general-purpose differentiable meshfree solver within a hybrid
Lagrangian-Eulerian framework, tailored for simulating complex continuum
mechanics involving large deformations, frictional contact, and inelastic
material behavior, with emphasis on geomechanics and geophysical hazard
applications. Built on the material point method (MPM) and implemented using
the JAX computing framework, JAX-MPM is fully differentiable and
GPU-accelerated, enabling efficient gradient-based optimization directly
through time-stepping solvers. It supports joint training of physical models
and neural networks, allowing the learning of embedded closures and neural
constitutive models. We validate JAX-MPM on several 2D and 3D benchmarks,
including dam-breaks and granular collapses, demonstrating its accuracy and
performance. A high-resolution 3D granular cylinder collapse with 2.7 million
particles completes 1000 steps in ~22 seconds (single precision) and ~98
seconds (double precision) on a single GPU. Beyond forward modeling, we
demonstrate inverse modeling capabilities such as velocity field reconstruction
and spatially varying friction estimation. These results establish JAX-MPM as a
unified, scalable platform for differentiable meshfree simulation and
data-driven geomechanical inference.

Abstract: A hierarchical labeling system for mobile applications (apps) benefits a wide
range of downstream businesses that integrate the labeling with their
proprietary user data, to improve user modeling. Such a label hierarchy can
define more granular labels that capture detailed app features beyond the
limitations of traditional broad app categories. In this paper, we address the
problem of hierarchical multilabel classification for apps by using their
textual information such as names and descriptions. We present: 1) HMCN
(Hierarchical Multilabel Classification Network) for handling the
classification from two perspectives: the first focuses on a multilabel
classification without hierarchical constraints, while the second predicts
labels sequentially at each hierarchical level considering such constraints; 2)
HMCL (Hierarchical Multilabel Contrastive Learning), a scheme that is capable
of learning more distinguishable app representations to enhance the performance
of HMCN. Empirical results on our Tencent App Store dataset and two public
datasets demonstrate that our approach performs well compared with
state-of-the-art methods. The approach has been deployed at Tencent and the
multilabel classification outputs for apps have helped a downstream

regard to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov metric, for over one year.

Abstract: Contextual anomaly detection (CAD) aims to identify anomalies in a target
(behavioral) variable conditioned on a set of contextual variables that
influence the normalcy of the target variable but are not themselves indicators
of anomaly. In many anomaly detection tasks, there exist contextual variables
that influence the normalcy of the target variable but are not themselves
indicators of anomaly. In this work, we propose a novel framework for CAD,
normalcy score (NS), that explicitly models both the aleatoric and epistemic
uncertainties. Built on heteroscedastic Gaussian process regression, our method
regards the Z-score as a random variable, providing confidence intervals that
reflect the reliability of the anomaly assessment. Through experiments on
benchmark datasets and a real-world application in cardiology, we demonstrate
that NS outperforms state-of-the-art CAD methods in both detection accuracy and
interpretability. Moreover, confidence intervals enable an adaptive,
uncertainty-driven decision-making process, which may be very important in
domains such as healthcare.

Abstract: The growing adoption of domain-specific architectures in edge computing
platforms for deep learning has highlighted the efficiency of hardware
accelerators. However, integrating custom accelerators into modern machine
learning (ML) compilers remains a complex challenge due to the need for
significant modifications in compilation layers and specialized scheduling
techniques. Existing frameworks offer partial solutions and require users to
navigate intricate compiler internals.
  In this paper, we introduce a TVM-based compilation integration approach that
targets GEMM-based deep learning accelerators. Our approach abstracts the
complexities of compiler integration, enabling seamless integration of
accelerators without requiring in-depth knowledge of the underlying compiler.
Furthermore, we extend and incorporate design space exploration tools,
specifically CoSA, to automate efficient tensor scheduling, accounting for
factors such as uneven mapping and double buffering. Our framework is
benchmarked on the Gemmini accelerator, demonstrating performance comparable to
its specialized manually implemented toolchain.

Conclusion: 本文的分布依赖边界在多任务线性回归中提供了更精确的理论保证，尤其在数据分布“良好”时表现更优。

Abstract: Modern regression problems often involve high-dimensional data and a careful
tuning of the regularization hyperparameters is crucial to avoid overly complex
models that may overfit the training data while guaranteeing desirable
properties like effective variable selection. We study the recently introduced
direction of tuning regularization hyperparameters in linear regression across
multiple related tasks. We obtain distribution-dependent bounds on the
generalization error for the validation loss when tuning the L1 and L2
coefficients, including ridge, lasso and the elastic net. In contrast, prior
work develops bounds that apply uniformly to all distributions, but such bounds
necessarily degrade with feature dimension, d. While these bounds are shown to
be tight for worst-case distributions, our bounds improve with the "niceness"
of the data distribution. Concretely, we show that under additional assumptions
that instances within each task are i.i.d. draws from broad well-studied
classes of distributions including sub-Gaussians, our generalization bounds do
not get worse with increasing d, and are much sharper than prior work for very
large d. We also extend our results to a generalization of ridge regression,
where we achieve tighter bounds that take into account an estimate of the mean
of the ground truth distribution.

Abstract: Scenario-based testing is an indispensable instrument for the comprehensive
validation and verification of automated vehicles (AVs). However, finding a
manageable and finite, yet representative subset of scenarios in a scalable,
possibly unsupervised manner is notoriously challenging. Our work is meant to
constitute a cornerstone to facilitate sample-efficient testing, while still
capturing the diversity of relevant operational design domains (ODDs) and
accounting for the "long tail" phenomenon in particular. To this end, we first
propose an expressive and flexible heterogeneous, spatio-temporal graph model
for representing traffic scenarios. Leveraging recent advances of graph neural
networks (GNNs), we then propose a self-supervised method to learn a universal
embedding space for scenario graphs that enables clustering and similarity
search. In particular, we implement contrastive learning alongside a
bootstrapping-based approach and evaluate their suitability for partitioning
the scenario space. Experiments on the nuPlan dataset confirm the model's
ability to capture semantics and thus group related scenarios in a meaningful
way despite the absence of discrete class labels. Different scenario types
materialize as distinct clusters. Our results demonstrate how variable-length
traffic scenarios can be condensed into single vector representations that
enable nearest-neighbor retrieval of representative candidates for distinct
scenario categories. Notably, this is achieved without manual labeling or bias
towards an explicit objective such as criticality. Ultimately, our approach can
serve as a basis for scalable selection of scenarios to further enhance the
efficiency and robustness of testing AVs in simulation.

Abstract: We present a deep learning approach to extract physical parameters (e.g.,
mobility, Schottky contact barrier height, defect profiles) of two-dimensional
(2D) transistors from electrical measurements, enabling automated parameter
extraction and technology computer-aided design (TCAD) fitting. To facilitate
this task, we implement a simple data augmentation and pre-training approach by
training a secondary neural network to approximate a physics-based device
simulator. This method enables high-quality fits after training the neural
network on electrical data generated from physics-based simulations of ~500
devices, a factor >40$\times$ fewer than other recent efforts. Consequently,
fitting can be achieved by training on physically rigorous TCAD models,
including complex geometry, self-consistent transport, and electrostatic
effects, and is not limited to computationally inexpensive compact models. We
apply our approach to reverse-engineer key parameters from experimental
monolayer WS$_2$ transistors, achieving a median coefficient of determination
($R^2$) = 0.99 when fitting measured electrical data. We also demonstrate that
this approach generalizes and scales well by reverse-engineering electrical
data on high-electron-mobility transistors while fitting 35 parameters
simultaneously. To facilitate future research on deep learning approaches for
inverse transistor design, we have published our code and sample data sets

Abstract: Traditional GWAS has advanced our understanding of complex diseases but often
misses nonlinear genetic interactions. Deep learning offers new opportunities
to capture complex genomic patterns, yet existing methods mostly depend on
feature selection strategies that either constrain analysis to known pathways
or risk data leakage when applied across the full dataset. Further, covariates
can inflate predictive performance without reflecting true genetic signals. We
explore different deep learning architecture choices for GWAS and demonstrate
that careful architectural choices can outperform existing methods under strict
no-leakage conditions. Building on this, we extend our approach to a
multi-label framework that jointly models five diseases, leveraging shared
genetic architecture for improved efficiency and discovery. Applied to five
million SNPs across 37,000 samples, our method achieves competitive predictive
performance (AUC 0.68-0.96), offering a scalable, leakage-free, and
biologically meaningful approach for multi-disease GWAS analysis.

Abstract: A hypothesis testing algorithm is replicable if, when run on two different
samples from the same distribution, it produces the same output with high
probability. This notion, defined by by Impagliazzo, Lei, Pitassi, and Sorell
[STOC'22], can increase trust in testing procedures and is deeply related to
algorithmic stability, generalization, and privacy. We build general tools to
prove lower and upper bounds on the sample complexity of replicable testers,
unifying and quantitatively improving upon existing results.
  We identify a set of canonical properties, and prove that any replicable
testing algorithm can be modified to satisfy these properties without worsening
accuracy or sample complexity. A canonical replicable algorithm computes a
deterministic function of its input (i.e., a test statistic) and thresholds
against a uniformly random value in $[0,1]$. It is invariant to the order in
which the samples are received, and, if the testing problem is ``symmetric,''
then the algorithm is also invariant to the labeling of the domain elements,
resolving an open question by Liu and Ye [NeurIPS'24]. We prove new lower
bounds for uniformity, identity, and closeness testing by reducing to the case
where the replicable algorithm satisfies these canonical properties.
  We systematize and improve upon a common strategy for replicable algorithm
design based on test statistics with known expectation and bounded variance.
Our framework allow testers which have been extensively analyzed in the
non-replicable setting to be made replicable with minimal overhead. As direct
applications of our framework, we obtain constant-factor optimal bounds for
coin testing and closeness testing and get replicability for free in a large
parameter regime for uniformity testing.
  We also give state-of-the-art bounds for replicable Gaussian mean testing,
and, unlike prior work, our algorithm runs in polynomial time.

Abstract: Recent advances in protein structure prediction have achieved near-atomic
accuracy for well-folded proteins. However, current benchmarks inadequately
assess model performance in biologically challenging contexts, especially those
involving intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), limiting their utility in
applications such as drug discovery, disease variant interpretation, and
protein interface design. We introduce DisProtBench, a comprehensive benchmark
for evaluating protein structure prediction models (PSPMs) under structural
disorder and complex biological conditions. DisProtBench spans three key axes:
(1) Data complexity, covering disordered regions, G protein-coupled receptor
(GPCR) ligand pairs, and multimeric complexes; (2) Task diversity, benchmarking
twelve leading PSPMs across structure-based tasks with unified classification,
regression, and interface metrics; and (3) Interpretability, via the
DisProtBench Portal, which provides precomputed 3D structures and visual error
analyses. Our results reveal significant variability in model robustness under
disorder, with low-confidence regions linked to functional prediction failures.
Notably, global accuracy metrics often fail to predict task performance in
disordered settings, emphasizing the need for function-aware evaluation.
DisProtBench establishes a reproducible, extensible, and biologically grounded
framework for assessing next-generation PSPMs in realistic biomedical
scenarios.

Abstract: We train a neural network to predict distributional responses in gene
expression following genetic perturbations. This is an essential task in
early-stage drug discovery, where such responses can offer insights into gene
function and inform target identification. Existing methods only predict
changes in the mean expression, overlooking stochasticity inherent in
single-cell data. In contrast, we offer a more realistic view of cellular
responses by modeling expression distributions. Our model predicts gene-level
histograms conditioned on perturbations and outperforms baselines in capturing
higher-order statistics, such as variance, skewness, and kurtosis, at a
fraction of the training cost. To generalize to unseen perturbations, we
incorporate prior knowledge via gene embeddings from large language models
(LLMs). While modeling a richer output space, the method remains competitive in
predicting mean expression changes. This work offers a practical step towards
more expressive and biologically informative models of perturbation effects.

these generators-particularly when integrated into frameworks like PyTorch,

that even generators labeled ''crush-resistant'' (e.g., PCG, Philox) may fail
certain statistical tests. Surprisingly, we can observe some differences in
failure profiles between the native and framework-integrated versions of the
same algorithm, highlighting some implementation differences that may exist.

Motivation: 探讨外部扰动（如环境变化、捕食者）对群体稳定性的影响，填补了现有研究的空白。

Result: 揭示了群体在逃避检测和抗捕食能力之间的权衡关系，并通过SwaGen生成了优化的群体配置。

Conclusion: SwaGen可用于设计鲁棒的人工群体，并加深对自然群体动态的理解。

Abstract: Swarms, such as schools of fish or drone formations, are prevalent in both
natural and engineered systems. While previous works have focused on the social
interactions within swarms, the role of external perturbations--such as
environmental changes, predators, or communication breakdowns--in affecting
swarm stability is not fully understood. Our study addresses this gap by
modeling swarms as graphs and applying graph signal processing techniques to
analyze perturbations as signals on these graphs. By examining predation, we
uncover a "detectability-durability trade-off", demonstrating a tension between
a swarm's ability to evade detection and its resilience to predation, once
detected. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence for this trade-off,
explicitly tying it to properties of the swarm's spatial configuration. Toward
task-specific optimized swarms, we introduce SwaGen, a graph neural
network-based generative model. We apply SwaGen to resilient swarm generation
by defining a task-specific loss function, optimizing the contradicting
trade-off terms simultaneously.With this, SwaGen reveals novel spatial
configurations, optimizing the trade-off at both ends. Applying the model can
guide the design of robust artificial swarms and deepen our understanding of
natural swarm dynamics.

Abstract: Advancing the dynamics inference of power electronic systems (PES) to the
real-time edge-side holds transform-ative potential for testing, control, and

continu-ous-discrete dynamics on resource-constrained edge hardware remains a

leverages lightweight neural networks to substitute time-consuming matrix

which transforms sequential bottlenecks into highly parallel operation suitable

demonstrates that NSS achieves 23x speedup and 60% hardware resource reduction

Method: 通过数值近似积分误差并识别最小误差的支持大小，构建单尺度局部参考函数，无需访问模型参数值。

Result: 实验表明，所选支持大小与参数估计误差最小区域一致，且计算效率优于多尺度全局测试函数策略。

Conclusion: 该方法有效优化了测试函数选择，提高了计算效率和噪声鲁棒性。

Abstract: Weak form Scientific Machine Learning (WSciML) is a recently developed
framework for data-driven modeling and scientific discovery. It leverages the
weak form of equation error residuals to provide enhanced noise robustness in
system identification via convolving model equations with test functions,
reformulating the problem to avoid direct differentiation of data. The
performance, however, relies on wisely choosing a set of compactly supported
test functions.
  In this work, we mathematically motivate a novel data-driven method for
constructing Single-scale-Local reference functions for creating the set of
test functions. Our approach numerically approximates the integration error
introduced by the quadrature and identifies the support size for which the
error is minimal, without requiring access to the model parameter values.
Through numerical experiments across various models, noise levels, and temporal
resolutions, we demonstrate that the selected supports consistently align with
regions of minimal parameter estimation error. We also compare the proposed
method against the strategy for constructing Multi-scale-Global (and
orthogonal) test functions introduced in our prior work, demonstrating the
improved computational efficiency.

Abstract: Developing algorithms for real-life problems that perform well in practice
highly depends on the availability of realistic data for testing. Obtaining
real-life data for optimization problems in health care, however, is often
difficult. This is especially true for any patient related optimization
problems, e.g., for patient-to-room assignment, due to data privacy policies.
Furthermore, obtained real-life data usually cannot be published which
prohibits reproducibility of results by other researchers. Therefore, often
artificially generated instances are used. In this paper, we present
combinatorial insights about the feasibility of instances for the
patient-to-room assignment problem (PRA). We use these insights to develop a
configurable instance generator for PRA with an easy-to-use graphical user
interface. Configurability is in this case especially important as we observed
in an extensive analysis of real-life data that, e.g., the probability
distribution for patients' age and length of stay depends on the respective

Result: 在复杂NLOS环境中，该方法实现了0.39米的定位精度，比TDoA基线提高了73.6%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了NLOS条件下的定位精度，为工业环境中的UWB定位提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite their high accuracy, UWB-based localization systems suffer
inaccuracies when deployed in industrial locations with many obstacles due to
multipath effects and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions. In such
environments, current error mitigation approaches for time difference of
arrival (TDoA) localization typically exclude NLOS links. However, this
exclusion approach leads to geometric dilution of precision problems and this
approach is infeasible when the majority of links are NLOS. To address these
limitations, we propose a transformer-based TDoA position correction method
that uses raw channel impulse responses (CIRs) from all available anchor nodes
to compute position corrections. We introduce different CIR ordering, patching
and positional encoding strategies for the transformer, and analyze each
proposed technique's scalability and performance gains. Based on experiments on
real-world UWB measurements, our approach can provide accuracies of up to 0.39
m in a complex environment consisting of (almost) only NLOS signals, which is
an improvement of 73.6 % compared to the TDoA baseline.

Abstract: Randomized trials are typically designed to detect average treatment effects
but often lack the statistical power to uncover effect heterogeneity over
patient characteristics, limiting their value for personalized decision-making.
To address this, we propose the QR-learner, a model-agnostic learner that
estimates conditional average treatment effects (CATE) within the trial
population by leveraging external data from other trials or observational
studies. The proposed method is robust: it has the potential to reduce the CATE
prediction mean squared error while maintaining consistency, even when the
external data is not aligned with the trial. Moreover, we introduce a procedure
that combines the QR-learner with a trial-only CATE learner and show that it
asymptotically matches or exceeds the trial-only learner in terms of mean
squared error. We examine the performance of our approach in simulation studies
and apply the methods to a real-world dataset, demonstrating improvements in
both CATE estimation and statistical power for detecting heterogeneous effects.

Abstract: Quantum processors may enhance machine learning by mapping high-dimensional
data onto quantum systems for processing. Conventional quantum kernels, or
feature maps, for encoding data features onto a quantum circuit are currently
impractical, as the number of entangling gates scales quadratically with the
dimension of the dataset and the number of qubits. In this work, we introduce a
quantum kernel designed to handle high-dimensional data with a significantly
reduced number of qubits and entangling operations. Our approach preserves
essential data characteristics while promoting computational efficiency, as
evidenced by extensive experiments on benchmark datasets that demonstrate a
marked improvement in both accuracy and resource utilization, as compared to
state-of-the-art quantum feature maps. Our noisy simulations results combined
with lower resource requirements highlight our kernel's ability to function
within the constraints of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Through
numerical simulations and small-scale implementation on a superconducting
circuit quantum computing platform, we demonstrate that our scheme performs on
par or better than a set of classical algorithms for classification. Our
findings herald a promising avenue for the practical implementation of quantum
machine learning algorithms on near future quantum computing platforms.

Abstract: We develop a class of differentially private two-sample scale tests, called

These RPST tests are inspired both by recent differentially private extensions
of some common rank tests and some older modifications to non-private rank
tests. We present the asymptotic distribution of the RPST test statistic under
the null hypothesis, under a very general condition on the rank transformation.
We also prove RPST tests are differentially private, and that their type I
error does not exceed the given level. We uncover that the growth rate of the
rank transformation presents a tradeoff between power and sensitivity. We do
extensive simulations to investigate the effects of the tuning parameters and
compare to a general private testing framework. Lastly, we show that our
techniques can also be used to improve the differentially private signed-rank
test.

updating weights via gradient descent and a proximal algorithm to maintain a
valid probability density. Inspired by SINDy (Brunton et al. 2016), it
incorporates feature augmentation and Tikhonov regularization. For multivariate
normal weights, the proximal step is omitted to focus on parameter estimation.
The algorithm's effectiveness is demonstrated through experimental results in
regression and binary classification using real-world data.

Conclusion: 现代视角超越了Breiman的两种文化框架，展示了实现模型目标的新途径。

Abstract: In the famous Two Cultures paper, Leo Breiman provided a visionary
perspective on the cultures of ''data models'' (modeling with consideration of
data generation) versus ''algorithmic models'' (vanilla machine learning
models). I provide a modern perspective on these approaches. One of Breiman's
key arguments against data models is the ''Rashomon Effect,'' which is the
existence of many different-but-equally-good models. The Rashomon Effect
implies that data modelers would not be able to determine which model generated
the data. Conversely, one of his core advantages in favor of data models is
simplicity, as he claimed there exists an ''Occam Dilemma,'' i.e., an
accuracy-simplicity tradeoff. After 25 years of powerful computers, it has
become clear that this claim is not generally true, in that algorithmic models
do not need to be complex to be accurate; however, there are nuances that help
explain Breiman's logic, specifically, that by ''simple,'' he appears to
consider only linear models or unoptimized decision trees. Interestingly, the
Rashomon Effect is a key tool in proving the nullification of the Occam
Dilemma. To his credit though, Breiman did not have the benefit of modern
computers, with which my observations are much easier to make.
  Breiman's goal for interpretability was somewhat intertwined with causality:
simpler models can help reveal which variables have a causal relationship with
the outcome. However, I argue that causality can be investigated without the
use of single models, whether or not they are simple. Interpretability is
useful in its own right, and I think Breiman knew that too.
  Technically, my modern perspective does not belong to either of Breiman's Two
Cultures, but shares the goals of both of them - causality, simplicity,
accuracy - and shows that these goals can be accomplished in other ways,
without the limitations Breiman was concerned about.

clean and infected memory snapshots across multiple malware families and
operating systems, capturing detailed behavioural and environmental features.
Key design decisions include applying ethical and legal compliance, thorough
validation using both automated and manual methods, and comprehensive
documentation to ensure replicability and integrity. The dataset's distinctive
features enable modelling system states and transitions, facilitating RL-based
malware detection and response strategies. This resource is significant for

Conclusion: PASTIS为随机动力学过程的模型发现提供了统计基础、验证和实用的方法论框架。

Abstract: This thesis focuses on the discovery of stochastic differential equations
(SDEs) and stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) from noisy and
discrete time series. A major challenge is selecting the simplest possible
correct model from vast libraries of candidate models, where standard
information criteria (AIC, BIC) are often limited.
  We introduce PASTIS (Parsimonious Stochastic Inference), a new information
criterion derived from extreme value theory. Its penalty term, $n_\mathcal{B}
\ln(n_0/p)$, explicitly incorporates the size of the initial library of
candidate parameters ($n_0$), the number of parameters in the considered model
($n_\mathcal{B}$), and a significance threshold ($p$). This significance
threshold represents the probability of selecting a model containing more
parameters than necessary when comparing many models.
  Benchmarks on various systems (Lorenz, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, Lotka-Volterra for
SDEs; Gray-Scott for SPDEs) demonstrate that PASTIS outperforms AIC, BIC,
cross-validation (CV), and SINDy (a competing method) in terms of exact model
identification and predictive capability.
  Furthermore, real-world data can be subject to large sampling intervals
($\Delta t$) or measurement noise ($\sigma$), which can impair model learning
and selection capabilities. To address this, we have developed robust variants
of PASTIS, PASTIS-$\Delta t$ and PASTIS-$\sigma$, thus extending the
applicability of the approach to imperfect experimental data.
  PASTIS thus provides a statistically grounded, validated, and practical
methodological framework for discovering simple models for processes with
stochastic dynamics.

single function evaluation and a single gradient is available at the previously
chosen action $x_{t-1}$ for either the current cost function $f_t$ or the most
recent cost function $f_{t-1}$. When the switching cost is linear, online
algorithms with optimal order-wise competitive ratios are derived for the
frugal setting. When the gradient information is noisy, an online algorithm
whose competitive ratio grows quadratically with the noise magnitude is
derived.

non-dominated arms by adaptively collecting samples from the arms. We introduce

optimal guarantees in both the fixed-budget and the fixed-confidence settings.
Notably, we show that the difficulty of these tasks mainly depends on the
sub-optimality gaps of $h$ arms only. Our theoretical results are supported by

Abstract: Neural networks with a latency requirement on the order of microseconds, like
the ones used at the CERN Large Hadron Collider, are typically deployed on

consumption and latency. The algorithm achieves resource reduction similar to

inference on FPGAs. We show that the proposed algorithm can reduce on-chip
resources by up to a third for realistic, highly quantized neural networks
while simultaneously reducing latency, enabling the implementation of
previously infeasible networks.

Conclusion: MIOCP为控制问题提供了一种新的优化框架，能够同时优化策略和先验分布。

Abstract: In this paper, we formulate a mutual information optimal control problem
(MIOCP) for discrete-time linear systems. This problem can be regarded as an
extension of a maximum entropy optimal control problem (MEOCP). Differently
from the MEOCP where the prior is fixed to the uniform distribution, the MIOCP
optimizes the policy and prior simultaneously. As analytical results, under the
policy and prior classes consisting of Gaussian distributions, we derive the
optimal policy and prior of the MIOCP with the prior and policy fixed,
respectively. Using the results, we propose an alternating minimization
algorithm for the MIOCP. Through numerical experiments, we discuss how our
proposed algorithm works.

Motivation: 城市热岛效应在热浪期间加剧，对公共健康构成威胁。研究旨在通过分类驱动因素（D、U、L）和土地利用类型，为城市规划者提供一个可解释且高效的UHI缓解评估框架。

Method: 使用随机森林（RF）和极端梯度提升（XGB）训练WRF-SLUCM模型输出数据，构建基于LUT的模型，分类特征并允许可选权重分配。

Result: 基于LUT的模型在统计上显著优于其他模型，尤其在小尺度驱动因素（如地表发射率、反照率和叶面积指数）的敏感性分析中表现突出。

Conclusion: 该方法为城市规划者提供了一个直接且高效的UHI缓解评估框架，尽管仍需减少统计不确定性并在其他城市验证。

Abstract: Urban heat islands (UHIs) are often accentuated during heat waves (HWs) and
pose a public health risk. Mitigating UHIs requires urban planners to first
estimate how urban heat is influenced by different land use types (LUTs) and
drivers across scales - from synoptic-scale climatic background processes to
small-scale urban- and scale-bridging features. This study proposes to classify
these drivers into driving (D), urban (U), and local (L) features,
respectively. To increase interpretability and enhance computation efficiency,
a LUT-distinguishing machine learning approach is proposed as a fast emulator
for Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled to a Single-Layer Urban
Canopy Model (WRF-SLUCM) to predict ground- (TSK) and 2-meter air temperature
(T2). Using random forests (RFs) with extreme gradient boosting (XGB) trained
on WRF-SLUCM output over Zurich, Switzerland, during heatwave (HW) periods in
2017 and 2019, this study proposes LUT-based (LB) models that categorize
features by scales and practical controllability, allowing optional categorical
weighting. This approach enables category-specific feature ranking and
sensitivity estimation of T2 and TSK to most important small-scale drivers -
most notably surface emissivity, albedo, and leaf area index (LAI). Models
employing the LB framework are statistically significantly more accurate than
models that do not, with higher performance when more HW data is included in
training. With RF-XGB robustly performing optimal with unit weights, the method
substantially increase interpretability. Despite the needs to reduce
statistical uncertainties and testing the method on other cities, the proposed
approach offers urban planners a direct framework for feasibility-centered UHI
mitigation assessment.

Conclusion: KF-FedKL在数据不足和隐私保护需求下有效实现了非线性系统的协作线性化。

Abstract: Real-time control and estimation are pivotal for applications such as
industrial automation and future healthcare. The realization of this vision
relies heavily on efficient interactions with nonlinear systems. Therefore,
Koopman learning, which leverages the power of deep learning to linearize
nonlinear systems, has been one of the most successful examples of mitigating
the complexity inherent in nonlinearity. However, the existing literature
assumes access to accurate system states and abundant high-quality data for
Koopman analysis, which is usually impractical in real-world scenarios. To fill
this void, this paper considers the case where only observations of the system
are available and where the observation data is insufficient to accomplish an
independent Koopman analysis. To this end, we propose Kalman Filter aided
Federated Koopman Learning (KF-FedKL), which pioneers the combination of Kalman
filtering and federated learning with Koopman analysis. By doing so, we can
achieve collaborative linearization with privacy guarantees. Specifically, we
employ a straightforward yet efficient loss function to drive the training of a
deep Koopman network for linearization. To obtain system information devoid of
individual information from observation data, we leverage the unscented Kalman
filter and the unscented Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother. To achieve collaboration
between clients, we adopt the federated learning framework and develop a
modified FedAvg algorithm to orchestrate the collaboration. A convergence
analysis of the proposed framework is also presented. Finally, through
extensive numerical simulations, we showcase the performance of KF-FedKL under
various situations.

Abstract: This report presents our systems submitted to the audio-only and audio-visual
tracks of the DCASE2025 Task 3 Challenge: Stereo Sound Event Localization and
Detection (SELD) in Regular Video Content. SELD is a complex task that combines
temporal event classification with spatial localization, requiring reasoning
across spatial, temporal, and semantic dimensions. The last is arguably the
most challenging to model. Traditional SELD architectures rely on multichannel
input, which limits their ability to leverage large-scale pre-training due to
data constraints. To address this, we enhance standard SELD architectures with
semantic information by integrating pre-trained, contrastive language-aligned
models: CLAP for audio and OWL-ViT for visual inputs. These embeddings are
incorporated into a modified Conformer module tailored for multimodal fusion,
which we refer to as the Cross-Modal Conformer. Additionally, we incorporate
autocorrelation-based acoustic features to improve distance estimation. We
pre-train our models on curated synthetic audio and audio-visual datasets and
apply a left-right channel swapping augmentation to further increase the
training data. Both our audio-only and audio-visual systems substantially
outperform the challenge baselines on the development set, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our strategy. Performance is further improved through model
ensembling and a visual post-processing step based on human keypoints. Future
work will investigate the contribution of each modality and explore
architectural variants to further enhance results.

Abstract: Generative models of music audio are typically used to generate output based
solely on a text prompt or melody. Boomerang sampling, recently proposed for
the image domain, allows generating output close to an existing example, using
any pretrained diffusion model. In this work, we explore its application in the
audio domain as a tool for data augmentation or content manipulation.
Specifically, implementing Boomerang sampling for Stable Audio Open, we augment
training data for a state-of-the-art beat tracker, and attempt to replace
musical instruments in recordings. Our results show that the rhythmic structure
of existing examples is mostly preserved, that it improves performance of the
beat tracker, but only in scenarios of limited training data, and that it can
accomplish text-based instrument replacement on monophonic inputs. We publish
our implementation to invite experiments on data augmentation in other tasks

Motivation: 在资源受限设备上部署语音增强系统时，传统方法需要在性能和计算效率之间静态权衡。动态剪枝方法旨在解决这一问题，实现自适应资源分配。

Method: 通过动态剪枝技术，模型可以在不同利用率因子（UF）下运行，每个UF对应不同的性能/效率权衡。同时，一个路由子网络端到端训练以确定当前输入的最佳UF。

Result: 实验表明，动态剪枝方法在平均使用10%容量的情况下，语音质量与静态25%利用率相当或更好，同时减少了29%的乘法累加操作（MACs）。

Conclusion: 动态剪枝方法在语音增强任务中实现了Pareto最优，显著提升了资源利用效率。

Abstract: Speech enhancement (SE) enables robust speech recognition, real-time
communication, hearing aids, and other applications where speech quality is
crucial. However, deploying such systems on resource-constrained devices
involves choosing a static trade-off between performance and computational
efficiency. In this paper, we introduce dynamic slimming to DEMUCS, a popular
SE architecture, making it scalable and input-adaptive. Slimming lets the model
operate at different utilization factors (UF), each corresponding to a
different performance/efficiency trade-off, effectively mimicking multiple
model sizes without the extra storage costs. In addition, a router subnet,
trained end-to-end with the backbone, determines the optimal UF for the current
input. Thus, the system saves resources by adaptively selecting smaller UFs
when additional complexity is unnecessary. We show that our solution is
Pareto-optimal against individual UFs, confirming the benefits of dynamic
routing. When training the proposed dynamically-slimmable model to use 10% of
its capacity on average, we obtain the same or better speech quality as the
equivalent static 25% utilization while reducing MACs by 29%.

reliably generates amorphous structures up to 1000 times faster than
conventional simulations across processing conditions, compositions, and data
sources. Generated structures recovered the short- and medium-range order,
sampling diversity, and macroscopic properties of silica glass, as validated by
simulations and an information-theoretical strategy. Conditional generation
allowed sampling large structures at low cooling rates of 10$^{-2}$ K/ps to
uncover a ductile-to-brittle transition and mesoporous silica structures.
Extension to metallic glassy systems accurately reproduced local structures and
properties from both computational and experimental datasets, demonstrating how
synthetic data can be generated from characterization results. Our methods
provide a roadmap for the design and simulation of amorphous materials
previously inaccessible to computational methods.

Result: VIF方法在计算效率和准确性上优于现有方法，适用于非高斯似然，计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: VIF方法为高斯过程在大规模数据中的应用提供了高效且稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Gaussian processes are flexible, probabilistic, non-parametric models widely
used in machine learning and statistics. However, their scalability to large
data sets is limited by computational constraints. To overcome these
challenges, we propose Vecchia-inducing-points full-scale (VIF) approximations
combining the strengths of global inducing points and local Vecchia
approximations. Vecchia approximations excel in settings with low-dimensional
inputs and moderately smooth covariance functions, while inducing point methods
are better suited to high-dimensional inputs and smoother covariance functions.
Our VIF approach bridges these two regimes by using an efficient
correlation-based neighbor-finding strategy for the Vecchia approximation of
the residual process, implemented via a modified cover tree algorithm. We
further extend our framework to non-Gaussian likelihoods by introducing
iterative methods that substantially reduce computational costs for training
and prediction by several orders of magnitudes compared to Cholesky-based
computations when using a Laplace approximation. In particular, we propose and
compare novel preconditioners and provide theoretical convergence results.
Extensive numerical experiments on simulated and real-world data sets show that
VIF approximations are both computationally efficient as well as more accurate
and numerically stable than state-of-the-art alternatives. All methods are
implemented in the open source C++ library GPBoost with high-level Python and R
interfaces.

Conclusion: 该方法在隐私保护环境下实现了与非隐私保护方法相当的效果，为广告定向提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Major advertising platforms recently increased privacy protections by
limiting advertisers' access to individual-level data. Instead of providing
access to granular raw data, the platforms only allow a limited number of
aggregate queries to a dataset, which is further protected by adding
differentially private noise. This paper studies whether and how advertisers
can design effective targeting policies within these restrictive privacy
preserving data environments. To achieve this, I develop a probabilistic
machine learning method based on Bayesian optimization, which facilitates
dynamic data exploration. Since Bayesian optimization was designed to sample
points from a function to find its maximum, it is not applicable to aggregate
queries and to targeting. Therefore, I introduce two innovations: (i) integral
updating of posteriors which allows to select the best regions of the data to
query rather than individual points and (ii) a targeting-aware acquisition
function that dynamically selects the most informative regions for the
targeting task. I identify the conditions of the dataset and privacy
environment that necessitate the use of such a "smart" querying strategy. I
apply the strategic querying method to the Criteo AI Labs dataset for uplift
modeling (Diemert et al., 2018) that contains visit and conversion data from
14M users. I show that an intuitive benchmark strategy only achieves 33% of the
non-privacy-preserving targeting potential in some cases, while my strategic
querying method achieves 97-101% of that potential, and is statistically
indistinguishable from Causal Forest (Athey et al., 2019): a state-of-the-art
non-privacy-preserving machine learning targeting method.

Abstract: Spatial profiling technologies in biology, such as imaging mass cytometry
(IMC) and spatial transcriptomics (ST), generate high-dimensional,
multi-channel data with strong spatial alignment and complex inter-channel
relationships. Generative modeling of such data requires jointly capturing
intra- and inter-channel structure, while also generalizing across arbitrary
combinations of observed and missing channels for practical application.
Existing diffusion-based models generally assume low-dimensional inputs (e.g.,
RGB images) and rely on simple conditioning mechanisms that break spatial
correspondence and ignore inter-channel dependencies. This work proposes a
unified diffusion framework for controllable generation over structured and
spatial biological data. Our model contains two key innovations: (1) a
hierarchical feature injection mechanism that enables multi-resolution
conditioning on spatially aligned channels, and (2) a combination of
latent-space and output-space channel-wise attention to capture inter-channel
relationships. To support flexible conditioning and generalization to arbitrary
subsets of observed channels, we train the model using a random masking
strategy, enabling it to reconstruct missing channels from any combination of
inputs. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across both spatial and
non-spatial prediction tasks, including protein imputation in IMC and
gene-to-protein prediction in single-cell datasets, and show strong
generalization to unseen conditional configurations.

A total of 40 Longissimus lumborum samples, evenly split between HNB and HLB,
were obtained from a local hypermarket. Data analysis using Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) demonstrated distinct spectral patterns associated with chemical
changes, clearly separating the two beef varieties and accounting for 93.72% of
the total variance. ML models, including Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA),
Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest, Gradient
Boosting (GB), K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree (DT), Naive Bayes (NB), and
Neural Networks (NN), were implemented, optimized through hyperparameter

robustness and prevent overfitting. Random Forest provided the highest
predictive accuracy with a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Area Under
the Curve (AUC) of 0.8826, closely followed by the SVM model at 0.8747.
Furthermore, GB and NN algorithms exhibited satisfactory performances, with
cross-validation scores of 0.752. Notably, the NN model achieved the highest
recall rate of 0.7804, highlighting its suitability in scenarios requiring
heightened sensitivity. DT and NB exhibited comparatively lower predictive
performance. The LR and SVM models emerged as optimal choices by effectively
balancing high accuracy, precision, and recall. This study confirms that
integrating NIRS with ML techniques offers a powerful and reliable method for
meat authenticity, significantly contributing to detecting food fraud.

Abstract: Multimodal neuroimages, such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and
resting-state functional MRI (fMRI), offer complementary perspectives on brain
activities by capturing structural or functional interactions among brain
regions. While existing studies suggest that fusing these multimodal data helps
detect abnormal brain activity caused by neurocognitive decline, they are
generally implemented in Euclidean space and can't effectively capture
intrinsic hierarchical organization of structural/functional brain networks.
This paper presents a hyperbolic kernel graph fusion (HKGF) framework for
neurocognitive decline analysis with multimodal neuroimages. It consists of a
multimodal graph construction module, a graph representation learning module
that encodes brain graphs in hyperbolic space through a family of hyperbolic
kernel graph neural networks (HKGNNs), a cross-modality coupling module that
enables effective multimodal data fusion, and a hyperbolic neural network for
downstream predictions. Notably, HKGNNs represent graphs in hyperbolic space to
capture both local and global dependencies among brain regions while preserving
the hierarchical structure of brain networks. Extensive experiments involving
over 4,000 subjects with DTI and/or fMRI data suggest the superiority of HKGF
over state-of-the-art methods in two neurocognitive decline prediction tasks.
HKGF is a general framework for multimodal data analysis, facilitating
objective quantification of structural/functional brain connectivity changes

Abstract: The increasing proliferation of vending machines in public and commercial

leading to unplanned downtimes and elevated service costs. This research
presents a novel predictive maintenance framework tailored for vending machines
by leveraging Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and machine learning (ML)
algorithms. The proposed system continuously monitors machine components and
operating conditions in real time and applies predictive models to forecast
failures before they occur. This enables timely maintenance scheduling,
minimizing downtime and extending machine lifespan. The framework was validated
through simulated fault data and performance evaluation using classification
algorithms. Results show a significant improvement in early fault detection and
a reduction in redundant service interventions. The findings indicate that
predictive maintenance systems, when integrated into vending infrastructure,
can transform operational efficiency and service reliability.

Abstract: Multi-material 3D printing, particularly through polymer jetting, enables the
fabrication of digital materials by mixing distinct photopolymers at the micron
scale within a single build to create a composite with tunable mechanical
properties. This work presents an integrated experimental and computational
investigation into the composition-dependent mechanical behavior of 3D printed
digital materials. We experimentally characterize five formulations, combining
soft and rigid UV-cured polymers under uniaxial tension and torsion across
three strain and twist rates. The results reveal nonlinear and rate-dependent
responses that strongly depend on composition. To model this behavior, we
develop a physics-augmented neural network (PANN) that combines a partially
input convex neural network (pICNN) for learning the composition-dependent
hyperelastic strain energy function with a quasi-linear viscoelastic (QLV)
formulation for time-dependent response. The pICNN ensures convexity with
respect to strain invariants while allowing non-convex dependence on
composition. To enhance interpretability, we apply $L_0$ sparsification. For
the time-dependent response, we introduce a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to
predict viscoelastic relaxation parameters from composition. The proposed model
accurately captures the nonlinear, rate-dependent behavior of 3D printed
digital materials in both uniaxial tension and torsion, achieving high
predictive accuracy for interpolated material compositions. This approach
provides a scalable framework for automated, composition-aware constitutive

Motivation: 研究旨在改进现有方法对DrugMatrix数据集的补全效果，以更准确地反映原始数据分布并捕捉器官特异性变异。

Method: 采用张量补全方法，包括非负张量补全实现，并与传统的Canonical Polyadic分解和2维矩阵分解方法对比。

Abstract: We explore applying a tensor completion approach to complete the DrugMatrix
toxicogenomics dataset. Our hypothesis is that by preserving the 3-dimensional
structure of the data, which comprises tissue, treatment, and transcriptomic
measurements, and by leveraging a machine learning formulation, our approach
will improve upon prior state-of-the-art results. Our results demonstrate that
the new tensor-based method more accurately reflects the original data
distribution and effectively captures organ-specific variability. The proposed
tensor-based methodology achieved lower mean squared errors and mean absolute
errors compared to both conventional Canonical Polyadic decomposition and
2-dimensional matrix factorization methods. In addition, our non-negative
tensor completion implementation reveals relationships among tissues. Our
findings not only complete the world's largest in-vivo toxicogenomics database
with improved accuracy but also offer a promising methodology for future
studies of drugs that may cross species barriers, for example, from rats to
humans.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to compute three-dimensional Magnetohydrodynamic
equilibria by parametrizing Fourier modes with artificial neural networks and
compare it to equilibria computed by conventional solvers. The full nonlinear
global force residual across the volume in real space is then minimized with
first order optimizers. Already,we observe competitive computational cost to
arrive at the same minimum residuals computed by existing codes. With increased
computational cost,lower minima of the residual are achieved by the neural
networks,establishing a new lower bound for the force residual. We use
minimally complex neural networks,and we expect significant improvements for
solving not only single equilibria with neural networks,but also for computing
neural network models valid over continuous distributions of equilibria.

Result: 证明了$z$-变换方法在推导渐进行为结果中的有效性，特别是在无限维希尔伯特空间中的收敛行为。

Conclusion: $z$-变换方法为优化算法的渐进行为分析提供了强大的工具。

Abstract: The $z$-transform of a sequence is a classical tool used within signal
processing, control theory, computer science, and electrical engineering. It
allows for studying sequences from their generating functions, with many
operations that can be equivalently defined on the original sequence and its
$z$-transform. In particular, the $z$-transform method focuses on asymptotic
behaviors and allows the use of Taylor expansions. We present a sequence of
results of increasing significance and difficulty for linear models and
optimization algorithms, demonstrating the effectiveness and versatility of the
$z$-transform method in deriving new asymptotic results. Starting from the
simplest gradient descent iterations in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space,
we show how the spectral dimension characterizes the convergence behavior. We
then extend the analysis to Nesterov acceleration, averaging techniques, and
stochastic gradient descent.

Motivation: 解决高维回归中ICD-10代码作为预测变量时，OLS模型系数不稳定的问题，同时避免正则化方法丢弃重要预测变量的风险。

Method: 通过截断ICD-10代码的字符数（如从7位减少到6位），降低回归问题的维度，同时保留所有诊断代码类别的表示。

Result: 减少ICD-10代码的粒度可以提高OLS模型的系数稳定性，同时保持可解释性和准确性。

Conclusion: 降低ICD-10代码的粒度是一种有效的正则化策略，解释了为什么现实世界中的风险调整和成本模型更倾向于使用较宽泛的诊断分组。

Abstract: Cost models in healthcare research must balance interpretability, accuracy,
and parameter consistency. However, interpretable models often struggle to
achieve both accuracy and consistency. Ordinary least squares (OLS) models for
high-dimensional regression can be accurate but fail to produce stable
regression coefficients over time when using highly granular ICD-10 diagnostic
codes as predictors. This instability arises because many ICD-10 codes are
infrequent in healthcare datasets. While regularization methods such as Ridge
can address this issue, they risk discarding important predictors. Here, we
demonstrate that reducing the granularity of ICD-10 codes is an effective
regularization strategy within OLS while preserving the representation of all
diagnostic code categories. By truncating ICD-10 codes from seven characters
(e.g., T67.0XXA, T67.0XXD) to six (e.g., T67.0XX) or fewer, we reduce the
dimensionality of the regression problem while maintaining model
interpretability and consistency. Mathematically, the merging of predictors in
OLS leads to increased trace of the Hessian matrix, which reduces the variance
of coefficient estimation. Our findings explain why broader diagnostic
groupings like DRGs and HCC codes are favored over highly granular ICD-10 codes
in real-world risk adjustment and cost models.

Motivation: FxLMS在主动噪声控制中常用，但缺乏对噪声源空间区域先验知识的利用。通过低维流形约束自适应滤波器权重，可以提升性能。

Method: 训练自编码器对稳态自适应滤波器的系数进行编码，约束权重为解码器输出，并在潜在空间中进行更新。

Result: 在某些条件下，Latent FxLMS比标准FxLMS收敛更快，且稳态误差相当。

Conclusion: Latent FxLMS通过利用低维流形约束，提升了FxLMS的收敛效率。

Abstract: Filtered-X LMS (FxLMS) is commonly used for active noise control (ANC),
wherein the soundfield is minimized at a desired location. Given prior
knowledge of the spatial region of the noise or control sources, we could
improve FxLMS by adapting along the low-dimensional manifold of possible
adaptive filter weights. We train an auto-encoder on the filter coefficients of
the steady-state adaptive filter for each primary source location sampled from
a given spatial region and constrain the weights of the adaptive filter to be
the output of the decoder for a given state of latent variables. Then, we
perform updates in the latent space and use the decoder to generate the
cancellation filter. We evaluate how various neural network constraints and
normalization techniques impact the convergence speed and steady-state mean
squared error. Under certain conditions, our Latent FxLMS model converges in
fewer steps with comparable steady-state error to the standard FxLMS.

Conclusion: Photon Splatting具有实时适应性和可解释性，适用于未来6G网络规划。

Abstract: We present Photon Splatting, a physics-guided neural surrogate model for
real-time wireless channel prediction in complex environments. The proposed
framework introduces surface-attached virtual sources, referred to as photons,
which carry directional wave signatures informed by the scene geometry and
transmitter configuration. At runtime, channel impulse responses (CIRs) are
predicted by splatting these photons onto the angular domain of the receiver
using a geodesic rasterizer. The model is trained to learn a physically
grounded representation that maps transmitter-receiver configurations to full
channel responses. Once trained, it generalizes to new transmitter positions,
antenna beam patterns, and mobile receivers without requiring model retraining.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework through a series of
experiments, from canonical 3D scenes to a complex indoor cafe with 1,000
receivers. Results show 30 millisecond-level inference latency and accurate CIR
predictions across a wide range of configurations. The approach supports
real-time adaptability and interpretability, making it a promising candidate
for wireless digital twin platforms and future 6G network planning.

Abstract: Proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers are pivotal for sustainable
hydrogen production, yet their long-term performance is hindered by membrane
degradation, which poses reliability and safety challenges. Therefore, accurate
modeling of this degradation is essential for optimizing durability and
performance. To address these concerns, traditional physics-based models have
been developed, offering interpretability but requiring numerous parameters
that are often difficult to measure and calibrate. Conversely, data-driven
approaches, such as machine learning, offer flexibility but may lack physical
consistency and generalizability. To address these limitations, this study
presents the first application of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to
model membrane degradation in PEM electrolyzers. The proposed PINN framework
couples two ordinary differential equations, one modeling membrane thinning via
a first-order degradation law and another governing the time evolution of the
cell voltage under membrane degradation. Results demonstrate that the PINN
accurately captures the long-term system's degradation dynamics while
preserving physical interpretability with limited noisy data. Consequently,
this work introduces a novel hybrid modeling approach for estimating and
understanding membrane degradation mechanisms in PEM electrolyzers, offering a
foundation for more robust predictive tools in electrochemical system
diagnostics.

Result: 该模型在多个生产系统的真实数据集上表现优于传统时间序列模型和基于Transformer的方法。

Conclusion: 结合经典预测与拓扑数据分析提高了OEE预测准确性，有助于主动维护和生产决策。

Abstract: Purpose: Overall equipment efficiency (OEE) is a key manufacturing KPI, but
its volatile nature complicates short-term forecasting. This study presents a
novel framework combining time series decomposition and topological data
analysis to improve OEE prediction across various equipment, such as hydraulic
press systems.
  Methods: The approach begins by decomposing hourly OEE data into trend,
seasonal, and residual components. The residual, capturing short-term
variability, is modeled using a seasonal ARIMA with exogenous variables
(SARIMAX). These exogenous features include statistical descriptors and
topological summaries from related time series. To manage the high-dimensional
input space, we propose a hybrid feature selection strategy using recursive
feature elimination based on statistically significant SARIMAX predictors,
coupled with BIC-guided particle swarm optimization. The framework is evaluated
on real-world datasets from multiple production systems.
  Results: The proposed model consistently outperforms conventional time series
models and advanced transformer-based approaches, achieving significantly lower
mean absolute error and mean absolute percentage error.
  Conclusion: Integrating classical forecasting with topological data analysis
enhances OEE prediction accuracy, enabling proactive maintenance and informed
production decisions in complex manufacturing environments.

Abstract: This paper introduces KZImputer, a novel adaptive imputation method for
univariate time series designed for short to medium-sized missed points (gaps)
(1-5 points and beyond) with tailored strategies for segments at the start,
middle, or end of the series. KZImputer employs a hybrid strategy to handle
various missing data scenarios. Its core mechanism differentiates between gaps
at the beginning, middle, or end of the series, applying tailored techniques at
each position to optimize imputation accuracy. The method leverages linear
interpolation and localized statistical measures, adapting to the
characteristics of the surrounding data and the gap size. The performance of
KZImputer has been systematically evaluated against established imputation
techniques, demonstrating its potential to enhance data quality for subsequent
time series analysis. This paper describes the KZImputer methodology in detail

Empirical analysis demonstrates that KZImputer achieves particularly strong

Abstract: The discovery of new ionizable lipids for efficient lipid nanoparticle
(LNP)-mediated RNA delivery remains a critical bottleneck for RNA-based
therapeutics development. Recent advances have highlighted the potential of
machine learning (ML) to predict transfection efficiency from molecular
structure, enabling high-throughput virtual screening and accelerating lead

quality, ineffective feature representations, low predictive accuracy, and poor
generalizability. Here, we present LANTERN (Lipid nANoparticle Transfection
Efficiency pRedictioN), a robust ML framework for predicting transfection
efficiency based on ionizable lipid representation. We benchmarked a diverse
set of ML models against AGILE, a previously published model developed for
transfection prediction. Our results show that combining simpler models with
chemically informative features, particularly count-based Morgan fingerprints,
outperforms more complex models that rely on internally learned embeddings,
such as AGILE. We also show that a multi-layer perceptron trained on a
combination of Morgan fingerprints and Expert descriptors achieved the highest
performance ($\text{R}^2$ = 0.8161, r = 0.9053), significantly exceeding AGILE
($\text{R}^2$ = 0.2655, r = 0.5488). We show that the models in LANTERN
consistently have strong performance across multiple evaluation metrics. Thus,
LANTERN offers a robust benchmarking framework for LNP transfection prediction
and serves as a valuable tool for accelerating lipid-based RNA delivery systems

Abstract: Urban streets are essential public spaces that facilitate everyday physical
activity and promote health equity. Drawing on Henri Lefebvre's spatial triad,
this study proposes a conceptual and methodological framework to quantify
street-level exercise deprivation through the dimensions of conceived (planning
and structure), perceived (visual and sensory), and lived (practice and
experiential) urban spaces. We integrate multi-source spatial data-including
street networks, street-view imagery, and social media-using explainable
machine learning (SHAP analysis) to classify streets by their dominant
deprivation modes, forming a novel typology of spatial inequity. Results
highlight significant differences across urban contexts: older city cores
predominantly experience infrastructural constraints (conceived space), whereas
new development areas suffer from experiential disengagement (lived space).
Furthermore, by identifying spatial mismatches between population distribution
and exercise intensity, our study reveals localized clusters of latent
deprivation. Simulation experiments demonstrate that targeted improvements
across spatial dimensions can yield up to 14% increases in exercise
supportiveness. This research not only operationalizes Lefebvre's spatial
theory at the street scale but also provides actionable insights and
intervention guidelines, contributing to the broader goals of spatial justice
and urban health equity.

interest is given by \[ dX(t) = \xi + f(X(t))\, dt + g(X(t))\, dW_t + \gamma
\int_{\mathbb{Z}} z\, N(dt,dz), \] where \( W_t \) is a standard Brownian
motion, and \( N(dt,dz) \) is a Poisson random measure on \( (~\mathbb{R}_{+}

\lambda( \Lambda~\otimes~v~)~) \), with \( \lambda, \gamma > 0 \), \( \Lambda

TL;DR: COMPASS是一个基于模拟的推理框架，结合了基于分数的扩散模型和Transformer架构，用于天体物理学中的参数估计和贝叶斯模型比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高维、不完整和可变大小的恒星丰度数据集的分析问题，以及在天体物理模拟器中约束不确定物理的需求。

Method: 结合基于分数的扩散模型和Transformer架构，处理高维数据并评估40种核合成产量表的组合。

Result: COMPASS强烈支持NuGrid的AGB产量和IllustrisTNG模拟中使用的核心坍缩超新星产量，推断出陡峭的高质量IMF斜率和升高的Ia型超新星归一化。

Conclusion: 现代SBI方法可以稳健地约束天体物理模拟器中的不确定物理，并在分析复杂模拟数据时实现原则性模型选择。

Abstract: We present \texttt{COMPASS}, a novel simulation-based inference framework
that combines score-based diffusion models with transformer architectures to
jointly perform parameter estimation and Bayesian model comparison across
competing Galactic Chemical Evolution (GCE) models. \texttt{COMPASS} handles
high-dimensional, incomplete, and variable-size stellar abundance datasets. %
Applied to high-precision elemental abundance measurements, \texttt{COMPASS}
evaluates 40 combinations of nucleosynthetic yield tables. The model strongly
favours Asymptotic Giant Branch yields from NuGrid and core-collapse SN yields
used in the IllustrisTNG simulation, achieving near-unity cumulative posterior
probability. Using the preferred model, we infer a steep high-mass IMF slope
and an elevated Supernova\,Ia normalization, consistent with prior solar
neighbourhood studies but now derived from fully amortized Bayesian inference.
% Our results demonstrate that modern SBI methods can robustly constrain
uncertain physics in astrophysical simulators and enable principled model
selection when analysing complex, simulation-based data.

Conclusion: 框架适用于分析复杂区域挑战（如碳排放），并指出人类认为有意义的定性特征可能对模型不准确。

Abstract: This study proposes an analytical framework that integrates DBSCAN clustering
with the Elastic Net regression model to address multifactorial problems
characterized by structural complexity and multicollinearity, exemplified by
carbon emissions analysis. DBSCAN is employed for unsupervised learning to
objectively cluster features, while the Elastic Net is utilized for
high-dimensional feature selection and complexity control. The Elastic Net is
specifically chosen for its ability to balance feature selection and
regularization by combining L1 (lasso) and L2 (ridge) penalties, making it
particularly suited for datasets with correlated predictors. Applying this
framework to energy consumption data from 46 industries in China (2000-2019)
resulted in the identification of 16 categories. Emission characteristics and
drivers were quantitatively assessed for each category, demonstrating the
framework's capacity to identify primary emission sources and provide
actionable insights. This research underscores the global applicability of the
framework for analyzing complex regional challenges, such as carbon emissions,
and highlights qualitative features that humans find meaningful may not be

Abstract: Static timing analysis is a crucial stage in the VLSI design flow that
verifies the timing correctness of circuits. Timing analysis depends on the
placement and routing of the design, but at the same time, placement and
routing efficiency depend on the final timing performance. VLSI design flows
can benefit from timing-related prediction to better perform the earlier stages
of the design flow. Effective capacitance is an essential input for gate delay
calculation, and finding exact values requires routing or routing estimates. In
this work, we propose the first GNN-based post-layout effective capacitance
modeling method, GNN-Ceff, that achieves significant speed gains due to GPU
parallelization while also providing better accuracy than current heuristics.
GNN-Ceff parallelization achieves 929x speedup on real-life benchmarks over the

Abstract: Air pollution poses a critical health threat in cities worldwide, with
nitrogen dioxide levels in Cork, Ireland exceeding World Health Organization

Abstract: Cyclic peptides, characterized by geometric constraints absent in linear

we propose CP-Composer, a novel generative framework that enables zero-shot

decomposes complex cyclization patterns into unit constraints, which are
incorporated into a diffusion model through geometric conditioning on nodes and
edges. During training, the model learns from unit constraints and their random
combinations in linear peptides, while at inference, novel constraint
combinations required for cyclization are imposed as input. Experiments show
that our model, despite trained with linear peptides, is capable of generating
diverse target-binding cyclic peptides, reaching success rates from 38% to 84%

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel methodology for robustly estimating particle
size distributions from optical scattering measurements using constrained
Gaussian process regression. The estimation of particle size distributions is
commonly formulated as a Fredholm integral equation of the first kind, an
ill-posed inverse problem characterized by instability due to measurement noise
and limited data. To address this, we use a Gaussian process prior to
regularize the solution and integrate a normalization constraint into the
Gaussian process via two approaches: by constraining the Gaussian process using
a pseudo-measurement and by using Lagrange multipliers in the equivalent
optimization problem. To improve computational efficiency, we employ a spectral
expansion of the covariance kernel using eigenfunctions of the Laplace
operator, resulting in a computationally tractable low-rank representation
without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, we investigate two complementary
strategies for hyperparameter estimation: a data-driven approach based on
maximizing the unconstrained log marginal likelihood, and an alternative
approach where the physical constraints are taken into account. Numerical
experiments demonstrate that the proposed constrained Gaussian process
regression framework accurately reconstructs particle size distributions,
producing numerically stable, smooth, and physically interpretable results.
This methodology provides a principled and efficient solution for addressing
inverse scattering problems and related ill-posed integral equations.

Conclusion: TNOs颜色主要为原始形成时的特征。

Abstract: The origins of the colors of Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) represent a
crucial unresolved question, central to understanding the history of our Solar
System. Recent observational surveys have revealed correlations between the
eccentricity and inclination of TNOs and their colors. This has rekindled the
long-standing debate on whether these colors reflect the conditions of TNO
formation or their subsequent collisional evolution. In this study, we address
this question with 98.7% certainty, using a model-agnostic, data-driven
approach based on causal graphs. First, as a sanity check, we demonstrate how
our model can replicate the currently accepted paradigms of TNOs' dynamical
history, blindly and without any orbital modeling or physics-based assumptions.
In fact, our causal model (with no knowledge of the existence of Neptune)
predicts the existence of an unknown perturbing body, i.e., Neptune. We then
show how this model predicts, with high certainty, that the color of TNOs is
the root cause of their inclination distribution, rather than the other way
around. This strongly suggests that the colors of TNOs reflect an underlying
dynamical property, most likely their formation location. Moreover, our causal
model excludes formation scenarios that invoke substantial color modification
by subsequent irradiation. We therefore conclude that the colors of TNOs are
predominantly primordial.

Abstract: Fuel-free docking is a key operational technology for in-space assembly,
resupplying space stations, sample return missions, and formation keeping of
large-scale satellite swarms. The use of conventional propulsion systems,
including thrusters, can cause adverse effects at short distances, such as
sensor contamination, which may lead to the failure of the satellite or onboard
equipment. The magnetic field interaction control generated by magnetorquers
can overcome these weaknesses of propulsion. This actuation enables
simultaneous control of attitude and formation control among desired satellite
groups. The previous study typically uses the traditional dipole approximation
model of the exact magnetic field to reduce computation cost. However,
proximity operations often involve relatively short distances between
satellites, which can easily compromise the effectiveness of this
approximation. To avoid model errors that could result in satellite collisions,
we utilize a magnetic field model described by Biot-Savart's law, without
distance approximations (Near-field model), in consideration of short-distance
operations. To overcome the high computational cost associated with the coil
geometry and relative states information, a learning-based magnetic field
approximation is derived, and its effectiveness is shown in the docking
simulation of target and chaser satellites equipped with electromagnetic coils
on three axes. Our method significantly reduces the computational cost of the
exact magnetic model and possesses scalability that can accommodate an
increasing number of target satellites through parallel processing.

Abstract: Stormwater infrastructures are decentralized urban water-management systems
that face highly unsteady hydraulic and pollutant loadings from episodic
rainfall-runoff events. Accurately evaluating their in-situ treatment
performance is essential for cost-effective design and planning. Traditional
lumped dynamic models (e.g., continuously stirred tank reactor, CSTR) are

address these limitations, this study develops a composite operator-based
neural network (CPNN) framework that leverages state-of-the-art operator
learning to predict the spatial and temporal dynamics of hydraulics and
particulate matter (PM) in stormwater treatment. The framework is demonstrated
on a hydrodynamic separator (HS), a common urban treatment device. Results
indicate that the CPNN achieves R2 > 0.8 for hydraulic predictions in 95.2% of
test cases; for PM concentration predictions, R2 > 0.8 in 72.6% of cases and
0.4 < R2 < 0.8 in 22.6%. The analysis identifies challenges in capturing
dynamics under extreme low-flow conditions, owing to their lower contribution
to the training loss. Exploiting the automatic-differentiation capability of
the CPNN, sensitivity analyses quantify the influence of storm event loading on
PM transport. Finally, the potential of the CPNN framework for continuous,
long-term evaluation of stormwater infrastructure performance is discussed,
marking a step toward robust, climate-aware planning and implementation.

Abstract: We present a machine-learning based Volume Of Fluid method to simulate
multi-material flows on three-dimensional domains. One of the novelties of the
method is that the flux fraction is computed by evaluating a previously trained
neural network and without explicitly reconstructing any local interface
approximating the exact one. The network is trained on a purely synthetic
dataset generated by randomly sampling numerous local interfaces and which can
be adapted to improve the scheme on less regular interfaces when needed.
Several strategies to ensure the efficiency of the method and the satisfaction
of physical constraints and properties are suggested and formalized. Numerical
results on the advection equation are provided to show the performance of the
method. We observe numerical convergence as the size of the mesh tends to zero
$h=1/N_h\searrow 0$, with a better rate than two reference schemes.
