### [1] [LLMs Encode Harmfulness and Refusal Separately](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11878)
*Jiachen Zhao,Jing Huang,Zhengxuan Wu,David Bau,Weiyan Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

Relevance: 90.0

TL;DR: 论文发现LLMs内部对“有害性”的理解与“拒绝”行为是两个独立的概念，提出了一种新的安全机制（Latent Guard）来检测不安全输入并减少过度拒绝。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs是否真正理解有害性，而不仅仅是机械地拒绝有害指令。

Method: 通过识别和分析LLMs内部的“有害性”方向，与“拒绝”方向对比，验证其独立性。进一步探索了jailbreak方法和对抗性微调对模型内部有害性理解的影响。

Result: 发现LLMs对有害性的理解比拒绝行为更稳健，提出Latent Guard作为安全机制，性能优于Llama Guard 3 8B。

Conclusion: LLMs内部的有害性理解是独立且稳健的，为AI安全研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: LLMs are trained to refuse harmful instructions, but do they truly understand
harmfulness beyond just refusing? Prior work has shown that LLMs' refusal
behaviors can be mediated by a one-dimensional subspace, i.e., a refusal
direction. In this work, we identify a new dimension to analyze safety
mechanisms in LLMs, i.e., harmfulness, which is encoded internally as a
separate concept from refusal. There exists a harmfulness direction that is
distinct from the refusal direction. As causal evidence, steering along the
harmfulness direction can lead LLMs to interpret harmless instructions as
harmful, but steering along the refusal direction tends to elicit refusal
responses directly without reversing the model's judgment on harmfulness.
Furthermore, using our identified harmfulness concept, we find that certain
jailbreak methods work by reducing the refusal signals without reversing the
model's internal belief of harmfulness. We also find that adversarially
finetuning models to accept harmful instructions has minimal impact on the
model's internal belief of harmfulness. These insights lead to a practical
safety application: The model's latent harmfulness representation can serve as
an intrinsic safeguard (Latent Guard) for detecting unsafe inputs and reducing
over-refusals that is robust to finetuning attacks. For instance, our Latent
Guard achieves performance comparable to or better than Llama Guard 3 8B, a
dedicated finetuned safeguard model, across different jailbreak methods. Our
findings suggest that LLMs' internal understanding of harmfulness is more
robust than their refusal decision to diverse input instructions, offering a
new perspective to study AI safety

### [2] [IAM: Efficient Inference through Attention Mapping between Different-scale LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11953)

TL;DR: 论文提出了IAM框架，通过利用不同规模LLM间注意力矩阵的高相似性，优化推理效率，实现加速计算和减少KV缓存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在长上下文推理中的资源消耗问题，利用外部信息优化效率。

Method: 分析注意力矩阵相似性，设计IAM框架，通过小规模和大规模LLM间的注意力映射优化计算和缓存。

Result: IAM加速预填充15%，减少KV缓存使用22.1%，且不显著影响性能。

Conclusion: IAM是一种通用且与现有方法正交的优化工具，适用于不同系列模型。

Abstract: LLMs encounter significant challenges in resource consumption nowadays,
especially with long contexts. Despite extensive efforts dedicate to enhancing
inference efficiency, these methods primarily exploit internal sparsity within
the models, without leveraging external information for optimization. We
identify the high similarity of attention matrices across different-scale LLMs,
which offers a novel perspective for optimization. We first conduct a
comprehensive analysis of how to measure similarity, how to select mapping
Layers and whether mapping is consistency. Based on these insights, we
introduce the IAM framework, which achieves dual benefits of accelerated
attention computation and reduced KV cache usage by performing attention
mapping between small and large LLMs. Our experimental results demonstrate that
IAM can accelerate prefill by 15% and reduce KV cache usage by 22.1% without
appreciably sacrificing performance. Experiments on different series of models
show the generalizability of IAM. Importantly, it is also orthogonal to many
existing KV cache optimization methods, making it a versatile addition to the
current toolkit for enhancing LLM efficiency.

TL;DR: 研究通过可重复性实验探讨了LLMs如何处理事实与反事实信息的竞争，重点关注注意力头的作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs中注意力头在事实与反事实信息竞争中的作用，验证并调和近期三项研究的结果。

Method: 使用机制解释工具分析注意力头强度与事实输出比例的关系，评估抑制机制的竞争假设，研究注意力模式的领域特异性。

Result: 发现促进事实输出的注意力头通过通用复制抑制而非选择性反事实抑制实现，且其行为具有领域依赖性。

Conclusion: 注意力头行为是领域依赖的，更大模型表现出更专业和类别敏感的模式。

Abstract: This paper presents a reproducibility study examining how Large Language
Models (LLMs) manage competing factual and counterfactual information, focusing
on the role of attention heads in this process. We attempt to reproduce and
reconcile findings from three recent studies by Ortu et al., Yu, Merullo, and
Pavlick and McDougall et al. that investigate the competition between
model-learned facts and contradictory context information through Mechanistic
Interpretability tools. Our study specifically examines the relationship
between attention head strength and factual output ratios, evaluates competing
hypotheses about attention heads' suppression mechanisms, and investigates the
domain specificity of these attention patterns. Our findings suggest that
attention heads promoting factual output do so via general copy suppression
rather than selective counterfactual suppression, as strengthening them can
also inhibit correct facts. Additionally, we show that attention head behavior
is domain-dependent, with larger models exhibiting more specialized and
category-sensitive patterns.

Result: 代码和数学生成速度提升近5倍，通用聊天和知识任务提升约2.5倍，且无质量损失。

Conclusion: 该方法通过多令牌预测和优化策略，显著提升了自回归模型的推理效率。

Abstract: Autoregressive language models are constrained by their inherently sequential
nature, generating one token at a time. This paradigm limits inference speed
and parallelism, especially during later stages of generation when the
direction and semantics of text are relatively certain. In this work, we
propose a novel framework that leverages the inherent knowledge of vanilla
autoregressive language models about future tokens, combining techniques to
realize this potential and enable simultaneous prediction of multiple
subsequent tokens. Our approach introduces several key innovations: (1) a
masked-input formulation where multiple future tokens are jointly predicted
from a common prefix; (2) a gated LoRA formulation that preserves the original
LLM's functionality, while equipping it for multi-token prediction; (3) a
lightweight, learnable sampler module that generates coherent sequences from
the predicted future tokens; (4) a set of auxiliary training losses, including
a consistency loss, to enhance the coherence and accuracy of jointly generated
tokens; and (5) a speculative generation strategy that expands tokens
quadratically in the future while maintaining high fidelity. Our method
achieves significant speedups through supervised fine-tuning on pretrained
models. For example, it generates code and math nearly 5x faster, and improves
general chat and knowledge tasks by almost 2.5x. These gains come without any
loss in quality.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指令跟随评估数据集多为英语或机器翻译，限制了多语言场景的适用性。

Method: 通过结合翻译与验证的混合流程，创建了本地化的多语言基准。

Conclusion: 多语言指令跟随面临关键词一致性和跨语言约束的挑战，Marco-Bench-MIF为研究提供了工具。

Abstract: Instruction-following capability has become a major ability to be evaluated
for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing datasets, such as IFEval,
are either predominantly monolingual and centered on English or simply machine
translated to other languages, limiting their applicability in multilingual
contexts. In this paper, we present an carefully-curated extension of IFEval to
a localized multilingual version named Marco-Bench-MIF, covering 30 languages
with varying levels of localization. Our benchmark addresses linguistic
constraints (e.g., modifying capitalization requirements for Chinese) and
cultural references (e.g., substituting region-specific company names in
prompts) via a hybrid pipeline combining translation with verification. Through
comprehensive evaluation of 20+ LLMs on our Marco-Bench-MIF, we found that: (1)
25-35% accuracy gap between high/low-resource languages, (2) model scales
largely impact performance by 45-60% yet persists script-specific challenges,
and (3) machine-translated data underestimates accuracy by7-22% versus
localized data. Our analysis identifies challenges in multilingual instruction
following, including keyword consistency preservation and compositional
constraint adherence across languages. Our Marco-Bench-MIF is available at

Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖信息熵作为压缩指标，忽略了注意力关键令牌和压缩过程中熵的变化，导致压缩效果受限。

Method: 提出动态注意力感知方法（DAC），结合熵和注意力信息，动态调整压缩过程。

Result: 在多个领域（如LongBench、GSM8K、BBH）的实验表明，DAC在多种任务和LLMs上均表现优异。

Conclusion: DAC通过动态整合熵和注意力信息，显著提升了任务无关提示压缩的效果。

Abstract: Task-agnostic prompt compression leverages the redundancy in natural language
to reduce computational overhead and enhance information density within
prompts, especially in long-context scenarios. Existing methods predominantly
rely on information entropy as the metric to compress lexical units, aiming to
achieve minimal information loss. However, these approaches overlook two
critical aspects: (i) the importance of attention-critical tokens at the
algorithmic level, and (ii) shifts in information entropy during the
compression process. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a dynamic
attention-aware approach for task-agnostic prompt compression (DAC). This
approach effectively integrates entropy and attention information, dynamically
sensing entropy shifts during compression to achieve fine-grained prompt
compression. Extensive experiments across various domains, including LongBench,
GSM8K, and BBH, show that DAC consistently yields robust and substantial
improvements across a diverse range of tasks and LLMs, offering compelling
evidence of its efficacy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM部署因计算资源需求大而困难，现有PoT量化在GPU上效率不足。

Method: 提出两步后训练算法：初始化量化尺度并校准，优化反量化过程。

Result: 在2-和3-bit格式下超越现有整数量化方法，反量化速度在NVIDIA V100和RTX 4090上分别提升3.67倍和1.63倍。

Conclusion: PoT量化显著提升LLM推理效率和低精度性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, their deployment is
challenging due to the substantial computational resources required.
Power-of-two (PoT) quantization is a general tool to counteract this
difficulty. Albeit previous works on PoT quantization can be efficiently
dequantized on CPUs using fixed-point addition, it showed less effectiveness on
GPUs. The reason is entanglement of the sign bit and sequential bit
manipulations needed for dequantization. We propose a novel POT quantization
framework for LLM weights that (i) outperforms state-of-the-art accuracy in
extremely low-precision number formats, and (ii) enables faster inference
through more efficient dequantization. To maintain the accuracy of the
quantized model, we introduce a two-step post-training algorithm: (i)
initialize the quantization scales with a robust starting point, and (ii)
refine these scales using a minimal calibration set. The performance of our PoT
post-training algorithm surpasses the current state-of-the-art in integer
quantization, particularly at low precisions such as 2- and 3-bit formats. Our
PoT quantization accelerates the dequantization step required for the floating
point inference and leads to $3.67\times$ speed up on a NVIDIA V100, and
$1.63\times$ on a NVIDIA RTX 4090, compared to uniform integer dequantization.

Abstract: Reading comprehension is a fundamental skill in human cognitive development.
With the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a growing need
to compare how humans and LLMs understand language across different contexts
and apply this understanding to functional tasks such as inference, emotion
interpretation, and information retrieval. Our previous work used LLMs and
human biomarkers to study the reading comprehension process. The results showed
that the biomarkers corresponding to words with high and low relevance to the
inference target, as labeled by the LLMs, exhibited distinct patterns,
particularly when validated using eye-tracking data. However, focusing solely
on individual words limited the depth of understanding, which made the
conclusions somewhat simplistic despite their potential significance. This
study used an LLM-based AI agent to group words from a reading passage into
nodes and edges, forming a graph-based text representation based on semantic
meaning and question-oriented prompts. We then compare the distribution of eye
fixations on important nodes and edges. Our findings indicate that LLMs exhibit
high consistency in language understanding at the level of graph topological
structure. These results build on our previous findings and offer insights into
effective human-AI co-learning strategies.

Result: 价值相似性高的代理对表现出更高的信任和亲密感。

Conclusion: LLM代理模拟可作为社会科学理论的有效测试平台。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for simulating
complex social phenomena using human-like agents with specific traits. In human
societies, value similarity is important for building trust and close
relationships; however, it remains unexplored whether this principle holds true
in artificial societies comprising LLM agents. Therefore, this study
investigates the influence of value similarity on relationship-building among
LLM agents through two experiments. First, in a preliminary experiment, we
evaluated the controllability of values in LLMs to identify the most effective
model and prompt design for controlling the values. Subsequently, in the main
experiment, we generated pairs of LLM agents imbued with specific values and
analyzed their mutual evaluations of trust and interpersonal closeness
following a dialogue. The experiments were conducted in English and Japanese to
investigate language dependence. The results confirmed that pairs of agents
with higher value similarity exhibited greater mutual trust and interpersonal
closeness. Our findings demonstrate that the LLM agent simulation serves as a
valid testbed for social science theories, contributes to elucidating the
mechanisms by which values influence relationship building, and provides a
foundation for inspiring new theories and insights into the social sciences.

Motivation: 研究多义词定义在不同目标群体中的简化效果，避免因过度简化导致信息丢失和误导用户。

Method: 使用两种新评估数据集，测试多个LLM（如DeepSeek v3、Llama 4等），结合LLM-as-Judge和人工标注，并通过DPO微调Llama 3.1 8B。

Result: 简化显著降低多义词定义的完整性，但DPO微调能显著提升响应质量。

Conclusion: 需要在教育NLP中平衡简洁性与完整性，以确保可靠且上下文感知的定义。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can provide accurate word definitions and
explanations for any context. However, the scope of the definition changes for
different target groups, like children or language learners. This is especially
relevant for homonyms, words with multiple meanings, where oversimplification
might risk information loss by omitting key senses, potentially misleading
users who trust LLM outputs. We investigate how simplification impacts homonym
definition quality across three target groups: Normal, Simple, and ELI5. Using
two novel evaluation datasets spanning multiple languages, we test DeepSeek v3,
Llama 4 Maverick, Qwen3-30B A3B, GPT-4o mini, and Llama 3.1 8B via LLM-as-Judge
and human annotations. Our results show that simplification drastically
degrades definition completeness by neglecting polysemy, increasing the risk of
misunderstanding. Fine-tuning Llama 3.1 8B with Direct Preference Optimization
substantially improves homonym response quality across all prompt types. These
findings highlight the need to balance simplicity and completeness in
educational NLP to ensure reliable, context-aware definitions for all learners.

Method: 采用三步评估框架（问题生成、回答、评分），结合自动和手动评估方法，测试了7种来源的材料和4个团队的提交。

Result: LLMs在问题生成和评分任务中表现不佳，回答任务中表现尚可但受限；自动评分存在误判问题。

Conclusion: 需改进问题生成和评分的评估策略，LLMs在多语言理解任务中仍有提升空间。

Abstract: ELOQUENT is a set of shared tasks that aims to create easily testable
high-level criteria for evaluating generative language models. Sensemaking is
one such shared task.
  In Sensemaking, we try to assess how well generative models ``make sense out
of a given text'' in three steps inspired by exams in a classroom setting: (1)
Teacher systems should prepare a set of questions, (2) Student systems should
answer these questions, and (3) Evaluator systems should score these answers,
all adhering rather strictly to a given set of input materials.
  We report on the 2025 edition of Sensemaking, where we had 7 sources of test
materials (fact-checking analyses of statements, textbooks, transcribed
recordings of a lecture, and educational videos) spanning English, German,
Ukrainian, and Czech languages.
  This year, 4 teams participated, providing us with 2 Teacher submissions, 2
Student submissions, and 2 Evaluator submissions. We added baselines for
Teacher and Student using commercial large language model systems. We devised a
fully automatic evaluation procedure, which we compare to a minimalistic manual
evaluation.
  We were able to make some interesting observations. For the first task, the
creation of questions, better evaluation strategies will still have to be
devised because it is difficult to discern the quality of the various candidate
question sets. In the second task, question answering, the LLMs examined
overall perform acceptably, but restricting their answers to the given input
texts remains problematic. In the third task, evaluation of question answers,
our adversarial tests reveal that systems using the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm
erroneously rate both garbled question-answer pairs and answers to mixed-up
questions as acceptable.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in
understanding and generating human language, contributing to more natural
interactions with complex systems. However, they face challenges such as
ambiguity in user requests processed by LLMs. To address these challenges, this
paper introduces and evaluates a multi-agent debate framework designed to
enhance detection and resolution capabilities beyond single models. The
framework consists of three LLM architectures (Llama3-8B, Gemma2-9B, and
Mistral-7B variants) and a dataset with diverse ambiguities. The debate
framework markedly enhanced the performance of Llama3-8B and Mistral-7B
variants over their individual baselines, with Mistral-7B-led debates achieving
a notable 76.7% success rate and proving particularly effective for complex
ambiguities and efficient consensus. While acknowledging varying model
responses to collaborative strategies, these findings underscore the debate
framework's value as a targeted method for augmenting LLM capabilities. This
work offers important insights for developing more robust and adaptive language
understanding systems by showing how structured debates can lead to improved
clarity in interactive systems.

Conclusion: 结论指出，这种能力在计算社会科学中有潜力，但也存在滥用风险，建议限制公共应用中的使用，同时保留研究用途的受控访问。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have traditionally relied on static training
data, limiting their knowledge to fixed snapshots. Recent advancements,
however, have equipped LLMs with web browsing capabilities, enabling real time
information retrieval and multi step reasoning over live web content. While
prior studies have demonstrated LLMs ability to access and analyze websites,
their capacity to directly retrieve and analyze social media data remains
unexplored. Here, we evaluate whether web browsing LLMs can infer demographic
attributes of social media users given only their usernames. Using a synthetic
dataset of 48 X (Twitter) accounts and a survey dataset of 1,384 international
participants, we show that these models can access social media content and
predict user demographics with reasonable accuracy. Analysis of the synthetic
dataset further reveals how LLMs parse and interpret social media profiles,
which may introduce gender and political biases against accounts with minimal
activity. While this capability holds promise for computational social science
in the post API era, it also raises risks of misuse particularly in information
operations and targeted advertising underscoring the need for safeguards. We
recommend that LLM providers restrict this capability in public facing
applications, while preserving controlled access for verified research
purposes.

Abstract: Open-weights reasoning language models generate long chains-of-thought (CoTs)
before producing a final response, which improves performance but introduces
additional alignment risks, with harmful content often appearing in both the
CoTs and the final outputs. In this work, we investigate if we can use CoTs to
predict final response misalignment. We evaluate a range of monitoring
approaches, including humans, highly-capable large language models, and text
classifiers, using either CoT text or activations. First, we find that a simple
linear probe trained on CoT activations can significantly outperform all
text-based methods in predicting whether a final response will be safe or
unsafe. CoT texts are often unfaithful and can mislead humans and classifiers,
while model latents (i.e., CoT activations) offer a more reliable predictive
signal. Second, the probe makes accurate predictions before reasoning
completes, achieving strong performance even when applied to early CoT
segments. These findings generalize across model sizes, families, and safety
benchmarks, suggesting that lightweight probes could enable real-time safety
monitoring and early intervention during generation.

Result: 实验表明，BETR在计算效率上比基线方法提升2.1倍，并在10个任务中的9个上表现更好，且能泛化到其他基准。

Conclusion: 结论是直接匹配预训练数据与目标任务能有效塑造模型能力，且数据选择策略需随模型规模调整。

Abstract: Every data selection method inherently has a target. In practice, these
targets often emerge implicitly through benchmark-driven iteration: researchers
develop selection strategies, train models, measure benchmark performance, then
refine accordingly. This raises a natural question: what happens when we make
this optimization explicit? To explore this, we propose benchmark-targeted
ranking (BETR), a simple method that selects pretraining documents based on
similarity to benchmark training examples. BETR embeds benchmark examples and a
sample of pretraining documents in a shared space, scores this sample by
similarity to benchmarks, then trains a lightweight classifier to predict these
scores for the full corpus. We compare data selection methods by training over
500 models spanning $10^{19}$ to $10^{22}$ FLOPs and fitting scaling laws to
them. From this, we find that simply aligning pretraining data to evaluation
benchmarks using BETR achieves a 2.1x compute multiplier over DCLM-Baseline
(4.7x over unfiltered data) and improves performance on 9 out of 10 tasks
across all scales. BETR also generalizes well: when targeting a diverse set of
benchmarks disjoint from our evaluation suite, it still matches or outperforms
baselines. Our scaling analysis further reveals a clear trend: larger models
require less aggressive filtering. Overall, our findings show that directly
matching pretraining data to target tasks precisely shapes model capabilities
and highlight that optimal selection strategies must adapt to model scale.

Abstract: This thesis addresses challenges related to data and parameter efficiency in
neural language models, with a focus on representation analysis and the
introduction of new optimization techniques. The first part examines the
properties and dynamics of language representations within neural models,
emphasizing their significance in enhancing robustness and generalization. It
proposes innovative approaches based on representation smoothness, including
regularization strategies that utilize Jacobian and Hessian matrices to
stabilize training and mitigate sensitivity to input perturbations. The second
part focuses on methods to significantly enhance data and parameter efficiency
by integrating active learning strategies with parameter-efficient fine-tuning,
guided by insights from representation smoothness analysis. It presents
smoothness-informed early-stopping techniques designed to eliminate the need
for labeled validation sets and proposes innovative combinations of active
learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning to reduce labeling efforts and
computational resources. Extensive experimental evaluations across various NLP
tasks demonstrate that these combined approaches substantially outperform
traditional methods in terms of performance, stability, and efficiency. The
third part explores weak supervision techniques enhanced by in-context learning
to effectively utilize unlabeled data, further reducing dependence on extensive
labeling. It shows that using in-context learning as a mechanism for weak
supervision enables models to better generalize from limited labeled data by
leveraging unlabeled examples more effectively during training. Comprehensive
empirical evaluations confirm significant gains in model accuracy,
adaptability, and robustness, especially in low-resource settings and dynamic
data environments.

<details>

Motivation: 大型语言模型在代码生成方面表现优异，但在代码质量分析上受限于静态训练数据，难以适应不断变化的最佳实践。

Method: MetaLint通过指令调优在合成数据上训练模型，支持从易到难的泛化，无需重新训练即可适应新代码模式。

Result: MetaLint在未见的PEP习语上表现优异，F-score达70.37%，定位准确率为26.73%，与更大模型相当。

Conclusion: MetaLint展示了在代码质量分析中的潜力，特别是在适应性和泛化能力方面。

Abstract: Large Language Models, though successful in code generation, struggle with
code quality analysis because they are limited by static training data and
can't easily adapt to evolving best practices. We introduce MetaLint, a new
instruction-following framework that formulates code quality analysis as the
task of detecting and fixing problematic semantic code fragments or code idioms
based on high-level specifications. Unlike conventional approaches that train
models on static, rule-based data, MetaLint employs instruction tuning on
synthetic linter-generated data to support easy-to-hard generalization,
enabling models to adapt to novel or complex code patterns without retraining.
To evaluate this, we construct a benchmark of challenging idioms inspired by
real-world coding standards such as Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) and
assess whether MetaLint-trained models reason adaptively or simply memorize.
Our results show that MetaLint improves generalization to unseen PEP idioms,
achieving a 70.37% F-score on idiom detection with the highest recall (70.43%)
among all evaluated models. It also achieves 26.73% on localization,
competitive for its 4B parameter size and comparable to larger state-of-the-art
models like o3-mini, highlighting its potential for future-proof code quality
analysis.

Conclusion: CRABS通过结合语法分析和LLM，有效解决了笔记本理解的挑战，显著提升了准确率。

Abstract: Recognizing the information flows and operations comprising data science and
machine learning Python notebooks is critical for evaluating, reusing, and
adapting notebooks for new tasks. Investigating a notebook via re-execution
often is impractical due to the challenges of resolving data and software
dependencies. While Large Language Models (LLMs) pre-trained on large codebases
have demonstrated effectiveness in understanding code without running it, we
observe that they fail to understand some realistic notebooks due to
hallucinations and long-context challenges. To address these issues, we propose
a notebook understanding task yielding an information flow graph and
corresponding cell execution dependency graph for a notebook, and demonstrate
the effectiveness of a pincer strategy that uses limited syntactic analysis to
assist full comprehension of the notebook using an LLM. Our Capture and Resolve
Assisted Bounding Strategy (CRABS) employs shallow syntactic parsing and
analysis of the abstract syntax tree (AST) to capture the correct
interpretation of a notebook between lower and upper estimates of the
inter-cell I/O sets, then uses an LLM to resolve remaining ambiguities via
cell-by-cell zero-shot learning, thereby identifying the true data inputs and
outputs of each cell. We evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach using an annotated dataset of 50 representative, highly up-voted
Kaggle notebooks that together represent 3454 actual cell inputs and outputs.
The LLM correctly resolves 1397 of 1425 (98%) ambiguities left by analyzing the
syntactic structure of these notebooks. Across 50 notebooks, CRABS achieves
average F1 scores of 98% identifying cell-to-cell information flows and 99%
identifying transitive cell execution dependencies.

Result: 在高批量推理任务中，BlockBPE的吞吐量比tiktoken高2倍，比HuggingFace Tokenizers高2.5倍。

Conclusion: BlockBPE为GPU上的高效分词提供了可行方案，适用于大规模语言模型推理。

Abstract: Tokenization is a critical preprocessing step in large language model
pipelines, yet widely-used implementations remain CPU-bound and suboptimal for
batch inference workflows on GPU. We present BlockBPE, a parallel GPU
implementation of byte-pair encoding (BPE) that achieves near linear-time
complexity under realistic assumptions and is optimized for high-throughput,
batch inference. Unlike existing Rust-based tokenizers such as HuggingFace
Tokenizers or OpenAI's tiktoken-whose runtimes are dominated by Regex
pre-tokenization and exhibit $O(n \log n)$ runtime-BlockBPE eliminates the
Regex pre-tokenization which leads to small loss in generation quality, but
enables highly parallelized token merges within thread blocks, reducing overall
complexity to $O(nd)$ where $d \ll n$. On high-batch inference workloads,
BlockBPE achieves up to 2x higher throughput than tiktoken and 2.5x over
HuggingFace Tokenizers.

show that LLMs not only outperformed humans in all the assessed criteria, but
did better in six out of the eight test tasks. We then computed the uniqueness
of the individual answers, which showed some minor differences between humans

revealed that humans are more inclined towards E(extending)-creativity, while
LLMs favor F(ixed)-creativity.

Result: 探针在简单和复杂任务中均表现良好，错误检测准确率超过90%，选择性重新提示提高了任务准确性。

Conclusion: 算术错误可通过内部激活预测，简单探针为轻量级自我纠正提供了可行方案。

Abstract: We investigate whether internal activations in language models can be used to
detect arithmetic errors. Starting with a controlled setting of 3-digit
addition, we show that simple probes can accurately decode both the model's
predicted output and the correct answer from hidden states, regardless of
whether the model's output is correct. Building on this, we train lightweight
error detectors that predict model correctness with over 90% accuracy. We then
extend our analysis to structured chain-of-thought traces on addition-only
GSM8K problems and find that probes trained on simple arithmetic generalize
well to this more complex setting, revealing consistent internal
representations. Finally, we demonstrate that these probes can guide selective
re-prompting of erroneous reasoning steps, improving task accuracy with minimal
disruption to correct outputs. Our findings suggest that arithmetic errors can
be anticipated from internal activations alone, and that simple probes offer a
viable path toward lightweight model self-correction.

Abstract: Organizations increasingly rely on proprietary enterprise data, including HR
records, structured reports, and tabular documents, for critical
decision-making. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have strong generative
capabilities, they are limited by static pretraining, short context windows,
and challenges in processing heterogeneous data formats. Conventional
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks address some of these gaps but
often struggle with structured and semi-structured data.
  This work proposes an advanced RAG framework that combines hybrid retrieval
strategies using dense embeddings (all-mpnet-base-v2) and BM25, enhanced by
metadata-aware filtering with SpaCy NER and cross-encoder reranking. The
framework applies semantic chunking to maintain textual coherence and retains
tabular data structures to preserve row-column integrity. Quantized indexing
optimizes retrieval efficiency, while human-in-the-loop feedback and
conversation memory improve adaptability.
  Experiments on enterprise datasets show notable improvements: Precision@5
increased by 15 percent (90 versus 75), Recall@5 by 13 percent (87 versus 74),
and Mean Reciprocal Rank by 16 percent (0.85 versus 0.69). Qualitative
evaluations show higher scores in Faithfulness (4.6 versus 3.0), Completeness
(4.2 versus 2.5), and Relevance (4.5 versus 3.2) on a 5-point Likert scale.
These results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in delivering accurate,
comprehensive, and contextually relevant responses for enterprise tasks. Future
work includes extending to multimodal data and integrating agent-based
retrieval. The source code will be released at

Abstract: Text data augmentation is a widely used strategy for mitigating data sparsity
in natural language processing (NLP), particularly in low-resource settings
where limited samples hinder effective semantic modeling. While augmentation
can improve input diversity and downstream interpretability, existing
techniques often lack mechanisms to ensure semantic preservation during
large-scale or iterative generation, leading to redundancy and instability.
This work introduces a principled evaluation framework for large language model
(LLM) based text augmentation, comprising two components: (1) Scalability
Analysis, which measures semantic consistency as augmentation volume increases,
and (2) Iterative Augmentation with Summarization Refinement (IASR), which
evaluates semantic drift across recursive paraphrasing cycles. Empirical
evaluations across state-of-the-art LLMs show that GPT-3.5 Turbo achieved the
best balance of semantic fidelity, diversity, and generation efficiency.
Applied to a real-world topic modeling task using BERTopic with GPT-enhanced
few-shot labeling, the proposed approach results in a 400% increase in topic
granularity and complete elimination of topic overlaps. These findings
validated the utility of the proposed frameworks for structured evaluation of
LLM-based augmentation in practical NLP pipelines.

Abstract: Traditional information extraction systems face challenges with text only
language models as it does not consider infographics (visual elements of
information) such as tables, charts, images etc. often used to convey complex
information to readers. Multimodal LLM (MLLM) face challenges of finding needle
in the haystack problem i.e., either longer context length or substantial
number of documents as search space. Late interaction mechanism over visual
language models has shown state of the art performance in retrieval-based
vision augmented Q&A tasks. There are yet few challenges using it for RAG based
multi-modal Q&A. Firstly, many popular and widely adopted vector databases do
not support native multi-vector retrieval. Secondly, late interaction requires
computation which inflates space footprint and can hinder enterprise adoption.
Lastly, the current state of late interaction mechanism does not leverage the
approximate neighbor search indexing methods for large speed ups in retrieval
process. This paper explores a pragmatic approach to make vision retrieval
process scalable and efficient without compromising on performance quality. We
propose multi-step custom implementation utilizing widely adopted hybrid search
(metadata & embedding) and state of the art late interaction re-ranker to
retrieve best matching pages. Finally, MLLM are prompted as reader to generate
answers from contextualized best matching pages. Through experiments, we
observe that the proposed design is scalable (significant speed up) and stable
(without degrading performance quality), hence can be used as production
systems at enterprises.

Maths learning driven by large language models (LLMs). We call our approach
Mathematics Explanations through Games by AI LLMs (MEGA). Some students
struggle with Maths and as a result avoid Math-related discipline or subjects
despite the importance of Maths across many fields, including signal

pedagogy. We compared the MEGA method to the traditional step-by-step (CoT)
method to ascertain which is better by using a within-group design after
randomly assigning questions for the participants, who are university students.
Samples (n=60) were randomly drawn from each of the two test sets of the Grade
School Math 8K (GSM8K) and Mathematics Aptitude Test of Heuristics (MATH)
datasets, based on the error margin of 11%, the confidence level of 90%, and a
manageable number of samples for the student evaluators. These samples were
used to evaluate two capable LLMs at length (Generative Pretrained Transformer
4o (GPT4o) and Claude 3.5 Sonnet) out of the initial six that were tested for
capability. The results showed that students agree in more instances that the
MEGA method is experienced as better for learning for both datasets. It is even
much better than the CoT (47.5% compared to 26.67%) in the more difficult MATH

Abstract: Text anomaly detection is a critical task in natural language processing
(NLP), with applications spanning fraud detection, misinformation
identification, spam detection and content moderation, etc. Despite significant
advances in large language models (LLMs) and anomaly detection algorithms, the
absence of standardized and comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating the
existing anomaly detection methods on text data limits rigorous comparison and
development of innovative approaches. This work performs a comprehensive
empirical study and introduces a benchmark for text anomaly detection,
leveraging embeddings from diverse pre-trained language models across a wide
array of text datasets. Our work systematically evaluates the effectiveness of
embedding-based text anomaly detection by incorporating (1) early language
models (GloVe, BERT); (2) multiple LLMs (LLaMa-2, LLama-3, Mistral, OpenAI
(small, ada, large)); (3) multi-domain text datasets (news, social media,
scientific publications); (4) comprehensive evaluation metrics (AUROC, AUPRC).
Our experiments reveal a critical empirical insight: embedding quality
significantly governs anomaly detection efficacy, and deep learning-based
approaches demonstrate no performance advantage over conventional shallow
algorithms (e.g., KNN, Isolation Forest) when leveraging LLM-derived
embeddings.In addition, we observe strongly low-rank characteristics in
cross-model performance matrices, which enables an efficient strategy for rapid
model evaluation (or embedding evaluation) and selection in practical
applications. Furthermore, by open-sourcing our benchmark toolkit that includes
all embeddings from different models and code at

provides a foundation for future research in robust and scalable text anomaly
detection systems.

assessment. Ten Japanese science fiction short stories were translated into
English and evaluated by six state-of-the-art LLMs across seven independent
sessions. Principal component analysis and clustering techniques revealed
significant variations in evaluation consistency ({\alpha} ranging from 1.00 to
0.35) and five distinct evaluation patterns. Additionally, evaluation variance
across stories differed by up to 4.5-fold, with TF-IDF analysis confirming
distinctive evaluation vocabularies for each model. Our seven-session
within-day protocol using an original Science Fiction corpus strategically
minimizes external biases, allowing us to observe implicit value systems shaped
by RLHF and their influence on literary judgment. These findings suggest that
LLMs may possess individual evaluation characteristics similar to human
critical schools, rather than functioning as neutral benchmarkers.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了MapIQ基准数据集，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在地图视觉问答（Map-VQA）任务中的表现，并探讨了模型对地图设计变化的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Map-VQA研究主要局限于choropleth地图，覆盖的主题和任务有限。MapIQ旨在填补这一空白，提供更全面的评估。

Method: 构建包含14,706个问答对的MapIQ数据集，涵盖三种地图类型和六种主题。评估多个MLLMs在六种视觉分析任务中的表现，并与人类基线对比。还研究了地图设计变化对模型性能的影响。

Result: 实验揭示了MLLMs在地图任务中的表现、鲁棒性、对内部地理知识的依赖，以及改进Map-VQA性能的潜在途径。

Conclusion: MapIQ为MLLMs在地图理解任务中的评估提供了新基准，并指出了未来改进方向。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have driven
researchers to explore how well these models read data visualizations, e.g.,
bar charts, scatter plots. More recently, attention has shifted to visual
question answering with maps (Map-VQA). However, Map-VQA research has primarily
focused on choropleth maps, which cover only a limited range of thematic
categories and visual analytical tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce
MapIQ, a benchmark dataset comprising 14,706 question-answer pairs across three
map types: choropleth maps, cartograms, and proportional symbol maps spanning
topics from six distinct themes (e.g., housing, crime). We evaluate multiple
MLLMs using six visual analytical tasks, comparing their performance against
one another and a human baseline. An additional experiment examining the impact
of map design changes (e.g., altered color schemes, modified legend designs,
and removal of map elements) provides insights into the robustness and
sensitivity of MLLMs, their reliance on internal geographic knowledge, and
potential avenues for improving Map-VQA performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线交流中低资源语言和方言的翻译常忽略本地俚语和文化嵌入的有害内容，现有系统难以处理毒性内容的翻译。

Method: 1. 少量样本提示工程，人工验证并筛选示例；2. 通过语义相似度基准测试优化模型-提示对。

Result: 定量人工评估验证了框架的有效性和效率，提升了翻译质量和文化敏感性。

Conclusion: 该框架为低资源环境下的文化敏感内容审核和基准测试提供了支持，强调了保留社会语言细微差别的重要性。

Abstract: As online communication increasingly incorporates under-represented languages
and colloquial dialects, standard translation systems often fail to preserve
local slang, code-mixing, and culturally embedded markers of harmful speech.
Translating toxic content between low-resource language pairs poses additional
challenges due to scarce parallel data and safety filters that sanitize
offensive expressions. In this work, we propose a reproducible, two-stage
framework for toxicity-preserving translation, demonstrated on a code-mixed
Singlish safety corpus. First, we perform human-verified few-shot prompt
engineering: we iteratively curate and rank annotator-selected Singlish-target
examples to capture nuanced slang, tone, and toxicity. Second, we optimize
model-prompt pairs by benchmarking several large language models using semantic
similarity via direct and back-translation. Quantitative human evaluation
confirms the effectiveness and efficiency of our pipeline. Beyond improving
translation quality, our framework contributes to the safety of multicultural
LLMs by supporting culturally sensitive moderation and benchmarking in
low-resource contexts. By positioning Singlish as a testbed for inclusive NLP,
we underscore the importance of preserving sociolinguistic nuance in real-world
applications such as content moderation and regional platform governance.

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在通用代码任务中表现良好，但在硬件描述语言（如VHDL）中的研究和评估仍不足，论文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出CoDes方法，通过生成一系列中间描述步骤，结合原始输入提示，提升LLMs在VHDL任务中的表现。

Result: 实验表明，CoDes方法在多个指标上显著优于标准提示策略，提升了VHDL代码生成和摘要的质量。

Conclusion: CoDes不仅改善了VHDL任务的性能，还为未来研究提供了框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become widely used across diverse NLP tasks
and domains, demonstrating their adaptability and effectiveness. In the realm
of Electronic Design Automation (EDA), LLMs show promise for tasks like
Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code generation and summarization. However,
despite the proliferation of LLMs for general code-related tasks, there's a
dearth of research focused on evaluating and refining these models for hardware
description languages (HDLs), notably VHDL. In this study, we evaluate the
performance of existing code LLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization
using various metrics and two datasets -- VHDL-Eval and VHDL-Xform. The latter,
an in-house dataset, aims to gauge LLMs' understanding of functionally
equivalent code. Our findings reveal consistent underperformance of these
models across different metrics, underscoring a significant gap in their
suitability for this domain. To address this challenge, we propose
Chain-of-Descriptions (CoDes), a novel approach to enhance the performance of
LLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization tasks. CoDes involves
generating a series of intermediate descriptive steps based on: (i) the problem
statement for code generation, and (ii) the VHDL code for summarization. These
steps are then integrated with the original input prompt (problem statement or
code) and provided as input to the LLMs to generate the final output. Our
experiments demonstrate that the CoDes approach significantly surpasses the
standard prompting strategy across various metrics on both datasets. This
method not only improves the quality of VHDL code generation and summarization
but also serves as a framework for future research aimed at enhancing code LLMs
for VHDL.

develop a model capable of performing sentiment analysis in Persian using
limited data, while getting prior knowledge from high-resource languages. To
achieve this, three pre-trained multilingual models (XLM-RoBERTa, mDeBERTa, and
DistilBERT) were employed, which were fine-tuned using few-shot and incremental
learning approaches on small samples of Persian data from diverse sources,
including X, Instagram, Digikala, Snappfood, and Taaghche. This variety enabled
the models to learn from a broad range of contexts. Experimental results show
that the mDeBERTa and XLM-RoBERTa achieved high performances, reaching 96%
accuracy on Persian sentiment analysis. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of combining few-shot learning and incremental learning with
multilingual pre-trained models.

Conclusion: PgM通过区分单模态和配对模态特征的学习，提供了灵活性和性能提升，为多模态学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multimodal learning benefits from multiple modal information, and each
learned modal representations can be divided into uni-modal that can be learned
from uni-modal training and paired-modal features that can be learned from
cross-modal interaction. Building on this perspective, we propose a
partitioner-guided modal learning framework, PgM, which consists of the modal
partitioner, uni-modal learner, paired-modal learner, and uni-paired modal
decoder. Modal partitioner segments the learned modal representation into
uni-modal and paired-modal features. Modal learner incorporates two dedicated
components for uni-modal and paired-modal learning. Uni-paired modal decoder
reconstructs modal representation based on uni-modal and paired-modal features.
PgM offers three key benefits: 1) thorough learning of uni-modal and
paired-modal features, 2) flexible distribution adjustment for uni-modal and
paired-modal representations to suit diverse downstream tasks, and 3) different
learning rates across modalities and partitions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of PgM across four multimodal tasks and further
highlight its transferability to existing models. Additionally, we visualize
the distribution of uni-modal and paired-modal features across modalities and
tasks, offering insights into their respective contributions.

Abstract: We present ExpliCIT-QA, a system that extends our previous MRT approach for
tabular question answering into a multimodal pipeline capable of handling
complex table images and providing explainable answers. ExpliCIT-QA follows a
modular design, consisting of: (1) Multimodal Table Understanding, which uses a
Chain-of-Thought approach to extract and transform content from table images;
(2) Language-based Reasoning, where a step-by-step explanation in natural
language is generated to solve the problem; (3) Automatic Code Generation,
where Python/Pandas scripts are created based on the reasoning steps, with
feedback for handling errors; (4) Code Execution to compute the final answer;
and (5) Natural Language Explanation that describes how the answer was
computed. The system is built for transparency and auditability: all
intermediate outputs, parsed tables, reasoning steps, generated code, and final
answers are available for inspection. This strategy works towards closing the
explainability gap in end-to-end TableVQA systems. We evaluated ExpliCIT-QA on
the TableVQA-Bench benchmark, comparing it with existing baselines. We
demonstrated improvements in interpretability and transparency, which open the
door for applications in sensitive domains like finance and healthcare where
auditing results are critical.

Abstract: The language identification task is a crucial fundamental step in NLP. Often
it serves as a pre-processing step for widely used NLP applications such as
multilingual machine translation, information retrieval, question and
answering, and text summarization. The core challenge of language
identification lies in distinguishing languages in noisy, short, and code-mixed
environments. This becomes even harder in case of diverse Indian languages that
exhibit lexical and phonetic similarities, but have distinct differences. Many
Indian languages share the same script making the task even more challenging.
In this paper, we release a dataset of 230K sentences consisting of English and
all 22 official Indian languages labeled with their language identifiers where
data in most languages are newly created. We also develop and release robust
baseline models using state-of-the-art approaches in machine learning and deep
learning that can aid the research in this field. Our baseline models are
comparable to the state-of-the-art models for the language identification task.

Experimental results show that our adaptive reward scaling mechanism provides
modest but consistent benefits on homogeneous datasets (CLOTH-F) and more

26,151 question-answering pairs across 10 diverse languages. PolyChartQA is
built using a decoupled pipeline that separates chart data from rendering code,
allowing multilingual charts to be flexibly generated by simply translating the
data and reusing the code. We leverage state-of-the-art LLM-based translation
and enforce rigorous quality control in the pipeline to ensure the linguistic
and semantic consistency of the generated multilingual charts. PolyChartQA
facilitates systematic evaluation of multilingual chart understanding.
Experiments on both open- and closed-source large vision-language models reveal

Abstract: Coreference Resolution systems are typically evaluated on benchmarks
containing small- to medium-scale documents. When it comes to evaluating long
texts, however, existing benchmarks, such as LitBank, remain limited in length
and do not adequately assess system capabilities at the book scale, i.e., when
co-referring mentions span hundreds of thousands of tokens. To fill this gap,
we first put forward a novel automatic pipeline that produces high-quality
Coreference Resolution annotations on full narrative texts. Then, we adopt this
pipeline to create the first book-scale coreference benchmark, BOOKCOREF, with
an average document length of more than 200,000 tokens. We carry out a series
of experiments showing the robustness of our automatic procedure and
demonstrating the value of our resource, which enables current long-document
coreference systems to gain up to +20 CoNLL-F1 points when evaluated on full
books. Moreover, we report on the new challenges introduced by this
unprecedented book-scale setting, highlighting that current models fail to

### [45] [Improving Contextual ASR via Multi-grained Fusion with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12252)
*Shilin Zhou,Zhenghua Li*

TL;DR: 提出了一种多粒度融合方法，结合LLMs的上下文知识改进ASR中的关键词识别，实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ASR模型在识别上下文相关关键词（如专有名词或用户特定实体）时的不足，结合LLMs的上下文知识提升准确性。

Method: 提出多粒度融合方法，联合利用token级和phrase级融合，采用后融合策略结合ASR的声学信息和LLM的上下文知识。

Result: 在中文和英文数据集上实现了关键词相关指标的最先进性能，同时保持非关键词文本的高准确性。

Conclusion: 多粒度融合框架中token级和phrase级组件相互补充，显著提升性能。

Abstract: While end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models have shown
impressive performance in transcribing general speech, they often struggle to
accurately recognize contextually relevant keywords, such as proper nouns or
user-specific entities.
  Previous approaches have explored leveraging keyword dictionaries in the
textual modality to improve keyword recognition, either through token-level
fusion that guides token-by-token generation or phrase-level fusion that
enables direct copying of keyword phrases.
  However, these methods operate at different granularities and have their own
limitations.
  In this paper, we propose a novel multi-grained fusion approach that jointly
leverages the strengths of both token-level and phrase-level fusion with Large
Language Models (LLMs).
  Our approach incorporates a late-fusion strategy that elegantly combines
ASR's acoustic information with LLM's rich contextual knowledge, balancing
fine-grained token precision with holistic phrase-level understanding.
  Experiments on Chinese and English datasets demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on keyword-related metrics while
preserving high accuracy on non-keyword text.
  Ablation studies further confirm that the token-level and phrase-level
components both contribute significantly to the performance gains,
complementing each other in our joint multi-grained framework.
  The code and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为T-index的定量测量方法，用于评估翻译文本的特性（translationese），通过对比微调的语言模型计算得出。实验表明T-index在跨域设置中具有鲁棒性和高效性，并能与人类标注结果良好相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器翻译质量评估指标（如BLEU、COMET）未能涵盖翻译文本的特性（translationese），因此需要一种新的定量测量方法。

Method: 使用两个对比微调的0.5B参数语言模型，基于1-5k对合成数据计算T-index，并在真实翻译数据集上进行验证。

Result: T-index能有效捕捉真实翻译中的特性，与人类标注结果显著相关（Pearson's r = 0.568），且与现有MT质量评估指标相关性低。

Conclusion: T-index可作为现有MT质量评估指标的补充，提供对翻译特性的独立测量。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose the first quantitative measure for translationese
-- the translationese-index (T-index) for graded and generalizable measurement
of translationese, computed from the likelihood ratios of two contrastively
fine-tuned language models (LMs). We use a synthesized dataset and a dataset
with translations in the wild to evaluate T-index's generalizability in
cross-domain settings and its validity against human judgments. Our results
show that T-index is both robust and efficient. T-index scored by two 0.5B LMs
fine-tuned on only 1-5k pairs of synthetic data can well capture translationese
in the wild. We find that the relative differences in T-indices between
translations can well predict pairwise translationese annotations obtained from
human annotators; and the absolute values of T-indices correlate well with
human ratings of degrees of translationese (Pearson's $r = 0.568$).
Additionally, the correlation between T-index and existing machine translation
(MT) quality estimation (QE) metrics such as BLEU and COMET is low, suggesting
that T-index is not covered by these metrics and can serve as a complementary
metric in MT QE.

Method: 使用LLM代理、代码执行和医疗术语数据库工具构建端到端框架Infherno，支持自定义和合成数据，以及本地和专有模型。

Result: Infherno在预测FHIR资源方面表现良好，与人类基线相当，支持临床数据集成和跨机构互操作性。

Conclusion: Infherno框架有效解决了临床数据转换中的泛化性和结构一致性问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: For clinical data integration and healthcare services, the HL7 FHIR standard
has established itself as a desirable format for interoperability between
complex health data. Previous attempts at automating the translation from
free-form clinical notes into structured FHIR resources rely on modular,
rule-based systems or LLMs with instruction tuning and constrained decoding.
Since they frequently suffer from limited generalizability and structural
inconformity, we propose an end-to-end framework powered by LLM agents, code
execution, and healthcare terminology database tools to address these issues.
Our solution, called Infherno, is designed to adhere to the FHIR document
schema and competes well with a human baseline in predicting FHIR resources
from unstructured text. The implementation features a front end for custom and
synthetic data and both local and proprietary models, supporting clinical data
integration processes and interoperability across institutions.

Conclusion: S2WTM是一种有效的主题建模方法，能够避免后验坍塌并提升模型性能。

Abstract: Modeling latent representations in a hyperspherical space has proven
effective for capturing directional similarities in high-dimensional text data,
benefiting topic modeling. Variational autoencoder-based neural topic models
(VAE-NTMs) commonly adopt the von Mises-Fisher prior to encode hyperspherical
structure. However, VAE-NTMs often suffer from posterior collapse, where the KL
divergence term in the objective function highly diminishes, leading to
ineffective latent representations. To mitigate this issue while modeling
hyperspherical structure in the latent space, we propose the Spherical Sliced
Wasserstein Autoencoder for Topic Modeling (S2WTM). S2WTM employs a prior
distribution supported on the unit hypersphere and leverages the Spherical
Sliced-Wasserstein distance to align the aggregated posterior distribution with
the prior. Experimental results demonstrate that S2WTM outperforms
state-of-the-art topic models, generating more coherent and diverse topics
while improving performance on downstream tasks.

Conclusion: BTSS为模拟翻译行为提供了新视角，有助于理解翻译的认知和情感动态。

Abstract: The paper introduces a Behavioural Translation Style Space (BTSS) that
describes possible behavioural translation patterns. The suggested BTSS is
organized as a hierarchical structure that entails various embedded processing
layers. We posit that observable translation behaviour - i.e., eye and finger
movements - is fundamental when executing the physical act of translation but
it is caused and shaped by higher-order cognitive processes and affective
translation states. We analyse records of keystrokes and gaze data as
indicators of the hidden mental processing structure and organize the
behavioural patterns as a multi-layered embedded BTSS. The BTSS serves as the
basis for a computational translation agent to simulate the temporal dynamics
of affect, automatized behaviour and cognition during human translation
production.

Conclusion: 结论指出，尽管SSL在低资源语音任务中表现良好，但在少量样本分类系统中处理儿童数据时存在局限性。

Abstract: We explore an ASR-free method for isolated word reading assessment in

substantial drop for child speech input, even with child templates. Despite the
success of employing SSL representations in low-resource speech tasks, our work

Abstract: Gender bias has been widely observed in speech perception tasks, influenced
by the fundamental voicing differences between genders. This study reveals a
gender bias in the perception of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) speech. In a
perception experiment involving 16 Chinese listeners evaluating both Chinese
and Greek speech, we identified that male speech was more frequently identified
as AD, with this bias being particularly pronounced in Chinese speech. Acoustic
analysis showed that shimmer values in male speech were significantly
associated with AD perception, while speech portion exhibited a significant
negative correlation with AD identification. Although language did not have a
significant impact on AD perception, our findings underscore the critical role
of gender bias in AD speech perception. This work highlights the necessity of
addressing gender bias when developing AD detection models and calls for
further research to validate model performance across different linguistic
contexts.

Hebbian plasticity, local inhibition, and inter-area inhibition. We implement a
simulated neuromorphic system based on this formalism, which is capable of
basic language acquisition: Starting from a tabula rasa, the system learns, in
any language, the semantics of words, their syntactic role (verb versus noun),
and the word order of the language, including the ability to generate novel
sentences, through the exposure to a modest number of grounded sentences in the
same language. We discuss several possible extensions and implications of this
result.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have revolutionized cross-modal
understanding but continue to struggle with hallucinations - fabricated content
contradicting visual inputs. Existing hallucination mitigation methods either
incur prohibitive computational costs or introduce distribution mismatches
between training data and model outputs. We identify a critical insight:
hallucinations predominantly emerge at the early stages of text generation and
propagate through subsequent outputs. To address this, we propose **SENTINEL**
(**S**entence-level **E**arly i**N**tervention **T**hrough **IN**-domain
pr**E**ference **L**earning), a framework that eliminates dependency on human
annotations. Specifically, we first bootstrap high-quality in-domain preference
pairs by iteratively sampling model outputs, validating object existence
through cross-checking with two open-vocabulary detectors, and classifying
sentences into hallucinated/non-hallucinated categories. Subsequently, we use
context-coherent positive samples and hallucinated negative samples to build
context-aware preference data iteratively. Finally, we train models using a
context-aware preference loss (C-DPO) that emphasizes discriminative learning
at the sentence level where hallucinations initially manifest. Experimental
results show that SENTINEL can reduce hallucinations by over 90\% compared to
the original model and outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method on both
hallucination benchmarks and general capabilities benchmarks, demonstrating its
superiority and generalization ability. The models, datasets, and code are

Second, we propose ChimeraBreak, a novel tri-modal attack strategy that

Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal significant

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models (DMs) have been propelled by
alignment methods that post-train models to better conform to human
preferences. However, these approaches typically require computation-intensive
training of a base model and a reward model, which not only incurs substantial
computational overhead but may also compromise model accuracy and training
efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose Inversion-DPO, a novel
alignment framework that circumvents reward modeling by reformulating Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) with DDIM inversion for DMs. Our method conducts
intractable posterior sampling in Diffusion-DPO with the deterministic
inversion from winning and losing samples to noise and thus derive a new
post-training paradigm. This paradigm eliminates the need for auxiliary reward
models or inaccurate appromixation, significantly enhancing both precision and
efficiency of training. We apply Inversion-DPO to a basic task of text-to-image
generation and a challenging task of compositional image generation. Extensive
experiments show substantial performance improvements achieved by Inversion-DPO
compared to existing post-training methods and highlight the ability of the
trained generative models to generate high-fidelity compositionally coherent
images. For the post-training of compostitional image geneation, we curate a
paired dataset consisting of 11,140 images with complex structural annotations
and comprehensive scores, designed to enhance the compositional capabilities of
generative models. Inversion-DPO explores a new avenue for efficient,

Conclusion: ST-VFM是一个强大的通用框架，适用于时空预测任务。

Abstract: Foundation models have achieved remarkable success in natural language
processing and computer vision, demonstrating strong capabilities in modeling
complex patterns. While recent efforts have explored adapting large language
models (LLMs) for time-series forecasting, LLMs primarily capture
one-dimensional sequential dependencies and struggle to model the richer
spatio-temporal (ST) correlations essential for accurate ST forecasting. In
this paper, we present \textbf{ST-VFM}, a novel framework that systematically
reprograms Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) for general-purpose spatio-temporal
forecasting. While VFMs offer powerful spatial priors, two key challenges arise
when applying them to ST tasks: (1) the lack of inherent temporal modeling
capacity and (2) the modality gap between visual and ST data. To address these,
ST-VFM adopts a \emph{dual-branch architecture} that integrates raw ST inputs
with auxiliary ST flow inputs, where the flow encodes lightweight temporal
difference signals interpretable as dynamic spatial cues. To effectively
process these dual-branch inputs, ST-VFM introduces two dedicated reprogramming
stages. The \emph{pre-VFM reprogramming} stage applies a Temporal-Aware Token
Adapter to embed temporal context and align both branches into VFM-compatible
feature spaces. The \emph{post-VFM reprogramming} stage introduces a Bilateral
Cross-Prompt Coordination module, enabling dynamic interaction between branches
through prompt-based conditioning, thus enriching joint representation learning
without modifying the frozen VFM backbone. Extensive experiments on ten
spatio-temporal datasets show that ST-VFM outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness across VFM backbones
(e.g., DINO, CLIP, DEIT) and ablation studies, establishing it as a strong
general framework for spatio-temporal forecasting.

Abstract: Mental visualization, the ability to construct and manipulate visual
representations internally, is a core component of human cognition and plays a
vital role in tasks involving reasoning, prediction, and abstraction. Despite
the rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), current
benchmarks primarily assess passive visual perception, offering limited insight
into the more active capability of internally constructing visual patterns to
support problem solving. Yet mental visualization is a critical cognitive skill
in humans, supporting abilities such as spatial navigation, predicting physical
trajectories, and solving complex visual problems through imaginative
simulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce Hyperphantasia, a synthetic
benchmark designed to evaluate the mental visualization abilities of MLLMs
through four carefully constructed puzzles. Each task is procedurally generated
and presented at three difficulty levels, enabling controlled analysis of model
performance across increasing complexity. Our comprehensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art models reveals a substantial gap between the performance of
humans and MLLMs. Additionally, we explore the potential of reinforcement
learning to improve visual simulation capabilities. Our findings suggest that
while some models exhibit partial competence in recognizing visual patterns,
robust mental visualization remains an open challenge for current MLLMs.

Motivation: ViTs中的注意力机制导致频率消失，丢失关键细节和纹理，需要一种方法来动态调制频率响应。

Method: 提出FDAM，包括Attention Inversion（AttInv）和Frequency Dynamic Scaling（FreqScale），通过电路理论生成互补的高通滤波和动态加权频率分量。

Result: 在多种模型（如SegFormer、DeiT、MaskDINO）和任务（语义分割、目标检测等）中表现提升，并在遥感检测中达到SOTA。

Conclusion: FDAM有效避免了表示崩溃，显著提升了ViTs的性能。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have significantly advanced computer vision,
demonstrating strong performance across various tasks. However, the attention
mechanism in ViTs makes each layer function as a low-pass filter, and the
stacked-layer architecture in existing transformers suffers from frequency
vanishing. This leads to the loss of critical details and textures. We propose
a novel, circuit-theory-inspired strategy called Frequency-Dynamic Attention
Modulation (FDAM), which can be easily plugged into ViTs. FDAM directly
modulates the overall frequency response of ViTs and consists of two
techniques: Attention Inversion (AttInv) and Frequency Dynamic Scaling
(FreqScale). Since circuit theory uses low-pass filters as fundamental
elements, we introduce AttInv, a method that generates complementary high-pass
filtering by inverting the low-pass filter in the attention matrix, and
dynamically combining the two. We further design FreqScale to weight different
frequency components for fine-grained adjustments to the target response
function. Through feature similarity analysis and effective rank evaluation, we
demonstrate that our approach avoids representation collapse, leading to
consistent performance improvements across various models, including SegFormer,
DeiT, and MaskDINO. These improvements are evident in tasks such as semantic
segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Additionally, we

Motivation: ViT的高计算成本限制了实际应用，现有剪枝方法因独立处理Q/K令牌而牺牲了准确性。

Method: 提出Block-based Symmetric Pruning and Fusion（BSPF-ViT），联合评估令牌及其邻居，保留关键令牌并通过相似性融合压缩。

Conclusion: BSPF-ViT在效率和准确性上均优于现有方法，适用于各种ViT变体。

Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) has achieved impressive results across various
vision tasks, yet its high computational cost limits practical applications.
Recent methods have aimed to reduce ViT's $O(n^2)$ complexity by pruning
unimportant tokens. However, these techniques often sacrifice accuracy by
independently pruning query (Q) and key (K) tokens, leading to performance
degradation due to overlooked token interactions. To address this limitation,
we introduce a novel {\bf Block-based Symmetric Pruning and Fusion} for
efficient ViT (BSPF-ViT) that optimizes the pruning of Q/K tokens jointly.
Unlike previous methods that consider only a single direction, our approach
evaluates each token and its neighbors to decide which tokens to retain by
taking token interaction into account. The retained tokens are compressed
through a similarity fusion step, preserving key information while reducing
computational costs. The shared weights of Q/K tokens create a symmetric
attention matrix, allowing pruning only the upper triangular part for speed up.
BSPF-ViT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art ViT methods at all pruning
levels, increasing ImageNet classification accuracy by 1.3% on DeiT-T and 2.0%
on DeiT-S, while reducing computational overhead by 50%. It achieves 40%
speedup with improved accuracy across various ViTs.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) emerged as a promising tool for mechanistic
interpretability of transformer-based foundation models. Very recently, SAEs
were also adopted for the visual domain, enabling the discovery of visual
concepts and their patch-wise attribution to tokens in the transformer model.
While a growing number of foundation models emerged for medical imaging, tools
for explaining their inferences are still lacking. In this work, we show the
applicability of SAEs for hematology. We propose CytoSAE, a sparse autoencoder
which is trained on over 40,000 peripheral blood single-cell images. CytoSAE
generalizes to diverse and out-of-domain datasets, including bone marrow
cytology, where it identifies morphologically relevant concepts which we
validated with medical experts. Furthermore, we demonstrate scenarios in which
CytoSAE can generate patient-specific and disease-specific concepts, enabling
the detection of pathognomonic cells and localized cellular abnormalities at
the patch level. We quantified the effect of concepts on a patient-level AML
subtype classification task and show that CytoSAE concepts reach performance
comparable to the state-of-the-art, while offering explainability on the
sub-cellular level. Source code and model weights are available at

Conclusion: MGFFD-VLM框架有效提升了伪造检测的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Recent studies have utilized visual large language models (VLMs) to answer
not only "Is this face a forgery?" but also "Why is the face a forgery?" These
studies introduced forgery-related attributes, such as forgery location and
type, to construct deepfake VQA datasets and train VLMs, achieving high
accuracy while providing human-understandable explanatory text descriptions.
However, these methods still have limitations. For example, they do not fully
leverage face quality-related attributes, which are often abnormal in forged
faces, and they lack effective training strategies for forgery-aware VLMs. In
this paper, we extend the VQA dataset to create DD-VQA+, which features a
richer set of attributes and a more diverse range of samples. Furthermore, we
introduce a novel forgery detection framework, MGFFD-VLM, which integrates an
Attribute-Driven Hybrid LoRA Strategy to enhance the capabilities of Visual
Large Language Models (VLMs). Additionally, our framework incorporates
Multi-Granularity Prompt Learning and a Forgery-Aware Training Strategy. By
transforming classification and forgery segmentation results into prompts, our
method not only improves forgery classification but also enhances
interpretability. To further boost detection performance, we design multiple
forgery-related auxiliary losses. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach surpasses existing methods in both text-based forgery judgment and
analysis, achieving superior accuracy.

Abstract: Deformable Attention Transformers (DAT) have shown remarkable performance in
computer vision tasks by adaptively focusing on informative image regions.
However, their data-dependent sampling mechanism introduces irregular memory
access patterns, posing significant challenges for efficient hardware
deployment. Existing acceleration methods either incur high hardware overhead

hardware-friendly optimization framework for DAT. First, a neural architecture

automatically divide the input feature into uniform patches during the
inference process, avoiding memory conflicts without modifying model
architecture. The method explores the optimal slice configuration by jointly
optimizing hardware cost and inference accuracy. Secondly, an FPGA-based
verification system is designed to test the performance of this framework on
edge-side hardware. Algorithm experiments on the ImageNet-1K dataset
demonstrate that our hardware-friendly framework can maintain have only 0.2%
accuracy drop compared to the baseline DAT. Hardware experiments on Xilinx FPGA
show the proposed method reduces DRAM access times to 18% compared with
existing DAT acceleration methods.

Abstract: Diffusion Models have shown remarkable proficiency in image and video
synthesis. As model size and latency increase limit user experience, hybrid
edge-cloud collaborative framework was recently proposed to realize fast
inference and high-quality generation, where the cloud model initiates
high-quality semantic planning and the edge model expedites later-stage
refinement. However, excessive cloud denoising prolongs inference time, while
insufficient steps cause semantic ambiguity, leading to inconsistency in edge
model output. To address these challenges, we propose EC-Diff that accelerates
cloud inference through gradient-based noise estimation while identifying the
optimal point for cloud-edge handoff to maintain generation quality.
Specifically, we design a K-step noise approximation strategy to reduce cloud
inference frequency by using noise gradients between steps and applying cloud
inference periodically to adjust errors. Then we design a two-stage greedy
search algorithm to efficiently find the optimal parameters for noise
approximation and edge model switching. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method significantly enhances generation quality compared to edge
inference, while achieving up to an average $2\times$ speedup in inference
compared to cloud inference. Video samples and source code are available at

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable image generation capabilities,
but also pose risks in privacy and fairness by memorizing sensitive concepts or
perpetuating biases. We propose a novel \textbf{concept erasure} method for
text-to-image diffusion models, designed to remove specified concepts (e.g., a
private individual or a harmful stereotype) from the model's generative
repertoire. Our method, termed \textbf{FADE} (Fair Adversarial Diffusion
Erasure), combines a trajectory-aware fine-tuning strategy with an adversarial
objective to ensure the concept is reliably removed while preserving overall
model fidelity. Theoretically, we prove a formal guarantee that our approach
minimizes the mutual information between the erased concept and the model's
outputs, ensuring privacy and fairness. Empirically, we evaluate FADE on Stable
Diffusion and FLUX, using benchmarks from prior work (e.g., object, celebrity,
explicit content, and style erasure tasks from MACE). FADE achieves
state-of-the-art concept removal performance, surpassing recent baselines like
ESD, UCE, MACE, and ANT in terms of removal efficacy and image quality.
Notably, FADE improves the harmonic mean of concept removal and fidelity by
5--10\% over the best prior method. We also conduct an ablation study to
validate each component of FADE, confirming that our adversarial and
trajectory-preserving objectives each contribute to its superior performance.
Our work sets a new standard for safe and fair generative modeling by
unlearning specified concepts without retraining from scratch.

Abstract: The landscape of video recognition has evolved significantly, shifting from
traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to Transformer-based
architectures for improved accuracy. While 3D CNNs have been effective at
capturing spatiotemporal dynamics, recent Transformer models leverage
self-attention to model long-range spatial and temporal dependencies. Despite
achieving state-of-the-art performance on major benchmarks, Transformers remain
computationally expensive, particularly with dense video data. To address this,
we propose a lightweight Video Focal Modulation Network, DVFL-Net, which
distills spatiotemporal knowledge from a large pre-trained teacher into a
compact nano student model, enabling efficient on-device deployment. DVFL-Net
utilizes knowledge distillation and spatial-temporal feature modulation to
significantly reduce computation while preserving high recognition performance.
We employ forward Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence alongside spatio-temporal
focal modulation to effectively transfer both local and global context from the
Video-FocalNet Base (teacher) to the proposed VFL-Net (student). We evaluate
DVFL-Net on UCF50, UCF101, HMDB51, SSV2, and Kinetics-400, benchmarking it
against recent state-of-the-art methods in Human Action Recognition (HAR).
Additionally, we conduct a detailed ablation study analyzing the impact of
forward KL divergence. The results confirm the superiority of DVFL-Net in
achieving an optimal balance between performance and efficiency, demonstrating
lower memory usage, reduced GFLOPs, and strong accuracy, making it a practical
solution for real-time HAR applications.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal traffic prediction plays a key role in intelligent
transportation systems by enabling accurate prediction in complex urban areas.
Although not only accuracy but also efficiency for scalability is important,
some previous methods struggle to capture heterogeneity such as varying traffic
patterns across regions and time periods. Moreover, Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs), which are the mainstream of traffic prediction, not only require
predefined adjacency matrix, but also limit scalability to large-scale data
containing many nodes due to their inherent complexity. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Deformable Dynamic Convolution Network (DDCN) for
accurate yet efficient traffic prediction. Traditional Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) are limited in modeling non-Euclidean spatial structures and
spatio-temporal heterogeneity, DDCN overcomes these challenges by dynamically
applying deformable filters based on offset. Specifically, DDCN decomposes
transformer-style CNN to encoder-decoder structure, and applies proposed
approaches to the spatial and spatio-temporal attention blocks of the encoder
to emphasize important features. The decoder, composed of feed-forward module,
complements the output of the encoder. This novel structure make DDCN can
perform accurate yet efficient traffic prediction. In comprehensive experiments
on four real-world datasets, DDCN achieves competitive performance, emphasizing
the potential and effectiveness of CNN-based approaches for spatio-temporal
traffic prediction.

Abstract: Abstract visual reasoning (AVR) enables humans to quickly discover and
generalize abstract rules to new scenarios. Designing intelligent systems with
human-like AVR abilities has been a long-standing topic in the artificial
intelligence community. Deep AVR solvers have recently achieved remarkable
success in various AVR tasks. However, they usually use task-specific designs
or parameters in different tasks. In such a paradigm, solving new tasks often
means retraining the model, and sometimes retuning the model architectures,
which increases the cost of solving AVR problems. In contrast to task-specific
approaches, this paper proposes a novel Unified Conditional Generative Solver
(UCGS), aiming to address multiple AVR tasks in a unified framework. First, we
prove that some well-known AVR tasks can be reformulated as the problem of
estimating the predictability of target images in problem panels. Then, we
illustrate that, under the proposed framework, training one conditional
generative model can solve various AVR tasks. The experiments show that with a
single round of multi-task training, UCGS demonstrates abstract reasoning
ability across various AVR tasks. Especially, UCGS exhibits the ability of
zero-shot reasoning, enabling it to perform abstract reasoning on problems from
unseen AVR tasks in the testing phase.

Abstract: Open-set few-shot image classification aims to train models using a small
amount of labeled data, enabling them to achieve good generalization when
confronted with unknown environments. Existing methods mainly use visual
information from a single image to learn class representations to distinguish
known from unknown categories. However, these methods often overlook the
benefits of integrating rich contextual information. To address this issue,
this paper proposes a prototypical augmentation and alignment method, termed
ProtoConNet, which incorporates background information from different samples
to enhance the diversity of the feature space, breaking the spurious
associations between context and image subjects in few-shot scenarios.
Specifically, it consists of three main modules: the clustering-based data
selection (CDS) module mines diverse data patterns while preserving core
features; the contextual-enhanced semantic refinement (CSR) module builds a
context dictionary to integrate into image representations, which boosts the
model's robustness in various scenarios; and the prototypical alignment (PA)
module reduces the gap between image representations and class prototypes,
amplifying feature distances for known and unknown classes. Experimental
results from two datasets verified that ProtoConNet enhances the effectiveness
of representation learning in few-shot scenarios and identifies open-set
samples, making it superior to existing methods.

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) aims to identify human emotions
from temporally evolving facial movements and plays a critical role in
affective computing. While recent vision-language approaches have introduced
semantic textual descriptions to guide expression recognition, existing methods
still face two key limitations: they often underutilize the subtle emotional
cues embedded in generated text, and they have yet to incorporate sufficiently
effective mechanisms for filtering out facial dynamics that are irrelevant to
emotional expression. To address these gaps, We propose GRACE, Granular
Representation Alignment for Cross-modal Emotion recognition that integrates
dynamic motion modeling, semantic text refinement, and token-level cross-modal
alignment to facilitate the precise localization of emotionally salient
spatiotemporal features. Our method constructs emotion-aware textual
descriptions via a Coarse-to-fine Affective Text Enhancement (CATE) module and
highlights expression-relevant facial motion through a motion-difference
weighting mechanism. These refined semantic and visual signals are aligned at
the token level using entropy-regularized optimal transport. Experiments on
three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves
recognition performance, particularly in challenging settings with ambiguous or
imbalanced emotion classes, establishing new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in
terms of both UAR and WAR.

Conclusion: SFM是一种通用且高效的方法，能显著提升高频信息处理能力。

Abstract: High spatial frequency information, including fine details like textures,
significantly contributes to the accuracy of semantic segmentation. However,
according to the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem, high-frequency components
are vulnerable to aliasing or distortion when propagating through downsampling
layers such as strided-convolution. Here, we propose a novel Spatial Frequency
Modulation (SFM) that modulates high-frequency features to a lower frequency
before downsampling and then demodulates them back during upsampling.
Specifically, we implement modulation through adaptive resampling (ARS) and
design a lightweight add-on that can densely sample the high-frequency areas to
scale up the signal, thereby lowering its frequency in accordance with the
Frequency Scaling Property. We also propose Multi-Scale Adaptive Upsampling
(MSAU) to demodulate the modulated feature and recover high-frequency
information through non-uniform upsampling This module further improves
segmentation by explicitly exploiting information interaction between densely
and sparsely resampled areas at multiple scales. Both modules can seamlessly
integrate with various architectures, extending from convolutional neural
networks to transformers. Feature visualization and analysis confirm that our
method effectively alleviates aliasing while successfully retaining details
after demodulation. Finally, we validate the broad applicability and
effectiveness of SFM by extending it to image classification, adversarial
robustness, instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation tasks. The code is

Abstract: With recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) models, effectively
generating multiple instances within a single image prompt has become a crucial

individual instances, often struggle to account for relationship discrepancy

proposes the relation-aware disentangled learning (RaDL) framework. RaDL
enhances instance-specific attributes through learnable parameters and
generates relation-aware image features via Relation Attention, utilizing
action verbs extracted from the global prompt. Through extensive evaluations on
benchmarks such as COCO-Position, COCO-MIG, and DrawBench, we demonstrate that
RaDL outperforms existing methods, showing significant improvements in
positional accuracy, multiple attributes consideration, and the relationships
between instances. Our results present RaDL as the solution for generating
images that consider both the relationships and multiple attributes of each
instance within the multi-instance image.

Abstract: Generalizable semantic segmentation aims to perform well on unseen target
domains, a critical challenge due to real-world applications requiring high
generalizability. Class-wise prototypes, representing class centroids, serve as
domain-invariant cues that benefit generalization due to their stability and
semantic consistency. However, this approach faces three challenges. First,
existing methods often adopt coarse prototypical alignment strategies, which
may hinder performance. Second, naive prototypes computed by averaging source
batch features are prone to overfitting and may be negatively affected by
unrelated source data. Third, most methods treat all source samples equally,
ignoring the fact that different features have varying adaptation difficulties.
To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework for generalizable
semantic segmentation: Prototypical Progressive Alignment and Reweighting
(PPAR), leveraging the strong generalization ability of the CLIP model.
Specifically, we define two prototypes: the Original Text Prototype (OTP) and
Visual Text Prototype (VTP), generated via CLIP to serve as a solid base for
alignment. We then introduce a progressive alignment strategy that aligns
features in an easy-to-difficult manner, reducing domain gaps gradually.
Furthermore, we propose a prototypical reweighting mechanism that estimates the
reliability of source data and adjusts its contribution, mitigating the effect
of irrelevant or harmful features (i.e., reducing negative transfer). We also
provide a theoretical analysis showing the alignment between our method and
domain generalization theory. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that PPAR achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Language-Guided Contrastive Audio-Visual Masked
Autoencoders (LG-CAV-MAE) to improve audio-visual representation learning.
LG-CAV-MAE integrates a pretrained text encoder into contrastive audio-visual
masked autoencoders, enabling the model to learn across audio, visual and text
modalities. To train LG-CAV-MAE, we introduce an automatic method to generate
audio-visual-text triplets from unlabeled videos. We first generate frame-level
captions using an image captioning model and then apply CLAP-based filtering to
ensure strong alignment between audio and captions. This approach yields
high-quality audio-visual-text triplets without requiring manual annotations.
We evaluate LG-CAV-MAE on audio-visual retrieval tasks, as well as an
audio-visual classification task. Our method significantly outperforms existing
approaches, achieving up to a 5.6% improvement in recall@10 for retrieval tasks
and a 3.2% improvement for the classification task.

Abstract: Recent advances in test-time adaptation (TTA) for Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) have garnered increasing attention, particularly through the use of
multiple augmented views of a single image to boost zero-shot generalization.
Unfortunately, existing methods fail to strike a satisfactory balance between
performance and efficiency, either due to excessive overhead of tuning text
prompts or unstable benefits from handcrafted, training-free visual feature
enhancement. In this paper, we present Global-Spatial Bias Learner (GS-Bias),
an efficient and effective TTA paradigm that incorporates two learnable biases
during TTA, unfolded as the global bias and spatial bias. Particularly, the
global bias captures the global semantic features of a test image by learning
consistency across augmented views, while spatial bias learns the semantic
coherence between regions in the image's spatial visual representation. It is
worth highlighting that these two sets of biases are directly added to the
logits outputed by the pretrained VLMs, which circumvent the full
backpropagation through VLM that hinders the efficiency of existing TTA
methods. This endows GS-Bias with extremely high efficiency while achieving
state-of-the-art performance on 15 benchmark datasets. For example, it achieves
a 2.23% improvement over TPT in cross-dataset generalization and a 2.72%
improvement in domain generalization, while requiring only 6.5% of TPT's memory
usage on ImageNet.

Motivation: 现有无监督部件发现方法在跨类别和场景时缺乏鲁棒性，限制了应用范围。MPAE旨在解决这一问题。

Method: MPAE通过掩码图像、学习部件描述符和特征图，利用局部特征与描述符的相似性填充掩码区域，从而对齐部件形状。

Result: 实验表明，MPAE能鲁棒地发现跨类别和场景的有意义部件，并为解决遮挡和跨类别部件相似性提供基础。

Conclusion: MPAE是一种有效的无监督部件发现方法，适用于复杂场景和多样类别。

Abstract: Part-level features are crucial for image understanding, but few studies
focus on them because of the lack of fine-grained labels. Although unsupervised
part discovery can eliminate the reliance on labels, most of them cannot
maintain robustness across various categories and scenarios, which restricts
their application range. To overcome this limitation, we present a more
effective paradigm for unsupervised part discovery, named Masked Part
Autoencoder (MPAE). It first learns part descriptors as well as a feature map
from the inputs and produces patch features from a masked version of the
original images. Then, the masked regions are filled with the learned part
descriptors based on the similarity between the local features and descriptors.
By restoring these masked patches using the part descriptors, they become
better aligned with their part shapes, guided by appearance features from
unmasked patches. Finally, MPAE robustly discovers meaningful parts that
closely match the actual object shapes, even in complex scenarios. Moreover,
several looser yet more effective constraints are proposed to enable MPAE to
identify the presence of parts across various scenarios and categories in an
unsupervised manner. This provides the foundation for addressing challenges
posed by occlusion and for exploring part similarity across multiple
categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method robustly
discovers meaningful parts across various categories and scenarios. The code is

Result: 定性和定量实验表明，该方法能根据给定掩码成功实现区域特定的风格混合。

Conclusion: 该方法为风格混合提供了更精确的控制，同时保持了结构的连贯性。

Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image models have achieved remarkable results in
synthesizing diverse images from text prompts and can capture specific artistic
styles via style personalization. However, their entangled latent space and
lack of smooth interpolation make it difficult to apply distinct painting
techniques in a controlled, regional manner, often causing one style to
dominate. To overcome this, we propose a zero-shot diffusion pipeline that
naturally blends multiple styles by performing style composition on the
denoised latents predicted during the flow-matching denoising process of
separately trained, style-specialized models. We leverage the fact that
lower-noise latents carry stronger stylistic information and fuse them across
heterogeneous diffusion pipelines using spatial masks, enabling precise,
region-specific style control. This mechanism preserves the fidelity of each
individual style while allowing user-guided mixing. Furthermore, to ensure
structural coherence across different models, we incorporate depth-map
conditioning via ControlNet into the diffusion framework. Qualitative and
quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method successfully achieves
region-specific style mixing according to the given masks.

Conclusion: ID-EA通过改进文本与视觉嵌入的对齐，有效提升个性化肖像生成的身份一致性和效率。

Abstract: Recently, personalized portrait generation with a text-to-image diffusion
model has significantly advanced with Textual Inversion, emerging as a
promising approach for creating high-fidelity personalized images. Despite its
potential, current Textual Inversion methods struggle to maintain consistent
facial identity due to semantic misalignments between textual and visual
embedding spaces regarding identity. We introduce ID-EA, a novel framework that
guides text embeddings to align with visual identity embeddings, thereby
improving identity preservation in a personalized generation. ID-EA comprises
two key components: the ID-driven Enhancer (ID-Enhancer) and the ID-conditioned
Adapter (ID-Adapter). First, the ID-Enhancer integrates identity embeddings
with a textual ID anchor, refining visual identity embeddings derived from a
face recognition model using representative text embeddings. Then, the
ID-Adapter leverages the identity-enhanced embedding to adapt the text
condition, ensuring identity preservation by adjusting the cross-attention
module in the pre-trained UNet model. This process encourages the text features
to find the most related visual clues across the foreground snippets. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that ID-EA substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity preservation metrics while
achieving remarkable computational efficiency, generating personalized
portraits approximately 15 times faster than existing approaches.

Abstract: Recent works have correlated Masked Image Modeling (MIM) with consistency
regularization in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). However, they merely
treat masking as a special form of deformation on the input images and neglect
the theoretical analysis, which leads to a superficial understanding of masked
reconstruction and insufficient exploitation of its potential in enhancing
feature extraction and representation learning. In this paper, we reframe
masked reconstruction as a sparse signal reconstruction problem and
theoretically prove that the dual form of complementary masks possesses
superior capabilities in extracting domain-agnostic image features. Based on
this compelling insight, we propose MaskTwins, a simple yet effective UDA
framework that integrates masked reconstruction directly into the main training
pipeline. MaskTwins uncovers intrinsic structural patterns that persist across
disparate domains by enforcing consistency between predictions of images masked
in complementary ways, enabling domain generalization in an end-to-end manner.
Extensive experiments verify the superiority of MaskTwins over baseline methods
in natural and biological image segmentation. These results demonstrate the
significant advantages of MaskTwins in extracting domain-invariant features
without the need for separate pre-training, offering a new paradigm for
domain-adaptive segmentation.

Abstract: High-quality open-source datasets have emerged as a pivotal catalyst driving

potential exploitation. Protecting these datasets is of paramount importance
for the interests of their owners. The verification of dataset ownership has
evolved into a crucial approach in this domain; however, existing verification
techniques are predominantly tailored to supervised models and contrastive
pre-trained models, rendering them ill-suited for direct application to the
increasingly prevalent masked models. In this work, we introduce the inaugural
methodology addressing this critical, yet unresolved challenge, termed Dataset
Ownership Verification for Masked Modeling (DOV4MM). The central objective is
to ascertain whether a suspicious black-box model has been pre-trained on a
particular unlabeled dataset, thereby assisting dataset owners in safeguarding
their rights. DOV4MM is grounded in our empirical observation that when a model
is pre-trained on the target dataset, the difficulty of reconstructing masked
information within the embedding space exhibits a marked contrast to models not
pre-trained on that dataset. We validated the efficacy of DOV4MM through ten
masked image models on ImageNet-1K and four masked language models on
WikiText-103. The results demonstrate that DOV4MM rejects the null hypothesis,
with a $p$-value considerably below 0.05, surpassing all prior approaches. Code

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of novel class discovery (NCD), which
aims to cluster novel classes by leveraging knowledge from disjoint known
classes. While recent advances have made significant progress in this area,
existing NCD methods face two major limitations. First, they primarily focus on
single-view data (e.g., images), overlooking the increasingly common multi-view
data, such as multi-omics datasets used in disease diagnosis. Second, their
reliance on pseudo-labels to supervise novel class clustering often results in
unstable performance, as pseudo-label quality is highly sensitive to factors
such as data noise and feature dimensionality. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel framework named Intra-view and Inter-view Correlation Guided
Multi-view Novel Class Discovery (IICMVNCD), which is the first attempt to
explore NCD in multi-view setting so far. Specifically, at the intra-view
level, leveraging the distributional similarity between known and novel
classes, we employ matrix factorization to decompose features into
view-specific shared base matrices and factor matrices. The base matrices
capture distributional consistency among the two datasets, while the factor
matrices model pairwise relationships between samples. At the inter-view level,
we utilize view relationships among known classes to guide the clustering of
novel classes. This includes generating predicted labels through the weighted
fusion of factor matrices and dynamically adjusting view weights of known
classes based on the supervision loss, which are then transferred to novel
class learning. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed
approach.

Abstract: Face anti-spoofing (FAS) aims to construct a robust system that can withstand
diverse attacks. While recent efforts have concentrated mainly on cross-domain
generalization, two significant challenges persist: limited semantic
understanding of attack types and training redundancy across domains. We
address the first by integrating vision-language models (VLMs) to enhance the
perception of visual input. For the second challenge, we employ a meta-domain
strategy to learn a unified model that generalizes well across multiple
domains. Our proposed InstructFLIP is a novel instruction-tuned framework that
leverages VLMs to enhance generalization via textual guidance trained solely on
a single domain. At its core, InstructFLIP explicitly decouples instructions
into content and style components, where content-based instructions focus on
the essential semantics of spoofing, and style-based instructions consider
variations related to the environment and camera characteristics. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of InstructFLIP by outperforming SOTA
models in accuracy and substantially reducing training redundancy across
diverse domains in FAS. Project website is available at

Abstract: Video Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight Detection (HD) aim to pinpoint
specific moments and assess clip-wise relevance based on the text query. While
DETR-based joint frameworks have made significant strides, there remains
untapped potential in harnessing the intricate relationships between temporal
motion and spatial semantics within video content. In this paper, we propose
the Motion-Semantics DETR (MS-DETR), a framework that captures rich
motion-semantics features through unified learning for MR/HD tasks. The encoder
first explicitly models disentangled intra-modal correlations within motion and
semantics dimensions, guided by the given text queries. Subsequently, the
decoder utilizes the task-wise correlation across temporal motion and spatial
semantics dimensions to enable precise query-guided localization for MR and
refined highlight boundary delineation for HD. Furthermore, we observe the
inherent sparsity dilemma within the motion and semantics dimensions of MR/HD
datasets. To address this issue, we enrich the corpus from both dimensions by
generation strategies and propose contrastive denoising learning to ensure the
above components learn robustly and effectively. Extensive experiments on four
MR/HD benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
state-of-the-art models by a margin. Our code is available at

Abstract: Motion forecasting for on-road traffic agents presents both a significant
challenge and a critical necessity for ensuring safety in autonomous driving
systems. In contrast to most existing data-driven approaches that directly
predict future trajectories, we rethink this task from a planning perspective,
advocating a "First Reasoning, Then Forecasting" strategy that explicitly
incorporates behavior intentions as spatial guidance for trajectory prediction.
To achieve this, we introduce an interpretable, reward-driven intention
reasoner grounded in a novel query-centric Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL)
scheme. Our method first encodes traffic agents and scene elements into a
unified vectorized representation, then aggregates contextual features through
a query-centric paradigm. This enables the derivation of a reward distribution,
a compact yet informative representation of the target agent's behavior within
the given scene context via IRL. Guided by this reward heuristic, we perform
policy rollouts to reason about multiple plausible intentions, providing
valuable priors for subsequent trajectory generation. Finally, we develop a
hierarchical DETR-like decoder integrated with bidirectional selective state
space models to produce accurate future trajectories along with their
associated probabilities. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Argoverse
and nuScenes motion forecasting datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly enhances trajectory prediction confidence, achieving highly
competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有FGIR方法依赖预训练模型，限制了在资源受限环境中的适应性和任务特定架构的设计。

Method: 引入TGDA框架，结合数据感知增强和细粒度感知教师模型的弱监督，设计了任务特定架构（如LRNets和ViTFS）。

Abstract: Fine-grained image recognition (FGIR) aims to distinguish visually similar
sub-categories within a broader class, such as identifying bird species. While
most existing FGIR methods rely on backbones pretrained on large-scale datasets
like ImageNet, this dependence limits adaptability to resource-constrained
environments and hinders the development of task-specific architectures
tailored to the unique challenges of FGIR.
  In this work, we challenge the conventional reliance on pretrained models by
demonstrating that high-performance FGIR systems can be trained entirely from
scratch. We introduce a novel training framework, TGDA, that integrates
data-aware augmentation with weak supervision via a fine-grained-aware teacher
model, implemented through knowledge distillation. This framework unlocks the
design of task-specific and hardware-aware architectures, including LRNets for
low-resolution FGIR and ViTFS, a family of Vision Transformers optimized for
efficient inference.
  Extensive experiments across three FGIR benchmarks over diverse settings
involving low-resolution and high-resolution inputs show that our method
consistently matches or surpasses state-of-the-art pretrained counterparts. In
particular, in the low-resolution setting, LRNets trained with TGDA improve
accuracy by up to 23\% over prior methods while requiring up to 20.6x less
parameters, lower FLOPs, and significantly less training data. Similarly,
ViTFS-T can match the performance of a ViT B-16 pretrained on ImageNet-21k
while using 15.3x fewer trainable parameters and requiring orders of magnitudes
less data. These results highlight TGDA's potential as an adaptable alternative
to pretraining, paving the way for more efficient fine-grained vision systems.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in generative
modeling, yet their sampling procedures remain vulnerable to hallucinations,
often stemming from inaccuracies in score approximation. In this work, we
reinterpret diffusion sampling through the lens of optimization and introduce
RODS (Robust Optimization-inspired Diffusion Sampler), a novel method that
detects and corrects high-risk sampling steps using geometric cues from the
loss landscape. RODS enforces smoother sampling trajectories and adaptively
adjusts perturbations, reducing hallucinations without retraining and at
minimal additional inference cost. Experiments on AFHQv2, FFHQ, and 11k-hands
demonstrate that RODS improves both sampling fidelity and robustness, detecting
over 70% of hallucinated samples and correcting more than 25%, all while
avoiding the introduction of new artifacts.

Conclusion: 生成式模型为医学图像短语定位提供了更有效的范式，具有更高的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Abstract: Phrase grounding, i.e., mapping natural language phrases to specific image
regions, holds significant potential for disease localization in medical
imaging through clinical reports. While current state-of-the-art methods rely
on discriminative, self-supervised contrastive models, we demonstrate that
generative text-to-image diffusion models, leveraging cross-attention maps, can
achieve superior zero-shot phrase grounding performance. Contrary to prior
assumptions, we show that fine-tuning diffusion models with a frozen,
domain-specific language model, such as CXR-BERT, substantially outperforms
domain-agnostic counterparts. This setup achieves remarkable improvements, with
mIoU scores doubling those of current discriminative methods. These findings
highlight the underexplored potential of generative models for phrase grounding
tasks. To further enhance performance, we introduce Bimodal Bias Merging (BBM),
a novel post-processing technique that aligns text and image biases to identify
regions of high certainty. BBM refines cross-attention maps, achieving even
greater localization accuracy. Our results establish generative approaches as a
more effective paradigm for phrase grounding in the medical imaging domain,
paving the way for more robust and interpretable applications in clinical
practice. The source code and model weights are available at

Abstract: We argue that diffusion models' success in modeling complex distributions is,
for the most part, coming from their input conditioning. This paper
investigates the representation used to condition diffusion models from the
perspective that ideal representations should improve sample fidelity, be easy
to generate, and be compositional to allow out-of-training samples generation.
We introduce Discrete Latent Code (DLC), an image representation derived from
Simplicial Embeddings trained with a self-supervised learning objective. DLCs
are sequences of discrete tokens, as opposed to the standard continuous image
embeddings. They are easy to generate and their compositionality enables
sampling of novel images beyond the training distribution. Diffusion models
trained with DLCs have improved generation fidelity, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for unconditional image generation on ImageNet. Additionally,
we show that composing DLCs allows the image generator to produce
out-of-distribution samples that coherently combine the semantics of images in
diverse ways. Finally, we showcase how DLCs can enable text-to-image generation
by leveraging large-scale pretrained language models. We efficiently finetune a
text diffusion language model to generate DLCs that produce novel samples
outside of the image generator training distribution.

Abstract: Training of autonomous driving systems requires extensive datasets with

expensive. In this paper, we introduce AutoVDC (Automated Vision Data Cleaning)

automatically identify erroneous annotations in vision datasets, thereby
enabling users to eliminate these errors and enhance data quality. We validate
our approach using the KITTI and nuImages datasets, which contain object

AutoVDC, we create dataset variants with intentionally injected erroneous
annotations and observe the error detection rate of our approach. Additionally,
we compare the detection rates using different VLMs and explore the impact of
VLM fine-tuning on our pipeline. The results demonstrate our method's high

Result: 在FashionIQ和CIRR数据集上达到SOTA性能，并在HP-FashionIQ数据集上表现出最强的人类偏好对齐。

Conclusion: QuRe有效解决了假阴性问题，提升了检索结果的相关性和用户满意度。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) retrieves relevant images based on a reference
image and accompanying text describing desired modifications. However, existing
CIR methods only focus on retrieving the target image and disregard the
relevance of other images. This limitation arises because most methods
employing contrastive learning-which treats the target image as positive and
all other images in the batch as negatives-can inadvertently include false
negatives. This may result in retrieving irrelevant images, reducing user
satisfaction even when the target image is retrieved. To address this issue, we
propose Query-Relevant Retrieval through Hard Negative Sampling (QuRe), which
optimizes a reward model objective to reduce false negatives. Additionally, we
introduce a hard negative sampling strategy that selects images positioned
between two steep drops in relevance scores following the target image, to
effectively filter false negatives. In order to evaluate CIR models on their
alignment with human satisfaction, we create Human-Preference FashionIQ
(HP-FashionIQ), a new dataset that explicitly captures user preferences beyond
target retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QuRe achieves
state-of-the-art performance on FashionIQ and CIRR datasets while exhibiting
the strongest alignment with human preferences on the HP-FashionIQ dataset. The

Result: 在COCO、VisDrone和PASCAL VOC数据集上优于现有方法，尤其在小物体检测中表现突出。

Conclusion: InterpIoU和Dynamic InterpIoU有效解决了传统IoU损失函数的局限性，提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Bounding box regression (BBR) is fundamental to object detection, where the
regression loss is crucial for accurate localization. Existing IoU-based losses
often incorporate handcrafted geometric penalties to address IoU's
non-differentiability in non-overlapping cases and enhance BBR performance.
However, these penalties are sensitive to box shape, size, and distribution,
often leading to suboptimal optimization for small objects and undesired
behaviors such as bounding box enlargement due to misalignment with the IoU
objective. To address these limitations, we propose InterpIoU, a novel loss
function that replaces handcrafted geometric penalties with a term based on the
IoU between interpolated boxes and the target. By using interpolated boxes to
bridge the gap between predictions and ground truth, InterpIoU provides
meaningful gradients in non-overlapping cases and inherently avoids the box
enlargement issue caused by misaligned penalties. Simulation results further
show that IoU itself serves as an ideal regression target, while existing
geometric penalties are both unnecessary and suboptimal. Building on InterpIoU,
we introduce Dynamic InterpIoU, which dynamically adjusts interpolation
coefficients based on IoU values, enhancing adaptability to scenarios with
diverse object distributions. Experiments on COCO, VisDrone, and PASCAL VOC
show that our methods consistently outperform state-of-the-art IoU-based losses
across various detection frameworks, with particularly notable improvements in
small object detection, confirming their effectiveness.

Abstract: Recent progress has been made in region-aware vision-language modeling,
particularly with the emergence of the Describe Anything Model (DAM). DAM is
capable of generating detailed descriptions of any specific image areas or
objects without the need for additional localized image-text alignment
supervision. We hypothesize that such region-level descriptive capability is
beneficial for the task of Visual Question Answering (VQA), especially in
challenging scenarios involving images with dense text. In such settings, the
fine-grained extraction of textual information is crucial to producing correct
answers. Motivated by this, we introduce DAM-QA, a framework with a tailored
evaluation protocol, developed to investigate and harness the region-aware
capabilities from DAM for the text-rich VQA problem that requires reasoning
over text-based information within images. DAM-QA incorporates a mechanism that
aggregates answers from multiple regional views of image content, enabling more
effective identification of evidence that may be tied to text-related elements.
Experiments on six VQA benchmarks show that our approach consistently
outperforms the baseline DAM, with a notable 7+ point gain on DocVQA. DAM-QA
also achieves the best overall performance among region-aware models with fewer
parameters, significantly narrowing the gap with strong generalist VLMs. These
results highlight the potential of DAM-like models for text-rich and broader
VQA tasks when paired with efficient usage and integration strategies. Our code

Abstract: Radiologists rely on eye movements to navigate and interpret medical images.
A trained radiologist possesses knowledge about the potential diseases that may
be present in the images and, when searching, follows a mental checklist to
locate them using their gaze. This is a key observation, yet existing models
fail to capture the underlying intent behind each fixation. In this paper, we
introduce a deep learning-based approach, RadGazeIntent, designed to model this
behavior: having an intention to find something and actively searching for it.
Our transformer-based architecture processes both the temporal and spatial
dimensions of gaze data, transforming fine-grained fixation features into
coarse, meaningful representations of diagnostic intent to interpret
radiologists' goals. To capture the nuances of radiologists' varied
intention-driven behaviors, we process existing medical eye-tracking datasets
to create three intention-labeled subsets: RadSeq (Systematic Sequential
Search), RadExplore (Uncertainty-driven Exploration), and RadHybrid (Hybrid
Pattern). Experimental results demonstrate RadGazeIntent's ability to predict
which findings radiologists are examining at specific moments, outperforming
baseline methods across all intention-labeled datasets.

Abstract: Grasping unknown objects from a single view has remained a challenging topic
in robotics due to the uncertainty of partial observation. Recent advances in
large-scale models have led to benchmark solutions such as GraspNet-1Billion.
However, such learning-based approaches still face a critical limitation in
performance robustness for their sensitivity to sensing noise and environmental
changes. To address this bottleneck in achieving highly generalized grasping,
we abandon the traditional learning framework and introduce a new perspective:
similarity matching, where similar known objects are utilized to guide the
grasping of unknown target objects. We newly propose a method that robustly
achieves unknown-object grasping from a single viewpoint through three key
steps: 1) Leverage the visual features of the observed object to perform
similarity matching with an existing database containing various object models,
identifying potential candidates with high similarity; 2) Use the candidate
models with pre-existing grasping knowledge to plan imitative grasps for the
unknown target object; 3) Optimize the grasp quality through a local
fine-tuning process. To address the uncertainty caused by partial and noisy
observation, we propose a multi-level similarity matching framework that
integrates semantic, geometric, and dimensional features for comprehensive
evaluation. Especially, we introduce a novel point cloud geometric descriptor,
the C-FPFH descriptor, which facilitates accurate similarity assessment between
partial point clouds of observed objects and complete point clouds of database
models. In addition, we incorporate the use of large language models, introduce
the semi-oriented bounding box, and develop a novel point cloud registration
approach based on plane detection to enhance matching accuracy under
single-view conditions. Videos are available at https://youtu.be/qQDIELMhQmk.

Motivation: 随着人脸识别系统（FRS）的广泛应用，用户隐私保护变得尤为重要。传统HE方法因非定制化设计导致效率低下，亟需一种高效且安全的解决方案。

Result: 实验表明，IDFace能在126ms内从100万加密模板中识别出人脸，仅比明文识别慢2倍。

Conclusion: IDFace通过优化HE在FRS中的应用，实现了高效且安全的隐私保护。

Abstract: As face recognition systems (FRS) become more widely used, user privacy
becomes more important. A key privacy issue in FRS is protecting the user's
face template, as the characteristics of the user's face image can be recovered
from the template. Although recent advances in cryptographic tools such as
homomorphic encryption (HE) have provided opportunities for securing the FRS,
HE cannot be used directly with FRS in an efficient plug-and-play manner. In
particular, although HE is functionally complete for arbitrary programs, it is
basically designed for algebraic operations on encrypted data of predetermined
shape, such as a polynomial ring. Thus, a non-tailored combination of HE and
the system can yield very inefficient performance, and many previous HE-based
face template protection methods are hundreds of times slower than plain
systems without protection. In this study, we propose IDFace, a new HE-based
secure and efficient face identification method with template protection.
IDFace is designed on the basis of two novel techniques for efficient searching
on a (homomorphically encrypted) biometric database with an angular metric. The
first technique is a template representation transformation that sharply
reduces the unit cost for the matching test. The second is a space-efficient
encoding that reduces wasted space from the encryption algorithm, thus saving
the number of operations on encrypted templates. Through experiments, we show
that IDFace can identify a face template from among a database of 1M encrypted
templates in 126ms, showing only 2X overhead compared to the identification
over plaintexts.

Abstract: Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) has gained increasing interest for
remote sensing applications. Recent studies show that Doppler velocity
projections extracted from CSI can enable human activity recognition (HAR) that
is robust to environmental changes and generalizes to new users. However,
despite these advances, generalizability still remains insufficient for
practical deployment. Inspired by neural radiance fields (NeRF), which learn a
volumetric representation of a 3D scene from 2D images, this work proposes a
novel approach to reconstruct an informative 3D latent motion representation
from one-dimensional Doppler velocity projections extracted from Wi-Fi CSI. The
resulting latent representation is then used to construct a uniform Doppler
radiance field (DoRF) of the motion, providing a comprehensive view of the
performed activity and improving the robustness to environmental variability.
The results show that the proposed approach noticeably enhances the
generalization accuracy of Wi-Fi-based HAR, highlighting the strong potential
of DoRFs for practical sensing applications.

Conclusion: VISTA无需特定领域训练，适用于资源受限平台。

Abstract: Global localization is critical for autonomous navigation, particularly in
scenarios where an agent must localize within a map generated in a different
session or by another agent, as agents often have no prior knowledge about the
correlation between reference frames. However, this task remains challenging in
unstructured environments due to appearance changes induced by viewpoint
variation, seasonal changes, spatial aliasing, and occlusions -- known failure
modes for traditional place recognition methods. To address these challenges,
we propose VISTA (View-Invariant Segmentation-Based Tracking for Frame
Alignment), a novel open-set, monocular global localization framework that
combines: 1) a front-end, object-based, segmentation and tracking pipeline,
followed by 2) a submap correspondence search, which exploits geometric
consistencies between environment maps to align vehicle reference frames. VISTA
enables consistent localization across diverse camera viewpoints and seasonal
changes, without requiring any domain-specific training or finetuning. We
evaluate VISTA on seasonal and oblique-angle aerial datasets, achieving up to a
69% improvement in recall over baseline methods. Furthermore, we maintain a
compact object-based map that is only 0.6% the size of the most
memory-conservative baseline, making our approach capable of real-time
implementation on resource-constrained platforms.

Abstract: Outdoor advertisements remain a critical medium for modern marketing, yet
accurately verifying billboard text visibility under real-world conditions is
still challenging. Traditional Optical Character Recognition (OCR) pipelines
excel at cropped text recognition but often struggle with complex outdoor
scenes, varying fonts, and weather-induced visual noise. Recently, multimodal
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as promising alternatives, offering
end-to-end scene understanding with no explicit detection step. This work
systematically benchmarks representative VLMs - including Qwen 2.5 VL 3B,
InternVL3, and SmolVLM2 - against a compact CNN-based OCR baseline
(PaddleOCRv4) across two public datasets (ICDAR 2015 and SVT), augmented with
synthetic weather distortions to simulate realistic degradation. Our results
reveal that while selected VLMs excel at holistic scene reasoning, lightweight
CNN pipelines still achieve competitive accuracy for cropped text at a fraction
of the computational cost-an important consideration for edge deployment. To
foster future research, we release our weather-augmented benchmark and
evaluation code publicly.

Abstract: Establishing reliable correspondences between image pairs is a fundamental
task in computer vision, underpinning applications such as 3D reconstruction
and visual localization. Although recent methods have made progress in pruning
outliers from dense correspondence sets, they often hypothesize consistent
visual domains and overlook the challenges posed by diverse scene structures.
In this paper, we propose CorrMoE, a novel correspondence pruning framework
that enhances robustness under cross-domain and cross-scene variations. To
address domain shift, we introduce a De-stylization Dual Branch, performing
style mixing on both implicit and explicit graph features to mitigate the
adverse influence of domain-specific representations. For scene diversity, we
design a Bi-Fusion Mixture of Experts module that adaptively integrates
multi-perspective features through linear-complexity attention and dynamic
expert routing. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
CorrMoE achieves superior accuracy and generalization compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The code and pre-trained models are available at

Motivation: 现有视频质量评估方法对HDR视频泛化能力不足，需开发更通用的评估框架。

Result: 模型在HDR视频质量评估中达到SOTA性能，并在IEEE ICME 2025挑战赛中获胜。

Conclusion: CompressedVQA-HDR框架有效解决了HDR视频质量评估的挑战。

Abstract: Video compression is a standard procedure applied to all videos to minimize
storage and transmission demands while preserving visual quality as much as
possible. Therefore, evaluating the visual quality of compressed videos is
crucial for guiding the practical usage and further development of video
compression algorithms. Although numerous compressed video quality assessment
(VQA) methods have been proposed, they often lack the generalization capability
needed to handle the increasing diversity of video types, particularly high
dynamic range (HDR) content. In this paper, we introduce CompressedVQA-HDR, an
effective VQA framework designed to address the challenges of HDR video quality
assessment. Specifically, we adopt the Swin Transformer and SigLip 2 as the
backbone networks for the proposed full-reference (FR) and no-reference (NR)
VQA models, respectively. For the FR model, we compute deep structural and
textural similarities between reference and distorted frames using
intermediate-layer features extracted from the Swin Transformer as its
quality-aware feature representation. For the NR model, we extract the global
mean of the final-layer feature maps from SigLip 2 as its quality-aware
representation. To mitigate the issue of limited HDR training data, we
pre-train the FR model on a large-scale standard dynamic range (SDR) VQA
dataset and fine-tune it on the HDRSDR-VQA dataset. For the NR model, we employ
an iterative mixed-dataset training strategy across multiple compressed VQA
datasets, followed by fine-tuning on the HDRSDR-VQA dataset. Experimental
results show that our models achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to
existing FR and NR VQA models. Moreover, CompressedVQA-HDR-FR won first place
in the FR track of the Generalizable HDR & SDR Video Quality Measurement Grand
Challenge at IEEE ICME 2025. The code is available at

Result: 实验表明，该方法在低光条件下优于现有方法，成功重建辐射场。

Conclusion: Dark-EvGS框架有效解决了低光环境下的图像重建问题，并提供了首个真实数据集。

Abstract: In low-light environments, conventional cameras often struggle to capture
clear multi-view images of objects due to dynamic range limitations and motion
blur caused by long exposure. Event cameras, with their high-dynamic range and
high-speed properties, have the potential to mitigate these issues.
Additionally, 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) enables radiance field reconstruction,
facilitating bright frame synthesis from multiple viewpoints in low-light
conditions. However, naively using an event-assisted 3D GS approach still faced
challenges because, in low light, events are noisy, frames lack quality, and
the color tone may be inconsistent. To address these issues, we propose
Dark-EvGS, the first event-assisted 3D GS framework that enables the
reconstruction of bright frames from arbitrary viewpoints along the camera
trajectory. Triplet-level supervision is proposed to gain holistic knowledge,
granular details, and sharp scene rendering. The color tone matching block is
proposed to guarantee the color consistency of the rendered frames.
Furthermore, we introduce the first real-captured dataset for the event-guided
bright frame synthesis task via 3D GS-based radiance field reconstruction.
Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves better results than existing
methods, conquering radiance field reconstruction under challenging low-light
conditions. The code and sample data are included in the supplementary

Abstract: Public remote sensing datasets often face limitations in universality due to
resolution variability and inconsistent land cover category definitions. To
harness the vast pool of unlabeled remote sensing data, we propose SAMST, a
semi-supervised semantic segmentation method. SAMST leverages the strengths of
the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in zero-shot generalization and boundary
detection. SAMST iteratively refines pseudo-labels through two main components:
supervised model self-training using both labeled and pseudo-labeled data, and
a SAM-based Pseudo-label Refiner. The Pseudo-label Refiner comprises three
modules: a Threshold Filter Module for preprocessing, a Prompt Generation
Module for extracting connected regions and generating prompts for SAM, and a
Label Refinement Module for final label stitching. By integrating the
generalization power of large models with the training efficiency of small
models, SAMST improves pseudo-label accuracy, thereby enhancing overall model
performance. Experiments on the Potsdam dataset validate the effectiveness and
feasibility of SAMST, demonstrating its potential to address the challenges
posed by limited labeled data in remote sensing semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: 解耦-耦合策略有效提升了RGB-IR域自适应目标检测性能，光谱和空间特征的处理是关键。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptive object detection (UDAOD) from the visible domain
to the infrared (RGB-IR) domain is challenging. Existing methods regard the RGB
domain as a unified domain and neglect the multiple subdomains within it, such
as daytime, nighttime, and foggy scenes. We argue that decoupling the
domain-invariant (DI) and domain-specific (DS) features across these multiple
subdomains is beneficial for RGB-IR domain adaptation. To this end, this paper
proposes a new SS-DC framework based on a decoupling-coupling strategy. In
terms of decoupling, we design a Spectral Adaptive Idempotent Decoupling (SAID)
module in the aspect of spectral decomposition. Due to the style and content
information being highly embedded in different frequency bands, this module can
decouple DI and DS components more accurately and interpretably. A novel filter
bank-based spectral processing paradigm and a self-distillation-driven
decoupling loss are proposed to improve the spectral domain decoupling. In
terms of coupling, a new spatial-spectral coupling method is proposed, which
realizes joint coupling through spatial and spectral DI feature pyramids.
Meanwhile, this paper introduces DS from decoupling to reduce the domain bias.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the
baseline performance and outperform existing UDAOD methods on multiple RGB-IR
datasets, including a new experimental protocol proposed in this paper based on
the FLIR-ADAS dataset.

Abstract: We propose SGLoc, a novel localization system that directly regresses camera
poses from 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation by leveraging semantic
information. Our method utilizes the semantic relationship between 2D image and
3D scene representation to estimate the 6DoF pose without prior pose
information. In this system, we introduce a multi-level pose regression
strategy that progressively estimates and refines the pose of query image from
the global 3DGS map, without requiring initial pose priors. Moreover, we
introduce a semantic-based global retrieval algorithm that establishes
correspondences between 2D (image) and 3D (3DGS map). By matching the extracted
scene semantic descriptors of 2D query image and 3DGS semantic representation,
we align the image with the local region of the global 3DGS map, thereby
obtaining a coarse pose estimation. Subsequently, we refine the coarse pose by
iteratively optimizing the difference between the query image and the rendered
image from 3DGS. Our SGLoc demonstrates superior performance over baselines on
12scenes and 7scenes datasets, showing excellent capabilities in global
localization without initial pose prior. Code will be available at

reconstructing vehicles from sparse-view inputs, leveraging depth maps and a
robust pose estimation architecture to synthesize novel views and augment
training data. Specifically, we enhance Gaussian Splatting by integrating a
selective photometric loss, applied only to high-confidence pixels, and
replacing standard Structure-from-Motion pipelines with the DUSt3R architecture
to improve camera pose estimation. Furthermore, we present a novel dataset

Conclusion: 该方法高效且实用，为FRS安全性提供了新视角。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on face recognition systems (FRSs) pose serious security
and privacy threats, especially when these systems are used for identity
verification. In this paper, we propose a novel method for generating
adversarial faces-synthetic facial images that are visually distinct yet
recognized as a target identity by the FRS. Unlike iterative optimization-based
approaches (e.g., gradient descent or other iterative solvers), our method
leverages the structural characteristics of the FRS feature space. We figure
out that individuals sharing the same attribute (e.g., gender or race) form an
attributed subsphere. By utilizing such subspheres, our method achieves both
non-adaptiveness and a remarkably small number of queries. This eliminates the
need for relying on transferability and open-source surrogate models, which
have been a typical strategy when repeated adaptive queries to commercial FRSs
are impossible. Despite requiring only a single non-adaptive query consisting
of 100 face images, our method achieves a high success rate of over 93% against
AWS's CompareFaces API at its default threshold. Furthermore, unlike many
existing attacks that perturb a given image, our method can deliberately
produce adversarial faces that impersonate the target identity while exhibiting
high-level attributes chosen by the adversary.

Abstract: Deep learning-based bilateral grid processing has emerged as a promising
solution for image enhancement, inherently encoding spatial and intensity
information while enabling efficient full-resolution processing through slicing
operations. However, existing approaches are limited to linear affine
transformations, hindering their ability to model complex color relationships.
Meanwhile, while multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) excel at non-linear mappings,
traditional MLP-based methods employ globally shared parameters, which is hard
to deal with localized variations. To overcome these dual challenges, we
propose a Bilateral Grid-based Pixel-Adaptive Multi-layer Perceptron (BPAM)
framework. Our approach synergizes the spatial modeling of bilateral grids with
the non-linear capabilities of MLPs. Specifically, we generate bilateral grids
containing MLP parameters, where each pixel dynamically retrieves its unique
transformation parameters and obtain a distinct MLP for color mapping based on
spatial coordinates and intensity values. In addition, we propose a novel grid
decomposition strategy that categorizes MLP parameters into distinct types
stored in separate subgrids. Multi-channel guidance maps are used to extract
category-specific parameters from corresponding subgrids, ensuring effective
utilization of color information during slicing while guiding precise parameter
generation. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in performance while maintaining
real-time processing capabilities.

Abstract: Modeling and rendering dynamic urban driving scenes is crucial for

capture dynamic object motions accurately and decompose scenes properly,
resulting in rendering artifacts. We introduce AD-GS, a novel self-supervised
framework for high-quality free-viewpoint rendering of driving scenes from a
single log. At its core is a novel learnable motion model that integrates
locality-aware B-spline curves with global-aware trigonometric functions,
enabling flexible yet precise dynamic object modeling. Rather than requiring
comprehensive semantic labeling, AD-GS automatically segments scenes into
objects and background with the simplified pseudo 2D segmentation, representing
objects using dynamic Gaussians and bidirectional temporal visibility masks.
Further, our model incorporates visibility reasoning and physically rigid
regularization to enhance robustness. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that
our annotation-free model significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art
annotation-free methods and is competitive with annotation-dependent
approaches.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is widely recognized as the most reliable
tool for detecting tumors due to its capability to produce detailed images that
reveal their presence. However, the accuracy of diagnosis can be compromised
when human specialists evaluate these images. Factors such as fatigue, limited
expertise, and insufficient image detail can lead to errors. For example, small
tumors might go unnoticed, or overlap with healthy brain regions could result
in misidentification. To address these challenges and enhance diagnostic
precision, this study proposes a novel double ensembling framework, consisting
of ensembled pre-trained deep learning (DL) models for feature extraction and
ensembled fine-tuned hyperparameter machine learning (ML) models to efficiently
classify brain tumors. Specifically, our method includes extensive
preprocessing and augmentation, transfer learning concepts by utilizing various
pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks and vision transformer networks
to extract deep features from brain MRI, and fine-tune hyperparameters of ML
classifiers. Our experiments utilized three different publicly available Kaggle
MRI brain tumor datasets to evaluate the pre-trained DL feature extractor
models, ML classifiers, and the effectiveness of an ensemble of deep features
along with an ensemble of ML classifiers for brain tumor classification. Our
results indicate that the proposed feature fusion and classifier fusion improve
upon the state of the art, with hyperparameter fine-tuning providing a
significant enhancement over the ensemble method. Additionally, we present an
ablation study to illustrate how each component contributes to accurate brain
tumor classification.

Abstract: Low-light images suffer from complex degradation, and existing enhancement
methods often encode all degradation factors within a single latent space. This
leads to highly entangled features and strong black-box characteristics, making
the model prone to shortcut learning. To mitigate the above issues, this paper
proposes a wavelet-based low-light stereo image enhancement method with feature
space decoupling. Our insight comes from the following findings: (1) Wavelet
transform enables the independent processing of low-frequency and
high-frequency information. (2) Illumination adjustment can be achieved by
adjusting the low-frequency component of a low-light image, extracted through
multi-level wavelet decomposition. Thus, by using wavelet transform the feature
space is decomposed into a low-frequency branch for illumination adjustment and
multiple high-frequency branches for texture enhancement. Additionally, stereo
low-light image enhancement can extract useful cues from another view to
improve enhancement. To this end, we propose a novel high-frequency guided
cross-view interaction module (HF-CIM) that operates within high-frequency
branches rather than across the entire feature space, effectively extracting
valuable image details from the other view. Furthermore, to enhance the
high-frequency information, a detail and texture enhancement module (DTEM) is
proposed based on cross-attention mechanism. The model is trained on a dataset
consisting of images with uniform illumination and images with non-uniform
illumination. Experimental results on both real and synthetic images indicate
that our algorithm offers significant advantages in light adjustment while
effectively recovering high-frequency information. The code and dataset are

Abstract: Modern digitised approaches have dramatically changed the preservation and
restoration of cultural treasures, integrating computer scientists into
multidisciplinary projects with ease. Machine learning, deep learning, and
computer vision techniques have revolutionised developing sectors like 3D
reconstruction, picture inpainting,IoT-based methods, genetic algorithms, and
image processing with the integration of computer scientists into
multidisciplinary initiatives. We suggest three cutting-edge techniques in
recognition of the special qualities of Indian monuments, which are famous for
their architectural skill and aesthetic appeal. First is the Fractal
Convolution methodology, a segmentation method based on image processing that
successfully reveals subtle architectural patterns within these irreplaceable
cultural buildings. The second is a revolutionary Self-Sensitive Tile Filling
(SSTF) method created especially for West Bengal's mesmerising Bankura
Terracotta Temples with a brand-new data augmentation method called MosaicSlice
on the third. Furthermore, we delve deeper into the Super Resolution strategy
to upscale the images without losing significant amount of quality. Our methods
allow for the development of seamless region-filling and highly detailed tiles
while maintaining authenticity using a novel data augmentation strategy within
affordable costs introducing automation. By providing effective solutions that
preserve the delicate balance between tradition and innovation, this study
improves the subject and eventually ensures unrivalled efficiency and aesthetic
excellence in cultural heritage protection. The suggested approaches advance
the field into an era of unmatched efficiency and aesthetic quality while
carefully upholding the delicate equilibrium between tradition and innovation.

Abstract: This paper introduces KeyDiff3D, a framework for unsupervised monocular 3D
keypoints estimation that accurately predicts 3D keypoints from a single image.
While previous methods rely on manual annotations or calibrated multi-view
images, both of which are expensive to collect, our method enables monocular 3D
keypoints estimation using only a collection of single-view images. To achieve
this, we leverage powerful geometric priors embedded in a pretrained multi-view
diffusion model. In our framework, this model generates multi-view images from
a single image, serving as a supervision signal to provide 3D geometric cues to
our model. We also use the diffusion model as a powerful 2D multi-view feature
extractor and construct 3D feature volumes from its intermediate
representations. This transforms implicit 3D priors learned by the diffusion
model into explicit 3D features. Beyond accurate keypoints estimation, we
further introduce a pipeline that enables manipulation of 3D objects generated
by the diffusion model. Experimental results on diverse aspects and datasets,
including Human3.6M, Stanford Dogs, and several in-the-wild and out-of-domain
datasets, highlight the effectiveness of our method in terms of accuracy,
generalization, and its ability to enable manipulation of 3D objects generated
by the diffusion model from a single image.

Abstract: Weed detection is a critical component of precision agriculture, facilitating
targeted herbicide application and reducing environmental impact. However,
deploying accurate object detection models on resource-limited platforms
remains challenging, particularly when differentiating visually similar weed
species commonly encountered in plant phenotyping applications. In this work,
we investigate Channel-wise Knowledge Distillation (CWD) and Masked Generative
Distillation (MGD) to enhance the performance of lightweight models for
real-time smart spraying systems. Utilizing YOLO11x as the teacher model and
YOLO11n as both reference and student, both CWD and MGD effectively transfer
knowledge from the teacher to the student model. Our experiments, conducted on
a real-world dataset comprising sugar beet crops and four weed types (Cirsium,
Convolvulus, Fallopia, and Echinochloa), consistently show increased AP50
across all classes. The distilled CWD student model achieves a notable
improvement of 2.5% and MGD achieves 1.9% in mAP50 over the baseline without
increasing model complexity. Additionally, we validate real-time deployment
feasibility by evaluating the student YOLO11n model on Jetson Orin Nano and
Raspberry Pi 5 embedded devices, performing five independent runs to evaluate
performance stability across random seeds. These findings confirm CWD and MGD
as an effective, efficient, and practical approach for improving deep
learning-based weed detection accuracy in precision agriculture and plant
phenotyping scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce Cluster Contrast (CueCo), a novel approach to unsupervised
visual representation learning that effectively combines the strengths of
contrastive learning and clustering methods. Inspired by recent advancements,
CueCo is designed to simultaneously scatter and align feature representations
within the feature space. This method utilizes two neural networks, a query and
a key, where the key network is updated through a slow-moving average of the
query outputs. CueCo employs a contrastive loss to push dissimilar features
apart, enhancing inter-class separation, and a clustering objective to pull
together features of the same cluster, promoting intra-class compactness. Our
method achieves 91.40% top-1 classification accuracy on CIFAR-10, 68.56% on
CIFAR-100, and 78.65% on ImageNet-100 using linear evaluation with a ResNet-18

Abstract: Semi-supervised medical image segmentation is a crucial technique for
alleviating the high cost of data annotation. When labeled data is limited,
textual information can provide additional context to enhance visual semantic
understanding. However, research exploring the use of textual data to enhance
visual semantic embeddings in 3D medical imaging tasks remains scarce. In this
paper, we propose a novel text-driven multiplanar visual interaction framework
for semi-supervised medical image segmentation (termed Text-SemiSeg), which
consists of three main modules: Text-enhanced Multiplanar Representation (TMR),
Category-aware Semantic Alignment (CSA), and Dynamic Cognitive Augmentation
(DCA). Specifically, TMR facilitates text-visual interaction through planar
mapping, thereby enhancing the category awareness of visual features. CSA
performs cross-modal semantic alignment between the text features with
introduced learnable variables and the intermediate layer of visual features.
DCA reduces the distribution discrepancy between labeled and unlabeled data
through their interaction, thus improving the model's robustness. Finally,
experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our model effectively
enhances visual features with textual information and outperforms other
methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/taozh2017/Text-SemiSeg.

Abstract: 3D modeling is moving from virtual to physical. Existing 3D generation
primarily emphasizes geometries and textures while neglecting physical-grounded
modeling. Consequently, despite the rapid development of 3D generative models,
the synthesized 3D assets often overlook rich and important physical
properties, hampering their real-world application in physical domains like
simulation and embodied AI. As an initial attempt to address this challenge, we
propose \textbf{PhysX}, an end-to-end paradigm for physical-grounded 3D asset
generation. 1) To bridge the critical gap in physics-annotated 3D datasets, we
present PhysXNet - the first physics-grounded 3D dataset systematically
annotated across five foundational dimensions: absolute scale, material,
affordance, kinematics, and function description. In particular, we devise a
scalable human-in-the-loop annotation pipeline based on vision-language models,
which enables efficient creation of physics-first assets from raw 3D assets.2)
Furthermore, we propose \textbf{PhysXGen}, a feed-forward framework for
physics-grounded image-to-3D asset generation, injecting physical knowledge
into the pre-trained 3D structural space. Specifically, PhysXGen employs a
dual-branch architecture to explicitly model the latent correlations between 3D
structures and physical properties, thereby producing 3D assets with plausible
physical predictions while preserving the native geometry quality. Extensive
experiments validate the superior performance and promising generalization
capability of our framework. All the code, data, and models will be released to
facilitate future research in generative physical AI.

Abstract: Enabling virtual humans to dynamically and realistically respond to diverse
auditory stimuli remains a key challenge in character animation, demanding the
integration of perceptual modeling and motion synthesis. Despite its
significance, this task remains largely unexplored. Most previous works have
primarily focused on mapping modalities like speech, audio, and music to
generate human motion. As of yet, these models typically overlook the impact of
spatial features encoded in spatial audio signals on human motion. To bridge
this gap and enable high-quality modeling of human movements in response to
spatial audio, we introduce the first comprehensive Spatial Audio-Driven Human
Motion (SAM) dataset, which contains diverse and high-quality spatial audio and
motion data. For benchmarking, we develop a simple yet effective
diffusion-based generative framework for human MOtion generation driven by
SPatial Audio, termed MOSPA, which faithfully captures the relationship between
body motion and spatial audio through an effective fusion mechanism. Once
trained, MOSPA could generate diverse realistic human motions conditioned on
varying spatial audio inputs. We perform a thorough investigation of the
proposed dataset and conduct extensive experiments for benchmarking, where our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance on this task. Our model and
dataset will be open-sourced upon acceptance. Please refer to our supplementary

Conclusion: 提出的分层代理节点表示方法在通用性、编辑性和复杂性之间取得了平衡，为3D表示提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Current 3D representations like meshes, voxels, point clouds, and NeRF-based
neural implicit fields exhibit significant limitations: they are often
task-specific, lacking universal applicability across reconstruction,
generation, editing, and driving. While meshes offer high precision, their
dense vertex data complicates editing; NeRFs deliver excellent rendering but
suffer from structural ambiguity, hindering animation and manipulation; all
representations inherently struggle with the trade-off between data complexity
and fidelity. To overcome these issues, we introduce a novel 3D Hierarchical
Proxy Node representation. Its core innovation lies in representing an object's
shape and texture via a sparse set of hierarchically organized
(tree-structured) proxy nodes distributed on its surface and interior. Each
node stores local shape and texture information (implicitly encoded by a small
MLP) within its neighborhood. Querying any 3D coordinate's properties involves
efficient neural interpolation and lightweight decoding from relevant nearby
and parent nodes. This framework yields a highly compact representation where
nodes align with local semantics, enabling direct drag-and-edit manipulation,
and offers scalable quality-complexity control. Extensive experiments across 3D
reconstruction and editing demonstrate our method's expressive efficiency,
high-fidelity rendering quality, and superior editability.

Conclusion: xOp-GAN通过多生成器设计和判别器的推理使用，显著提升了水下图像恢复的性能。

Abstract: The wide range of deformation artifacts that arise from complex light
propagation, scattering, and depth-dependent attenuation makes the underwater
image restoration to remain a challenging problem. Like other single deep
regressor networks, conventional GAN-based restoration methods struggle to
perform well across this heterogeneous domain, since a single generator network
is typically insufficient to capture the full range of visual degradations. In
order to overcome this limitation, we propose xOp-GAN, a novel GAN model with
several expert generator networks, each trained solely on a particular subset
with a certain image quality. Thus, each generator can learn to maximize its
restoration performance for a particular quality range. Once a xOp-GAN is
trained, each generator can restore the input image and the best restored image
can then be selected by the discriminator based on its perceptual confidence
score. As a result, xOP-GAN is the first GAN model with multiple generators
where the discriminator is being used during the inference of the regression
task. Experimental results on benchmark Large Scale Underwater Image (LSUI)
dataset demonstrates that xOp-GAN achieves PSNR levels up to 25.16 dB,
surpassing all single-regressor models by a large margin even, with reduced
complexity.

Abstract: Estimating a person's age from their gait has important applications in
healthcare, security and human-computer interaction. In this work, we review
fifty-nine studies involving over seventy-five thousand subjects recorded with
video, wearable and radar sensors. We observe that convolutional neural
networks produce an average error of about 4.2 years, inertial-sensor models
about 4.5 years and multi-sensor fusion as low as 3.4 years, with notable
differences between lab and real-world data. We then analyse sixty-three
thousand eight hundred forty-six gait cycles from the OU-ISIR Large-Population
dataset to quantify correlations between age and five key metrics: stride
length, walking speed, step cadence, step-time variability and joint-angle
entropy, with correlation coefficients of at least 0.27. Next, we fine-tune a
ResNet34 model and apply Grad-CAM to reveal that the network attends to the
knee and pelvic regions, consistent with known age-related gait changes.
Finally, on a one hundred thousand sample subset of the VersatileGait database,
we compare support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, multilayer
perceptrons and convolutional neural networks, finding that deep networks
achieve up to 96 percent accuracy while processing each sample in under 0.1
seconds. By combining a broad meta-analysis with new large-scale experiments
and interpretable visualizations, we establish solid performance baselines and
practical guidelines for reducing gait-age error below three years in
real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: VAE-MLP模型在直肠癌LNM分期中表现出色，优于传统CNN方法，且代码已开源。

Abstract: Effective treatment for rectal cancer relies on accurate lymph node
metastasis (LNM) staging. However, radiological criteria based on lymph node
(LN) size, shape and texture morphology have limited diagnostic accuracy. In
this work, we investigate applying a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) as a feature
encoder model to replace the large pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) used in existing approaches. The motivation for using a VAE is that the
generative model aims to reconstruct the images, so it directly encodes visual
features and meaningful patterns across the data. This leads to a disentangled
and structured latent space which can be more interpretable than a CNN. Models
are deployed on an in-house MRI dataset with 168 patients who did not undergo
neo-adjuvant treatment. The post-operative pathological N stage was used as the
ground truth to evaluate model predictions. Our proposed model 'VAE-MLP'

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉诊断中人类主体数据敏感性的挑战，利用运动场景积累多样化情绪状态的数据。

Method: 利用板球比赛中的姿势数据，通过运动分析识别击球意图，并使用现有数据统计作为弱监督验证。

Result: 方法在区分攻击性和防御性击球意图上达到75% F1分数和80% AUC-ROC。

Conclusion: 姿势数据为意图推断提供了强信号，且弱监督方法可缓解数据标注限制。

Abstract: Posture-based mental state inference has significant potential in diagnosing
fatigue, preventing injury, and enhancing performance across various domains.
Such tools must be research-validated with large datasets before being
translated into practice. Unfortunately, such vision diagnosis faces serious
challenges due to the sensitivity of human subject data. To address this, we
identify sports settings as a viable alternative for accumulating data from
human subjects experiencing diverse emotional states. We test our hypothesis in
the game of cricket and present a posture-based solution to identify human
intent from activity videos. Our method achieves over 75\% F1 score and over
80\% AUC-ROC in discriminating aggressive and defensive shot intent through
motion analysis. These findings indicate that posture leaks out strong signals
for intent inference, even with inherent noise in the data pipeline.
Furthermore, we utilize existing data statistics as weak supervision to
validate our findings, offering a potential solution for overcoming data
labelling limitations. This research contributes to generalizable techniques
for sports analytics and also opens possibilities for applying human behavior
analysis across various fields.

Abstract: Event-based sensors have emerged as a promising solution for addressing
challenging conditions in pedestrian and traffic monitoring systems. Their
low-latency and high dynamic range allow for improved response time in
safety-critical situations caused by distracted walking or other unusual
movements. However, the availability of data covering such scenarios remains
limited. To address this gap, we present SEPose -- a comprehensive synthetic
event-based human pose estimation dataset for fixed pedestrian perception
generated using dynamic vision sensors in the CARLA simulator. With nearly 350K
annotated pedestrians with body pose keypoints from the perspective of fixed
traffic cameras, SEPose is a comprehensive synthetic multi-person pose
estimation dataset that spans busy and light crowds and traffic across diverse
lighting and weather conditions in 4-way intersections in urban, suburban, and
rural environments. We train existing state-of-the-art models such as RVT and
YOLOv8 on our dataset and evaluate them on real event-based data to demonstrate
the sim-to-real generalization capabilities of the proposed dataset.

Abstract: While 3D facial animation has made impressive progress, challenges still
exist in realizing fine-grained stylized 3D facial expression manipulation due
to the lack of appropriate datasets. In this paper, we introduce the
AUBlendSet, a 3D facial dataset based on AU-Blendshape representation for
fine-grained facial expression manipulation across identities. AUBlendSet is a
blendshape data collection based on 32 standard facial action units (AUs)
across 500 identities, along with an additional set of facial postures
annotated with detailed AUs. Based on AUBlendSet, we propose AUBlendNet to
learn AU-Blendshape basis vectors for different character styles. AUBlendNet
predicts, in parallel, the AU-Blendshape basis vectors of the corresponding
style for a given identity mesh, thereby achieving stylized 3D emotional facial
manipulation. We comprehensively validate the effectiveness of AUBlendSet and
AUBlendNet through tasks such as stylized facial expression manipulation,
speech-driven emotional facial animation, and emotion recognition data
augmentation. Through a series of qualitative and quantitative experiments, we
demonstrate the potential and importance of AUBlendSet and AUBlendNet in 3D
facial animation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, AUBlendSet is the first

expression manipulation for any identity through facial AUs. Our source code is

Abstract: We propose an end-to-end deep neural encoder-decoder model to encode and
decode brain activity in response to naturalistic stimuli using functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Leveraging temporally correlated input
from consecutive film frames, we employ temporal convolutional layers in our
architecture, which effectively allows to bridge the temporal resolution gap
between natural movie stimuli and fMRI acquisitions. Our model predicts
activity of voxels in and around the visual cortex and performs reconstruction
of corresponding visual inputs from neural activity. Finally, we investigate
brain regions contributing to visual decoding through saliency maps. We find
that the most contributing regions are the middle occipital area, the fusiform
area, and the calcarine, respectively employed in shape perception, complex
recognition (in particular face perception), and basic visual features such as
edges and contrasts. These functions being strongly solicited are in line with
the decoder's capability to reconstruct edges, faces, and contrasts. All in
all, this suggests the possibility to probe our understanding of visual
processing in films using as a proxy the behaviour of deep learning models such
as the one proposed in this paper.

Abstract: Air pollutants pose a significant threat to the environment and human health,
thus forecasting accurate pollutant concentrations is essential for pollution
warnings and policy-making. Existing studies predominantly focus on
single-pollutant forecasting, neglecting the interactions among different
pollutants and their diverse spatial responses. To address the practical needs
of forecasting multivariate air pollutants, we propose MultiVariate
AutoRegressive air pollutants forecasting model (MVAR), which reduces the
dependency on long-time-window inputs and boosts the data utilization
efficiency. We also design the Multivariate Autoregressive Training Paradigm,
enabling MVAR to achieve 120-hour long-term sequential forecasting.
Additionally, MVAR develops Meteorological Coupled Spatial Transformer block,
enabling the flexible coupling of AI-based meteorological forecasts while
learning the interactions among pollutants and their diverse spatial responses.
As for the lack of standardized datasets in air pollutants forecasting, we
construct a comprehensive dataset covering 6 major pollutants across 75 cities
in North China from 2018 to 2023, including ERA5 reanalysis data and FuXi-2.0

Abstract: Tracking small, agile multi-objects (SMOT), such as birds, from an Unmanned
Aerial Vehicle (UAV) perspective is a highly challenging computer vision task.
The difficulty stems from three main sources: the extreme scarcity of target
appearance features, the complex motion entanglement caused by the combined
dynamics of the camera and the targets themselves, and the frequent occlusions
and identity ambiguity arising from dense flocking behavior. This paper details
our championship-winning solution in the MVA 2025 "Finding Birds" Small
Multi-Object Tracking Challenge (SMOT4SB), which adopts the
tracking-by-detection paradigm with targeted innovations at both the detection
and association levels. On the detection side, we propose a systematic training
enhancement framework named \textbf{SliceTrain}. This framework, through the
synergy of 'deterministic full-coverage slicing' and 'slice-level stochastic
augmentation, effectively addresses the problem of insufficient learning for
small objects in high-resolution image training. On the tracking side, we
designed a robust tracker that is completely independent of appearance
information. By integrating a \textbf{motion direction maintenance (EMA)}
mechanism and an \textbf{adaptive similarity metric} combining \textbf{bounding
box expansion and distance penalty} into the OC-SORT framework, our tracker can
stably handle irregular motion and maintain target identities. Our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SMOT4SB public test set, reaching
an SO-HOTA score of \textbf{55.205}, which fully validates the effectiveness
and advancement of our framework in solving complex real-world SMOT problems.

Abstract: Heatwaves pose a significant threat to public health, especially as global
warming intensifies. However, current routing systems (e.g., online maps) fail
to incorporate shade information due to the difficulty of estimating shades
directly from noisy satellite imagery and the limited availability of training
data for generative models. In this paper, we address these challenges through
two main contributions. First, we build an extensive dataset covering diverse
longitude-latitude regions, varying levels of building density, and different
urban layouts. Leveraging Blender-based 3D simulations alongside building
outlines, we capture building shadows under various solar zenith angles
throughout the year and at different times of day. These simulated shadows are
aligned with satellite images, providing a rich resource for learning shade
patterns. Second, we propose the DeepShade, a diffusion-based model designed to
learn and synthesize shade variations over time. It emphasizes the nuance of
edge features by jointly considering RGB with the Canny edge layer, and
incorporates contrastive learning to capture the temporal change rules of
shade. Then, by conditioning on textual descriptions of known conditions (e.g.,
time of day, solar angles), our framework provides improved performance in
generating shade images. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by using
our shade predictions to calculate shade ratios for real-world route planning
in Tempe, Arizona. We believe this work will benefit society by providing a
reference for urban planning in extreme heat weather and its potential
practical applications in the environment.

Abstract: We introduce a principled, data-driven approach for modeling a neural prior

challenge of modeling distributions on the manifold of valid 6D rotations by
inverting the Gram-Schmidt process during training, enabling stable learning
while preserving downstream compatibility with rotation-based frameworks. Our
architecture and training pipeline are framework-agnostic and easily
reproducible. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the learned prior through
both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, and we analyze its impact via
ablation studies. This work provides a sound probabilistic foundation for
integrating pose priors into human motion capture and reconstruction pipelines.

Abstract: Calisthenics skill classification is the computer vision task of inferring
the skill performed by an athlete from images, enabling automatic performance
assessment and personalized analytics. Traditional methods for calisthenics
skill recognition are based on pose estimation methods to determine the
position of skeletal data from images, which is later fed to a classification
algorithm to infer the performed skill. Despite the progress in human pose
estimation algorithms, they still involve high computational costs, long
inference times, and complex setups, which limit the applicability of such
approaches in real-time applications or mobile devices. This work proposes a
direct approach to calisthenics skill recognition, which leverages depth
estimation and athlete patch retrieval to avoid the computationally expensive
human pose estimation module. Using Depth Anything V2 for depth estimation and
YOLOv10 for athlete localization, we segment the subject from the background
rather than relying on traditional pose estimation techniques. This strategy
increases efficiency, reduces inference time, and improves classification
accuracy. Our approach significantly outperforms skeleton-based methods,
achieving 38.3x faster inference with RGB image patches and improved
classification accuracy with depth patches (0.837 vs. 0.815). Beyond these
performance gains, the modular design of our pipeline allows for flexible

Abstract: This paper presents the objective, dataset, baseline, and metrics of Task 3
of the DCASE2025 Challenge on sound event localization and detection (SELD). In
previous editions, the challenge used four-channel audio formats of first-order
Ambisonics (FOA) and microphone array. In contrast, this year's challenge
investigates SELD with stereo audio data (termed stereo SELD). This change
shifts the focus from more specialized 360{\deg} audio and audiovisual scene
analysis to more commonplace audio and media scenarios with limited
field-of-view (FOV). Due to inherent angular ambiguities in stereo audio data,
the task focuses on direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation in the azimuth plane
(left-right axis) along with distance estimation. The challenge remains divided
into two tracks: audio-only and audiovisual, with the audiovisual track
introducing a new sub-task of onscreen/offscreen event classification
necessitated by the limited FOV. This challenge introduces the DCASE2025 Task3
Stereo SELD Dataset, whose stereo audio and perspective video clips are sampled
and converted from the STARSS23 recordings. The baseline system is designed to
process stereo audio and corresponding video frames as inputs. In addition to
the typical SELD event classification and localization, it integrates
onscreen/offscreen classification for the audiovisual track. The evaluation
metrics have been modified to introduce an onscreen/offscreen accuracy metric,
which assesses the models' ability to identify which sound sources are
onscreen. In the experimental evaluation, the baseline system performs
reasonably well with the stereo audio data.

Abstract: Humans possess a remarkable capacity for spatial cognition, allowing for
self-localization even in novel or unfamiliar environments. While hippocampal
neurons encoding position and orientation are well documented, the large-scale
neural dynamics supporting spatial representation, particularly during
naturalistic, passive experience, remain poorly understood. Here, we
demonstrate for the first time that non-invasive brain-computer interfaces
(BCIs) based on electroencephalography (EEG) can decode spontaneous,
fine-grained egocentric 6D pose, comprising three-dimensional position and
orientation, during passive viewing of egocentric video. Despite EEG's limited
spatial resolution and high signal noise, we find that spatially coherent
visual input (i.e., continuous and structured motion) reliably evokes decodable
spatial representations, aligning with participants' subjective sense of
spatial engagement. Decoding performance further improves when visual input is
presented at a frame rate of 100 ms per image, suggesting alignment with
intrinsic neural temporal dynamics. Using gradient-based backpropagation
through a neural decoding model, we identify distinct EEG channels contributing
to position -- and orientation specific -- components, revealing a distributed
yet complementary neural encoding scheme. These findings indicate that the
brain's spatial systems operate spontaneously and continuously, even under
passive conditions, challenging traditional distinctions between active and
passive spatial cognition. Our results offer a non-invasive window into the
automatic construction of egocentric spatial maps and advance our understanding
of how the human mind transforms everyday sensory experience into structured
internal representations.

to enhance monitoring activities for these animals, utilising images captured
by camera traps. This project explores different CV approaches to create a
re-ID model able to identify individual feral cats in the wild. The main
approach consists of modifying a part-pose guided network (PPGNet) model,
initially used in the re-ID of Amur tigers, to be applicable for feral cats.
This adaptation, resulting in PPGNet-Cat, which incorporates specific
modifications to suit the characteristics of feral cats images. Additionally,
various experiments were conducted, particularly exploring contrastive learning
approaches such as ArcFace loss. The main results indicate that PPGNet-Cat
excels in identifying feral cats, achieving high performance with a mean
Average Precision (mAP) of 0.86 and a rank-1 accuracy of 0.95. These outcomes
establish PPGNet-Cat as a competitive model within the realm of re-ID.

Abstract: Cortical lesions (CLs) have emerged as valuable biomarkers in multiple
sclerosis (MS), offering high diagnostic specificity and prognostic relevance.
However, their routine clinical integration remains limited due to subtle
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) appearance, challenges in expert annotation,
and a lack of standardized automated methods. We propose a comprehensive
multi-centric benchmark of CL detection and segmentation in MRI. A total of 656
MRI scans, including clinical trial and research data from four institutions,
were acquired at 3T and 7T using MP2RAGE and MPRAGE sequences with
expert-consensus annotations. We rely on the self-configuring nnU-Net
framework, designed for medical imaging segmentation, and propose adaptations
tailored to the improved CL detection. We evaluated model generalization
through out-of-distribution testing, demonstrating strong lesion detection
capabilities with an F1-score of 0.64 and 0.5 in and out of the domain,
respectively. We also analyze internal model features and model errors for a
better understanding of AI decision-making. Our study examines how data
variability, lesion ambiguity, and protocol differences impact model
performance, offering future recommendations to address these barriers to
clinical adoption. To reinforce the reproducibility, the implementation and

Conclusion: 该研究为健身领域的自动化工具开发提供了初步基础。

Abstract: Calisthenics is a fast-growing bodyweight discipline that consists of
different categories, one of which is focused on skills. Skills in calisthenics
encompass both static and dynamic elements performed by athletes. The
evaluation of static skills is based on their difficulty level and the duration
of the hold. Automated tools able to recognize isometric skills from a video by
segmenting them to estimate their duration would be desirable to assist
athletes in their training and judges during competitions. Although the video
understanding literature on action recognition through body pose analysis is
rich, no previous work has specifically addressed the problem of calisthenics
skill temporal video segmentation. This study aims to provide an initial step
towards the implementation of automated tools within the field of Calisthenics.
To advance knowledge in this context, we propose a dataset of video footage of
static calisthenics skills performed by athletes. Each video is annotated with
a temporal segmentation which determines the extent of each skill. We hence
report the results of a baseline approach to address the problem of skill
temporal segmentation on the proposed dataset. The results highlight the
feasibility of the proposed problem, while there is still room for improvement.

Motivation: BPD是一种常见的早产儿慢性肺病，早期预测可以避免不必要的治疗风险。现有的常规方法预测效果有限，因此需要更准确的工具。

Method: 使用ResNet-50模型，基于成人胸部X光片进行领域特定预训练，采用渐进式冻结、CutMix数据增强和线性探测技术。

Result: 模型在预测中重度BPD时AUROC为0.78，显著优于通用预训练方法（p=0.031）。

Conclusion: 领域特定预训练结合渐进式冻结和线性探测技术，能够高效且准确地预测BPD预后。

Abstract: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease affecting 35% of
extremely low birth weight infants. Defined by oxygen dependence at 36 weeks
postmenstrual age, it causes lifelong respiratory complications. However,
preventive interventions carry severe risks, including neurodevelopmental
impairment, ventilator-induced lung injury, and systemic complications.
Therefore, early BPD prognosis and prediction of BPD outcome is crucial to
avoid unnecessary toxicity in low risk infants. Admission radiographs of
extremely preterm infants are routinely acquired within 24h of life and could
serve as a non-invasive prognostic tool. In this work, we developed and
investigated a deep learning approach using chest X-rays from 163 extremely
low-birth-weight infants ($\leq$32 weeks gestation, 401-999g) obtained within
24 hours of birth. We fine-tuned a ResNet-50 pretrained specifically on adult
chest radiographs, employing progressive layer freezing with discriminative
learning rates to prevent overfitting and evaluated a CutMix augmentation and
linear probing. For moderate/severe BPD outcome prediction, our best performing
model with progressive freezing, linear probing and CutMix achieved an AUROC of
0.78 $\pm$ 0.10, balanced accuracy of 0.69 $\pm$ 0.10, and an F1-score of 0.67
$\pm$ 0.11. In-domain pre-training significantly outperformed ImageNet
initialization (p = 0.031) which confirms domain-specific pretraining to be
important for BPD outcome prediction. Routine IRDS grades showed limited
prognostic value (AUROC 0.57 $\pm$ 0.11), confirming the need of learned
markers. Our approach demonstrates that domain-specific pretraining enables
accurate BPD prediction from routine day-1 radiographs. Through progressive
freezing and linear probing, the method remains computationally feasible for
site-level implementation and future federated learning deployments.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of micromobility solutions, particularly two-wheeled
vehicles like e-scooters and e-bikes, has created an urgent need for reliable
autonomous riding (AR) technologies. While autonomous driving (AD) systems have
matured significantly, AR presents unique challenges due to the inherent
instability of two-wheeled platforms, limited size, limited power, and
unpredictable environments, which pose very serious concerns about road users'
safety. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of AR systems by
systematically examining their core components, perception, planning, and
control, through the lens of AD technologies. We identify critical gaps in
current AR research, including a lack of comprehensive perception systems for
various AR tasks, limited industry and government support for such
developments, and insufficient attention from the research community. The
review analyses the gaps of AR from the perspective of AD to highlight
promising research directions, such as multimodal sensor techniques for
lightweight platforms and edge deep learning architectures. By synthesising
insights from AD research with the specific requirements of AR, this review
aims to accelerate the development of safe, efficient, and scalable autonomous

Result: SPIM提高了I通道的清晰度0.3%，减少了Q通道清晰度25%，并校正了0.30的旋转和偏斜偏差。

Conclusion: SPIM展示了空间分析与物理模型结合在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: The development of advanced packaging is essential in the semiconductor
manufacturing industry. However, non-destructive testing (NDT) of advanced
packaging becomes increasingly challenging due to the depth and complexity of
the layers involved. In such a scenario, Magnetic field imaging (MFI) enables
the imaging of magnetic fields generated by currents. For MFI to be effective
in NDT, the magnetic fields must be converted into current density. This
conversion has typically relied solely on a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for
magnetic field inversion; however, the existing approach does not consider eddy
current effects or image misalignment in the test setup. In this paper, we
present a spatial-physics informed model (SPIM) designed for a 3D spiral sample
scanned using Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (SQUID) microscopy.
The SPIM encompasses three key components: i) magnetic image enhancement by
aligning all the "sharp" wire field signals to mitigate the eddy current effect
using both in-phase (I-channel) and quadrature-phase (Q-channel) images; (ii)
magnetic image alignment that addresses skew effects caused by any misalignment
of the scanning SQUID microscope relative to the wire segments; and (iii) an
inversion method for converting magnetic fields to magnetic currents by
integrating the Biot-Savart Law with FFT. The results show that the SPIM
improves I-channel sharpness by 0.3% and reduces Q-channel sharpness by 25%.
Also, we were able to remove rotational and skew misalignments of 0.30 in a
real image. Overall, SPIM highlights the potential of combining spatial
analysis with physics-driven models in practical applications.

Motivation: 在缺乏明确成功标准的领域（如计算机使用），如何将人类直觉转化为可扩展的规则是一个挑战。MLLMs因其世界知识和对齐人类偏好的能力成为潜在解决方案，但存在协议偏差问题。

Conclusion: SGV有效解决了MLLMs作为验证器时的协议偏差问题，显著提升了其性能，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Verifiers -- functions assigning rewards to agent behavior -- have been key
for AI progress in domains like math and board games. However, extending these
gains to domains without clear-cut success criteria (e.g.,computer use) remains
a challenge: while humans can recognize suitable outcomes, translating this
intuition into scalable rules is non-trivial. Multimodal Large Language
Models(MLLMs) emerge as a promising solution, given their world knowledge,
human-preference alignment, and reasoning skills. We evaluate MLLMs as
verifiers of agent trajectories across web navigation, computer use, and
robotic manipulation, and identify a critical limitation: agreement bias, a
strong tendency for MLLMs to favor information in their context window, often
generating chains of thought to rationalize flawed behavior. This bias is
pervasive across models, resilient to test-time scaling, and can impact several
methods using MLLMs as evaluators (e.g.,data filtering). Notably, it occurs
despite MLLMs showing strong, human-aligned priors on desired behavior. To
address this, we propose Self-Grounded Verification (SGV), a lightweight method
that enables more effective use of MLLMs' knowledge and reasoning by harnessing
their own sampling mechanisms via unconditional and conditional generation. SGV
operates in two steps: first, the MLLM is elicited to retrieve broad priors
about task completion, independent of the data under evaluation. Then,
conditioned on self-generated priors, it reasons over and evaluates a candidate
trajectory. Enhanced with SGV, MLLM verifiers show gains of up to 20 points in
accuracy and failure detection rates, and can perform real-time supervision of
heterogeneous agents, boosting task completion of a GUI specialist in OSWorld,
a diffusion policy in robomimic, and a ReAct agent in VisualWebArena -- setting
a new state of the art on the benchmark, surpassing the previous best by 48%.

Abstract: The exploration-exploitation trade-off constitutes one of the fundamental
challenges in reinforcement learning (RL), which is exacerbated in multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) due to the exponential growth of joint
state-action spaces. This paper proposes a topology-enhanced MARL (TPE-MARL)
method for optimizing cooperative decision-making of connected and autonomous
vehicles (CAVs) in mixed traffic. This work presents two primary contributions:
First, we construct a game topology tensor for dynamic traffic flow,
effectively compressing high-dimensional traffic state information and decrease
the search space for MARL algorithms. Second, building upon the designed game
topology tensor and using QMIX as the backbone RL algorithm, we establish a
topology-enhanced MARL framework incorporating visit counts and agent mutual
information. Extensive simulations across varying traffic densities and CAV
penetration rates demonstrate the effectiveness of TPE-MARL. Evaluations
encompassing training dynamics, exploration patterns, macroscopic traffic
performance metrics, and microscopic vehicle behaviors reveal that TPE-MARL
successfully balances exploration and exploitation. Consequently, it exhibits
superior performance in terms of traffic efficiency, safety, decision
smoothness, and task completion. Furthermore, the algorithm demonstrates
decision-making rationality comparable to or exceeding that of human drivers in
both mixed-autonomy and fully autonomous traffic scenarios. Code of our work is

Abstract: Game playing has long served as a fundamental benchmark for evaluating
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). While Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated impressive capabilities in general reasoning, their effectiveness
in spatial strategic reasoning, which is critical for complex and fully
observable board games, remains insufficiently explored. In this work, we adopt
Chinese Chess (Xiangqi) as a challenging and rich testbed due to its intricate
rules and spatial complexity. To advance LLMs' strategic competence in such
environments, we propose a training framework tailored to Xiangqi, built upon a
large-scale dataset of five million board-move pairs enhanced with expert
annotations and engine evaluations. Building on this foundation, we introduce
Xiangqi-R1, a 7B-parameter model trained in multi-stage manner: (1) fine-tuning
for legal move prediction to capture basic spatial rules, (2) incorporating
strategic annotations to improve decision-making, and (3) applying
reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with
multi-dimensional reward signals to enhance reasoning stability. Our
Experimental results indicate that, despite their size and power,
general-purpose LLMs struggle to achieve satisfactory performance in these
tasks. Compared to general-purpose LLMs, Xiangqi-R1 greatly advances with an

Abstract: AI systems are rapidly advancing in capability, and frontier model developers
broadly acknowledge the need for safeguards against serious misuse. However,
this paper demonstrates that fine-tuning, whether via open weights or closed
fine-tuning APIs, can produce helpful-only models. In contrast to prior work
which is blocked by modern moderation systems or achieved only partial removal
of safeguards or degraded output quality, our jailbreak-tuning method teaches
models to generate detailed, high-quality responses to arbitrary harmful
requests. For example, OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic models will fully comply
with requests for CBRN assistance, executing cyberattacks, and other criminal
activity. We further show that backdoors can increase not only the stealth but
also the severity of attacks, while stronger jailbreak prompts become even more
effective in fine-tuning attacks, linking attack and potentially defenses in
the input and weight spaces. Not only are these models vulnerable, more recent
ones also appear to be becoming even more vulnerable to these attacks,
underscoring the urgent need for tamper-resistant safeguards. Until such
safeguards are discovered, companies and policymakers should view the release

Abstract: Scientific innovation is undergoing a paradigm shift driven by the rapid
advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs). As science faces mounting
challenges including information overload, disciplinary silos, and diminishing
returns on conventional research methods, LLMs are emerging as powerful agents
capable not only of enhancing scientific workflows but also of participating in
and potentially leading the innovation process. Existing surveys mainly focus
on different perspectives, phrases, and tasks in scientific research and
discovery, while they have limitations in understanding the transformative
potential and role differentiation of LLM. This survey proposes a comprehensive
framework to categorize the evolving roles of LLMs in scientific innovation
across three hierarchical levels: Evaluator, Collaborator, and Scientist. We
distinguish between LLMs' contributions to structured scientific research
processes and open-ended scientific discovery, thereby offering a unified
taxonomy that clarifies capability boundaries, evaluation criteria, and
human-AI interaction patterns at each level. Through an extensive analysis of
current methodologies, benchmarks, systems, and evaluation metrics, this survey
delivers an in-depth and systematic synthesis on LLM-driven scientific
innovation. We present LLMs not only as tools for automating existing
processes, but also as catalysts capable of reshaping the epistemological
foundations of science itself. This survey offers conceptual clarity, practical
guidance, and theoretical foundations for future research, while also

Abstract: Many current state-of-the-art models for sequential recommendations are based
on transformer architectures. Interpretation and explanation of such black box
models is an important research question, as a better understanding of their
internals can help understand, influence, and control their behavior, which is
very important in a variety of real-world applications. Recently sparse
autoencoders (SAE) have been shown to be a promising unsupervised approach for
extracting interpretable features from language models. These autoencoders
learn to reconstruct hidden states of the transformer's internal layers from
sparse linear combinations of directions in their activation space.
  This paper is focused on the application of SAE to the sequential
recommendation domain. We show that this approach can be successfully applied
to the transformer trained on a sequential recommendation task: learned
directions turn out to be more interpretable and monosemantic than the original
hidden state dimensions. Moreover, we demonstrate that the features learned by
SAE can be used to effectively and flexibly control the model's behavior,
providing end-users with a straightforward method to adjust their
recommendations to different custom scenarios and contexts.

hybrids, which promise near-linear scaling. While most current research focuses
on the accuracy and theoretical throughput of these models, a systematic
performance characterization on practical consumer hardware is critically
needed to guide system-level optimization and unlock new applications.
  To address this gap, we present a comprehensive, comparative benchmarking of
carefully selected Transformer, SSM, and hybrid models specifically for
long-context inference on consumer and embedded GPUs. Our analysis reveals that
SSMs are not only viable but superior for this domain, capable of processing
sequences up to 220K tokens on a 24GB consumer GPU-approximately 4x longer than
comparable Transformers. While Transformers may be up to 1.8x faster at short
sequences, SSMs demonstrate a dramatic performance inversion, becoming up to 4x
faster at very long contexts (~57K tokens). Our operator-level analysis reveals
that custom, hardware-aware SSM kernels dominate the inference runtime,
accounting for over 55% of latency on edge platforms, identifying them as a
primary target for future hardware acceleration. We also provide detailed,
device-specific characterization results to guide system co-design for the
edge. To foster further research, we will open-source our characterization
framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多智能体系统在动态环境中的适应性和鲁棒性受限，Aime旨在通过动态规划和执行解决这些问题。

Method: Aime采用动态规划器、动态Actor实例化和集中式进度管理模块，实现实时策略调整和任务执行。

Result: Aime在多个基准测试中表现优于现有最先进的专用智能体，展示了更高的适应性和任务成功率。

Conclusion: Aime为多智能体协作提供了更灵活和高效的基础框架。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) are
emerging as a powerful paradigm for solving complex, multifaceted problems.
However, the potential of these systems is often constrained by the prevalent
plan-and-execute framework, which suffers from critical limitations: rigid plan
execution, static agent capabilities, and inefficient communication. These
weaknesses hinder their adaptability and robustness in dynamic environments.
This paper introduces Aime, a novel multi-agent framework designed to overcome
these challenges through dynamic, reactive planning and execution. Aime
replaces the conventional static workflow with a fluid and adaptive
architecture. Its core innovations include: (1) a Dynamic Planner that
continuously refines the overall strategy based on real-time execution
feedback; (2) an Actor Factory that implements Dynamic Actor instantiation,
assembling specialized agents on-demand with tailored tools and knowledge; and
(3) a centralized Progress Management Module that serves as a single source of
truth for coherent, system-wide state awareness. We empirically evaluated Aime
on a diverse suite of benchmarks spanning general reasoning (GAIA), software
engineering (SWE-bench Verified), and live web navigation (WebVoyager). The
results demonstrate that Aime consistently outperforms even highly specialized
state-of-the-art agents in their respective domains. Its superior adaptability
and task success rate establish Aime as a more resilient and effective
foundation for multi-agent collaboration.

Abstract: We introduce a modular harness design for LLM agents that composes of

backbone to tackle a wide spectrum of multi turn gaming environments without
domain-specific engineering. Using classic and modern game suites as
low-barrier, high-diversity testbeds, our framework provides a unified workflow
for analyzing how each module affects performance across dynamic interactive
settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the harness lifts gameplay
performance consistently over un-harnessed baselines and reveals distinct
contribution patterns, for example, memory dominates in long-horizon puzzles
while perception is critical in vision noisy arcades. These findings highlight
the effectiveness of our modular harness design in advancing general-purpose

Motivation: 动态规划问题建模通常需要专家知识，LLMs有潜力自动化这一过程，但面临数据稀缺和随机性挑战。

Method: 引入DP-Bench基准和7B参数的DPLM模型，采用DualReflect合成数据生成方法（结合前向和后向生成）。

Result: DPLM在性能上媲美主流LLMs，并在难题上超越它们；DualReflect在数据稀缺和多样性间取得平衡。

Conclusion: 结合前向和后向生成的数据方法在动态规划问题中效果显著，为LLMs在优化领域的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Dynamic programming (DP) is a fundamental method in operations research, but
formulating DP models has traditionally required expert knowledge of both the
problem context and DP techniques. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the
potential to automate this process. However, DP problems pose unique challenges
due to their inherently stochastic transitions and the limited availability of
training data. These factors make it difficult to directly apply existing
LLM-based models or frameworks developed for other optimization problems, such
as linear or integer programming. We introduce DP-Bench, the first benchmark
covering a wide range of textbook-level DP problems to enable systematic
evaluation. We present Dynamic Programming Language Model (DPLM), a
7B-parameter specialized model that achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art LLMs like OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, and surpasses them on
hard problems. Central to DPLM's effectiveness is DualReflect, our novel
synthetic data generation pipeline, designed to scale up training data from a
limited set of initial examples. DualReflect combines forward generation for
diversity and backward generation for reliability. Our results reveal a key
insight: backward generation is favored in low-data regimes for its strong
correctness guarantees, while forward generation, though lacking such
guarantees, becomes increasingly valuable at scale for introducing diverse
formulations. This trade-off highlights the complementary strengths of both
approaches and the importance of combining them.

Conclusion: 建议采用双重验证框架，同时审计偏见和评估能力。

Abstract: The increasing use of generative AI for resume screening is predicated on the
assumption that it offers an unbiased alternative to biased human
decision-making. However, this belief fails to address a critical question: are
these AI systems fundamentally competent at the evaluative tasks they are meant
to perform? This study investigates the question of competence through a
two-part audit of eight major AI platforms. Experiment 1 confirmed complex,
contextual racial and gender biases, with some models penalizing candidates
merely for the presence of demographic signals. Experiment 2, which evaluated
core competence, provided a critical insight: some models that appeared
unbiased were, in fact, incapable of performing a substantive evaluation,
relying instead on superficial keyword matching. This paper introduces the
"Illusion of Neutrality" to describe this phenomenon, where an apparent lack of
bias is merely a symptom of a model's inability to make meaningful judgments.
This study recommends that organizations and regulators adopt a dual-validation
framework, auditing AI hiring tools for both demographic bias and demonstrable
competence to ensure they are both equitable and effective.

Method: 通过迭代提示LLM提取13个与“丑陋”相关的形容词，生成624张图像，并进行人口和社会经济属性编码与主题分析。

Result: AI模型将“丑陋”与老年白人男性形象过度关联，反映了社会偏见和避免边缘群体刻板印象的悖论性偏见。

Conclusion: 生成式AI仍延续偏见，需推动伦理训练范式和包容性开发方法。

Abstract: Generative AI does not only replicate human creativity but also reproduces
deep-seated cultural biases, making it crucial to critically examine how
concepts like ugliness are understood and expressed by these tools. This study
investigates how four different generative AI models understand and express
ugliness through text and image and explores the biases embedded within these
representations. We extracted 13 adjectives associated with ugliness through
iterative prompting of a large language model and generated 624 images across
four AI models and three prompts. Demographic and socioeconomic attributes
within the images were independently coded and thematically analyzed. Our
findings show that AI models disproportionately associate ugliness with old
white male figures, reflecting entrenched social biases as well as paradoxical
biases, where efforts to avoid stereotypical depictions of marginalized groups
inadvertently result in the disproportionate projection of negative attributes
onto majority groups. Qualitative analysis further reveals that, despite
supposed attempts to frame ugliness within social contexts, conventional
physical markers such as asymmetry and aging persist as central visual motifs.
These findings demonstrate that despite attempts to create more equal
representations, generative AI continues to perpetuate inherited and
paradoxical biases, underscoring the critical work being done to create ethical
AI training paradigms and advance methodologies for more inclusive AI
development.

Result: 在小型合成工作负载上，Clarify成功解决了模糊性问题，合成了正确的路由策略。

Conclusion: 消歧方法不仅适用于网络配置，也适用于其他需要明确意图的LLM合成任务。

Abstract: Beyond hallucinations, another problem in program synthesis using LLMs is
ambiguity in user intent. We illustrate the ambiguity problem in a networking
context for LLM-based incremental configuration synthesis of route-maps and
ACLs. These structures frequently overlap in header space, making the relative
priority of actions impossible for the LLM to infer without user interaction.
Measurements in a large cloud identify complex ACLs with 100's of overlaps,
showing ambiguity is a real problem. We propose a prototype system, Clarify,
which uses an LLM augmented with a new module called a Disambiguator that helps
elicit user intent. On a small synthetic workload, Clarify incrementally
synthesizes routing policies after disambiguation and then verifies them. Our
treatment of ambiguities is useful more generally when the intent of updates
can be correctly synthesized by LLMs, but their integration is ambiguous and
can lead to different global behaviors.

Abstract: AI is transforming research. It is being leveraged to construct surveys,

(TBJ) which we use to evaluate AI, machine learning and computational models
for effective and ethical use (Taber and Timpone 1997; Timpone and Yang 2024),
we consider the potential and limitation of analytic, generative, and agentic
AI to augment data scientists or take on tasks traditionally done by human
analysts and researchers. While AI can be leveraged to assist analysts in their
tasks, we raise some warnings about push-button automation. Just as earlier
eras of survey analysis created some issues when the increased ease of using
statistical software allowed researchers to conduct analyses they did not fully
understand, the new AI tools may create similar but larger risks. We emphasize
a human-machine collaboration perspective (Daugherty and Wilson 2018)
throughout the data science workflow and particularly call out the vital role
that data scientists play under VUCA decision areas. We conclude by encouraging
the advance of AI tools to complement data scientists but advocate for

benchmarks provide valuable insights, they typically lack execution-based
evaluation for generating code compliant with specific library versions. To
address this, we introduce GitChameleon, a novel, meticulously curated dataset

Abstract: Bio-inspired design is often used in autonomous UAV navigation due to the
capacity of biological systems for flight and obstacle avoidance despite
limited sensory and computational capabilities. In particular, honeybees mainly
use the sensory input of optic flow, the apparent motion of objects in their
visual field, to navigate cluttered environments. In our work, we train a
Reinforcement Learning agent to navigate a tunnel with obstacles using only
optic flow as sensory input. We inspect the attention patterns of trained
agents to determine the regions of optic flow on which they primarily base
their motor decisions. We find that agents trained in this way pay most
attention to regions of discontinuity in optic flow, as well as regions with
large optic flow magnitude. The trained agents appear to navigate a cluttered
tunnel by avoiding the obstacles that produce large optic flow, while
maintaining a centered position in their environment, which resembles the
behavior seen in flying insects. This pattern persists across independently
trained agents, which suggests that this could be a good strategy for
developing a simple explicit control law for physical UAVs.

the sampling sparsity of online planning. Empirical evaluations on two

educators. Our findings suggest that the successful integration of AI requires
a balanced approach, considering ethical, pedagogical, and technical factors.
Future research may explore enhancing AI accuracy, preserving academic

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合YOLO和SAM的混合模型，用于医学影像中骨科骨盆标志物的精确分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像中的解剖标志物检测对诊断至关重要，但现有通用分割模型（如SAM）无法直接支持此类任务，需要特定提示。

Method: 利用YOLO生成边界框作为SAM的输入提示，结合两者的优势，构建一个可靠的分割流程。

Result: 该混合模型在检测骨科骨盆标志物和复杂轮廓（如股骨皮质骨和骨盆入口）方面表现优异。

Conclusion: YOLO和SAM的结合为医学影像中的精细分割任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Radiographic images are a cornerstone of medical diagnostics in orthopaedics,
with anatomical landmark detection serving as a crucial intermediate step for
information extraction. General-purpose foundational segmentation models, such
as SAM (Segment Anything Model), do not support landmark segmentation out of
the box and require prompts to function. However, in medical imaging, the
prompts for landmarks are highly specific. Since SAM has not been trained to
recognize such landmarks, it cannot generate accurate landmark segmentations
for diagnostic purposes. Even MedSAM, a medically adapted variant of SAM, has
been trained to identify larger anatomical structures, such as organs and their
parts, and lacks the fine-grained precision required for orthopaedic pelvic
landmarks. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging another
general-purpose, non-foundational model: YOLO. YOLO excels in object detection
and can provide bounding boxes that serve as input prompts for SAM. While YOLO
is efficient at detection, it is significantly outperformed by SAM in
segmenting complex structures. In combination, these two models form a reliable
pipeline capable of segmenting not only a small pilot set of eight anatomical
landmarks but also an expanded set of 72 landmarks and 16 regions with complex
outlines, such as the femoral cortical bone and the pelvic inlet. By using
YOLO-generated bounding boxes to guide SAM, we trained the hybrid model to
accurately segment orthopaedic pelvic radiographs. Our results show that the
proposed combination of YOLO and SAM yields excellent performance in detecting
anatomical landmarks and intricate outlines in orthopaedic pelvic radiographs.

Abstract: Foundation models, pre-trained on large image datasets and capable of
capturing rich feature representations, have recently shown potential for
zero-shot image registration. However, their performance has mostly been tested
in the context of rigid or less complex structures, such as the brain or
abdominal organs, and it remains unclear whether these models can handle more
challenging, deformable anatomy. Breast MRI registration is particularly
difficult due to significant anatomical variation between patients, deformation
caused by patient positioning, and the presence of thin and complex internal
structure of fibroglandular tissue, where accurate alignment is crucial.
Whether foundation model-based registration algorithms can address this level
of complexity remains an open question. In this study, we provide a
comprehensive evaluation of foundation model-based registration algorithms for
breast MRI. We assess five pre-trained encoders, including DINO-v2, SAM,
MedSAM, SSLSAM, and MedCLIP, across four key breast registration tasks that
capture variations in different years and dates, sequences, modalities, and
patient disease status (lesion versus no lesion). Our results show that
foundation model-based algorithms such as SAM outperform traditional
registration baselines for overall breast alignment, especially under large
domain shifts, but struggle with capturing fine details of fibroglandular
tissue. Interestingly, additional pre-training or fine-tuning on medical or
breast-specific images in MedSAM and SSLSAM, does not improve registration
performance and may even decrease it in some cases. Further work is needed to
understand how domain-specific training influences registration and to explore
targeted strategies that improve both global alignment and fine structure
accuracy. We also publicly release our code at

Method: JSQA首先生成可感知差异（JND）音频对，预训练编码器；再微调用于MOS预测。

Result: 实验表明，感知引导的预训练显著提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: 将感知因素融入预训练对SQA性能提升至关重要。

Abstract: Speech quality assessment (SQA) is often used to learn a mapping from a
high-dimensional input space to a scalar that represents the mean opinion score
(MOS) of the perceptual speech quality. Learning such a mapping is challenging
for many reasons, but largely because MOS exhibits high levels of inherent
variance due to perceptual and experimental-design differences. Many solutions
have been proposed, but many approaches do not properly incorporate perceptual
factors into their learning algorithms (beyond the MOS label), which could lead
to unsatisfactory results. To this end, we propose JSQA, a two-stage framework
that pretrains an audio encoder using perceptually-guided contrastive learning
on just noticeable difference (JND) pairs, followed by fine-tuning for MOS
prediction. We first generate pairs of audio data within JND levels, which are
then used to pretrain an encoder to leverage perceptual quality similarity
information and map it into an embedding space. The JND pairs come from clean
LibriSpeech utterances that are mixed with background noise from CHiME-3, at
different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). The encoder is later fine-tuned with
audio samples from the NISQA dataset for MOS prediction. Experimental results
suggest that perceptually-inspired contrastive pretraining significantly
improves the model performance evaluated by various metrics when compared
against the same network trained from scratch without pretraining. These
findings suggest that incorporating perceptual factors into pretraining greatly
contributes to the improvement in performance for SQA.

Abstract: Patterns of electrical brain activity recorded via electroencephalography
(EEG) offer immense value for scientific and clinical investigations. The
inability of supervised EEG encoders to learn robust EEG patterns and their
over-reliance on expensive signal annotations have sparked a transition towards
general-purpose self-supervised EEG encoders, i.e., EEG foundation models
(EEG-FMs), for robust and scalable EEG feature extraction. However, the
real-world readiness of early EEG-FMs and the rubric for long-term research
progress remain unclear. A systematic and comprehensive review of
first-generation EEG-FMs is therefore necessary to understand the current
state-of-the-art and identify key directions for future EEG-FMs. To that end,
this study reviews 10 early EEG-FMs and presents a critical synthesis of their
methodology, empirical findings, and outstanding research gaps. We find that
most EEG-FMs adopt a sequence-based modeling scheme that relies on
transformer-based backbones and the reconstruction of masked sequences for
self-supervision. However, model evaluations remain heterogeneous and largely
limited, making it challenging to assess their practical off-the-shelf utility.
In addition to adopting standardized and realistic evaluations, future work
should demonstrate more substantial scaling effects and make principled and
trustworthy choices throughout the EEG representation learning pipeline. We
believe that developing benchmarks, software tools, technical methodologies,
and applications in collaboration with domain experts may further advance the
translational utility and real-world adoption of EEG-FMs.

Abstract: High-risk traffic zones such as intersections are a major cause of
collisions. This study leverages deep generative models to enhance the safety
of autonomous vehicles in an intersection context. We train a 1000-step
denoising diffusion probabilistic model to generate collision-causing sensor
noise sequences for an autonomous vehicle navigating a four-way intersection
based on the current relative position and velocity of an intruder. Using the
generative adversarial architecture, the 1000-step model is distilled into a
single-step denoising diffusion model which demonstrates fast inference speed
while maintaining similar sampling quality. We demonstrate one possible
application of the single-step model in building a robust planner for the
autonomous vehicle. The planner uses the single-step model to efficiently
sample potential failure cases based on the currently measured traffic state to
inform its decision-making. Through simulation experiments, the robust planner
demonstrates significantly lower failure rate and delay rate compared with the
baseline Intelligent Driver Model controller.

Abstract: The SaaS paradigm has revolutionized software distribution by offering
flexible pricing options to meet diverse customer needs. However, the rapid
expansion of the SaaS market has introduced significant complexity for DevOps
teams, who must manually manage and evolve pricing structures, an approach that
is both time-consuming and prone to errors. The absence of automated tools for
pricing analysis restricts the ability to efficiently evaluate, optimize, and
scale these models. This paper proposes leveraging intelligent pricing
(iPricing), dynamic, machine-readable pricing models, as a solution to these
challenges. Intelligent pricing enables competitive analysis, streamlines
operational decision-making, and supports continuous pricing evolution in
response to market dynamics, leading to improved efficiency and accuracy. We
present an LLM-driven approach that automates the transformation of static HTML
pricing into iPricing, significantly improving efficiency and consistency while
minimizing human error. Our implementation, AI4Pricing2Yaml, features a basic
Information Extractor that uses web scraping and LLMs technologies to extract
essential pricing components, plans, features, usage limits, and add-ons, from
SaaS websites. Validation against a dataset of 30 distinct commercial SaaS,
encompassing over 150 intelligent pricings, demonstrates the system's
effectiveness in extracting the desired elements across all steps. However,
challenges remain in addressing hallucinations, complex structures, and dynamic
content. This work highlights the potential of automating intelligent pricing
transformation to streamline SaaS pricing management, offering implications for
improved consistency and scalability in an increasingly intricate pricing
landscape. Future research will focus on refining extraction capabilities and
enhancing the system's adaptability to a wider range of SaaS websites.

Abstract: Coordinated online behavior, which spans from beneficial collective actions
to harmful manipulation such as disinformation campaigns, has become a key
focus in digital ecosystem analysis. Traditional methods often rely on
monomodal approaches, focusing on single types of interactions like co-retweets
or co-hashtags, or consider multiple modalities independently of each other.
However, these approaches may overlook the complex dynamics inherent in
multimodal coordination. This study compares different ways of operationalizing
the detection of multimodal coordinated behavior. It examines the trade-off
between weakly and strongly integrated multimodal models, highlighting the
balance between capturing broader coordination patterns and identifying tightly
coordinated behavior. By comparing monomodal and multimodal approaches, we
assess the unique contributions of different data modalities and explore how
varying implementations of multimodality impact detection outcomes. Our
findings reveal that not all the modalities provide distinct insights, but that
with a multimodal approach we can get a more comprehensive understanding of
coordination dynamics. This work enhances the ability to detect and analyze
coordinated online behavior, offering new perspectives for safeguarding the
integrity of digital platforms.

Abstract: We introduce BenchRL-QAS, a unified benchmarking framework for systematically
evaluating reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in quantum architecture
search (QAS) across diverse variational quantum algorithm tasks and system
sizes ranging from 2- to 8-qubit. Our study benchmarks nine RL agents including
both value-based and policy-gradient methods on representative quantum problems
such as variational quantum eigensolver, variational quantum state
diagonalization, quantum classification, and state preparation, spanning both
noiseless and realistic noisy regimes. We propose a weighted ranking metric
that balances accuracy, circuit depth, gate count, and computational
efficiency, enabling fair and comprehensive comparison. Our results first
reveal that RL-based quantum classifier outperforms baseline variational
classifiers. Then we conclude that no single RL algorithm is universally
optimal when considering a set of QAS tasks; algorithmic performance is highly
context-dependent, varying with task structure, qubit count, and noise. This
empirical finding provides strong evidence for the "no free lunch" principle in
RL-based quantum circuit design and highlights the necessity of tailored
algorithm selection and systematic benchmarking for advancing quantum circuit

Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis has seen renewed progress under the discrete
modeling paradigm. Existing autoregressive approaches often rely on
single-codebook representations, which suffer from significant information
loss. Even with post-hoc refinement techniques such as flow matching, these
methods fail to recover fine-grained details (e.g., prosodic nuances,
speaker-specific timbres), especially in challenging scenarios like singing
voice or music synthesis. We propose QTTS, a novel TTS framework built upon our
new audio codec, QDAC. The core innovation of QDAC lies in its end-to-end
training of an ASR-based auto-regressive network with a GAN, which achieves
superior semantic feature disentanglement for scalable, near-lossless
compression. QTTS models these discrete codes using two innovative strategies:
the Hierarchical Parallel architecture, which uses a dual-AR structure to model
inter-codebook dependencies for higher-quality synthesis, and the Delay
Multihead approach, which employs parallelized prediction with a fixed delay to
accelerate inference speed. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed
framework achieves higher synthesis quality and better preserves expressive
content compared to baseline. This suggests that scaling up compression via
multi-codebook modeling is a promising direction for high-fidelity,
general-purpose speech and audio generation.

Abstract: Recommender systems can be found everywhere today, shaping our everyday
experience whenever we're consuming content, ordering food, buying groceries
online, or even just reading the news. Let's imagine we're in the process of
building a recommender system to make content suggestions to users on social
media. When thinking about fairness, it becomes clear there are several
perspectives to consider: the users asking for tailored suggestions, the
content creators hoping for some limelight, and society at large, navigating
the repercussions of algorithmic recommendations. A shared fairness concern
across all three is the emergence of filter bubbles, a side-effect that takes
place when recommender systems are almost "too good", making recommendations so
tailored that users become inadvertently confined to a narrow set of
opinions/themes and isolated from alternative ideas. From the user's
perspective, this is akin to manipulation. From the small content creator's
perspective, this is an obstacle preventing them access to a whole range of
potential fans. From society's perspective, the potential consequences are
far-reaching, influencing collective opinions, social behavior and political
decisions. How can our recommender system be fine-tuned to avoid the creation
of filter bubbles, and ensure a more inclusive and diverse content landscape?
Approaching this problem involves defining one (or more) performance metric to
represent diversity, and tweaking our recommender system's performance through
the lens of fairness. By incorporating this metric into our evaluation
framework, we aim to strike a balance between personalized recommendations and
the broader societal goal of fostering rich and varied cultures and points of
view.

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence (neuro-symbolic AI) excels in logical
analysis and reasoning. Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC), a promising
brain-inspired computational model, is integral to neuro-symbolic AI. Various
HDC models have been proposed to represent class-instance and class-class
relations, but when representing the more complex class-subclass relation,
where multiple objects associate different levels of classes and subclasses,
they face challenges for factorization, a crucial task for neuro-symbolic AI
systems. In this article, we propose FactorHD, a novel HDC model capable of
representing and factorizing the complex class-subclass relation efficiently.
FactorHD features a symbolic encoding method that embeds an extra memorization
clause, preserving more information for multiple objects. In addition, it
employs an efficient factorization algorithm that selectively eliminates
redundant classes by identifying the memorization clause of the target class.
Such model significantly enhances computing efficiency and accuracy in
representing and factorizing multiple objects with class-subclass relation,
overcoming limitations of existing HDC models such as "superposition
catastrophe" and "the problem of 2". Evaluations show that FactorHD achieves
approximately 5667x speedup at a representation size of 10^9 compared to
existing HDC models. When integrated with the ResNet-18 neural network,
FactorHD achieves 92.48% factorization accuracy on the Cifar-10 dataset.

human video that predicts human wrist and hand actions, we can perform Inverse
Kinematics and retargeting to convert the human actions to robot actions. We
fine-tune the model using a few robot manipulation demonstrations to obtain the
robot policy, namely EgoVLA. We propose a simulation benchmark called Isaac
Humanoid Manipulation Benchmark, where we design diverse bimanual manipulation
tasks with demonstrations. We fine-tune and evaluate EgoVLA with Isaac Humanoid
Manipulation Benchmark and show significant improvements over baselines and
ablate the importance of human data. Videos can be found on our website:

Conclusion: CB-DFS方法成功实现了DFS中GPU计算的批量处理，为搜索算法的并行优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of GPU technology has unlocked powerful parallel
processing capabilities, creating new opportunities to enhance classic search
algorithms. A recent successful application of GPUs is in compressing large
pattern database (PDB) heuristics using neural networks while preserving
heuristic admissibility. However, very few algorithms have been designed to
exploit GPUs during search. Several variants of A* exist that batch GPU
computations. In this paper we introduce a method for batching GPU computations
in depth first search. In particular, we describe a new cost-bounded
depth-first search (CB-DFS) method that leverages the combined parallelism of
modern CPUs and GPUs. This is used to create algorithms like \emph{Batch IDA*},
an extension of the Iterative Deepening A* (IDA*) algorithm, or Batch BTS, an
extensions of Budgeted Tree Search. Our approach builds on the general approach
used by Asynchronous Parallel IDA* (AIDA*), while maintaining optimality
guarantees. We evaluate the approach on the 3x3 Rubik's Cube and 4x4 sliding
tile puzzle (STP), showing that GPU operations can be efficiently batched in
DFS. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments to analyze the effects of
hyperparameters, neural network heuristic size, and hardware resources on
performance.

Result: 实验表明，MADDPG-MATO在延迟、能耗和任务完成率上均优于基线算法。

Conclusion: 该算法在动态高负载IIoT环境中表现出高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The integration of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) with Artificial
Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) offers new opportunities for smart
manufacturing, but it also introduces challenges related to
computation-intensive tasks and low-latency demands. Traditional generative
models based on cloud computing are difficult to meet the real-time
requirements of AIGC tasks in IIoT environments, and edge computing can
effectively reduce latency through task offloading. However, the dynamic nature
of AIGC tasks, model switching delays, and resource constraints impose higher
demands on edge computing environments. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes an AIGC task offloading framework tailored for IIoT edge computing
environments, considering the latency and energy consumption caused by AIGC
model switching for the first time. IIoT devices acted as multi-agent
collaboratively offload their dynamic AIGC tasks to the most appropriate edge
servers deployed with different generative models. A model aware AIGC task
offloading algorithm based on Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient
(MADDPG-MATO) is devised to minimize the latency and energy. Experimental
results show that MADDPG-MATO outperforms baseline algorithms, achieving an
average reduction of 6.98% in latency, 7.12% in energy consumption, and a 3.72%
increase in task completion rate across four sets of experiments with model
numbers ranging from 3 to 6, it is demonstrated that the proposed algorithm is
robust and efficient in dynamic, high-load IIoT environments.

Motivation: 空间转录组学（ST）技术为生物学家提供了单细胞生物学的空间背景信息，但建模ST数据具有挑战性，需要整合多尺度信息。

Method: SToFM首先对每个ST切片进行多尺度信息提取，构建包含宏观、微观和基因尺度信息的子切片，然后使用SE(2) Transformer获取高质量细胞表示。

Conclusion: SToFM通过多尺度建模和大规模预训练，显著提升了空间转录组学数据的分析能力。

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) technologies provide biologists with rich
insights into single-cell biology by preserving spatial context of cells.
Building foundational models for ST can significantly enhance the analysis of
vast and complex data sources, unlocking new perspectives on the intricacies of
biological tissues. However, modeling ST data is inherently challenging due to
the need to extract multi-scale information from tissue slices containing vast
numbers of cells. This process requires integrating macro-scale tissue
morphology, micro-scale cellular microenvironment, and gene-scale gene
expression profile. To address this challenge, we propose SToFM, a multi-scale
Spatial Transcriptomics Foundation Model. SToFM first performs multi-scale
information extraction on each ST slice, to construct a set of ST sub-slices
that aggregate macro-, micro- and gene-scale information. Then an SE(2)
Transformer is used to obtain high-quality cell representations from the
sub-slices. Additionally, we construct \textbf{SToCorpus-88M}, the largest
high-resolution spatial transcriptomics corpus for pretraining. SToFM achieves
outstanding performance on a variety of downstream tasks, such as tissue region
semantic segmentation and cell type annotation, demonstrating its comprehensive
understanding of ST data

Abstract: Quantifiable image patterns associated with disease progression and treatment
response are critical tools for guiding individual treatment, and for
developing novel therapies. Here, we show that unsupervised machine learning
can identify a pattern vocabulary of liver tissue in magnetic resonance images
that quantifies treatment response in diffuse liver disease. Deep clustering
networks simultaneously encode and cluster patches of medical images into a
low-dimensional latent space to establish a tissue vocabulary. The resulting
tissue types capture differential tissue change and its location in the liver
associated with treatment response. We demonstrate the utility of the
vocabulary on a randomized controlled trial cohort of non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis patients. First, we use the vocabulary to compare longitudinal
liver change in a placebo and a treatment cohort. Results show that the method
identifies specific liver tissue change pathways associated with treatment, and
enables a better separation between treatment groups than established
non-imaging measures. Moreover, we show that the vocabulary can predict biopsy
derived features from non-invasive imaging data. We validate the method on a
separate replication cohort to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed
method.

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) provides a powerful declarative paradigm for
knowledge representation and reasoning. Recently, counting answer sets has
emerged as an important computational problem with applications in
probabilistic reasoning, network reliability analysis, and other domains. This
has motivated significant research into designing efficient ASP counters. While
substantial progress has been made for normal logic programs, the development
of practical counters for disjunctive logic programs remains challenging.
  We present SharpASP-SR, a novel framework for counting answer sets of
disjunctive logic programs based on subtractive reduction to projected
propositional model counting. Our approach introduces an alternative
characterization of answer sets that enables efficient reduction while ensuring
that intermediate representations remain of polynomial size. This allows
SharpASP-SR to leverage recent advances in projected model counting technology.
Through extensive experimental evaluation on diverse benchmarks, we demonstrate
that SharpASP-SR significantly outperforms existing counters on instances with
large answer set counts. Building on these results, we develop a hybrid
counting approach that combines enumeration techniques with SharpASP-SR to
achieve state-of-the-art performance across the full spectrum of disjunctive
programs.

Conclusion: PGT-I为大规模ST-GNN训练提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal graph neural networks (ST-GNNs) are powerful tools for
modeling spatial and temporal data dependencies. However, their applications
have been limited primarily to small-scale datasets because of memory
constraints. While distributed training offers a solution, current frameworks
lack support for spatiotemporal models and overlook the properties of
spatiotemporal data. Informed by a scaling study on a large-scale workload, we
present PyTorch Geometric Temporal Index (PGT-I), an extension to PyTorch
Geometric Temporal that integrates distributed data parallel training and two
novel strategies: index-batching and distributed-index-batching. Our index
techniques exploit spatiotemporal structure to construct snapshots dynamically
at runtime, significantly reducing memory overhead, while
distributed-index-batching extends this approach by enabling scalable
processing across multiple GPUs. Our techniques enable the first-ever training
of an ST-GNN on the entire PeMS dataset without graph partitioning, reducing
peak memory usage by up to 89\% and achieving up to a 13.1x speedup over
standard DDP with 128 GPUs.

Abstract: Hybrid rice breeding crossbreeds different rice lines and cultivates the
resulting hybrids in fields to select those with desirable agronomic traits,
such as higher yields. Recently, genomic selection has emerged as an efficient
way for hybrid rice breeding. It predicts the traits of hybrids based on their
genes, which helps exclude many undesired hybrids, largely reducing the
workload of field cultivation. However, due to the limited accuracy of genomic
prediction models, breeders still need to combine their experience with the
models to identify regulatory genes that control traits and select hybrids,
which remains a time-consuming process. To ease this process, in this paper, we
proposed a visual analysis method to facilitate interactive hybrid rice
breeding. Regulatory gene identification and hybrid selection naturally
ensemble a dual-analysis task. Therefore, we developed a parametric dual
projection method with theoretical guarantees to facilitate interactive dual
analysis. Based on this dual projection method, we further developed a gene
visualization and a hybrid visualization to verify the identified regulatory
genes and hybrids. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through the
quantitative evaluation of the parametric dual projection method, identified
regulatory genes and desired hybrids in the case study, and positive feedback
from breeders.

Result: 在ReLU控制屏障函数的案例中，该方法能够及时检测安全违规和错误证书，且开销极小。

Conclusion: 该框架为神经网络证书的验证提供了一种轻量级且高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Neural certificates have emerged as a powerful tool in cyber-physical systems
control, providing witnesses of correctness. These certificates, such as
barrier functions, often learned alongside control policies, once verified,
serve as mathematical proofs of system safety. However, traditional formal
verification of their defining conditions typically faces scalability
challenges due to exhaustive state-space exploration. To address this
challenge, we propose a lightweight runtime monitoring framework that
integrates real-time verification and does not require access to the underlying
control policy. Our monitor observes the system during deployment and performs
on-the-fly verification of the certificate over a lookahead region to ensure
safety within a finite prediction horizon. We instantiate this framework for
ReLU-based control barrier functions and demonstrate its practical
effectiveness in a case study. Our approach enables timely detection of safety
violations and incorrect certificates with minimal overhead, providing an
effective but lightweight alternative to the static verification of the
certificates.

Conclusion: 相空间形式化为QML提供了一种高效且可扩展的新方法。

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) seeks to exploit the intrinsic properties of
quantum mechanical systems, including superposition, coherence, and quantum
entanglement for classical data processing. However, due to the exponential
growth of the Hilbert space, QML faces practical limits in classical
simulations with the state-vector representation of quantum system. On the
other hand, phase-space methods offer an alternative by encoding quantum states
as quasi-probability functions. Building on prior work in qubit phase-space and
the Stratonovich-Weyl (SW) correspondence, we construct a closed, composable
dynamical formalism for one- and many-qubit systems in phase-space. This
formalism replaces the operator algebra of the Pauli group with function
dynamics on symplectic manifolds, and recasts the curse of dimensionality in
terms of harmonic support on a domain that scales linearly with the number of
qubits. It opens a new route for QML based on variational modelling over
phase-space.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging plays an essential role in contemporary
clinical diagnostics. It is increasingly integrated into advanced therapeutic
workflows, such as hybrid Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance
(PET/MR) imaging and MR-only radiation therapy. These integrated approaches are
critically dependent on accurate estimation of radiation attenuation, which is
typically facilitated by synthesizing Computed Tomography (CT) images from MR
scans to generate attenuation maps. However, existing MR-to-CT synthesis
methods for whole-body imaging often suffer from poor spatial alignment between
the generated CT and input MR images, and insufficient image quality for
reliable use in downstream clinical tasks. In this paper, we present a novel 3D
Wavelet Latent Diffusion Model (3D-WLDM) that addresses these limitations by
performing modality translation in a learned latent space. By incorporating a
Wavelet Residual Module into the encoder-decoder architecture, we enhance the
capture and reconstruction of fine-scale features across image and latent
spaces. To preserve anatomical integrity during the diffusion process, we
disentangle structural and modality-specific characteristics and anchor the
structural component to prevent warping. We also introduce a Dual Skip
Connection Attention mechanism within the diffusion model, enabling the
generation of high-resolution CT images with improved representation of bony
structures and soft-tissue contrast.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Hebbian learning as a novel method for swarm
robotics, enabling the automatic emergence of heterogeneity. Hebbian learning
presents a biologically inspired form of neural adaptation that solely relies
on local information. By doing so, we resolve several major challenges for
learning heterogeneous control: 1) Hebbian learning removes the complexity of
attributing emergent phenomena to single agents through local learning rules,
thus circumventing the micro-macro problem; 2) uniform Hebbian learning rules
across all swarm members limit the number of parameters needed, mitigating the
curse of dimensionality with scaling swarm sizes; and 3) evolving Hebbian
learning rules based on swarm-level behaviour minimises the need for extensive
prior knowledge typically required for optimising heterogeneous swarms. This
work demonstrates that with Hebbian learning heterogeneity naturally emerges,
resulting in swarm-level behavioural switching and in significantly improved
swarm capabilities. It also demonstrates how the evolution of Hebbian learning
rules can be a valid alternative to Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning in
standard benchmarking tasks.

Abstract: Highway on-ramp merging areas are common bottlenecks to traffic congestion
and accidents. Currently, a cooperative control strategy based on connected and
automated vehicles (CAVs) is a fundamental solution to this problem. While CAVs
are not fully widespread, it is necessary to propose a hierarchical cooperative
on-ramp merging control (HCOMC) framework for heterogeneous traffic flow on
two-lane highways to address this gap. This paper extends longitudinal
car-following models based on the intelligent driver model and lateral
lane-changing models using the quintic polynomial curve to account for
human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and CAVs, comprehensively considering human
factors and cooperative adaptive cruise control. Besides, this paper proposes a
HCOMC framework, consisting of a hierarchical cooperative planning model based
on the modified virtual vehicle model, a discretionary lane-changing model
based on game theory, and a multi-objective optimization model using the
elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm to ensure the safe, smooth, and
efficient merging process. Then, the performance of our HCOMC is analyzed under
different traffic densities and CAV penetration rates through simulation. The
findings underscore our HCOMC's pronounced comprehensive advantages in
enhancing the safety of group vehicles, stabilizing and expediting merging
process, optimizing traffic efficiency, and economizing fuel consumption

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代数字巡天项目生成了数十亿星系图像，需要高效自动化工具进行分析。现有方法依赖预定义类别的机器学习标注，限制了分析的灵活性。

Method: 利用生成式AI技术简化星系图像，将其转换为骨架化形式，便于形状测量和不受预定义类别限制的分析。

Result: 方法应用于12.5万张DESI Legacy Survey图像，生成的简化图像目录已公开。

Conclusion: 该方法为星系图像分析提供了更灵活、准确的工具，突破了预定义类别的限制。

Abstract: Modern digital sky surveys have been acquiring images of billions of
galaxies. While these images often provide sufficient details to analyze the
shape of the galaxies, accurate analysis of such high volumes of images
requires effective automation. Current solutions often rely on machine learning
annotation of the galaxy images based on a set of pre-defined classes. Here we
introduce a new approach to galaxy image analysis that is based on generative
AI. The method simplifies the galaxy images and automatically converts them
into a ``skeletonized" form. The simplified images allow accurate measurements
of the galaxy shapes and analysis that is not limited to a certain pre-defined
set of classes. We demonstrate the method by applying it to galaxy images
acquired by the DESI Legacy Survey. The code and data are publicly available.
The method was applied to 125,000 DESI Legacy Survey images, and the catalog of
the simplified images is publicly available.

Abstract: As the path toward 6G networks is being charted, the emerging applications
have motivated evolutions of network architectures to realize the efficient,
reliable, and flexible wireless networks. Among the potential architectures,
the non-terrestrial network (NTN) and open radio access network (ORAN) have
received increasing interest from both academia and industry. Although the
deployment of NTNs ensures coverage, enhances spectral efficiency, and improves
the resilience of wireless networks. The high altitude and mobility of NTN
present new challenges in the development and operations (DevOps) lifecycle,
hindering intelligent and scalable network management due to the lack of native
artificial intelligence (AI) capability. With the advantages of ORAN in
disaggregation, openness, virtualization, and intelligence, several works
propose integrating ORAN principles into the NTN, focusing mainly on ORAN
deployment options based on transparent and regenerative systems. However, a
holistic view of how to effectively combine ORAN and NTN throughout the DevOps
lifecycle is still missing, especially regarding how intelligent ORAN addresses
the scalability challenges in NTN. Motivated by this, in this paper, we first
provide the background knowledge about ORAN and NTN, outline the
state-of-the-art research on ORAN for NTNs, and present the DevOps challenges
that motivate the adoption of ORAN solutions. We then propose the ORAN-based
NTN framework, discussing its features and architectures in detail. These
include the discussion about flexible fronthaul split, RAN intelligent
controllers (RICs) enhancement for distributed learning, scalable deployment
architecture, and multi-domain service management. Finally, the future research
directions, including combinations of the ORAN-based NTN framework and other
enabling technologies and schemes, as well as the candidate use cases, are
highlighted.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有极性解码器在删除信道中的计算复杂度高（O(N^4)），限制了其应用。NPD通过改进架构降低复杂度。

Method: 扩展NPD架构以支持删除信道，仅修改其中一个神经网络。复杂度降至O(AN log N)。

Result: 在删除率δ∈{0.01, 0.1}的信道中验证了NPD性能，并展示了列表解码的改进。

Conclusion: NPD的复杂度降低使其在DNA存储等未来技术中具有潜在应用。

Abstract: This paper introduces a neural polar decoder (NPD) for deletion channels with
a constant deletion rate. Existing polar decoders for deletion channels exhibit
high computational complexity of $O(N^4)$, where $N$ is the block length. This
limits the application of polar codes for deletion channels to
short-to-moderate block lengths. In this work, we demonstrate that employing
NPDs for deletion channels can reduce the computational complexity. First, we
extend the architecture of the NPD to support deletion channels. Specifically,
the NPD architecture consists of four neural networks (NNs), each replicating
fundamental successive cancellation (SC) decoder operations. To support
deletion channels, we change the architecture of only one. The computational
complexity of the NPD is $O(AN\log N)$, where the parameter $A$ represents a
computational budget determined by the user and is independent of the channel.
We evaluate the new extended NPD for deletion channels with deletion rates
$\delta\in\{0.01, 0.1\}$ and we verify the NPD with the ground truth given by
the trellis decoder by Tal et al. We further show that due to the reduced
complexity of the NPD, we are able to incorporate list decoding and further
improve performance. We believe that the extended NPD presented here could have
applications in future technologies like DNA storage.

Motivation: 新生儿肺动脉高压的诊断依赖于主观性较强的超声心动图，现有自动化方法多为成人设计且基于单视角，泛化能力有限。

Method: 采用多视角变分自编码器（VAE）框架，从超声心动图视频中提取复杂潜在表征，提升特征提取和鲁棒性。

Result: 与单视角和监督学习方法相比，多视角VAE模型表现出更好的泛化能力和分类准确性。

Conclusion: 多视角学习在新生儿肺动脉高压的鲁棒评估中具有显著效果。

Abstract: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) in newborns is a critical condition characterized
by elevated pressure in the pulmonary arteries, leading to right ventricular
strain and heart failure. While right heart catheterization (RHC) is the
diagnostic gold standard, echocardiography is preferred due to its non-invasive
nature, safety, and accessibility. However, its accuracy highly depends on the
operator, making PH assessment subjective. While automated detection methods
have been explored, most models focus on adults and rely on single-view
echocardiographic frames, limiting their performance in diagnosing PH in
newborns. While multi-view echocardiography has shown promise in improving PH
assessment, existing models struggle with generalizability. In this work, we
employ a multi-view variational autoencoder (VAE) for PH prediction using
echocardiographic videos. By leveraging the VAE framework, our model captures
complex latent representations, improving feature extraction and robustness. We
compare its performance against single-view and supervised learning approaches.
Our results show improved generalization and classification accuracy,
highlighting the effectiveness of multi-view learning for robust PH assessment
in newborns.

Conclusion: 论文为位置感知架构提供了校准不确定性估计和优化计算效率的实用方法。

Abstract: Large language models demonstrate remarkable in-context learning
capabilities, adapting to new tasks without parameter updates. While this
phenomenon has been successfully modeled as implicit Bayesian inference, recent
empirical findings reveal a fundamental contradiction: transformers
systematically violate the martingale property, a cornerstone requirement of
Bayesian updating on exchangeable data. This violation challenges the
theoretical foundations underlying uncertainty quantification in critical
applications.
  Our theoretical analysis establishes four key results: (1) positional
encodings induce martingale violations of order $\Theta(\log n / n)$; (2)
transformers achieve information-theoretic optimality with excess risk
$O(n^{-1/2})$ in expectation over orderings; (3) the implicit posterior
representation converges to the true Bayesian posterior in the space of
sufficient statistics; and (4) we derive the optimal chain-of-thought length as
$k^* = \Theta(\sqrt{n}\log(1/\varepsilon))$ with explicit constants, providing
a principled approach to reduce inference costs while maintaining performance.
Empirical validation on GPT-3 confirms predictions (1)-(3), with transformers
reaching 99\% of theoretical entropy limits within 20 examples. Our framework
provides practical methods for extracting calibrated uncertainty estimates from
position-aware architectures and optimizing computational efficiency in
deployment.

Result: 提出的旋转子层在LLM注意力层中表现与强基线（如块Hadamard和低秩近似）相当，且参数效率更高（O(log²d) vs O(d²)）。

Conclusion: 几何原语可以通过代数方式组合成深度模型中的高级功能，为模型设计提供了新视角。

Abstract: Contemporary large models often exhibit behaviors suggesting the presence of
low-level primitives that compose into modules with richer functionality, but
these fundamental building blocks remain poorly understood. We investigate this
compositional structure in linear layers by asking: can we identify/synthesize
linear transformations from a minimal set of geometric primitives? Using
Clifford algebra, we show that linear layers can be expressed as compositions
of bivectors -- geometric objects encoding oriented planes -- and introduce a
differentiable algorithm that decomposes them into products of rotors. This
construction uses only O(log^2 d) parameters, versus O(d^2) required by dense
matrices. Applied to the key, query, and value projections in LLM attention
layers, our rotor-based layers match the performance of strong baselines such
as block-Hadamard and low-rank approximations. Our findings provide an
algebraic perspective on how these geometric primitives can compose into
higher-level functions within deep models.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）复杂性和能力的提升，较少广泛部署的对齐技术的效果尚不确定。本文旨在探索CAA在不同模型规模下的有效性。

Method: 使用Llama 2模型（7B、13B、70B），通过对比对（如仇恨到爱）在残差流向量空间中寻找理想方向，并在前向传播时添加该方向，直接操纵残差流以控制模型输出。

Result: 1) CAA在早期到中间层最有效。2) CAA的效果随模型规模增大而减弱。3) 负向引导在所有模型规模中效果更显著。

Conclusion: CAA是一种有效的对齐技术，但其效果受模型规模和引导方向影响。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) evolve in complexity and capability, the
efficacy of less widely deployed alignment techniques are uncertain. Building
on previous work on activation steering and contrastive activation addition
(CAA), this paper explores the effectiveness of CAA with model scale using the
family of Llama 2 models (7B, 13B, and 70B). CAA works by finding desirable
'directions' in the model's residual stream vector space using contrastive
pairs (for example, hate to love) and adding this direction to the residual
stream during the forward pass. It directly manipulates the residual stream and
aims to extract features from language models to better control their outputs.
Using answer matching questions centered around the refusal behavior, we found
that 1) CAA is most effective when applied at early-mid layers. 2) The
effectiveness of CAA diminishes with model size. 3) Negative steering has more
pronounced effects than positive steering across all model sizes.

Conclusion: 该方法有效结合了RL目标和网络压缩，提升了RL代理的效率和性能。

Abstract: Scaling deep neural networks (NN) of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms
has been shown to enhance performance when feature extraction networks are used
but the gained performance comes at the significant expense of increased
computational and memory complexity. Neural network pruning methods have
successfully addressed this challenge in supervised learning. However, their
application to RL is underexplored. We propose an approach to integrate
simultaneous training and pruning within advanced RL methods, in particular to
RL algorithms enhanced by the Online Feature Extractor Network (OFENet). Our
networks (XiNet) are trained to solve stochastic optimization problems over the
RL networks' weights and the parameters of variational Bernoulli distributions
for 0/1 Random Variables $\xi$ scaling each unit in the networks. The
stochastic problem formulation induces regularization terms that promote
convergence of the variational parameters to 0 when a unit contributes little
to the performance. In this case, the corresponding structure is rendered
permanently inactive and pruned from its network. We propose a cost-aware,
sparsity-promoting regularization scheme, tailored to the DenseNet architecture
of OFENets expressing the parameter complexity of involved networks in terms of
the parameters of the RVs in these networks. Then, when matching this cost with
the regularization terms, the many hyperparameters associated with them are
automatically selected, effectively combining the RL objectives and network
compression. We evaluate our method on continuous control benchmarks (MuJoCo)
and the Soft Actor-Critic RL agent, demonstrating that OFENets can be pruned
considerably with minimal loss in performance. Furthermore, our results confirm
that pruning large networks during training produces more efficient and higher
performing RL agents rather than training smaller networks from scratch.

Conclusion: RiemannLoRA为LoRA提供了一种统一的优化框架，显著提升了其效率和性能。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a widely adopted standard for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs), significantly
reducing memory and computational demands. However, challenges remain,
including finding optimal initialization strategies or mitigating
overparametrization in low-rank matrix factorization. In this work, we propose
a novel approach that addresses both of the challenges simultaneously within a
unified framework. Our method treats a set of fixed-rank LoRA matrices as a
smooth manifold. Considering adapters as elements on this manifold removes
overparametrization, while determining the direction of the fastest loss
decrease along the manifold provides initialization. Special care is taken to
obtain numerically stable and computationally efficient implementation of our
method, using best practices from numerical linear algebra and Riemannian
optimization. Experimental results on LLM and diffusion model architectures
demonstrate that RiemannLoRA consistently improves both convergence speed and
final performance over standard LoRA and its state-of-the-art modifications.

to approximate intermediate output features, drastically reducing inter-device
communication. Additionally, we restructure the self-attention mechanism to
eliminate redundant computations caused by per-device Key/Value calculation in
position-wise partitioning and design a partition-aware causal masking scheme
tailored for autoregressive models. We evaluate PRISM on ViT, BERT, and GPT-2
across diverse datasets, namely CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1k, GLUE, and
CBT. Our results demonstrate substantial reductions in communication overhead
(up to 99.2% for BERT at compression rate CR = 128) and per-device computation
(51.24% for BERT at the same setting), with only minor accuracy degradation.
This method offers a scalable and practical solution for deploying foundation
models in distributed resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning-trained Large Reasoning Models (LRMs, e.g.,
Deepseek-R1) demonstrate advanced reasoning capabilities in the evolving Large
Language Models (LLMs) domain, their susceptibility to security threats remains
a critical vulnerability. This weakness is particularly evident in
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation processes, where adversarial methods like
backdoor prompt attacks can systematically subvert the model's core reasoning
mechanisms. The emerging Chain-of-Thought Attack (CoTA) reveals this
vulnerability through exploiting prompt controllability, simultaneously
degrading both CoT safety and task performance with low-cost interventions. To
address this compounded security-performance vulnerability, we propose Thought
Purity (TP): a defense paradigm that systematically strengthens resistance to
malicious content while preserving operational efficacy. Our solution achieves
this through three synergistic components: (1) a safety-optimized data
processing pipeline (2) reinforcement learning-enhanced rule constraints (3)
adaptive monitoring metrics. Our approach establishes the first comprehensive
defense mechanism against CoTA vulnerabilities in reinforcement
learning-aligned reasoning systems, significantly advancing the
security-functionality equilibrium for next-generation AI architectures.

Method: 通过分析验证器ROC曲线的几何特性，理论推导了Best-of-N和拒绝采样的实例级准确性。

Result: 拒绝采样在固定计算量下优于Best-of-N，但在无限计算量下两者性能趋同，由ROC曲线原点附近的斜率决定。实验验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: 验证器的ROC曲线几何特性决定了测试时扩展方法的性能，为实际应用提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Test-time scaling aims to improve language model performance by leveraging
additional compute during inference. While many works have empirically studied
techniques like Best-of-N (BoN) and rejection sampling that make use of a
verifier to enable test-time scaling, there is little theoretical understanding
of how verifier imperfection affects performance. In this work, we address this
gap. Specifically, we prove how instance-level accuracy of these methods is
precisely characterized by the geometry of the verifier's ROC curve.
Interestingly, while scaling is determined by the local geometry of the ROC
curve for rejection sampling, it depends on global properties of the ROC curve
for BoN. As a consequence when the ROC curve is unknown, it is impossible to
extrapolate the performance of rejection sampling based on the low-compute
regime. Furthermore, while rejection sampling outperforms BoN for fixed
compute, in the infinite-compute limit both methods converge to the same level
of accuracy, determined by the slope of the ROC curve near the origin. Our
theoretical results are confirmed by experiments on GSM8K using different
versions of Llama and Qwen to generate and verify solutions.

subvert current safeguards, turning beneficial models into tools for harm. This
leads to a 'safety gap': the difference in dangerous capabilities between a
model with intact safeguards and one that has been stripped of those
safeguards. We open-source a toolkit to estimate the safety gap for
state-of-the-art open-weight models. As a case study, we evaluate biochemical
and cyber capabilities, refusal rates, and generation quality of models from
two families (Llama-3 and Qwen-2.5) across a range of parameter scales (0.5B to
405B) using different safeguard removal techniques. Our experiments reveal that
the safety gap widens as model scale increases and effective dangerous
capabilities grow substantially when safeguards are removed. We hope that the
Safety Gap Toolkit (https://github.com/AlignmentResearch/safety-gap) will serve
as an evaluation framework for common open-source models and as a motivation
for developing and testing tamper-resistant safeguards. We welcome
contributions to the toolkit from the community.

Motivation: 解决神经网络模型在公平性要求下避免推断敏感信息（如人口统计属性）的挑战。

Result: LEOPARD在经典NLP基准测试中实现了最先进的离散属性非线性擦除性能，并有效减少了深度非线性分类器的偏见。

Conclusion: LEOPARD是一种有效的公平性促进方法，能够在移除敏感信息的同时保留语义信息。

Abstract: Ensuring that neural models used in real-world applications cannot infer
sensitive information, such as demographic attributes like gender or race, from
text representations is a critical challenge when fairness is a concern. We
address this issue through concept erasure, a process that removes information
related to a specific concept from distributed representations while preserving
as much of the remaining semantic information as possible. Our approach
involves learning an orthogonal projection in the embedding space, designed to
make the class-conditional feature distributions of the discrete concept to
erase indistinguishable after projection. By adjusting the rank of the
projector, we control the extent of information removal, while its
orthogonality ensures strict preservation of the local structure of the
embeddings. Our method, termed $\overline{\mathrm{L}}$EOPARD, achieves
state-of-the-art performance in nonlinear erasure of a discrete attribute on
classic natural language processing benchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that $\overline{\mathrm{L}}$EOPARD effectively mitigates bias in deep nonlinear
classifiers, thereby promoting fairness.

Result: 实验证明RegCL在多个下游数据集上表现良好，验证了其在动态场景中的有效性。

Conclusion: RegCL成功解决了多领域知识整合的挑战，同时保持参数高效性，适用于动态场景。

Abstract: To address the performance limitations of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in
specific domains, existing works primarily adopt adapter-based one-step
adaptation paradigms. However, some of these methods are specific developed for
specific domains. If used on other domains may lead to performance degradation.
This issue of catastrophic forgetting severely limits the model's scalability.
To address this issue, this paper proposes RegCL, a novel non-replay continual
learning (CL) framework designed for efficient multi-domain knowledge
integration through model merging. Specifically, RegCL incorporates the model
merging algorithm into the continual learning paradigm by merging the
parameters of SAM's adaptation modules (e.g., LoRA modules) trained on
different domains. The merging process is guided by weight optimization, which
minimizes prediction discrepancies between the merged model and each of the
domain-specific models. RegCL effectively consolidates multi-domain knowledge
while maintaining parameter efficiency, i.e., the model size remains constant
regardless of the number of tasks, and no historical data storage is required.
Experimental results demonstrate that RegCL achieves favorable continual
learning performance across multiple downstream datasets, validating its
effectiveness in dynamic scenarios.

computational graphs of variable width and depth. Existing MoE architectures
generally require a fixed amount of computation for a given sample. Our

iteratively sampling from a set of candidate experts, unfolding the sequence
akin to how Recurrent Neural Networks are trained. Our method does not require
load-balancing mechanisms, and preliminary experiments show a reduction in
training epochs of 10\% to 40\% with a comparable/higher accuracy. These

Conclusion: Newfluence为解释复杂AI模型提供了更可靠的工具，其高维框架还可用于分析其他技术。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of machine learning (ML) and artificial
intelligence (AI) models has created a pressing need for tools that help
scientists, engineers, and policymakers interpret and refine model decisions
and predictions. Influence functions, originating from robust statistics, have
emerged as a popular approach for this purpose.
  However, the heuristic foundations of influence functions rely on
low-dimensional assumptions where the number of parameters $p$ is much smaller
than the number of observations $n$. In contrast, modern AI models often
operate in high-dimensional regimes with large $p$, challenging these
assumptions.
  In this paper, we examine the accuracy of influence functions in
high-dimensional settings. Our theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that
influence functions cannot reliably fulfill their intended purpose. We then
introduce an alternative approximation, called Newfluence, that maintains
similar computational efficiency while offering significantly improved
accuracy.
  Newfluence is expected to provide more accurate insights than many existing
methods for interpreting complex AI models and diagnosing their issues.
Moreover, the high-dimensional framework we develop in this paper can also be
applied to analyze other popular techniques, such as Shapley values.

Abstract: Robust uncertainty quantification (UQ) remains a critical barrier to the safe
deployment of deep learning in real-time virtual sensing, particularly in
high-stakes domains where sparse, noisy, or non-collocated sensor data are the
norm. We introduce the Conformalized Monte Carlo Operator (CMCO), a framework
that transforms neural operator-based virtual sensing with calibrated,
distribution-free prediction intervals. By unifying Monte Carlo dropout with
split conformal prediction in a single DeepONet architecture, CMCO achieves
spatially resolved uncertainty estimates without retraining, ensembling, or
custom loss design. Our method addresses a longstanding challenge: how to endow
operator learning with efficient and reliable UQ across heterogeneous domains.
Through rigorous evaluation on three distinct applications: turbulent flow,
elastoplastic deformation, and global cosmic radiation dose estimation-CMCO
consistently attains near-nominal empirical coverage, even in settings with
strong spatial gradients and proxy-based sensing. This breakthrough offers a
general-purpose, plug-and-play UQ solution for neural operators, unlocking
real-time, trustworthy inference in digital twins, sensor fusion, and
safety-critical monitoring. By bridging theory and deployment with minimal
computational overhead, CMCO establishes a new foundation for scalable,
generalizable, and uncertainty-aware scientific machine learning.

Abstract: Grokking refers to delayed generalization in which the increase in test
accuracy of a neural network occurs appreciably after the improvement in
training accuracy This paper introduces several practical metrics including
variance under dropout, robustness, embedding similarity, and sparsity
measures, that can forecast grokking behavior. Specifically, the resilience of
neural networks to noise during inference is estimated from a Dropout
Robustness Curve (DRC) obtained from the variation of the accuracy with the
dropout rate as the model transitions from memorization to generalization. The
variance of the test accuracy under stochastic dropout across training
checkpoints further exhibits a local maximum during the grokking. Additionally,
the percentage of inactive neurons decreases during generalization, while the
embeddings tend to a bimodal distribution independent of initialization that
correlates with the observed cosine similarity patterns and dataset symmetries.
These metrics additionally provide valuable insight into the origin and
behaviour of grokking.

Abstract: The epidemic failure of replicability across empirical science and machine
learning has recently motivated the formal study of replicable learning
algorithms [Impagliazzo et al. (2022)]. In batch settings where data comes from
a fixed i.i.d. source (e.g., hypothesis testing, supervised learning), the
design of data-efficient replicable algorithms is now more or less understood.
In contrast, there remain significant gaps in our knowledge for control
settings like reinforcement learning where an agent must interact directly with
a shifting environment. Karbasi et. al show that with access to a generative
model of an environment with $S$ states and $A$ actions (the RL 'batch
setting'), replicably learning a near-optimal policy costs only
$\tilde{O}(S^2A^2)$ samples. On the other hand, the best upper bound without a
generative model jumps to $\tilde{O}(S^7 A^7)$ [Eaton et al. (2024)] due to the
substantial difficulty of environment exploration. This gap raises a key
question in the broader theory of replicability: Is replicable exploration
inherently more expensive than batch learning? Is sample-efficient replicable
RL even possible?
  In this work, we (nearly) resolve this problem (for low-horizon tabular
MDPs): exploration is not a significant barrier to replicable learning! Our
main result is a replicable RL algorithm on $\tilde{O}(S^2A)$ samples, bridging
the gap between the generative and episodic settings. We complement this with a
matching $\tilde{\Omega}(S^2A)$ lower bound in the generative setting (under
the common parallel sampling assumption) and an unconditional lower bound in
the episodic setting of $\tilde{\Omega}(S^2)$ showcasing the near-optimality of
our algorithm with respect to the state space $S$.

Method: 使用改进的Spotlight Resonance方法进行表示对齐分析，并通过改变激活函数的代数对称性进行消融研究。

Result: 发现离散代数置换等变性对称性会导致表示离散化，而连续代数正交等变性对称性则保持连续性。此外，表示离散化可能与重建误差增加相关。

Conclusion: 激活函数的功能形式选择可能引入意外的归纳偏差，影响表示的离散化，这对可解释性研究有重要意义。

Abstract: This paper describes a novel methodology for determining representational
alignment, developed upon the existing Spotlight Resonance method. Using this,
it is found that algebraic symmetries of network primitives are a strong
predictor for task-agnostic structure in representations. Particularly, this
new tool is used to gain insight into how discrete representations can form and
arrange in autoencoder models, through an ablation study where only the
activation function is altered. Representations are found to tend to discretise
when the activation functions are defined through a discrete algebraic
permutation-equivariant symmetry. In contrast, they remain continuous under a
continuous algebraic orthogonal-equivariant definition. These findings
corroborate the hypothesis that functional form choices can carry unintended
inductive biases which produce task-independent artefactual structures in
representations, particularly that contemporary forms induce discretisation of
otherwise continuous structure -- a quantisation effect. Moreover, this
supports a general causal model for one mode in which discrete representations
may form, and could constitute a prerequisite for downstream interpretability
phenomena, including grandmother neurons, discrete coding schemes, general
linear features and possibly Superposition. Hence, this tool and proposed
mechanism for the influence of functional form on representations may provide
several insights into emergent interpretability research. Finally, preliminary
results indicate that quantisation of representations appears to correlate with
a measurable increase in reconstruction error, reinforcing previous conjectures
that this collapse can be detrimental.

Abstract: In this study, we derive Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) bounds on the
asymptotic sample-complexity for RL within the infinite-horizon Markov Decision
Process (MDP) setting that are sharper than those in existing literature. The
premise of our study is twofold: firstly, the further two states are from each
other, transition-wise, the less relevant the value of the first state is when
learning the $\epsilon$-optimal value of the second; secondly, the amount of
'effort', sample-complexity-wise, expended in learning the $\epsilon$-optimal
value of a state is independent of the number of samples required to learn the
$\epsilon$-optimal value of a second state that is a sufficient number of
transitions away from the first. Inversely, states within each other's vicinity
have values that are dependent on each other and will require a similar number
of samples to learn. By approximating the original MDP using smaller MDPs
constructed using subsets of the original's state-space, we are able to reduce
the sample-complexity by a logarithmic factor to $O(SA \log A)$ timesteps,
where $S$ and $A$ are the state and action space sizes. We are able to extend
these results to an infinite-horizon, model-free setting by constructing a
PAC-MDP algorithm with the aforementioned sample-complexity. We conclude with
showing how significant the improvement is by comparing our algorithm against
prior work in an experimental setting.

Abstract: Coreset selection methods have shown promise in reducing the training data
size while maintaining model performance for data-efficient machine learning.
However, as many datasets suffer from biases that cause models to learn
spurious correlations instead of causal features, it is important to understand
whether and how dataset reduction methods may perpetuate, amplify, or mitigate
these biases. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive analysis of the
implications of data selection on the spurious bias levels of the selected
coresets and the robustness of downstream models trained on them. We use an
extensive experimental setting spanning ten different spurious correlations
benchmarks, five score metrics to characterize sample importance/ difficulty,
and five data selection policies across a broad range of coreset sizes.
Thereby, we unravel a series of nontrivial nuances in interactions between
sample difficulty and bias alignment, as well as dataset bias and resultant
model robustness. For example, we find that selecting coresets using
embedding-based sample characterization scores runs a comparatively lower risk
of inadvertently exacerbating bias than selecting using characterizations based
on learning dynamics. Most importantly, our analysis reveals that although some
coreset selection methods could achieve lower bias levels by prioritizing
difficult samples, they do not reliably guarantee downstream robustness.

Abstract: Sequential deep learning models excel in domains with temporal or sequential

methods for understanding their predictions. While existing techniques quantify
feature importance, they inherently assume fixed feature ordering - conflating
the effects of (1) feature values and (2) their positions within input
sequences. To address this gap, we introduce OrdShap, a novel attribution
method that disentangles these effects by quantifying how a model's predictions
change in response to permuting feature position. We establish a game-theoretic
connection between OrdShap and Sanchez-Berganti\~nos values, providing a
theoretically grounded approach to position-sensitive attribution. Empirical
results from health, natural language, and synthetic datasets highlight
OrdShap's effectiveness in capturing feature value and feature position
attributions, and provide deeper insight into model behavior.

Abstract: Graph fraud detection has garnered significant attention as Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) have proven effective in modeling complex relationships within
multimodal data. However, existing graph fraud detection methods typically use
preprocessed node embeddings and predefined graph structures to reveal
fraudsters, which ignore the rich semantic cues contained in raw textual
information. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit powerful
capabilities in processing textual information, it remains a significant
challenge to perform multimodal fusion of processed textual embeddings with
graph structures. In this paper, we propose a \textbf{M}ulti-level \textbf{L}LM
\textbf{E}nhanced Graph Fraud \textbf{D}etection framework called MLED. In
MLED, we utilize LLMs to extract external knowledge from textual information to
enhance graph fraud detection methods. To integrate LLMs with graph structure
information and enhance the ability to distinguish fraudsters, we design a
multi-level LLM enhanced framework including type-level enhancer and
relation-level enhancer. One is to enhance the difference between the
fraudsters and the benign entities, the other is to enhance the importance of
the fraudsters in different relations. The experiments on four real-world
datasets show that MLED achieves state-of-the-art performance in graph fraud
detection as a generalized framework that can be applied to existing methods.

Abstract: Human feedback is increasingly used across diverse applications like training
AI models, developing recommender systems, and measuring public opinion -- with
granular feedback often being preferred over binary feedback for its greater
informativeness. While it is easy to accurately estimate a population's
distribution of feedback given feedback from a large number of individuals,
cost constraints typically necessitate using smaller groups. A simple method to
approximate the population distribution is regularized averaging: compute the
empirical distribution and regularize it toward a prior. Can we do better? As
we will discuss, the answer to this question depends on feedback granularity.
  Suppose one wants to predict a population's distribution of feedback using
feedback from a limited number of individuals. We show that, as feedback
granularity increases, one can substantially improve upon predictions of
regularized averaging by combining individuals' feedback in ways more
sophisticated than regularized averaging.
  Our empirical analysis using questions on social attitudes confirms this
pattern. In particular, with binary feedback, sophistication barely reduces the
number of individuals required to attain a fixed level of performance. By
contrast, with five-point feedback, sophisticated methods match the performance
of regularized averaging with about half as many individuals.

Abstract: In many applications, decision-makers must choose between multiple predictive
models that may all be miscalibrated. Which model (i.e., predictor) is more
"useful" in downstream decision tasks? To answer this, our first contribution
introduces the notion of the informativeness gap between any two predictors,
defined as the maximum normalized payoff advantage one predictor offers over
the other across all decision-making tasks. Our framework strictly generalizes
several existing notions: it subsumes U-Calibration [KLST-23] and Calibration
Decision Loss [HW-24], which compare a miscalibrated predictor to its
calibrated counterpart, and it recovers Blackwell informativeness [Bla-51,
Bla-53] as a special case when both predictors are perfectly calibrated. Our
second contribution is a dual characterization of the informativeness gap,
which gives rise to a natural informativeness measure that can be viewed as a
relaxed variant of the earth mover's distance (EMD) between two prediction
distributions. We show that this measure satisfies natural desiderata: it is
complete and sound, and it can be estimated sample-efficiently in the
prediction-only access setting. Along the way, we also obtain novel
combinatorial structural results when applying this measure to perfectly
calibrated predictors.

Motivation: 早期对DNNs可行性的质疑源于其非线性特性导致无法保证收敛到全局最优解，但实践表明标准训练协议下的大规模DNNs表现良好。然而，社区过于关注优化效率，忽视了优化器对学习解性质的影响。

Result: 优化器设计是影响模型性能的关键因素之一，应被视作与架构和数据同等重要的工具。

Conclusion: 社区应更关注优化器对学习解性质的影响，并设计具有特定目标的优化器，而不仅仅是追求收敛速度。

Abstract: Due to the nonlinear nature of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), one can not
guarantee convergence to a unique global minimum of the loss when using
optimizers relying only on local information, such as SGD. Indeed, this was a
primary source of skepticism regarding the feasibility of DNNs in the early
days of the field. The past decades of progress in deep learning have revealed
this skepticism to be misplaced, and a large body of empirical evidence shows
that sufficiently large DNNs following standard training protocols exhibit
well-behaved optimization dynamics that converge to performant solutions. This
success has biased the community to use convex optimization as a mental model
for learning, leading to a focus on training efficiency, either in terms of
required iteration, FLOPs or wall-clock time, when improving optimizers. We
argue that, while this perspective has proven extremely fruitful, another
perspective specific to DNNs has received considerably less attention: the
optimizer not only influences the rate of convergence, but also the qualitative
properties of the learned solutions. Restated, the optimizer can and will
encode inductive biases and change the effective expressivity of a given class
of models. Furthermore, we believe the optimizer can be an effective way of
encoding desiderata in the learning process. We contend that the community
should aim at understanding the biases of already existing methods, as well as
aim to build new optimizers with the explicit intent of inducing certain
properties of the solution, rather than solely judging them based on their
convergence rates. We hope our arguments will inspire research to improve our
understanding of how the learning process can impact the type of solution we
converge to, and lead to a greater recognition of optimizers design as a
critical lever that complements the roles of architecture and data in shaping
model outcomes.

Conclusion: 该方法为提升AI的可信度和效率提供了新的硬件解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence has raised concerns
regarding its trustworthiness, especially in terms of interpretability and
robustness. Tree-based models like Random Forest and XGBoost excel in
interpretability and accuracy for tabular data, but scaling them remains
computationally expensive due to poor data locality and high data dependence.
Previous efforts to accelerate these models with analog content addressable
memory (CAM) have struggled, due to the fact that the difficult-to-implement
sharp decision boundaries are highly susceptible to device variations, which
leads to poor hardware performance and vulnerability to adversarial attacks.
This work presents a novel hardware-software co-design approach using $MoS_2$
Flash-based analog CAM with inherent soft boundaries, enabling efficient
inference with soft tree-based models. Our soft tree model inference
experiments on $MoS_2$ analog CAM arrays show this method achieves exceptional
robustness against device variation and adversarial attacks while achieving
state-of-the-art accuracy. Specifically, our fabricated analog CAM arrays
achieve $96\%$ accuracy on Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) database,
while maintaining decision explainability. Our experimentally calibrated model
validated only a $0.6\%$ accuracy drop on the MNIST dataset under $10\%$ device
threshold variation, compared to a $45.3\%$ drop for traditional decision
trees. This work paves the way for specialized hardware that enhances AI's
trustworthiness and efficiency.

Motivation: Address fairness concerns in archetypal analysis by reducing sensitive group information in learned projections.

Method: Proposes FairAA with a fairness regularization term and FairKernelAA for nonlinear data. Evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Result: Reduces group separability without significantly compromising explained variance, achieving a utility-fairness trade-off.

Conclusion: FairAA is a promising tool for responsible representation learning in sensitive applications.

Abstract: Archetypal Analysis (AA) is an unsupervised learning method that represents
data as convex combinations of extreme patterns called archetypes. While AA
provides interpretable and low-dimensional representations, it can
inadvertently encode sensitive attributes, leading to fairness concerns. In
this work, we propose Fair Archetypal Analysis (FairAA), a modified formulation
that explicitly reduces the influence of sensitive group information in the
learned projections. We also introduce FairKernelAA, a nonlinear extension that
addresses fairness in more complex data distributions. Our approach
incorporates a fairness regularization term while preserving the structure and
interpretability of the archetypes. We evaluate FairAA and FairKernelAA on
synthetic datasets, including linear, nonlinear, and multi-group scenarios,
demonstrating their ability to reduce group separability -- as measured by mean
maximum discrepancy and linear separability -- without substantially
compromising explained variance. We further validate our methods on the
real-world ANSUR I dataset, confirming their robustness and practical utility.
The results show that FairAA achieves a favorable trade-off between utility and
fairness, making it a promising tool for responsible representation learning in
sensitive applications.

Abstract: Event time series are sequences of discrete events occurring at irregular
time intervals, each associated with a domain-specific observational modality.
They are common in domains such as high-energy astrophysics, computational
social science, cybersecurity, finance, healthcare, neuroscience, and
seismology. Their unstructured and irregular structure poses significant
challenges for extracting meaningful patterns and identifying salient phenomena
using conventional techniques. We propose novel two- and three-dimensional
tensor representations for event time series, coupled with sparse autoencoders
that learn physically meaningful latent representations. These embeddings
support a variety of downstream tasks, including anomaly detection,
similarity-based retrieval, semantic clustering, and unsupervised
classification. We demonstrate our approach on a real-world dataset from X-ray
astronomy, showing that these representations successfully capture temporal and
spectral signatures and isolate diverse classes of X-ray transients. Our
framework offers a flexible, scalable, and generalizable solution for analyzing
complex, irregular event time series across scientific and industrial domains.

Abstract: As deep generative models proliferate across the AI landscape, industrial
practitioners still face critical yet unanswered questions about which deep
generative models best suit complex manufacturing design tasks. This work
addresses this question through a complete study of five representative models
(Variational Autoencoder, Generative Adversarial Network, multimodal
Variational Autoencoder, Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model, and
Multinomial Diffusion Model) on industrial tire architecture generation. Our
evaluation spans three key industrial scenarios: (i) unconditional generation
of complete multi-component designs, (ii) component-conditioned generation
(reconstructing architectures from partial observations), and (iii)
dimension-constrained generation (creating designs that satisfy specific
dimensional requirements). To enable discrete diffusion models to handle
conditional scenarios, we introduce categorical inpainting, a mask-aware
reverse diffusion process that preserves known labels without requiring
additional training. Our evaluation employs geometry-aware metrics specifically
calibrated for industrial requirements, quantifying spatial coherence,
component interaction, structural connectivity, and perceptual fidelity. Our
findings reveal that diffusion models achieve the strongest overall
performance; a masking-trained VAE nonetheless outperforms the multimodal
variant MMVAE\textsuperscript{+} on nearly all component-conditioned metrics,
and within the diffusion family MDM leads in-distribution whereas DDPM
generalises better to out-of-distribution dimensional constraints.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training on decentralized
data without exposing raw data. However, the evaluation phase in FL may leak
sensitive information through shared performance metrics. In this paper, we
propose a novel protocol that incorporates Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to
enable privacy-preserving and verifiable evaluation for FL. Instead of
revealing raw loss values, clients generate a succinct proof asserting that
their local loss is below a predefined threshold. Our approach is implemented
without reliance on external APIs, using self-contained modules for federated
learning simulation, ZKP circuit design, and experimental evaluation on both
the MNIST and Human Activity Recognition (HAR) datasets. We focus on a
threshold-based proof for a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model
(for MNIST) and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model (for HAR), and evaluate
the approach in terms of computational overhead, communication cost, and
verifiability.

Abstract: We introduce a new framework of episodic tabular Markov decision processes
(MDPs) with adversarial preferences, which we refer to as preference-based MDPs
(PbMDPs). Unlike standard episodic MDPs with adversarial losses, where the
numerical value of the loss is directly observed, in PbMDPs the learner instead
observes preferences between two candidate arms, which represent the choices
being compared. In this work, we focus specifically on the setting where the
reward functions are determined by Borda scores. We begin by establishing a
regret lower bound for PbMDPs with Borda scores. As a preliminary step, we
present a simple instance to prove a lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{HSAT})$ for
episodic MDPs with adversarial losses, where $H$ is the number of steps per
episode, $S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the number of actions, and $T$ is
the number of episodes. Leveraging this construction, we then derive a regret
lower bound of $\Omega( (H^2 S K)^{1/3} T^{2/3} )$ for PbMDPs with Borda
scores, where $K$ is the number of arms. Next, we develop algorithms that
achieve a regret bound of order $T^{2/3}$. We first propose a global
optimization approach based on online linear optimization over the set of all
occupancy measures, achieving a regret bound of $\tilde{O}((H^2 S^2 K)^{1/3}
T^{2/3} )$ under known transitions. However, this approach suffers from
suboptimal dependence on the potentially large number of states $S$ and
computational inefficiency. To address this, we propose a policy optimization
algorithm whose regret is roughly bounded by $\tilde{O}( (H^6 S K^5)^{1/3}
T^{2/3} )$ under known transitions, and further extend the result to the
unknown-transition setting.

Abstract: Graphs Neural Networks (GNNs) demonstrate high-performance on the link
prediction (LP) task. However, these models often rely on all dataset samples
being drawn from the same distribution. In addition, graph generative models
(GGMs) show a pronounced ability to generate novel output graphs. Despite this,
GGM applications remain largely limited to domain-specific tasks. To bridge
this gap, we propose FLEX as a GGM framework which leverages two mechanism: (1)
structurally-conditioned graph generation, and (2) adversarial co-training
between an auto-encoder and GNN. As such, FLEX ensures structural-alignment
between sample distributions to enhance link-prediction performance in
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Notably, FLEX does not require expert
knowledge to function in different OOD scenarios. Numerous experiments are
conducted in synthetic and real-world OOD settings to demonstrate FLEX's
performance-enhancing ability, with further analysis for understanding the
effects of graph data augmentation on link structures. The source code is

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful framework for a wide
range of node-level graph learning tasks. However, their performance is often
constrained by reliance on random or minimally informed initial feature
representations, which can lead to slow convergence and suboptimal solutions.
In this paper, we leverage a statistically grounded method, one-hot graph
encoder embedding (GEE), to generate high-quality initial node features that
enhance the end-to-end training of GNNs. We refer to this integrated framework
as the GEE-powered GNN (GG), and demonstrate its effectiveness through
extensive simulations and real-world experiments across both unsupervised and
supervised settings. In node clustering, GG consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance, ranking first across all evaluated real-world
datasets, while exhibiting faster convergence compared to the standard GNN. For
node classification, we further propose an enhanced variant, GG-C, which
concatenates the outputs of GG and GEE and outperforms competing baselines.
These results confirm the importance of principled, structure-aware feature
initialization in realizing the full potential of GNNs.

Abstract: Learning with noisy labels (LNL) is essential for training deep neural
networks with imperfect data. Meta-learning approaches have achieved success by
using a clean unbiased labeled set to train a robust model. However, this
approach heavily depends on the availability of a clean labeled meta-dataset,
which is difficult to obtain in practice. In this work, we thus tackle the
challenge of meta-learning for noisy label scenarios without relying on a clean
labeled dataset. Our approach leverages the data itself while bypassing the
need for labels. Building on the insight that clean samples effectively
preserve the consistency of related data structures across the last hidden and
the final layer, whereas noisy samples disrupt this consistency, we design the
Cross-layer Information Divergence-based Meta Update Strategy (CLID-MU).
CLID-MU leverages the alignment of data structures across these diverse feature
spaces to evaluate model performance and use this alignment to guide training.
Experiments on benchmark datasets with varying amounts of labels under both
synthetic and real-world noise demonstrate that CLID-MU outperforms
state-of-the-art methods. The code is released at

individual review for maximum control, smart batch processing for large

morphism, enhancing clarity, modularity, and extensibility. As proof of
concept, we generate and benchmark two novel datasets-\textit{Tree-MNIST} and

Abstract: Lightweight inference is critical for biomolecular structure prediction and
other downstream tasks, enabling efficient real-world deployment and
inference-time scaling for large-scale applications. In this work, we address
the challenge of balancing model efficiency and prediction accuracy by making
several key modifications, 1) Multi-step AF3 sampler is replaced by a few-step
ODE sampler, significantly reducing computational overhead for the diffusion
module part during inference; 2) In the open-source Protenix framework, a
subset of pairformer or diffusion transformer blocks doesn't make contributions
to the final structure prediction, presenting opportunities for architectural
pruning and lightweight redesign; 3) A model incorporating an ESM module is
trained to substitute the conventional MSA module, reducing MSA preprocessing
time. Building on these key insights, we present Protenix-Mini, a compact and
optimized model designed for efficient protein structure prediction. This
streamlined version incorporates a more efficient architectural design with a
two-step Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) sampling strategy. By eliminating
redundant Transformer components and refining the sampling process,
Protenix-Mini significantly reduces model complexity with slight accuracy drop.
Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that it achieves high-fidelity
predictions, with only a negligible 1 to 5 percent decrease in performance on
benchmark datasets compared to its full-scale counterpart. This makes
Protenix-Mini an ideal choice for applications where computational resources
are limited but accurate structure prediction remains crucial.

Abstract: We study the generalized linear bandit (GLB) problem, a contextual
multi-armed bandit framework that extends the classical linear model by
incorporating a non-linear link function, thereby modeling a broad class of
reward distributions such as Bernoulli and Poisson. While GLBs are widely
applicable to real-world scenarios, their non-linear nature introduces
significant challenges in achieving both computational and statistical
efficiency. Existing methods typically trade off between two objectives, either
incurring high per-round costs for optimal regret guarantees or compromising
statistical efficiency to enable constant-time updates. In this paper, we
propose a jointly efficient algorithm that attains a nearly optimal regret
bound with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time and space complexities per round. The core of
our method is a tight confidence set for the online mirror descent (OMD)
estimator, which is derived through a novel analysis that leverages the notion
of mix loss from online prediction. The analysis shows that our OMD estimator,
even with its one-pass updates, achieves statistical efficiency comparable to
maximum likelihood estimation, thereby leading to a jointly efficient
optimistic method.

Result: 链式方法表现更优，Meta-IR在42种配置中均优于基线。

Conclusion: Meta-IR为零样本不平衡回归任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Imbalanced problems are prevalent in various real-world scenarios and are
extensively explored in classification tasks. However, they also present
challenges for regression tasks due to the rarity of certain target values. A
common alternative is to employ balancing algorithms in preprocessing to
address dataset imbalance. However, due to the variety of resampling methods
and learning models, determining the optimal solution requires testing many
combinations. Furthermore, the learning model, dataset, and evaluation metric
affect the best strategies. This work proposes the Meta-learning for Imbalanced
Regression (Meta-IR) framework, which diverges from existing literature by
training meta-classifiers to recommend the best pipeline composed of the
resampling strategy and learning model per task in a zero-shot fashion. The
meta-classifiers are trained using a set of meta-features to learn how to map
the meta-features to the classes indicating the best pipeline. We propose two
formulations: Independent and Chained. Independent trains the meta-classifiers
to separately indicate the best learning algorithm and resampling strategy.
Chained involves a sequential procedure where the output of one meta-classifier
is used as input for another to model intrinsic relationship factors. The
Chained scenario showed superior performance, suggesting a relationship between
the learning algorithm and the resampling strategy per task. Compared with
AutoML frameworks, Meta-IR obtained better results. Moreover, compared with
baselines of six learning algorithms and six resampling algorithms plus no
resampling, totaling 42 (6 X 7) configurations, Meta-IR outperformed all of
them. The code, data, and further information of the experiments can be found

Conclusion: 多轮RL在CUDA内核优化中有效，串行细化比并行采样更有益。

Abstract: Writing GPU kernels is a challenging task and critical for AI systems'
efficiency. It is also highly iterative: domain experts write code and improve
performance through execution feedback. Moreover, it presents verifiable
rewards like correctness and speedup, making it a natural environment to apply
Reinforcement Learning (RL). To explicitly incorporate the iterative nature of
this process into training, we develop a flexible multi-turn RL recipe that
addresses unique challenges encountered in real-world settings, such as
learning from long trajectories and effective reward attribution across turns.
We present Kevin - K(ernel D)evin, the first model trained with multi-turn RL
for CUDA kernel generation and optimization. In our evaluation setup, Kevin
shows significant gains over its base model (QwQ-32B), improving correctness of
generated kernels (in pure CUDA) from 56% to 82% and mean speedup from 0.53x to
1.10x of baseline (PyTorch Eager), and surpassing frontier models like o4-mini
(0.78x). Finally, we study its behavior across test-time scaling axes: we found
scaling serial refinement more beneficial than parallel sampling. In
particular, when given more refinement turns, Kevin shows a higher rate of
improvement.

Result: 实验表明，DUSE在类别平衡和不平衡场景下均优于8种核心集选择基线方法，并展现出对未见模型的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: DUSE为解决数据稀缺问题提供了一种有效方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Although deep neural networks have made remarkable achievements in the field
of automatic modulation recognition (AMR), these models often require a large
amount of labeled data for training. However, in many practical scenarios, the
available target domain data is scarce and difficult to meet the needs of model
training. The most direct way is to collect data manually and perform expert
annotation, but the high time and labor costs are unbearable. Another common
method is data augmentation. Although it can enrich training samples to a
certain extent, it does not introduce new data and therefore cannot
fundamentally solve the problem of data scarcity. To address these challenges,
we introduce a data expansion framework called Dynamic Uncertainty-driven
Sample Expansion (DUSE). Specifically, DUSE uses an uncertainty scoring
function to filter out useful samples from relevant AMR datasets and employs an
active learning strategy to continuously refine the scorer. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that DUSE consistently outperforms 8 coreset selection
baselines in both class-balance and class-imbalance settings. Besides, DUSE
exhibits strong cross-architecture generalization for unseen models.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) has emerged as a dominant paradigm for acquiring
knowledge from sequential tasks while avoiding catastrophic forgetting.
Although many CL methods have been proposed to show impressive empirical
performance, the theoretical understanding of their generalization behavior
remains limited, particularly for replay-based approaches. In this paper, we
establish a unified theoretical framework for replay-based CL, deriving a
series of information-theoretic bounds that explicitly characterize how the
memory buffer interacts with the current task to affect generalization.
Specifically, our hypothesis-based bounds reveal that utilizing the limited
exemplars of previous tasks alongside the current task data, rather than
exhaustive replay, facilitates improved generalization while effectively
mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, our prediction-based bounds
yield tighter and computationally tractable upper bounds of the generalization
gap through the use of low-dimensional variables. Our analysis is general and
broadly applicable to a wide range of learning algorithms, exemplified by
stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) as a representative method.
Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our
derived bounds in capturing the generalization dynamics in replay-based CL
settings.

Abstract: FourCastNet 3 advances global weather modeling by implementing a scalable,

The approach is designed to respect spherical geometry and to accurately model
the spatially correlated probabilistic nature of the problem, resulting in
stable spectra and realistic dynamics across multiple scales. FourCastNet 3
delivers forecasting accuracy that surpasses leading conventional ensemble
models and rivals the best diffusion-based methods, while producing forecasts 8

FourCastNet 3 demonstrates excellent probabilistic calibration and retains
realistic spectra, even at extended lead times of up to 60 days. All of these
advances are realized using a purely convolutional neural network architecture
tailored for spherical geometry. Scalable and efficient large-scale training on
1024 GPUs and more is enabled by a novel training paradigm for combined model-
and data-parallelism, inspired by domain decomposition methods in classical
numerical models. Additionally, FourCastNet 3 enables rapid inference on a
single GPU, producing a 90-day global forecast at 0.25{\deg}, 6-hourly
resolution in under 20 seconds. Its computational efficiency, medium-range
probabilistic skill, spectral fidelity, and rollout stability at subseasonal
timescales make it a strong candidate for improving meteorological forecasting

Conclusion: 该工作为3D环境感知通信研究提供了基础数据集和基准。

Abstract: Radio maps (RMs) serve as a critical foundation for enabling
environment-aware wireless communication, as they provide the spatial
distribution of wireless channel characteristics. Despite recent progress in RM
construction using data-driven approaches, most existing methods focus solely
on pathloss prediction in a fixed 2D plane, neglecting key parameters such as
direction of arrival (DoA), time of arrival (ToA), and vertical spatial
variations. Such a limitation is primarily due to the reliance on static
learning paradigms, which hinder generalization beyond the training data
distribution. To address these challenges, we propose UrbanRadio3D, a
large-scale, high-resolution 3D RM dataset constructed via ray tracing in
realistic urban environments. UrbanRadio3D is over 37$\times$3 larger than
previous datasets across a 3D space with 3 metrics as pathloss, DoA, and ToA,
forming a novel 3D$\times$33D dataset with 7$\times$3 more height layers than
prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) dataset. To benchmark 3D RM construction, a UNet
with 3D convolutional operators is proposed. Moreover, we further introduce
RadioDiff-3D, a diffusion-model-based generative framework utilizing the 3D
convolutional architecture. RadioDiff-3D supports both radiation-aware
scenarios with known transmitter locations and radiation-unaware settings based
on sparse spatial observations. Extensive evaluations on UrbanRadio3D validate
that RadioDiff-3D achieves superior performance in constructing rich,
high-dimensional radio maps under diverse environmental dynamics. This work
provides a foundational dataset and benchmark for future research in 3D
environment-aware communication. The dataset is available at

Abstract: Unsupervised classification is a fundamental machine learning problem.
Real-world data often contain imperfections, characterized by uncertainty and
imprecision, which are not well handled by traditional methods. Evidential
clustering, based on Dempster-Shafer theory, addresses these challenges. This
paper explores the underexplored problem of explaining evidential clustering
results, which is crucial for high-stakes domains such as healthcare. Our
analysis shows that, in the general case, representativity is a necessary and
sufficient condition for decision trees to serve as abductive explainers.
Building on the concept of representativity, we generalize this idea to
accommodate partial labeling through utility functions. These functions enable
the representation of "tolerable" mistakes, leading to the definition of
evidential mistakeness as explanation cost and the construction of explainers
tailored to evidential classifiers. Finally, we propose the Iterative
Evidential Mistake Minimization (IEMM) algorithm, which provides interpretable
and cautious decision tree explanations for evidential clustering functions. We
validate the proposed algorithm on synthetic and real-world data. Taking into
account the decision-maker's preferences, we were able to provide an
explanation that was satisfactory up to 93% of the time.

Conclusion: TuneQn有效平衡了模型性能和大小，适用于不同硬件。

Abstract: Quantization is a process that reduces the precision of deep neural network
models to lower model size and computational demands, often at the cost of
accuracy. However, fully quantized models may exhibit sub-optimal performance
below acceptable levels and face deployment challenges on low-end hardware
accelerators due to practical constraints. To address these issues,
quantization can be selectively applied to only a subset of layers, but
selecting which layers to exclude is non-trivial. To this direction, we propose
TuneQn, a suite enabling selective quantization, deployment and execution of
ONNX models across various CPU and GPU devices, combined with profiling and
multi-objective optimization. TuneQn generates selectively quantized ONNX
models, deploys them on different hardware, measures performance on metrics
like accuracy and size, performs Pareto Front minimization to identify the best
model candidate and visualizes the results. To demonstrate the effectiveness of
TuneQn, we evaluated TuneQn on four ONNX models with two quantization settings
across CPU and GPU devices. As a result, we demonstrated that our utility
effectively performs selective quantization and tuning, selecting ONNX model
candidates with up to a $54.14$% reduction in accuracy loss compared to the
fully quantized model, and up to a $72.9$% model size reduction compared to the

Abstract: The data privacy constraint in online continual learning (OCL), where the
data can be seen only once, complicates the catastrophic forgetting problem in
streaming data. A common approach applied by the current SOTAs in OCL is with
the use of memory saving exemplars or features from previous classes to be
replayed in the current task. On the other hand, the prompt-based approach
performs excellently in continual learning but with the cost of a growing
number of trainable parameters. The first approach may not be applicable in
practice due to data openness policy, while the second approach has the issue
of throughput associated with the streaming data. In this study, we propose a
novel prompt-based method for online continual learning that includes 4 main
components: (1) single light-weight prompt generator as a general knowledge,
(2) trainable scaler-and-shifter as specific knowledge, (3) pre-trained model
(PTM) generalization preserving, and (4) hard-soft updates mechanism. Our
proposed method achieves significantly higher performance than the current
SOTAs in CIFAR100, ImageNet-R, ImageNet-A, and CUB dataset. Our complexity
analysis shows that our method requires a relatively smaller number of
parameters and achieves moderate training time, inference time, and throughput.

combinatorial complexes (CCs), enabling efficient computation of heat kernels
that serve as node descriptors. Our approach captures multiscale information

  Theoretically, the proposed method is maximally expressive because it can
distinguish arbitrary non-isomorphic CCs. Empirically, it significantly
outperforms existing topological methods in terms of computational efficiency.
Besides demonstrating competitive performance with the state-of-the-art
descriptors on standard molecular datasets, it exhibits superior capability in
distinguishing complex topological structures and avoiding blind spots on
topological benchmarks. Overall, this work advances topological deep learning

Abstract: In many critical applications, resource constraints limit the amount of
information that can be gathered to make predictions. For example, in
healthcare, patient data often spans diverse features ranging from lab tests to
imaging studies. Each feature may carry different information and must be
acquired at a respective cost of time, money, or risk to the patient. Moreover,
temporal prediction tasks, where both instance features and labels evolve over
time, introduce additional complexity in deciding when or what information is
important. In this work, we propose NOCTA, a Non-Greedy Objective Cost-Tradeoff
Acquisition method that sequentially acquires the most informative features at
inference time while accounting for both temporal dynamics and acquisition
cost. We first introduce a cohesive estimation target for our NOCTA setting,
and then develop two complementary estimators: 1) a non-parametric method based
on nearest neighbors to guide the acquisition (NOCTA-NP), and 2) a parametric
method that directly predicts the utility of potential acquisitions (NOCTA-P).
Experiments on synthetic and real-world medical datasets demonstrate that both
NOCTA variants outperform existing baselines.

Result: 在IHDP数据集和模拟生存数据上，TDA减少了偏差并提高了覆盖率。

Conclusion: TDA为复杂多参数目标的深度架构提供了严格的因果推断路径。

Abstract: Modern deep neural networks are powerful predictive tools yet often lack
valid inference for causal parameters, such as treatment effects or entire
survival curves. While frameworks like Double Machine Learning (DML) and
Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) can debias machine-learning fits,
existing neural implementations either rely on "targeted losses" that do not
guarantee solving the efficient influence function equation or computationally
expensive post-hoc "fluctuations" for multi-parameter settings. We propose
Targeted Deep Architectures (TDA), a new framework that embeds TMLE directly
into the network's parameter space with no restrictions on the backbone
architecture. Specifically, TDA partitions model parameters - freezing all but
a small "targeting" subset - and iteratively updates them along a targeting
gradient, derived from projecting the influence functions onto the span of the
gradients of the loss with respect to weights. This procedure yields plug-in
estimates that remove first-order bias and produce asymptotically valid
confidence intervals. Crucially, TDA easily extends to multi-dimensional causal
estimands (e.g., entire survival curves) by merging separate targeting
gradients into a single universal targeting update. Theoretically, TDA inherits
classical TMLE properties, including double robustness and semiparametric
efficiency. Empirically, on the benchmark IHDP dataset (average treatment
effects) and simulated survival data with informative censoring, TDA reduces
bias and improves coverage relative to both standard neural-network estimators
and prior post-hoc approaches. In doing so, TDA establishes a direct, scalable
pathway toward rigorous causal inference within modern deep architectures for

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级的贝叶斯激励机制，用于联邦学习中的主动防御数据投毒攻击，通过经济激励确保良性客户参与并抑制恶意行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习的开放参与特性使其容易受到数据投毒攻击，现有防御方法多为被动且计算昂贵。本文旨在提出一种主动、经济高效的防御机制。

Method: 设计了一个贝叶斯不完全信息博弈模型，服务器使用小型验证数据集评估更新质量并发放奖励，满足个体理性（IR）和激励相容性（IC）。

Result: 在MNIST和FashionMNIST的非独立同分布数据上，即使50%的标签翻转攻击下，机制仍保持96.7%的准确率，显著优于标准FedAvg。

Conclusion: 该机制计算轻量、预算有限，易于集成到现有联邦学习框架中，为经济稳健和可持续的联邦学习生态系统提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized clients while preserving data privacy. However, its
open-participation nature exposes it to data-poisoning attacks, in which
malicious actors submit corrupted model updates to degrade the global model.
Existing defenses are often reactive, relying on statistical aggregation rules
that can be computationally expensive and that typically assume an honest
majority. This paper introduces a proactive, economic defense: a lightweight
Bayesian incentive mechanism that makes malicious behavior economically
irrational. Each training round is modeled as a Bayesian game of incomplete
information in which the server, acting as the principal, uses a small, private
validation dataset to verify update quality before issuing payments. The design
satisfies Individual Rationality (IR) for benevolent clients, ensuring their
participation is profitable, and Incentive Compatibility (IC), making poisoning
an economically dominated strategy. Extensive experiments on non-IID partitions
of MNIST and FashionMNIST demonstrate robustness: with 50% label-flipping
adversaries on MNIST, the mechanism maintains 96.7% accuracy, only 0.3
percentage points lower than in a scenario with 30% label-flipping adversaries.
This outcome is 51.7 percentage points better than standard FedAvg, which
collapses under the same 50% attack. The mechanism is computationally light,
budget-bounded, and readily integrates into existing FL frameworks, offering a
practical route to economically robust and sustainable FL ecosystems.

Abstract: In automated machine learning, scientific discovery, and other applications
of Bayesian optimization, deciding when to stop evaluating expensive black-box
functions is an important practical consideration. While several adaptive
stopping rules have been proposed, in the cost-aware setting they lack
guarantees ensuring they stop before incurring excessive function evaluation
costs. We propose a cost-aware stopping rule for Bayesian optimization that
adapts to varying evaluation costs and is free of heuristic tuning. Our rule is
grounded in a theoretical connection to state-of-the-art cost-aware acquisition
functions, namely the Pandora's Box Gittins Index (PBGI) and log expected
improvement per cost. We prove a theoretical guarantee bounding the expected
cumulative evaluation cost incurred by our stopping rule when paired with these
two acquisition functions. In experiments on synthetic and empirical tasks,
including hyperparameter optimization and neural architecture size search, we
show that combining our stopping rule with the PBGI acquisition function
consistently matches or outperforms other acquisition-function--stopping-rule
pairs in terms of cost-adjusted simple regret, a metric capturing trade-offs
between solution quality and cumulative evaluation cost.

Abstract: Universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) have emerged as
powerful tools for accelerating atomistic simulations, offering scalable and
efficient modeling with accuracy close to quantum calculations. However, their
reliability and effectiveness in practical, real-world applications remain an
open question. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and related nanoporous materials
are highly porous crystals with critical relevance in carbon capture, energy
storage, and catalysis applications. Modeling nanoporous materials presents
distinct challenges for uMLIPs due to their diverse chemistry, structural
complexity, including porosity and coordination bonds, and the absence from
existing training datasets. Here, we introduce MOFSimBench, a benchmark to
evaluate uMLIPs on key materials modeling tasks for nanoporous materials,
including structural optimization, molecular dynamics (MD) stability, the
prediction of bulk properties, such as bulk modulus and heat capacity, and
guest-host interactions. Evaluating over 20 models from various architectures
on a chemically and structurally diverse materials set, we find that
top-performing uMLIPs consistently outperform classical force fields and
fine-tuned machine learning potentials across all tasks, demonstrating their
readiness for deployment in nanoporous materials modeling. Our analysis
highlights that data quality, particularly the diversity of training sets and
inclusion of out-of-equilibrium conformations, plays a more critical role than
model architecture in determining performance across all evaluated uMLIPs. We
release our modular and extendable benchmarking framework at
https://github.com/AI4ChemS/mofsim-bench, providing an open resource to guide
the adoption for nanoporous materials modeling and further development of

Conclusion: d-DQIVAR为数据质量改进提供了实用工具，尤其适用于需要结合数据与流程驱动的场景。

Abstract: Approaches to enhancing data quality (DQ) are classified into two main
categories: data- and process-driven. However, prior research has predominantly
utilized batch data preprocessing within the data-driven framework, which often
proves insufficient for optimizing machine learning (ML) model performance and
frequently leads to distortions in data characteristics. Existing studies have
primarily focused on data preprocessing rather than genuine data quality
improvement (DQI). In this paper, we introduce d-DQIVAR, a novel visual
analytics system designed to facilitate DQI strategies aimed at improving ML
model performance. Our system integrates visual analytics techniques that
leverage both data-driven and process-driven approaches. Data-driven techniques
tackle DQ issues such as imputation, outlier detection, deletion, format
standardization, removal of duplicate records, and feature selection.
Process-driven strategies encompass evaluating DQ and DQI procedures by
considering DQ dimensions and ML model performance and applying the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. We illustrate how our system empowers users to harness
expert and domain knowledge effectively within a practical workflow through
case studies, evaluations, and user studies.

Abstract: Selecting the appropriate dimensionality reduction (DR) technique and
determining its optimal hyperparameter settings that maximize the accuracy of
the output projections typically involves extensive trial and error, often
resulting in unnecessary computational overhead. To address this challenge, we
propose a dataset-adaptive approach to DR optimization guided by structural
complexity metrics. These metrics quantify the intrinsic complexity of a
dataset, predicting whether higher-dimensional spaces are necessary to
represent it accurately. Since complex datasets are often inaccurately
represented in two-dimensional projections, leveraging these metrics enables us
to predict the maximum achievable accuracy of DR techniques for a given
dataset, eliminating redundant trials in optimizing DR. We introduce the design
and theoretical foundations of these structural complexity metrics. We
quantitatively verify that our metrics effectively approximate the ground truth
complexity of datasets and confirm their suitability for guiding
dataset-adaptive DR workflow. Finally, we empirically show that our
dataset-adaptive workflow significantly enhances the efficiency of DR
optimization without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: This article presents the current state of ML-security and of the
documentation of ML-based systems, models and datasets in research and practice
based on an extensive review of the existing literature. It shows a generally
low awareness of security aspects among ML-practitioners and organizations and
an often unstandardized approach to documentation, leading to overall low

to these factors, there is a clear need for improved security documentation in

Abstract: In recent years, various artificial intelligence-based surrogate models have
been proposed to provide rapid manufacturability predictions of material
forming processes. However, traditional AI-based surrogate models, typically
built with scalar or image-based neural networks, are limited in their ability
to capture complex 3D spatial relationships and to operate in a
permutation-invariant manner. To overcome these issues, emerging graph-based
surrogate models are developed using graph neural networks. This study
developed a new graph neural network surrogate model named Recurrent U
Net-based Graph Neural Network (RUGNN). The RUGNN model can achieve accurate
predictions of sheet material deformation fields across multiple forming
timesteps. The RUGNN model incorporates Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to model
temporal dynamics and a U-Net inspired graph-based downsample/upsample
mechanism to handle spatial long-range dependencies. A novel 'node-to-surface'
contact representation method was proposed, offering significant improvements
in computational efficiency for large-scale contact interactions. The RUGNN
model was validated using a cold forming case study and a more complex hot
forming case study using aluminium alloys. Results demonstrate that the RUGNN
model provides accurate deformation predictions closely matching ground truth
FE simulations and outperforming several baseline GNN architectures. Model
tuning was also performed to identify suitable hyperparameters, training
strategies, and input feature representations. These results demonstrate that
RUGNN is a reliable approach to support sheet material forming design by
enabling accurate manufacturability predictions.

Abstract: Objective: To develop and evaluate machine learning (ML) models for

SurgeryLSTM, a masked bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) with an
attention, using structured perioperative electronic health records (EHR) data.
Performance was evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R2), and key
predictors were identified using explainable AI. Results: SurgeryLSTM achieved
the highest predictive accuracy (R2=0.86), outperforming XGBoost (R2 = 0.85)
and baseline models. The attention mechanism improved interpretability by
dynamically identifying influential temporal segments within preoperative
clinical sequences, allowing clinicians to trace which events or features most
contributed to each LOS prediction. Key predictors of LOS included bone
disorder, chronic kidney disease, and lumbar fusion identified as the most
impactful predictors of LOS. Discussion: Temporal modeling with attention
mechanisms significantly improves LOS prediction by capturing the sequential
nature of patient data. Unlike static models, SurgeryLSTM provides both higher
accuracy and greater interpretability, which are critical for clinical
adoption. These results highlight the potential of integrating attention-based
temporal models into hospital planning workflows. Conclusion: SurgeryLSTM
presents an effective and interpretable AI solution for LOS prediction in
elective spine surgery. Our findings support the integration of temporal,
explainable ML approaches into clinical decision support systems to enhance
discharge readiness and individualized patient care.

Fields enable the derivation of physical quantities via automatic
differentiation. However, unlike conventional neural fields (e.g., signed
distance, occupancy, or radiance fields), Einstein Fields are \emph{Neural
Tensor Fields} with the key difference that when encoding the spacetime
geometry of general relativity into neural field representations, dynamics
emerge naturally as a byproduct. Einstein Fields show remarkable potential,
including continuum modeling of 4D spacetime, mesh-agnosticity, storage
efficiency, derivative accuracy, and ease of use. We address these challenges

Abstract: The Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) is a method for
discovering nonlinear dynamical system models from data. Quantifying
uncertainty in SINDy models is essential for assessing their reliability,
particularly in safety-critical applications. While various uncertainty
quantification methods exist for SINDy, including Bayesian and ensemble
approaches, this work explores the integration of Conformal Prediction, a
framework that can provide valid prediction intervals with coverage guarantees
based on minimal assumptions like data exchangeability. We introduce three
applications of conformal prediction with Ensemble-SINDy (E-SINDy): (1)
quantifying uncertainty in time series prediction, (2) model selection based on
library feature importance, and (3) quantifying the uncertainty of identified
model coefficients using feature conformal prediction. We demonstrate the three
applications on stochastic predator-prey dynamics and several chaotic dynamical
systems. We show that conformal prediction methods integrated with E-SINDy can
reliably achieve desired target coverage for time series forecasting,
effectively quantify feature importance, and produce more robust uncertainty
intervals for model coefficients, even under non-Gaussian noise, compared to
standard E-SINDy coefficient estimates.

Abstract: Accurately predicting drug-target interactions (DTIs) is pivotal for
advancing drug discovery and target validation techniques. While machine
learning approaches including those that are based on Graph Neural Networks
(GNN) have achieved notable success in DTI prediction, many of them have
difficulties in effectively integrating the diverse features of drugs, targets
and their interactions. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel
framework to take advantage of the power of both transductive learning and
inductive learning so that features at molecular level and drug-target
interaction network level can be exploited. Within this framework is a
GNN-based model called Graph-in-Graph (GiG) that represents graphs of drug and
target molecular structures as meta-nodes in a drug-target interaction graph,
enabling a detailed exploration of their intricate relationships. To evaluate
the proposed model, we have compiled a special benchmark comprising drug
SMILES, protein sequences, and their interaction data, which is interesting in
its own right. Our experimental results demonstrate that the GiG model
significantly outperforms existing approaches across all evaluation metrics,
highlighting the benefits of integrating different learning paradigms and
interaction data.

Abstract: Generating stable molecular conformations is crucial in several drug
discovery applications, such as estimating the binding affinity of a molecule
to a target. Recently, generative machine learning methods have emerged as a
promising, more efficient method than molecular dynamics for sampling of
conformations from the Boltzmann distribution. In this paper, we introduce
Torsional-GFN, a conditional GFlowNet specifically designed to sample
conformations of molecules proportionally to their Boltzmann distribution,
using only a reward function as training signal. Conditioned on a molecular
graph and its local structure (bond lengths and angles), Torsional-GFN samples
rotations of its torsion angles. Our results demonstrate that Torsional-GFN is
able to sample conformations approximately proportional to the Boltzmann
distribution for multiple molecules with a single model, and allows for
zero-shot generalization to unseen bond lengths and angles coming from the MD
simulations for such molecules. Our work presents a promising avenue for
scaling the proposed approach to larger molecular systems, achieving zero-shot
generalization to unseen molecules, and including the generation of the local
structure into the GFlowNet model.

Abstract: Latent space interpolations are a powerful tool for navigating deep
generative models in applied settings. An example is single-cell RNA
sequencing, where existing methods model cellular state transitions as latent
space interpolations with variational autoencoders, often assuming linear
shifts and Euclidean geometry. However, unless explicitly enforced, linear
interpolations in the latent space may not correspond to geodesic paths on the
data manifold, limiting methods that assume Euclidean geometry in the data
representations. We introduce FlatVI, a novel training framework that
regularises the latent manifold of discrete-likelihood variational autoencoders
towards Euclidean geometry, specifically tailored for modelling single-cell
count data. By encouraging straight lines in the latent space to approximate
geodesic interpolations on the decoded single-cell manifold, FlatVI enhances
compatibility with downstream approaches that assume Euclidean latent geometry.
Experiments on synthetic data support the theoretical soundness of our
approach, while applications to time-resolved single-cell RNA sequencing data
demonstrate improved trajectory reconstruction and manifold interpolation.

small molecule graph and conformer generation, and the model delivers
competitive performance in zero-shot molecular linker design for protein ligand

Conclusion: HyperEvent在准确性和效率上均优于现有方法，适用于大规模动态图。

Abstract: Dynamic link prediction in continuous-time dynamic graphs is a fundamental
task for modeling evolving complex systems. Existing node-centric and
event-centric methods focus on individual interactions or atomic states,
failing to capture the structural cohesion of composite hyper-events, groups of
causally related events. To address this, we propose HyperEvent, a framework
reframing dynamic link prediction as hyper-event recognition. Central to
HyperEvent is the dynamic construction of an association sequence using event
correlation vectors. These vectors quantify pairwise dependencies between the
query event and relevant historical events, thereby characterizing the
structural cohesion of a potential hyper-event. The framework predicts the
occurrence of the query event by evaluating whether it collectively forms a
valid hyper-event with these historical events. Notably, HyperEvent outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on 4 out of 5 datasets in the official leaderboard.
For scalability, we further introduce an efficient parallel training algorithm
that segments large event streams to enable concurrent training. Experiments
validate HyperEvent's superior accuracy and efficiency on large-scale graphs.
Among which HyperEvent achieves a 6.95% improvement in Mean Reciprocal Rank
over state-of-the-art baseline on the large-scale Flight dataset while
utilizing only 10.17% of the training time.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of platform integration has emerged as an effective
solution to mitigate market fragmentation by consolidating multiple
ride-hailing platforms into a single application. To address heterogeneous
passenger preferences, third-party integrators provide Discount Express service
delivered by express drivers at lower trip fares. For the individual platform,
encouraging broader participation of drivers in Discount Express services has
the potential to expand the accessible demand pool and improve matching
efficiency, but often at the cost of reduced profit margins. This study aims to
dynamically manage drivers' acceptance of Discount Express from the perspective
of individual platforms. The lack of historical data under the new business
model necessitates online learning. However, early-stage exploration through
trial and error can be costly in practice, highlighting the need for reliable
early-stage performance in real-world deployment. To address these challenges,
this study formulates the decision regarding the proportion of drivers'
acceptance behavior as a continuous control task. In response to the high
stochasticity, the opaque matching mechanisms employed by third-party
integrator, and the limited availability of historical data, we propose a
policy-improved deep deterministic policy gradient (pi-DDPG) framework. The
proposed framework incorporates a refiner module to boost policy performance
during the early training phase, leverages a convolutional long short-term
memory network to effectively capture complex spatiotemporal patterns, and
adopts a prioritized experience replay mechanism to enhance learning
efficiency. A simulator based on a real-world dataset is developed to validate
the effectiveness of the proposed pi-DDPG. Numerical experiments demonstrate
that pi-DDPG achieves superior learning efficiency and significantly reduces
early-stage training losses.

Abstract: The mobility patterns of people in cities evolve alongside changes in land
use and population. This makes it crucial for urban planners to simulate and
analyze human mobility patterns for purposes such as transportation
optimization and sustainable urban development. Existing generative models
borrowed from machine learning rely heavily on historical trajectories and
often overlook evolving factors like changes in population density and land
use. Mechanistic approaches incorporate population density and facility
distribution but assume static scenarios, limiting their utility for future
projections where historical data for calibration is unavailable. This study
introduces a novel, data-driven approach for generating origin-destination
mobility flows tailored to simulated urban scenarios. Our method leverages
adaptive factors such as dynamic region sizes and land use archetypes, and it
utilizes conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) to blend
historical data with these adaptive parameters. The approach facilitates rapid
mobility flow generation with adjustable spatial granularity based on regions
of interest, without requiring extensive calibration data or complex behavior
modeling. The promising performance of our approach is demonstrated by its
application to mobile phone data from Singapore, and by its comparison with
existing methods.

Abstract: Many physical systems are described by partial differential equations (PDEs),
and solving these equations and estimating their coefficients or boundary
conditions (BCs) from observational data play a crucial role in understanding
the associated phenomena. Recently, a machine learning approach known as
physics-informed neural network, which solves PDEs using neural networks by
minimizing the sum of residuals from the PDEs, BCs, and data, has gained
significant attention in the scientific community. In this study, we
investigate a physics-informed linear model (PILM) that uses linear
combinations of basis functions to represent solutions, thereby enabling an
analytical representation of optimal solutions. The PILM was formulated and
verified for illustrative forward and inverse problems including cases with
uncertain BCs. Furthermore, the PILM was applied to estimate crustal strain
rates using geodetic data. Specifically, physical regularization that enforces
elastic equilibrium on the velocity fields was compared with mathematical
regularization that imposes smoothness constraints. From a Bayesian
perspective, mathematical regularization exhibited superior performance. The
PILM provides an analytically solvable framework applicable to linear forward
and inverse problems, underdetermined systems, and physical regularization.

Abstract: Exploring causal relationships in stochastic time series is a challenging yet
crucial task with a vast range of applications, including finance, economics,
neuroscience, and climate science. Many algorithms for Causal Discovery (CD)
have been proposed, but they often exhibit a high sensitivity to noise,
resulting in misleading causal inferences when applied to real data. In this
paper, we observe that the frequency spectra of typical real-world time series
follow a power-law distribution, notably due to an inherent self-organizing
behavior. Leveraging this insight, we build a robust CD method based on the
extraction of power -law spectral features that amplify genuine causal signals.
Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives on both
synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets with known causal structures,
demonstrating its robustness and practical relevance.

Abstract: Gaussian processes have become a popular tool for nonparametric regression
because of their flexibility and uncertainty quantification. However, they
often use stationary kernels, which limit the expressiveness of the model and
may be unsuitable for many datasets. We propose a framework that uses
nonstationary kernels whose parameters vary across the feature space, modeling
these parameters as the output of a neural network that takes the features as
input. The neural network and Gaussian process are trained jointly using the
chain rule to calculate derivatives. Our method clearly describes the behavior
of the nonstationary parameters and is compatible with approximation methods
for scaling to large datasets. It is flexible and easily adapts to different
nonstationary kernels without needing to redesign the optimization procedure.
Our methods are implemented with the GPyTorch library and can be readily
modified. We test a nonstationary variance and noise variant of our method on
several machine learning datasets and find that it achieves better accuracy and
log-score than both a stationary model and a hierarchical model approximated
with variational inference. Similar results are observed for a model with only
nonstationary variance. We also demonstrate our approach's ability to recover
the nonstationary parameters of a spatial dataset.

Abstract: Constructing confidence intervals for the value of an optimal treatment
policy is an important problem in causal inference. Insight into the optimal
policy value can guide the development of reward-maximizing, individualized
treatment regimes. However, because the functional that defines the optimal
value is non-differentiable, standard semi-parametric approaches for performing
inference fail to be directly applicable. Existing approaches for handling this
non-differentiability fall roughly into two camps. In one camp are estimators
based on constructing smooth approximations of the optimal value. These
approaches are computationally lightweight, but typically place unrealistic
parametric assumptions on outcome regressions. In another camp are approaches
that directly de-bias the non-smooth objective. These approaches don't place
parametric assumptions on nuisance functions, but they either require the
computation of intractably-many nuisance estimates, assume unrealistic
$L^\infty$ nuisance convergence rates, or make strong margin assumptions that
prohibit non-response to a treatment. In this paper, we revisit the problem of
constructing smooth approximations of non-differentiable functionals. By
carefully controlling first-order bias and second-order remainders, we show
that a softmax smoothing-based estimator can be used to estimate parameters
that are specified as a maximum of scores involving nuisance components. In
particular, this includes the value of the optimal treatment policy as a
special case. Our estimator obtains $\sqrt{n}$ convergence rates, avoids
parametric restrictions/unrealistic margin assumptions, and is often
statistically efficient.

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding models for brain-computer interfaces
(BCIs) struggle with cross-dataset learning and generalization due to channel
layout inconsistencies, non-stationary signal distributions, and limited
neurophysiological prior integration. To address these issues, we propose a
plug-and-play Alignment-Based Frame-Patch Modeling (AFPM) framework, which has
two main components: 1) Spatial Alignment, which selects task-relevant channels
based on brain-region priors, aligns EEG distributions across domains, and
remaps the selected channels to a unified layout; and, 2) Frame-Patch Encoding,
which models multi-dataset signals into unified spatiotemporal patches for EEG
decoding. Compared to 17 state-of-the-art approaches that need dataset-specific
tuning, the proposed calibration-free AFPM achieves performance gains of up to
4.40% on motor imagery and 3.58% on event-related potential tasks. To our
knowledge, this is the first calibration-free cross-dataset EEG decoding
framework, substantially enhancing the practicalness of BCIs in real-world
applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we present enhanced analysis for sign-based optimization
algorithms with momentum updates. Traditional sign-based methods, under the
separable smoothness assumption, guarantee a convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(T^{-1/4})$, but they either require large batch sizes or assume
unimodal symmetric stochastic noise. To address these limitations, we
demonstrate that signSGD with momentum can achieve the same convergence rate
using constant batch sizes without additional assumptions. Our analysis, under
the standard $l_2$-smoothness condition, improves upon the result of the prior
momentum-based signSGD method by a factor of $\mathcal{O}(d^{1/2})$, where $d$
is the problem dimension. Furthermore, we explore sign-based methods with
majority vote in distributed settings and show that the proposed momentum-based
method yields convergence rates of $\mathcal{O}\left( d^{1/2}T^{-1/2} +
dn^{-1/2} \right)$ and $\mathcal{O}\left( \max \{ d^{1/4}T^{-1/4},

Abstract: Direct numerical simulation of turbulent flows at high Reynolds numbers
remains a major challenge for traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
tools running on classical computer hardware. This has motivated growing
interest in quantum algorithms for CFD to enable flow simulations on quantum
computers. The reason being that these computers are expected to deliver
potential speed-ups for certain problems. One promising quantum CFD approach is
a fully quantum implementation of the lattice Boltzmann method called QLBM.
Although efficient quantum routines are now available for the streaming step,
implementing the nonlinear, irreversible collision step with a low depth
circuit that avoids additional ancilla qubits, probabilistic post-selection and
repeated executions remains a significant challenge. In this study, we address
this challenge by introducing a framework for learning a surrogate quantum
circuit (SQC) that approximates the full Bhatnagar Gross Krook (BGK) collision
operator for the D2Q9 lattice. The four qubit circuit is trained to respect the
physical properties of the BGK collision operator, including mass and momentum
conservation, D8 equivariance and scale equivariance. When compiled to the gate
set used by IBM Heron processor under the assumption of full qubit
connectivity, the 15 block SQC requires only 2,430 native gates and uses
neither ancilla qubits nor post-selection or repeated executions. Moreover, its
depth is independent of the grid resolution, as collision is a local operation
that can exploit quantum parallelism to its full extent. We validate the SQC on
two benchmark flows, the Taylor Green vortex decay and the lid driven cavity,
demonstrating that it accurately captures vortex dissipation and flow
recirculation.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting the activity of oxide perovskite catalysts for
the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) requires descriptors that are both accurate
and physically interpretable. While symbolic regression (SR) offers a path to
discover such formulas, its performance degrades with high-dimensional inputs
and small datasets. We present a two-phase framework that combines neural
networks (NN), feature importance analysis, and symbolic regression (SR) to
discover interpretable descriptors for OER activity in oxide perovskites. In
Phase I, using a small dataset and seven structural features, we reproduce and
improve the known {\mu}/t descriptor by engineering composite features and
applying symbolic regression, achieving training and validation MAEs of 22.8
and 20.8 meV, respectively. In Phase II, we expand to 164 features, reduce
dimensionality, and identify LUMO energy as a key electronic descriptor. A
final formula using {\mu}/t, {\mu}/RA, and LUMO energy achieves improved
accuracy (training and validation MAEs of 22.1 and 20.6 meV) with strong
physical interpretability. Our results demonstrate that NN-guided symbolic
regression enables accurate, interpretable, and physically meaningful
descriptor discovery in data-scarce regimes, indicating interpretability need

derived from domain knowledge rather than data-driven approaches. To address
this, we introduce Spatio Temporal Agent-Based Graph Evolution Dynamics(STAGED)
integrating ABM with deep learning to model intercellular communication, and
its effect on the intracellular gene regulatory network. Using graph ODE
networks (GDEs) with shared weights per cell type, our approach represents
genes as vertices and interactions as directed edges, dynamically learning
their strengths through a designed attention mechanism. Trained to match
continuous trajectories of simulated as well as inferred trajectories from
spatial transcriptomics data, the model captures both intercellular and
intracellular interactions, enabling a more adaptive and accurate
representation of cellular dynamics.

Abstract: Forecasting load in power transmission networks is essential across various
hierarchical levels, from the system level down to individual points of
delivery (PoD). While intuitive and locally accurate, traditional local
forecasting models (LFMs) face significant limitations, particularly in
handling generalizability, overfitting, data drift, and the cold start problem.
These methods also struggle with scalability, becoming computationally
expensive and less efficient as the network's size and data volume grow. In
contrast, global forecasting models (GFMs) offer a new approach to enhance
prediction generalizability, scalability, accuracy, and robustness through
globalization and cross-learning. This paper investigates global load
forecasting in the presence of data drifts, highlighting the impact of
different modeling techniques and data heterogeneity. We explore
feature-transforming and target-transforming models, demonstrating how
globalization, data heterogeneity, and data drift affect each differently. In
addition, we examine the role of globalization in peak load forecasting and its
potential for hierarchical forecasting. To address data heterogeneity and the
balance between globality and locality, we propose separate time series
clustering (TSC) methods, introducing model-based TSC for feature-transforming
models and new weighted instance-based TSC for target-transforming models.
Through extensive experiments on a real-world dataset of Alberta's electricity
load, we demonstrate that global target-transforming models consistently
outperform their local counterparts, especially when enriched with global
features and clustering techniques. In contrast, global feature-transforming
models face challenges in balancing local and global dynamics, often requiring
TSC to manage data heterogeneity effectively.

Abstract: This paper presents a machine learning-accelerated optimization framework for
RF power amplifier design that reduces simulation requirements by 65% while
maintaining $\pm0.3$ to $\pm0.4$ dBm accuracy. The proposed method combines
MaxMin Latin Hypercube Sampling with CatBoost gradient boosting to
intelligently explore multidimensional parameter spaces. Instead of
exhaustively simulating all parameter combinations to achieve target P2dB
compression specifications, our approach strategically selects approximately
35% of critical simulation points. The framework processes ADS netlists,
executes harmonic balance simulations on the reduced dataset, and trains a
CatBoost model to predict P2dB performance across the entire design space.
Validation across 15 PA operating modes yields an average $R^2$ of 0.901, with
the system ranking parameter combinations by their likelihood of meeting target
specifications. The integrated solution delivers 58.24% to 77.78% reduction in
simulation time through automated GUI-based workflows, enabling rapid design
iterations without compromising accuracy standards required for production RF
circuits.

Abstract: Advancements in wireless and mobile technologies, including 5G advanced and
the envisioned 6G, are driving exponential growth in wireless devices. However,
this rapid expansion exacerbates spectrum scarcity, posing a critical
challenge. Dynamic spectrum allocation (DSA)--which relies on sensing and
dynamically sharing spectrum--has emerged as an essential solution to address
this issue. While machine learning (ML) models hold significant potential for
improving spectrum sensing, their adoption in centralized ML-based DSA systems
is limited by privacy concerns, bandwidth constraints, and regulatory
challenges. To overcome these limitations, distributed ML-based approaches such
as Federated Learning (FL) offer promising alternatives. This work addresses
two key challenges in FL-based spectrum sensing (FLSS). First, the scarcity of
labeled data for training FL models in practical spectrum sensing scenarios is
tackled with a semi-supervised FL approach, combined with energy detection,
enabling model training on unlabeled datasets. Second, we examine the security
vulnerabilities of FLSS, focusing on the impact of data poisoning attacks. Our
analysis highlights the shortcomings of existing majority-based defenses in
countering such attacks. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose a novel
defense mechanism inspired by vaccination, which effectively mitigates data
poisoning attacks without relying on majority-based assumptions. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate our solutions,
demonstrating that FLSS can achieve near-perfect accuracy on unlabeled datasets
and maintain Byzantine robustness against both targeted and untargeted data
poisoning attacks, even when a significant proportion of participants are
malicious.

Conclusion: 共生偏差对算法选择的影响取决于探索与利用的平衡，符号一致性是关键。

Abstract: We study A/B experiments that are designed to compare the performance of two
recommendation algorithms. Prior work has shown that the standard
difference-in-means estimator is biased in estimating the global treatment
effect (GTE) due to a particular form of interference between experimental
units. Specifically, units under the treatment and control algorithms
contribute to a shared pool of data that subsequently train both algorithms,
resulting in interference between the two groups. The bias arising from this
type of data sharing is known as "symbiosis bias". In this paper, we highlight
that, for decision-making purposes, the sign of the GTE often matters more than
its precise magnitude when selecting the better algorithm. We formalize this
insight under a multi-armed bandit framework and theoretically characterize
when the sign of the expected GTE estimate under data sharing aligns with or
contradicts the sign of the true GTE. Our analysis identifies the level of
exploration versus exploitation as a key determinant of how symbiosis bias
impacts algorithm selection.

Abstract: \noindent Solving cell problems in homogenization is hard, and available
deep-learning frameworks fail to match the speed and generality of traditional
computational frameworks. More to the point, it is generally unclear what to
expect of machine-learning approaches, let alone single out which approaches
are promising. In the work at hand, we advocate Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs)
for micromechanics, empowering them by insights from computational
micromechanics methods based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT). We construct
an FNO surrogate mimicking the basic scheme foundational for FFT-based methods
and show that the resulting operator predicts solutions to cell problems with
\emph{arbitrary} stiffness distribution only subject to a material-contrast
constraint up to a desired accuracy. In particular, there are no restrictions
on the material symmetry like isotropy, on the number of phases and on the
geometry of the interfaces between materials. Also, the provided fidelity is
sharp and uniform, providing explicit guarantees leveraging our physical
empowerment of FNOs. To show the desired universal approximation property, we
construct an FNO explicitly that requires no training to begin with. Still, the
obtained neural operator complies with the same memory requirements as the
basic scheme and comes with runtimes proportional to classical FFT solvers. In
particular, large-scale problems with more than 100 million voxels are readily
handled. The goal of this work is to underline the potential of FNOs for
solving micromechanical problems, linking FFT-based methods to FNOs. This
connection is expected to provide a fruitful exchange between both worlds.

Abstract: Railroad traffic disruption as a result of leaf-fall cost the UK rail
industry over 300 million per year and measures to mitigate such disruptions
are employed on a large scale, with 1.67 million kilometers of track being
treated in the UK in 2021 alone. Therefore, the ability to anticipate the
timing of leaf-fall would offer substantial benefits for rail network
operators, enabling the efficient scheduling of such mitigation measures.
However, current methodologies for predicting leaf-fall exhibit considerable
limitations in terms of scalability and reliability. This study endeavors to
devise a prediction system that leverages specialized prediction methods and
the latest satellite data sources to generate both scalable and reliable
insights into leaf-fall timings. An LSTM network trained on ground-truth
leaf-falling data combined with multispectral and meteorological satellite data
demonstrated a root-mean-square error of 6.32 days for predicting the start of
leaf-fall and 9.31 days for predicting the end of leaf-fall. The model, which
improves upon previous work on the topic, offers promising opportunities for
the optimization of leaf mitigation measures in the railway industry and the
improvement of our understanding of complex ecological systems.

Abstract: The Dutch railway network is one of the busiest in the world, with delays
being a prominent concern for the principal passenger railway operator NS. This
research addresses a gap in delay prediction studies within the Dutch railway
network by employing an XGBoost Classifier with a focus on topological
features. Current research predominantly emphasizes short-term predictions and
neglects the broader network-wide patterns essential for mitigating ripple
effects. This research implements and improves an existing methodology,
originally designed to forecast the evolution of the fast-changing US air
network, to predict delays in the Dutch Railways. By integrating Node
Centrality Measures and comparing multiple classifiers like RandomForest,
DecisionTree, GradientBoosting, AdaBoost, and LogisticRegression, the goal is
to predict delayed trajectories. However, the results reveal limited
performance, especially in non-simultaneous testing scenarios, suggesting the
necessity for more context-specific adaptations. Regardless, this research
contributes to the understanding of transportation network evaluation and
proposes future directions for developing more robust predictive models for
delays.

Conclusion: RNAMunin填补了直接从基因组序列识别ncRNA的技术空白，为研究微生物调控网络提供了新工具。

Abstract: Functional annotation of microbial genomes is often biased toward
protein-coding genes, leaving a vast, unexplored landscape of non-coding RNAs
(ncRNAs) that are critical for regulating bacterial and archaeal physiology,
stress response and metabolism. Identifying ncRNAs directly from genomic
sequence is a paramount challenge in bioinformatics and biology, essential for
understanding the complete regulatory potential of an organism. This paper
presents RNAMunin, a machine learning (ML) model that is capable of finding
ncRNAs using genomic sequence alone. It is also computationally viable for
large sequence datasets such as long read metagenomic assemblies with contigs
totaling multiple Gbp. RNAMunin is trained on Rfam sequences extracted from
approximately 60 Gbp of long read metagenomes from 16 San Francisco Estuary
samples. We know of no other model that can detect ncRNAs based solely on
genomic sequence at this scale. Since RNAMunin only requires genomic sequence
as input, we do not need for an ncRNA to be transcribed to find it, i.e., we do
not need transcriptomics data. We wrote this manuscript in a narrative style in
order to best convey how RNAMunin was developed and how it works in detail.
Unlike almost all current ML models, at approximately 1M parameters, RNAMunin
is very small and very fast.
