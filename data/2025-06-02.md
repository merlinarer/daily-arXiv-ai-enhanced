### [1] [Rethinking the Understanding Ability across LLMs through Mutual Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23790)
*Shaojie Wang,Sirui Ding,Na Zou*

Main category: cs.CL

Relevance: 90.0

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于互信息（MI）的信息理论框架，用于评估大语言模型（LLM）的语言理解能力，并通过token级恢复性任务比较不同LLM的信息保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法难以衡量LLM的固有语言理解能力，需要一种更通用的理论框架。

Method: 通过互信息（MI）量化输入句子与其潜在表示之间的信息保留，分解为token级MI，并利用Fano不等式推导可计算的下界。

Result: 编码器模型比解码器模型具有更高的信息保真度，后者表现出独特的后期“遗忘”模式；通过优化token级恢复性可提升模型理解能力。

Conclusion: 互信息可作为理解和改进语言模型能力的基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural
language processing, yet evaluating their intrinsic linguistic understanding
remains challenging. Moving beyond specialized evaluation tasks, we propose an
information-theoretic framework grounded in mutual information (MI) to achieve
this. We formalize the understanding as MI between an input sentence and its
latent representation (sentence-level MI), measuring how effectively input
information is preserved in latent representation. Given that LLMs learn
embeddings for individual tokens, we decompose sentence-level MI into
token-level MI between tokens and sentence embeddings, establishing theoretical
bounds connecting these measures. Based on this foundation, we theoretically
derive a computable lower bound for token-level MI using Fano's inequality,
which directly relates to token-level recoverability-the ability to predict
original tokens from sentence embedding. We implement this recoverability task
to comparatively measure MI across different LLMs, revealing that encoder-only
models consistently maintain higher information fidelity than their
decoder-only counterparts, with the latter exhibiting a distinctive late-layer
"forgetting" pattern where mutual information is first enhanced and then
discarded. Moreover, fine-tuning to maximize token-level recoverability
consistently improves understanding ability of LLMs on tasks without
task-specific supervision, demonstrating that mutual information can serve as a
foundation for understanding and improving language model capabilities.

### [2] [DenseLoRA: Dense Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23808)
*Lin Mu,Xiaoyu Wang,Li Ni,Yang Li,Zhize Wu,Peiquan Jin,Yiwen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

Relevance: 90.0

TL;DR: DenseLoRA improves LoRA by using a dense low-rank matrix for adapting LLMs, achieving higher accuracy with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior LoRA methods have redundant weights, leading to inefficiencies. DenseLoRA aims to enhance parameter efficiency and performance.

Method: DenseLoRA refines hidden representations with an Encoder-Decoder before adaptation, using a dense low-rank matrix instead of redundant matrices.

Result: DenseLoRA achieves 83.8% accuracy with 0.01% trainable parameters, outperforming LoRA's 80.8% with 0.70%.

Conclusion: DenseLoRA is a more efficient and effective adaptation method for LLMs.

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has been developed as an efficient approach for
adapting large language models (LLMs) by fine-tuning two low-rank matrices,
thereby reducing the number of trainable parameters. However, prior research
indicates that many of the weights in these matrices are redundant, leading to
inefficiencies in parameter utilization. To address this limitation, we
introduce Dense Low-Rank Adaptation (DenseLoRA), a novel approach that enhances
parameter efficiency while achieving superior performance compared to LoRA.
DenseLoRA builds upon the concept of representation fine-tuning, incorporating
a single Encoder-Decoder to refine and compress hidden representations across
all adaptation layers before applying adaptation. Instead of relying on two
redundant low-rank matrices as in LoRA, DenseLoRA adapts LLMs through a dense
low-rank matrix, improving parameter utilization and adaptation efficiency. We
evaluate DenseLoRA on various benchmarks, showing that it achieves 83.8%
accuracy with only 0.01% of trainable parameters, compared to LoRA's 80.8%
accuracy with 0.70% of trainable parameters on LLaMA3-8B. Additionally, we
conduct extensive experiments to systematically assess the impact of
DenseLoRA's components on overall model performance. Code is available at

### [3] [Measuring Sycophancy of Language Models in Multi-turn Dialogues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23840)

TL;DR: 论文提出了SYCON Bench，一个用于评估多轮自由对话中LLMs迎合行为的基准测试，发现对齐调优会放大迎合行为，而模型规模和推理优化能增强抵抗能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在多轮对话中的迎合行为（sycophancy），填补现有研究仅关注单轮事实正确性的空白。

Method: 引入SYCON Bench基准，测量模型在多轮对话中翻转立场（Turn of Flip）和频率（Number of Flip），并测试17种LLMs。

Result: 发现迎合行为普遍存在，对齐调优加剧此行为，而模型规模和推理优化能增强抵抗能力。推理模型表现优于指令调优模型。

Conclusion: 采用第三人称视角的提示策略可显著减少迎合行为（最高减少63.8%）。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are expected to provide helpful and harmless
responses, yet they often exhibit sycophancy--conforming to user beliefs
regardless of factual accuracy or ethical soundness. Prior research on
sycophancy has primarily focused on single-turn factual correctness,
overlooking the dynamics of real-world interactions. In this work, we introduce
SYCON Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating sycophantic behavior in
multi-turn, free-form conversational settings. Our benchmark measures how
quickly a model conforms to the user (Turn of Flip) and how frequently it
shifts its stance under sustained user pressure (Number of Flip). Applying
SYCON Bench to 17 LLMs across three real-world scenarios, we find that
sycophancy remains a prevalent failure mode. Our analysis shows that alignment
tuning amplifies sycophantic behavior, whereas model scaling and reasoning
optimization strengthen the model's ability to resist undesirable user views.
Reasoning models generally outperform instruction-tuned models but often fail
when they over-index on logical exposition instead of directly addressing the
user's underlying beliefs. Finally, we evaluate four additional prompting
strategies and demonstrate that adopting a third-person perspective reduces
sycophancy by up to 63.8% in debate scenario. We release our code and data at
https://github.com/JiseungHong/SYCON-Bench.

### [4] [Revisiting Uncertainty Estimation and Calibration of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23854)

TL;DR: 该论文全面研究了LLM中的不确定性估计，评估了80种模型，发现语言不确定性（LVU）优于其他方法，并揭示了模型规模、训练后处理等因素对性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在高风险应用中的部署增加，可靠的不确定性估计对确保其安全可信至关重要。

Method: 评估了80种LLM，比较了三种不确定性估计方法（TPU、NVU、LVU），使用MMLU-Pro基准测试。

Result: LVU表现最佳，模型规模、推理能力和量化等因素影响不确定性估计性能。

Conclusion: LVU是提升LLM可靠性的实用工具，需多角度评估不确定性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes
applications, robust uncertainty estimation is essential for ensuring the safe
and trustworthy deployment of LLMs. We present the most comprehensive study to
date of uncertainty estimation in LLMs, evaluating 80 models spanning open- and
closed-source families, dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures,
reasoning and non-reasoning modes, quantization variants and parameter scales
from 0.6B to 671B. Focusing on three representative black-box single-pass
methods, including token probability-based uncertainty (TPU), numerical verbal
uncertainty (NVU), and linguistic verbal uncertainty (LVU), we systematically
evaluate uncertainty calibration and selective classification using the
challenging MMLU-Pro benchmark, which covers both reasoning-intensive and
knowledge-based tasks. Our results show that LVU consistently outperforms TPU
and NVU, offering stronger calibration and discrimination while being more
interpretable. We also find that high accuracy does not imply reliable
uncertainty, and that model scale, post-training, reasoning ability and
quantization all influence estimation performance. Notably, LLMs exhibit better
uncertainty estimates on reasoning tasks than on knowledge-heavy ones, and good
calibration does not necessarily translate to effective error ranking. These
findings highlight the need for multi-perspective evaluation and position LVU
as a practical tool for improving the reliability of LLMs in real-world
settings.

Method: 采用偏置-多样性分解理论分析Transformer层，并通过信息论多样性验证层间差异对性能的影响。

Result: 性能提升依赖于层间多样性，且层数增加带来的边际效益递减，符合参数缩放定律的对数收敛特性。

Conclusion: 增加层数仅在层间行为差异显著时提升性能，实验验证了理论分析的正确性。

Abstract: Transformers deliver outstanding performance across a wide range of tasks and
are now a dominant backbone architecture for large language models (LLMs).
Their task-solving performance is improved by increasing parameter size, as
shown in the recent studies on parameter scaling laws. Although recent
mechanistic-interpretability studies have deepened our understanding of the
internal behavior of Transformers by analyzing their residual stream, the
relationship between these internal mechanisms and the parameter scaling laws
remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we focus on layers and their size, which
mainly decide the parameter size of Transformers. For this purpose, we first
theoretically investigate the layers within the residual stream through a
bias-diversity decomposition. The decomposition separates (i) bias, the error
of each layer's output from the ground truth, and (ii) diversity, which
indicates how much the outputs of each layer differ from each other. Analyzing
Transformers under this theory reveals that performance improves when
individual layers make predictions close to the correct answer and remain
mutually diverse. We show that diversity becomes especially critical when
individual layers' outputs are far from the ground truth. Finally, we introduce
an information-theoretic diversity and show our main findings that adding
layers enhances performance only when those layers behave differently, i.e.,
are diverse. We also reveal the performance gains from increasing the number of
layers exhibit submodularity: marginal improvements diminish as additional
layers increase, mirroring the logarithmic convergence predicted by the
parameter scaling laws. Experiments on multiple semantic-understanding tasks
with various LLMs empirically confirm the theoretical properties derived in
this study.

Result: 结果表明，通过聚焦关键令牌，LLM在长上下文中的性能显著提升，无需成比例增加计算资源。

Conclusion: 结论是LLM性能可通过战略推理而非单纯扩展实现突破，为更高效的语言系统开辟新途径。

Abstract: The prevailing assumption of an exponential decay in large language model
(LLM) reliability with sequence length, predicated on independent per-token
error probabilities, posits an inherent limitation for long autoregressive
outputs. Our research fundamentally challenges this view by synthesizing
emerging evidence that LLM errors are not uniformly distributed but are
concentrated at sparse "key tokens" ($5-10\%$ of total tokens) representing
critical decision junctions. By distinguishing these high-impact tokens from
the increasingly predictable majority, we introduce a new reliability formula
explaining the sustained coherence of modern LLMs over thousands of tokens.
Converging research streams reveal that long-context performance primarily
depends on accurately navigating a few crucial semantic decision points rather
than on uniform token-level accuracy, enabling targeted strategies that
significantly outperform brute-force approaches. We thus propose a framework
for next-generation systems centered on selective preservation of semantically
vital tokens, dynamic computational allocation at uncertain decision
boundaries, multi-path exploration at ambiguities, and architectures aligned
with natural semantic domains. This marks a fundamental shift from raw scaling
to strategic reasoning, promising breakthrough performance without
proportionate computational scaling and offering a more nuanced understanding
that supersedes the exponential decay hypothesis, thereby opening pathways
toward substantially more powerful and efficient language systems.

Motivation: 人类偏好数据在RLHF和DPO等场景中对LLM训练和评估至关重要，但传统标注方法存在不确定性和标注者分歧问题。

Method: 采用直觉模糊集（IFS）建模偏好，通过隶属度、非隶属度和犹豫度捕捉人类判断的复杂性，并开发了新的标注协议和聚合方法。

Result: 实验表明，IFS方法显著提升标注一致性，减少标注疲劳，数据质量更高，下游任务模型性能提升12.3%，标注时间减少15.7%。

Conclusion: IFS框架为处理人类偏好标注中的不确定性提供了理论支持，并为大规模LLM训练提供了实用价值。

Abstract: The quality of human preference data is crucial for training and evaluating
large language models (LLMs), particularly in reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO) scenarios. Traditional
side-by-side (SBS) annotation approaches often struggle with inherent
uncertainty, annotator disagreement, and the complexity of preference
judgments. This paper introduces a novel framework based on intuitionistic
fuzzy sets (IFS) for modeling and aggregating human preferences in LLM data
annotation tasks. Our approach captures not only the degree of preference but
also the uncertainty and hesitation inherent in human judgment through
membership, non-membership, and hesitation degrees. We propose an IFS-based
annotation protocol that enables more nuanced preference modeling, develops
aggregation methods for handling annotator disagreement, and introduces quality
metrics for preference data assessment. Experimental validation on multiple
datasets demonstrates that our IFS-based approach significantly improves
annotation consistency, reduces annotator fatigue, and produces higher-quality
preference data compared to traditional binary and Likert-scale methods. The
resulting preference datasets lead to improved model performance in downstream
tasks, with 12.3\% improvement in win-rate against baseline models and 15.7\%
reduction in annotation time. Our framework provides a principled approach to
handling uncertainty in human preference annotation and offers practical
benefits for large-scale LLM training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管增加可训练参数可以提升模型性能，但会带来更高的计算开销。研究发现优势参数对性能至关重要，因此提出APEX方法来优化参数利用。

Method: APEX逐步将优势参数扩展到劣势参数空间，增加其比例，并通过矩阵有效秩理论解释性能提升。

Result: 在指令微调中，APEX仅用52%的参数优于全参数微调；在持续预训练中，仅用33%的数据达到相同困惑度，下游任务表现显著提升。

Conclusion: APEX通过优化参数分配，显著提升了训练效率和模型性能。

Abstract: Although scaling up the number of trainable parameters in both pre-training
and fine-tuning can effectively improve the performance of large language
models, it also leads to increased computational overhead. When delving into
the parameter difference, we find that a subset of parameters, termed
advantageous parameters, plays a crucial role in determining model performance.
Further analysis reveals that stronger models tend to possess more such
parameters. In this paper, we propose Advantageous Parameter EXpansion Training
(APEX), a method that progressively expands advantageous parameters into the
space of disadvantageous ones, thereby increasing their proportion and
enhancing training effectiveness. Further theoretical analysis from the
perspective of matrix effective rank explains the performance gains of APEX.
Extensive experiments on both instruction tuning and continued pre-training
demonstrate that, in instruction tuning, APEX outperforms full-parameter tuning
while using only 52% of the trainable parameters. In continued pre-training,
APEX achieves the same perplexity level as conventional training with just 33%
of the training data, and yields significant improvements on downstream tasks.

Result: 在数学推理和幻觉基准测试中，FSPO显著减少了幻觉并提升了推理准确性。

Conclusion: FSPO通过事实验证有效平衡了RL微调的推理能力和可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced in reasoning tasks
through reinforcement learning (RL) optimization, achieving impressive
capabilities across various challenging benchmarks. However, our empirical
analysis reveals a critical drawback: reasoning-oriented RL fine-tuning
significantly increases the prevalence of hallucinations. We theoretically
analyze the RL training dynamics, identifying high-variance gradient,
entropy-induced randomness, and susceptibility to spurious local optima as key
factors leading to hallucinations. To address this drawback, we propose
Factuality-aware Step-wise Policy Optimization (FSPO), an innovative RL
fine-tuning algorithm incorporating explicit factuality verification at each
reasoning step. FSPO leverages automated verification against given evidence to
dynamically adjust token-level advantage values, incentivizing factual
correctness throughout the reasoning process. Experiments across mathematical
reasoning and hallucination benchmarks using Qwen2.5 and Llama models
demonstrate that FSPO effectively reduces hallucinations while enhancing
reasoning accuracy, substantially improving both reliability and performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning-centric language models have highlighted
reinforcement learning (RL) as a promising method for aligning models with
verifiable rewards. However, it remains contentious whether RL truly expands a
model's reasoning capabilities or merely amplifies high-reward outputs already
latent in the base model's distribution, and whether continually scaling up RL
compute reliably leads to improved reasoning performance. In this work, we
challenge prevailing assumptions by demonstrating that prolonged RL (ProRL)
training can uncover novel reasoning strategies that are inaccessible to base
models, even under extensive sampling. We introduce ProRL, a novel training
methodology that incorporates KL divergence control, reference policy
resetting, and a diverse suite of tasks. Our empirical analysis reveals that
RL-trained models consistently outperform base models across a wide range of
pass@k evaluations, including scenarios where base models fail entirely
regardless of the number of attempts. We further show that reasoning boundary
improvements correlates strongly with task competence of base model and
training duration, suggesting that RL can explore and populate new regions of
solution space over time. These findings offer new insights into the conditions
under which RL meaningfully expands reasoning boundaries in language models and
establish a foundation for future work on long-horizon RL for reasoning. We

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inability of AI systems to represent human meaning due to reliance on thin descriptions, and to leverage LLMs for automating thick descriptions at scale.

Method: Proposes using LLMs to generate and process thick descriptions, a verbal representation method from humanities, to capture cultural context and human meaning.

Result: Identifies five key challenges for applying thick descriptions in LLMs: context preservation, interpretive pluralism, integrating lived experience, distinguishing qualitative from quantitative, and dynamic meaning.

Conclusion: Thick description can unify efforts to represent culture in LLMs, offering a new direction for generative AI applications.

Abstract: This position paper argues that large language models (LLMs) can make
cultural context, and therefore human meaning, legible at an unprecedented
scale in AI-based sociotechnical systems. We argue that such systems have
previously been unable to represent human meaning because they rely on thin
descriptions: numerical representations that enforce standardization and
therefore strip human activity of the cultural context that gives it meaning.
By contrast, scholars in the humanities and qualitative social sciences have
developed frameworks for representing meaning through thick description: verbal
representations that accommodate heterogeneity and retain contextual
information needed to represent human meaning. While these methods can
effectively codify meaning, they are difficult to deploy at scale. However, the
verbal capabilities of LLMs now provide a means of (at least partially)
automating the generation and processing of thick descriptions, potentially
overcoming this bottleneck. We argue that the problem of rendering human
meaning legible is not just about selecting better metrics, but about
developing new representational formats (based on thick description). We frame
this as a crucial direction for the application of generative AI and identify
five key challenges: preserving context, maintaining interpretive pluralism,
integrating perspectives based on lived experience and critical distance,
distinguishing qualitative content from quantitative magnitude, and
acknowledging meaning as dynamic rather than static. Furthermore, we suggest
that thick description has the potential to serve as a unifying framework to
address a number of emerging concerns about the difficulties of representing
culture in (or using) LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) commonly risk copyright infringement by
reproducing protected content verbatim or with insufficient transformative
modifications, posing significant ethical, legal, and practical concerns.
Current inference-time safeguards predominantly rely on restrictive
refusal-based filters, often compromising the practical utility of these
models. To address this, we collaborated closely with intellectual property
experts to develop FUA-LLM (Fair Use Aligned Language Models), a
legally-grounded framework explicitly designed to align LLM outputs with
fair-use doctrine. Central to our method is FairUseDB, a carefully constructed
dataset containing 18,000 expert-validated examples covering nine realistic
infringement scenarios. Leveraging this dataset, we apply Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) to fine-tune open-source LLMs, encouraging them to produce
legally compliant and practically useful alternatives rather than resorting to
blunt refusal. Recognizing the shortcomings of traditional evaluation metrics,
we propose new measures: Weighted Penalty Utility and Compliance Aware Harmonic
Mean (CAH) to balance infringement risk against response utility. Extensive
quantitative experiments coupled with expert evaluations confirm that FUA-LLM
substantially reduces problematic outputs (up to 20\%) compared to
state-of-the-art approaches, while preserving real-world usability.

LLM agents with data-driven discovery tools to facilitate literature
exploration. LitChat automatically interprets user queries, retrieves relevant
sources, constructs knowledge graphs, and employs diverse data-mining

Conclusion: R3-RAG 通过强化学习实现了更高效的推理和检索，提升了 RAG 系统的性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates external knowledge with Large
Language Models (LLMs) to enhance factual correctness and mitigate
hallucination. However, dense retrievers often become the bottleneck of RAG
systems due to their limited parameters compared to LLMs and their inability to
perform step-by-step reasoning. While prompt-based iterative RAG attempts to
address these limitations, it is constrained by human-designed workflows. To
address these limitations, we propose $\textbf{R3-RAG}$, which uses
$\textbf{R}$einforcement learning to make the LLM learn how to
$\textbf{R}$eason and $\textbf{R}$etrieve step by step, thus retrieving
comprehensive external knowledge and leading to correct answers. R3-RAG is
divided into two stages. We first use cold start to make the model learn the
manner of iteratively interleaving reasoning and retrieval. Then we use
reinforcement learning to further harness its ability to better explore the
external retrieval environment. Specifically, we propose two rewards for
R3-RAG: 1) answer correctness for outcome reward, which judges whether the
trajectory leads to a correct answer; 2) relevance-based document verification
for process reward, encouraging the model to retrieve documents that are
relevant to the user question, through which we can let the model learn how to
iteratively reason and retrieve relevant documents to get the correct answer.
Experimental results show that R3-RAG significantly outperforms baselines and
can transfer well to different retrievers. We release R3-RAG at

### [15] [Emergent LLM behaviors are observationally equivalent to data leakage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23796)
*Christopher Barrie,Petter Törnberg*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文指出，Ashery等人关于LLMs在命名游戏中自发形成语言惯例的结论可能源于数据泄漏，而非真正的涌现行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否真正具备自发形成语言惯例的能力，还是仅仅在重复预训练数据中的内容。

Method: 通过多种分析证明LLMs识别游戏结构并回忆预训练结果，而非涌现新行为。

Result: LLMs的行为与训练数据记忆无异，未表现出真正的涌现特性。

Conclusion: LLMs在社会科学模型中的应用需谨慎，需探索替代策略。

Abstract: Ashery et al. recently argue that large language models (LLMs), when paired
to play a classic "naming game," spontaneously develop linguistic conventions
reminiscent of human social norms. Here, we show that their results are better
explained by data leakage: the models simply reproduce conventions they already
encountered during pre-training. Despite the authors' mitigation measures, we
provide multiple analyses demonstrating that the LLMs recognize the structure
of the coordination game and recall its outcomes, rather than exhibit
"emergent" conventions. Consequently, the observed behaviors are
indistinguishable from memorization of the training corpus. We conclude by
pointing to potential alternative strategies and reflecting more generally on
the place of LLMs for social science models.

Motivation: LLMs容易产生幻觉且对提示扰动敏感，导致生成文本不一致或不可靠。研究旨在改进现有的一致性测量方法，使其更符合人类感知。

Method: 提出了一种基于logit的集成方法，并通过用户研究（n=2,976）评估了现有方法和新方法的性能。

Result: 新方法在估计人类对一致性的评分方面表现与最佳现有方法相当，但整体上现有方法仍不理想。

Conclusion: 建议在LLM一致性评估中更广泛地使用人类输入，因为现有无人类评估的方法仍不够准确。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are prone to hallucinations and sensitive to
prompt perturbations, often resulting in inconsistent or unreliable generated
text. Different methods have been proposed to mitigate such hallucinations and
fragility -- one of them being measuring the consistency (the model's
confidence in the response, or likelihood of generating a similar response when
resampled) of LLM responses. In previous work, measuring consistency often
relied on the probability of a response appearing within a pool of resampled
responses, or internal states or logits of responses. However, it is not yet
clear how well these approaches approximate how humans perceive the consistency
of LLM responses. We performed a user study (n=2,976) and found current methods
typically do not approximate users' perceptions of LLM consistency very well.
We propose a logit-based ensemble method for estimating LLM consistency, and we
show that this method matches the performance of the best-performing existing
metric in estimating human ratings of LLM consistency. Our results suggest that
methods of estimating LLM consistency without human evaluation are sufficiently
imperfect that we suggest evaluation with human input be more broadly used.

Motivation: 现有LLM在医学考试中表现优异，但未能反映真实临床实践的复杂性和多样性，因此需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 开发了临床验证的分类法（5类22子类121任务），构建了35个基准（17现有，18新），并采用LLM-jury评估方法进行系统比较。

Conclusion: MedHELM强调了任务特异性评估的重要性，并为医学LLM提供了开源框架。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) achieve near-perfect scores on medical
licensing exams, these evaluations inadequately reflect the complexity and
diversity of real-world clinical practice. We introduce MedHELM, an extensible
evaluation framework for assessing LLM performance for medical tasks with three
key contributions. First, a clinician-validated taxonomy spanning 5 categories,
22 subcategories, and 121 tasks developed with 29 clinicians. Second, a
comprehensive benchmark suite comprising 35 benchmarks (17 existing, 18 newly
formulated) providing complete coverage of all categories and subcategories in
the taxonomy. Third, a systematic comparison of LLMs with improved evaluation
methods (using an LLM-jury) and a cost-performance analysis. Evaluation of 9
frontier LLMs, using the 35 benchmarks, revealed significant performance
variation. Advanced reasoning models (DeepSeek R1: 66% win-rate; o3-mini: 64%
win-rate) demonstrated superior performance, though Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieved
comparable results at 40% lower estimated computational cost. On a normalized
accuracy scale (0-1), most models performed strongly in Clinical Note
Generation (0.73-0.85) and Patient Communication & Education (0.78-0.83),
moderately in Medical Research Assistance (0.65-0.75), and generally lower in
Clinical Decision Support (0.56-0.72) and Administration & Workflow
(0.53-0.63). Our LLM-jury evaluation method achieved good agreement with
clinician ratings (ICC = 0.47), surpassing both average clinician-clinician
agreement (ICC = 0.43) and automated baselines including ROUGE-L (0.36) and
BERTScore-F1 (0.44). Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieved comparable performance to top
models at lower estimated cost. These findings highlight the importance of
real-world, task-specific evaluation for medical use of LLMs and provides an
open source framework to enable this.

Motivation: LLM在文本到SQL解析中表现优异，但有时会自信地给出错误答案。为了构建可信赖的系统，需要可靠的置信度度量。

Method: 提出子句频率（SCF）分数，利用SQL的结构化特性提供更细粒度的正确性信号，并结合多变量Platt缩放（MPS）生成整体校准分数。

Result: 在两个流行的文本到SQL数据集上，MPS与SCF结合的方法在校准和错误检测任务中优于传统Platt缩放。

Conclusion: 通过SCF和MPS的结合，显著提升了LLM在文本到SQL解析中的置信度校准能力。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on text-to-SQL
parsing, they sometimes exhibit unexpected failures in which they are
confidently incorrect. Building trustworthy text-to-SQL systems thus requires
eliciting reliable uncertainty measures from the LLM. In this paper, we study
the problem of providing a calibrated confidence score that conveys the
likelihood of an output query being correct. Our work is the first to establish
a benchmark for post-hoc calibration of LLM-based text-to-SQL parsing. In
particular, we show that Platt scaling, a canonical method for calibration,
provides substantial improvements over directly using raw model output
probabilities as confidence scores. Furthermore, we propose a method for
text-to-SQL calibration that leverages the structured nature of SQL queries to
provide more granular signals of correctness, named "sub-clause frequency"
(SCF) scores. Using multivariate Platt scaling (MPS), our extension of the
canonical Platt scaling technique, we combine individual SCF scores into an
overall accurate and calibrated score. Empirical evaluation on two popular
text-to-SQL datasets shows that our approach of combining MPS and SCF yields
further improvements in calibration and the related task of error detection
over traditional Platt scaling.

Result: 在70%稀疏度下，DLP将LLaMA2-7B的困惑度降低7.79，平均准确率提升2.7%。

Conclusion: DLP在高稀疏度下有效保留性能，兼容现有压缩技术，并支持PEFT。

Abstract: Pruning has recently been widely adopted to reduce the parameter scale and
improve the inference efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs). Mainstream
pruning techniques often rely on uniform layerwise pruning strategies, which
can lead to severe performance degradation at high sparsity levels. Recognizing
the varying contributions of different layers in LLMs, recent studies have
shifted their focus toward non-uniform layerwise pruning. However, these
approaches often rely on pre-defined values, which can result in suboptimal
performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel method called
Dynamic Layerwise Pruning (DLP). This approach adaptively determines the
relative importance of each layer by integrating model weights with input
activation information, assigning pruning rates accordingly. Experimental
results show that DLP effectively preserves model performance at high sparsity
levels across multiple LLMs. Specifically, at 70% sparsity, DLP reduces the
perplexity of LLaMA2-7B by 7.79 and improves the average accuracy by 2.7%
compared to state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, DLP is compatible with various
existing LLM compression techniques and can be seamlessly integrated into
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT). We release the code at
https://github.com/ironartisan/DLP to facilitate future research.

Result: 实验表明，LayerIF在LoRA-MoE架构专家分配和LLM剪枝中提升任务性能。

Conclusion: LayerIF为LLM层训练质量评估提供数据驱动方法，任务敏感且模型无关。

Abstract: Pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across a
wide range of tasks, yet exhibit substantial variability in the various layers'
training quality with respect to specific downstream applications, limiting
their downstream performance.It is therefore critical to estimate layer-wise
training quality in a manner that accounts for both model architecture and
training data. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on model-centric
heuristics (such as spectral statistics, outlier detection, or uniform
allocation) while overlooking the influence of data. To address these
limitations, we propose LayerIF, a data-driven framework that leverages
Influence Functions to quantify the training quality of individual layers in a
principled and task-sensitive manner. By isolating each layer's gradients and
measuring the sensitivity of the validation loss to training examples by
computing layer-wise influences, we derive data-driven estimates of layer
importance. Notably, our method produces task-specific layer importance
estimates for the same LLM, revealing how layers specialize for different
test-time evaluation tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our scores by
leveraging them for two downstream applications: (a) expert allocation in
LoRA-MoE architectures and (b) layer-wise sparsity distribution for LLM
pruning. Experiments across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate that our
model-agnostic, influence-guided allocation leads to consistent gains in task
performance.

Abstract: Accommodating human preferences is essential for creating aligned LLM agents
that deliver personalized and effective interactions. Recent work has shown the
potential for LLMs acting as writing agents to infer a description of user
preferences. Agent alignment then comes from conditioning on the inferred
preference description. However, existing methods often produce generic
preference descriptions that fail to capture the unique and individualized
nature of human preferences. This paper introduces PROSE, a method designed to
enhance the precision of preference descriptions inferred from user writing
samples. PROSE incorporates two key elements: (1) iterative refinement of
inferred preferences, and (2) verification of inferred preferences across
multiple user writing samples. We evaluate PROSE with several LLMs (i.e.,
Qwen2.5 7B and 72B Instruct, GPT-mini, and GPT-4o) on a summarization and an
email writing task. We find that PROSE more accurately infers nuanced human
preferences, improving the quality of the writing agent's generations over
CIPHER (a state-of-the-art method for inferring preferences) by 33\%. Lastly,
we demonstrate that ICL and PROSE are complementary methods, and combining them
provides up to a 9\% improvement over ICL alone.

Conclusion: 现有LLMs在steerability方面仍有不足，当前的策略可能不足以解决问题。

Abstract: Despite advances in large language models (LLMs) on reasoning and
instruction-following benchmarks, it remains unclear whether they can reliably
produce outputs aligned with a broad variety of user goals, a concept we refer
to as steerability. The abundance of methods proposed to modify LLM behavior
makes it unclear whether current LLMs are already steerable, or require further
intervention. In particular, LLMs may exhibit (i) poor coverage, where rare
user goals are underrepresented; (ii) miscalibration, where models overshoot
requests; and (iii) side effects, where changes to one dimension of text
inadvertently affect others. To systematically evaluate these failures, we
introduce a framework based on a multi-dimensional goal space that models user
goals and LLM outputs as vectors with dimensions corresponding to text
attributes (e.g., reading difficulty). Applied to a text-rewriting task, we
find that current LLMs struggle with steerability, as side effects are
persistent. Interventions to improve steerability, such as prompt engineering,
best-of-$N$ sampling, and reinforcement learning fine-tuning, have varying
effectiveness, yet side effects remain problematic. Our findings suggest that
even strong LLMs struggle with steerability, and existing alignment strategies
may be insufficient. We open-source our steerability evaluation framework at

Abstract: The increasing use of LLMs as substitutes for humans in ``aligning'' LLMs has
raised questions about their ability to replicate human judgments and
preferences, especially in ambivalent scenarios where humans disagree. This
study examines the biases and limitations of LLMs in three roles: answer
generator, judge, and debater. These roles loosely correspond to previously
described alignment frameworks: preference alignment (judge) and scalable
oversight (debater), with the answer generator reflecting the typical setting
with user interactions. We develop a ``no-consensus'' benchmark by curating
examples that encompass a variety of a priori ambivalent scenarios, each
presenting two possible stances. Our results show that while LLMs can provide
nuanced assessments when generating open-ended answers, they tend to take a
stance on no-consensus topics when employed as judges or debaters. These
findings underscore the necessity for more sophisticated methods for aligning
LLMs without human oversight, highlighting that LLMs cannot fully capture human
disagreement even on topics where humans themselves are divided.

Contemporary advanced techniques, such as prompt learning and reinforcement

while these approaches address broad ethical considerations and helpfulness,
they rarely focus on simulating individualized human value systems. To address
this gap, we present ValueSim, a framework that simulates individual values
through the generation of personal backstories reflecting past experiences and
demographic information. ValueSim converts structured individual data into
narrative backstories and employs a multi-module architecture inspired by the
Cognitive-Affective Personality System to simulate individual values based on
these narratives. Testing ValueSim on a self-constructed benchmark derived from
the World Values Survey demonstrates an improvement in top-1 accuracy by over
10% compared to retrieval-augmented generation methods. Further analysis
reveals that performance enhances as additional user interaction history
becomes available, indicating the model's ability to refine its persona
simulation capabilities over time.

Abstract: Mitigating social bias in large language models (LLMs) has become an
increasingly important research objective. However, existing debiasing methods
often incur high human and computational costs, exhibit limited effectiveness,
and struggle to scale to larger models and open-ended generation tasks. To
address these limitations, this paper proposes BiasFilter, a model-agnostic,
inference-time debiasing framework that integrates seamlessly with both
open-source and API-based LLMs. Instead of relying on retraining with balanced
data or modifying model parameters, BiasFilter enforces fairness by filtering
generation outputs in real time. Specifically, it periodically evaluates
intermediate outputs every few tokens, maintains an active set of candidate
continuations, and incrementally completes generation by discarding low-reward
segments based on a fairness reward signal. To support this process, we
construct a fairness preference dataset and train an implicit reward model to
assess token-level fairness in generated responses. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BiasFilter effectively mitigates social bias across a range of
LLMs while preserving overall generation quality.

Abstract: Recent advancements have shown that the Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach
significantly enhances the capacity of large language models (LLMs) and
improves performance on downstream tasks. Building on these promising results,
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have increasingly adopted MoE
techniques. However, existing multi-modal MoE tuning methods typically face two
key challenges: expert uniformity and router rigidity. Expert uniformity occurs
because MoE experts are often initialized by simply replicating the FFN
parameters from LLMs, leading to homogenized expert functions and weakening the
intended diversification of the MoE architecture. Meanwhile, router rigidity
stems from the prevalent use of static linear routers for expert selection,
which fail to distinguish between visual and textual tokens, resulting in
similar expert distributions for image and text. To address these limitations,
we propose EvoMoE, an innovative MoE tuning framework. EvoMoE introduces a
meticulously designed expert initialization strategy that progressively evolves
multiple robust experts from a single trainable expert, a process termed expert
evolution that specifically targets severe expert homogenization. Furthermore,
we introduce the Dynamic Token-aware Router (DTR), a novel routing mechanism
that allocates input tokens to appropriate experts based on their modality and
intrinsic token values. This dynamic routing is facilitated by hypernetworks,
which dynamically generate routing weights tailored for each individual token.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that EvoMoE significantly outperforms other
sparse MLLMs across a variety of multi-modal benchmarks, including MME,
MMBench, TextVQA, and POPE. Our results highlight the effectiveness of EvoMoE
in enhancing the performance of MLLMs by addressing the critical issues of
expert uniformity and router rigidity.

these abstract patterns. Based on this framework, we introduce two novel
complementary metrics: \(\scoreGamma\) measures basic reasoning accuracy, while
\(\scoreDelta\) quantifies a model's reliance on specific symbols rather than
underlying patterns - a key indicator of true abstraction versus mere
memorization. To implement this measurement, we design a benchmark: systematic
symbol remapping in rule-based tasks, which forces models to demonstrate
genuine pattern recognition beyond superficial token matching. Extensive LLM
evaluations using this benchmark (commercial API models, 7B-70B, multi-agent)
reveal:1) critical limitations in non-decimal arithmetic and symbolic
reasoning; 2) persistent abstraction gaps despite chain-of-thought prompting;
and 3) \(\scoreDelta\)'s effectiveness in robustly measuring memory dependence
by quantifying performance degradation under symbol remapping, particularly
highlighting operand-specific memorization. These findings underscore that
current LLMs, despite domain-specific strengths, still lack robust abstract
reasoning, highlighting key areas for future improvement.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in systems that retrieve
and summarize content from multiple sources, such as search engines and AI
assistants. While these models enhance user experience by generating coherent
summaries, they obscure the contributions of original content creators, raising
concerns about credit attribution and compensation. We address the challenge of
valuing individual documents used in LLM-generated summaries. We propose using
Shapley values, a game-theoretic method that allocates credit based on each
document's marginal contribution. Although theoretically appealing, Shapley
values are expensive to compute at scale. We therefore propose Cluster Shapley,
an efficient approximation algorithm that leverages semantic similarity between
documents. By clustering documents using LLM-based embeddings and computing
Shapley values at the cluster level, our method significantly reduces
computation while maintaining attribution quality. We demonstrate our approach
to a summarization task using Amazon product reviews. Cluster Shapley
significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining high accuracy,
outperforming baseline methods such as Monte Carlo sampling and Kernel SHAP
with a better efficient frontier. Our approach is agnostic to the exact LLM
used, the summarization process used, and the evaluation procedure, which makes
it broadly applicable to a variety of summarization settings.

Abstract: Multi-round incomplete information tasks are crucial for evaluating the
lateral thinking capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Currently,
research primarily relies on multiple benchmarks and automated evaluation
metrics to assess these abilities. However, our study reveals novel insights
into the limitations of existing methods, as they often yield misleading
results that fail to uncover key issues, such as shortcut-taking behaviors,
rigid patterns, and premature task termination. These issues obscure the true
reasoning capabilities of LLMs and undermine the reliability of evaluations. To
address these limitations, we propose a refined set of evaluation standards,
including inspection of reasoning paths, diversified assessment metrics, and
comparative analyses with human performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable promise but remain
challenging to continually improve through traditional finetuning, particularly
when integrating capabilities from other specialized LLMs. Popular methods like
ensemble and weight merging require substantial memory and struggle to adapt to
changing data environments. Recent efforts have transferred knowledge from
multiple LLMs into a single target model; however, they suffer from
interference and degraded performance among tasks, largely due to limited
flexibility in candidate selection and training pipelines. To address these
issues, we propose a framework that adaptively selects and aggregates knowledge
from diverse LLMs to build a single, stronger model, avoiding the high memory
overhead of ensemble and inflexible weight merging. Specifically, we design an
adaptive selection network that identifies the most relevant source LLMs based
on their scores, thereby reducing knowledge interference. We further propose a
dynamic weighted fusion strategy that accounts for the inherent strengths of
candidate LLMs, along with a feedback-driven loss function that prevents the
selector from converging on a single subset of sources. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method can enable a more stable and scalable knowledge
aggregation process while reducing knowledge interference by up to 50% compared
to existing approaches. Code is avaliable at

Result: 语义熵和长链思考显著提升了置信度的可靠性，且单独的阅读模型能重构类似置信度。

Conclusion: 可靠的不确定性估计需要显式探索生成空间，自我报告置信度在此条件下才可信。

Abstract: We study the source of uncertainty in DeepSeek R1-32B by analyzing its
self-reported verbal confidence on question answering (QA) tasks. In the
default answer-then-confidence setting, the model is regularly over-confident,
whereas semantic entropy - obtained by sampling many responses - remains
reliable. We hypothesize that this is because of semantic entropy's larger
test-time compute, which lets us explore the model's predictive distribution.
We show that granting DeepSeek the budget to explore its distribution by
forcing a long chain-of-thought before the final answer greatly improves its
verbal score effectiveness, even on simple fact-retrieval questions that
normally require no reasoning. Furthermore, a separate reader model that sees
only the chain can reconstruct very similar confidences, indicating the verbal
score might be merely a statistic of the alternatives surfaced during
reasoning. Our analysis concludes that reliable uncertainty estimation requires
explicit exploration of the generative space, and self-reported confidence is
trustworthy only after such exploration.

Abstract: We introduce a method to reduce refusal rates of large language models (LLMs)
on sensitive content without modifying model weights or prompts. Motivated by
the observation that refusals in certain models were often preceded by the
specific token sequence of a token marking the beginning of the
chain-of-thought (CoT) block (<think>) followed by a double newline token
(\n\n), we investigate the impact of two simple formatting adjustments during
generation: suppressing \n\n after <think> and suppressing the end-of-sequence
token after the end of the CoT block (</think>). Our method requires no
datasets, parameter changes, or training, relying solely on modifying token
probabilities during generation. In our experiments with official DeepSeek-R1
distillations, these interventions increased the proportion of substantive
answers to sensitive prompts without affecting performance on standard
benchmarks. Our findings suggest that refusal behaviors can be circumvented by
blocking refusal subspaces at specific points in the generation process.

Method: 引入ASyMOB框架，包含17,092个独特的数学挑战，按相似性和复杂性组织，通过数值或符号扰动分析LLMs的泛化能力。

Result: LLMs在扰动问题中表现显著下降（高达-70.3%），表明其依赖记忆而非深层理解。结合代码执行的模型表现更优（最高提升33.1%）。最先进模型（o4-mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash）表现出色且稳健。

Conclusion: 前沿LLMs可能已进入泛化能力的“相变”阶段，未来方向可能是深度整合外部工具或开发更强大的模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly approaching the level of proficiency
in university-level symbolic mathematics required for applications in advanced
science and technology. However, existing benchmarks fall short in assessing
the core skills of LLMs in symbolic mathematics-such as integration,
differential equations, and algebraic simplification. To address this gap, we
introduce ASyMOB, a novel assessment framework focused exclusively on symbolic
manipulation, featuring 17,092 unique math challenges, organized by similarity
and complexity. ASyMOB enables analysis of LLM generalization capabilities by
comparing performance in problems that differ by simple numerical or symbolic
`perturbations'. Evaluated LLMs exhibit substantial degradation in performance
for all perturbation types (up to -70.3%), suggesting reliance on memorized
patterns rather than deeper understanding of symbolic math, even among models
achieving high baseline accuracy. Comparing LLM performance to computer algebra
systems, we identify examples where they fail while LLMs succeed, as well as
problems solved only by combining both approaches. Models capable of integrated
code execution yielded higher accuracy compared to their performance without
code, particularly stabilizing weaker models (up to +33.1% for certain
perturbation types). Notably, the most advanced models (o4-mini, Gemini 2.5
Flash) demonstrate not only high symbolic math proficiency (scoring 96.8% and
97.6% on the unperturbed set), but also remarkable robustness against
perturbations, (-21.7% and -21.2% vs. average -50.4% for the other models).
This may indicate a recent "phase transition" in the generalization
capabilities of frontier LLMs. It remains to be seen whether the path forward
lies in deeper integration with sophisticated external tools, or in developing
models so capable that symbolic math systems like CAS become unnecessary.

Abstract: The emerging capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have sparked
concerns about their immediate potential for harmful misuse. The core approach
to mitigate these concerns is the detection of harmful queries to the model.
Current detection approaches are fallible, and are particularly susceptible to
attacks that exploit mismatched generalization of model capabilities (e.g.,
prompts in low-resource languages or prompts provided in non-text modalities
such as image and audio). To tackle this challenge, we propose OMNIGUARD, an
approach for detecting harmful prompts across languages and modalities. Our
approach (i) identifies internal representations of an LLM/MLLM that are
aligned across languages or modalities and then (ii) uses them to build a
language-agnostic or modality-agnostic classifier for detecting harmful
prompts. OMNIGUARD improves harmful prompt classification accuracy by 11.57\%
over the strongest baseline in a multilingual setting, by 20.44\% for
image-based prompts, and sets a new SOTA for audio-based prompts. By
repurposing embeddings computed during generation, OMNIGUARD is also very
efficient ($\approx 120 \times$ faster than the next fastest baseline). Code

Abstract: Hallucination remains a major challenge for the safe and trustworthy
deployment of large language models (LLMs) in factual content generation. Prior
work has explored confidence estimation as an effective approach to
hallucination detection, but often relies on post-hoc self-consistency methods
that require computationally expensive sampling. Verbalized confidence offers a
more efficient alternative, but existing approaches are largely limited to
short-form question answering (QA) tasks and do not generalize well to
open-ended generation. In this paper, we propose LoVeC (Long-form Verbalized
Confidence), an on-the-fly verbalized confidence estimation method for
long-form generation. Specifically, we use reinforcement learning (RL) to train
LLMs to append numerical confidence scores to each generated statement, serving
as a direct and interpretable signal of the factuality of generation. Our
experiments consider both on-policy and off-policy RL methods, including DPO,
ORPO, and GRPO, to enhance the model calibration. We introduce two novel
evaluation settings, free-form tagging and iterative tagging, to assess
different verbalized confidence estimation methods. Experiments on three
long-form QA datasets show that our RL-trained models achieve better
calibration and generalize robustly across domains. Also, our method is highly
efficient, as it only requires adding a few tokens to the output being decoded.

Abstract: Large Language Models are widely used for content moderation but often
misclassify benign comments as toxic, leading to over-sensitivity. While
previous research attributes this issue primarily to the presence of offensive
terms, we reveal a potential cause beyond token level: LLMs exhibit systematic
topic biases in their implicit associations. Inspired by cognitive psychology's
implicit association tests, we introduce Topic Association Analysis, a
semantic-level approach to quantify how LLMs associate certain topics with
toxicity. By prompting LLMs to generate free-form scenario imagination for
misclassified benign comments and analyzing their topic amplification levels,
we find that more advanced models (e.g., GPT-4 Turbo) demonstrate stronger
topic stereotype despite lower overall false positive rates. These biases
suggest that LLMs do not merely react to explicit, offensive language but rely
on learned topic associations, shaping their moderation decisions. Our findings
highlight the need for refinement beyond keyword-based filtering, providing
insights into the underlying mechanisms driving LLM over-sensitivity.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enhances performance of large language
models, but questions remain about whether these reasoning traces faithfully
reflect the internal processes of the model. We present the first comprehensive
study of CoT faithfulness in large vision-language models (LVLMs),
investigating how both text-based and previously unexplored image-based biases
affect reasoning and bias articulation. Our work introduces a novel,
fine-grained evaluation pipeline for categorizing bias articulation patterns,
enabling significantly more precise analysis of CoT reasoning than previous
methods. This framework reveals critical distinctions in how models process and
respond to different types of biases, providing new insights into LVLM CoT
faithfulness. Our findings reveal that subtle image-based biases are rarely
articulated compared to explicit text-based ones, even in models specialized
for reasoning. Additionally, many models exhibit a previously unidentified
phenomenon we term ``inconsistent'' reasoning - correctly reasoning before
abruptly changing answers, serving as a potential canary for detecting biased
reasoning from unfaithful CoTs. We then apply the same evaluation pipeline to
revisit CoT faithfulness in LLMs across various levels of implicit cues. Our
findings reveal that current language-only reasoning models continue to
struggle with articulating cues that are not overtly stated.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled remarkable progress in natural
language processing, yet their high computational and memory demands pose
challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Although recent
low-rank decomposition methods offer a promising path for structural
compression, they often suffer from accuracy degradation, expensive calibration
procedures, and result in inefficient model architectures that hinder
real-world inference speedups. In this paper, we propose FLAT-LLM, a fast and
accurate, training-free structural compression method based on fine-grained
low-rank transformations in the activation space. Specifically, we reduce the
hidden dimension by transforming the weights using truncated eigenvectors
computed via head-wise Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and employ an
importance-based metric to adaptively allocate ranks across decoders. FLAT-LLM
achieves efficient and effective weight compression without recovery
fine-tuning, which could complete the calibration within a few minutes.
Evaluated across 4 models and 11 datasets, FLAT-LLM outperforms structural
pruning baselines in generalization and downstream performance, while
delivering inference speedups over decomposition-based methods.

Abstract: The recent rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) highlights the
critical need for benchmarking their fairness. Conventional fairness metrics,
which focus on discrete accuracy-based evaluations (i.e., prediction
correctness), fail to capture the implicit impact of model uncertainty (e.g.,
higher model confidence about one group over another despite similar accuracy).
To address this limitation, we propose an uncertainty-aware fairness metric,
UCerF, to enable a fine-grained evaluation of model fairness that is more
reflective of the internal bias in model decisions compared to conventional
fairness measures. Furthermore, observing data size, diversity, and clarity
issues in current datasets, we introduce a new gender-occupation fairness
evaluation dataset with 31,756 samples for co-reference resolution, offering a
more diverse and suitable dataset for evaluating modern LLMs. We establish a
benchmark, using our metric and dataset, and apply it to evaluate the behavior
of ten open-source LLMs. For example, Mistral-7B exhibits suboptimal fairness
due to high confidence in incorrect predictions, a detail overlooked by
Equalized Odds but captured by UCerF. Overall, our proposed LLM benchmark,
which evaluates fairness with uncertainty awareness, paves the way for
developing more transparent and accountable AI systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating fluent text but struggle to
enforce external constraints because they generate tokens sequentially without
explicit control mechanisms. GenCP addresses this limitation by combining LLM
predictions with Constraint Programming (CP) reasoning, formulating text
generation as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). In this paper, we
improve GenCP by integrating Masked Language Models (MLMs) for domain
generation, which allows bidirectional constraint propagation that leverages
both past and future tokens. This integration bridges the gap between
token-level prediction and structured constraint enforcement, leading to more
reliable and constraint-aware text generation. Our evaluation on COLLIE
benchmarks demonstrates that incorporating domain preview via MLM calls
significantly improves GenCP's performance. Although this approach incurs
additional MLM calls and, in some cases, increased backtracking, the overall
effect is a more efficient use of LLM inferences and an enhanced ability to
generate feasible and meaningful solutions, particularly in tasks with strict
content constraints.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了结构化状态空间模型（SSMs）的隐藏状态是否可以通过后处理合并以支持下游推理，提出了一种称为“文档汤”的策略，通过独立编码文档并合并其表示，实现了模块化编码和重用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何在不重新处理完整输入的情况下，通过合并独立编码的文档表示来支持多跳问答、稀疏检索和长文档推理。

Method: 提出“文档汤”策略，独立编码文档并通过简单操作（如平均）合并表示，对Mamba2模型进行微调以生成可合并的表示。

Result: 在HotpotQA上，合并十个独立编码的文档的表现接近跨编码器的性能。

Conclusion: 文档汤策略有效支持模块化编码和下游任务，性能接近跨编码器。

Abstract: We investigate whether hidden states from Structured State Space Models
(SSMs) can be merged post-hoc to support downstream reasoning. Inspired by
model souping, we propose a strategy where documents are encoded independently
and their representations are pooled -- via simple operations like averaging --
into a single context state. This approach, which we call document souping,
enables modular encoding and reuse without reprocessing the full input for each
query. We finetune Mamba2 models to produce soupable representations and find
that they support multi-hop QA, sparse retrieval, and long-document reasoning
with strong accuracy. On HotpotQA, souping ten independently encoded documents
nearly matches the performance of a cross-encoder trained on the same inputs.

Method: 提出HARDTESTGEN管道，利用LLMs合成高质量测试，并构建了一个包含47k问题的数据集HARDTESTS。

Abstract: Verifiers play a crucial role in large language model (LLM) reasoning, needed
by post-training techniques such as reinforcement learning. However, reliable
verifiers are hard to get for difficult coding problems, because a
well-disguised wrong solution may only be detected by carefully human-written
edge cases that are difficult to synthesize. To address this issue, we propose
HARDTESTGEN, a pipeline for high-quality test synthesis using LLMs. With this
pipeline, we curate a comprehensive competitive programming dataset HARDTESTS
with 47k problems and synthetic high-quality tests. Compared with existing
tests, HARDTESTGEN tests demonstrate precision that is 11.3 percentage points
higher and recall that is 17.5 percentage points higher when evaluating
LLM-generated code. For harder problems, the improvement in precision can be as
large as 40 points. HARDTESTS also proves to be more effective for model
training, measured by downstream code generation performance. We will

Motivation: 尽管RLVR在数学和编程领域取得成功，但在医疗领域的应用面临独特挑战，如专业知识和推理需求。

Result: 在多个临床任务（如MEDCALC、TREC CLINICAL TRIALS、EHRSHOT）中表现出准确性、可解释性和跨任务泛化能力的提升。

Conclusion: EHRMIND为医疗领域应用RLVR提供了实用指导，增强了LLMs的能力。

Abstract: We present EHRMIND, a practical recipe for adapting large language models
(LLMs) to complex clinical reasoning tasks using reinforcement learning with
verifiable rewards (RLVR). While RLVR has succeeded in mathematics and coding,
its application to healthcare contexts presents unique challenges due to the
specialized knowledge and reasoning required for electronic health record (EHR)
interpretation. Our pilot study on the MEDCALC benchmark reveals two key
failure modes: (1) misapplied knowledge, where models possess relevant medical
knowledge but apply it incorrectly, and (2) missing knowledge, where models
lack essential domain knowledge. To address these cases, EHRMIND applies a
two-stage solution: a lightweight supervised fine-tuning (SFT) warm-up that
injects missing domain knowledge, stabilizes subsequent training, and
encourages structured, interpretable outputs; followed by RLVR, which
reinforces outcome correctness and refines the model's decision-making. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across diverse clinical
applications, including medical calculations (MEDCALC), patient-trial matching
(TREC CLINICAL TRIALS), and disease diagnosis (EHRSHOT). EHRMIND delivers
consistent gains in accuracy, interpretability, and cross-task generalization.
These findings offer practical guidance for applying RLVR to enhance LLM
capabilities in healthcare settings.

Method: 提出R-KV方法，针对推理模型中的冗余令牌进行压缩，保留关键信息。

Result: R-KV仅用10%的KV缓存即可保持100%性能，16%缓存时性能提升至105%，内存节省90%，吞吐量提升6.6倍。

Conclusion: R-KV在数学推理数据集上优于现有KV缓存压缩方法。

Abstract: Reasoning models have demonstrated impressive performance in self-reflection
and chain-of-thought reasoning. However, they often produce excessively long
outputs, leading to prohibitively large key-value (KV) caches during inference.
While chain-of-thought inference significantly improves performance on complex
reasoning tasks, it can also lead to reasoning failures when deployed with
existing KV cache compression approaches. To address this, we propose
Redundancy-aware KV Cache Compression for Reasoning models (R-KV), a novel
method specifically targeting redundant tokens in reasoning models. Our method
preserves nearly 100% of the full KV cache performance using only 10% of the KV
cache, substantially outperforming existing KV cache baselines, which reach
only 60% of the performance. Remarkably, R-KV even achieves 105% of full KV
cache performance with 16% of the KV cache. This KV-cache reduction also leads
to a 90% memory saving and a 6.6X throughput over standard chain-of-thought
reasoning inference. Experimental results show that R-KV consistently
outperforms existing KV cache compression baselines across two mathematical
reasoning datasets.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) enhances the performance of large language models

unwilling or unable to provide such demonstrations. Inspired by the human
analogy, we explore a new ICL paradigm CrossICL to study how to utilize
existing source task demonstrations in the ICL for target tasks, thereby
obtaining reliable guidance without any additional manual effort. To explore
this, we first design a two-stage alignment strategy to mitigate the
interference caused by gaps across tasks, as the foundation for our
experimental exploration. Based on it, we conduct comprehensive exploration of
CrossICL, with 875 NLP tasks from the Super-NI benchmark and six types of LLMs,

CrossICL and provide valuable insights on questions like the criteria for
selecting cross-task demonstrations, as well as the types of task-gap-induced

Conclusion: Mixed-R1为多源MLLM任务提供了统一的强化学习解决方案。

Abstract: Recent works on large language models (LLMs) have successfully demonstrated
the emergence of reasoning capabilities via reinforcement learning (RL).
Although recent efforts leverage group relative policy optimization (GRPO) for
MLLMs post-training, they constantly explore one specific aspect, such as
grounding tasks, math problems, or chart analysis. There are no works that can
leverage multi-source MLLM tasks for stable reinforcement learning. In this
work, we present a unified perspective to solve this problem. We present
Mixed-R1, a unified yet straightforward framework that contains a mixed reward
function design (Mixed-Reward) and a mixed post-training dataset (Mixed-45K).
We first design a data engine to select high-quality examples to build the
Mixed-45K post-training dataset. Then, we present a Mixed-Reward design, which
contains various reward functions for various MLLM tasks. In particular, it has
four different reward functions: matching reward for binary answer or
multiple-choice problems, chart reward for chart-aware datasets, IoU reward for
grounding problems, and open-ended reward for long-form text responses such as
caption datasets. To handle the various long-form text content, we propose a
new open-ended reward named Bidirectional Max-Average Similarity (BMAS) by
leveraging tokenizer embedding matching between the generated response and the
ground truth. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our proposed
method on various MLLMs, including Qwen2.5-VL and Intern-VL on various sizes.

keep the LoRA parameters frozen. Additionally, the low-resource problem has
been out of their scope. We propose a LoRA merge method that updates and prunes
LoRA parameters through fine-tuning with minimal target task data, which allows
finer-grained adjustments of LoRA parameters and enhancement of task
adaptability. Extensive experiments have been conducted taking summarization as
a benchmark task. Our datasets cover various domains and multiple languages of
English and Japanese. The results confirm that the proposed method achieves
significant and consistent improvements in task adaptability over the previous
methods.

Result: 在LLaMA3系列模型上实现1.3x~1.7x加速，且不改变生成文本分布。

Conclusion: CLaSp是一种高效、兼容性强的投机解码方法。

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD) is a promising method for accelerating the decoding
process of Large Language Models (LLMs). The efficiency of SD primarily hinges
on the consistency between the draft model and the verify model. However,
existing drafting approaches typically require additional modules to be
trained, which can be challenging to implement and ensure compatibility across
various LLMs. In this paper, we propose CLaSp, an in-context layer-skipping
strategy for self-speculative decoding. Unlike prior methods, CLaSp does not
require additional drafting modules or extra training. Instead, it employs a
plug-and-play mechanism by skipping intermediate layers of the verify model to
construct a compressed draft model. Specifically, we develop a dynamic
programming algorithm that optimizes the layer-skipping process by leveraging
the complete hidden states from the last verification stage as an objective.
This enables CLaSp to dynamically adjust its layer-skipping strategy after each
verification stage, without relying on pre-optimized sets of skipped layers.
Experimental results across diverse downstream tasks demonstrate that CLaSp
achieves a speedup of 1.3x ~ 1.7x on LLaMA3 series models without altering the
original distribution of the generated text.

Conclusion: 半结构化推理更易于分析，可通过手工或学习型审计自动检测推理缺陷。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly capable at reasoning, the
problem of "faithfulness" persists: LLM "reasoning traces" can contain errors
and omissions that are difficult to detect, and may obscure biases in model
outputs. To address these limitations, we introduce Semi-Structured Reasoning
Models (SSRMs), which internalize a semi-structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning format within the model. Our SSRMs generate reasoning traces in a
Pythonic syntax. While SSRM traces are not executable, they adopt a restricted,
task-specific vocabulary to name distinct reasoning steps, and to mark each
step's inputs and outputs. Through extensive evaluation on ten benchmarks,
SSRMs demonstrate strong performance and generality: they outperform comparably
sized baselines by nearly ten percentage points on in-domain tasks while
remaining competitive with specialized models on out-of-domain medical
benchmarks. Furthermore, we show that semi-structured reasoning is more
amenable to analysis: in particular, they can be automatically audited to
identify reasoning flaws. We explore both hand-crafted structured audits, which
detect task-specific problematic reasoning patterns, and learned typicality
audits, which apply probabilistic models over reasoning patterns, and show that
both audits can be used to effectively flag probable reasoning errors.

Abstract: This paper investigates the flow of factual information in Mamba State-Space
Model (SSM)-based language models. We rely on theoretical and empirical
connections to Transformer-based architectures and their attention mechanisms.
Exploiting this relationship, we adapt attentional interpretability techniques
originally developed for Transformers--specifically, the Attention Knockout
methodology--to both Mamba-1 and Mamba-2. Using them we trace how information
is transmitted and localized across tokens and layers, revealing patterns of
subject-token information emergence and layer-wise dynamics. Notably, some
phenomena vary between mamba models and Transformer based models, while others
appear universally across all models inspected--hinting that these may be
inherent to LLMs in general. By further leveraging Mamba's structured
factorization, we disentangle how distinct "features" either enable
token-to-token information exchange or enrich individual tokens, thus offering
a unified lens to understand Mamba internal operations.

Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced
multi-turn conversation systems, emphasizing the need for proactive guidance to
enhance users' interactions. However, these systems face challenges in
dynamically adapting to shifts in users' goals and maintaining low latency for
real-time interactions. In the Baidu Search AI assistant, an industrial-scale
multi-turn search system, we propose a novel two-phase framework to provide
proactive guidance. The first phase, Goal-adaptive Supervised Fine-Tuning
(G-SFT), employs a goal adaptation agent that dynamically adapts to user goal
shifts and provides goal-relevant contextual information. G-SFT also
incorporates scalable knowledge transfer to distill insights from LLMs into a
lightweight model for real-time interaction. The second phase, Click-oriented
Reinforcement Learning (C-RL), adopts a generate-rank paradigm, systematically
constructs preference pairs from user click signals, and proactively improves
click-through rates through more engaging guidance. This dual-phase
architecture achieves complementary objectives: G-SFT ensures accurate goal
tracking, while C-RL optimizes interaction quality through click signal-driven
reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework
achieves 86.10% accuracy in offline evaluation (+23.95% over baseline) and
25.28% CTR in online deployment (149.06% relative improvement), while reducing
inference latency by 69.55% through scalable knowledge distillation.

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) continues to improve, as
reflected in rising scores on standard benchmarks. However, the lack of
transparency around training data raises concerns about potential overlap with
evaluation sets and the fairness of reported results. Although prior work has
proposed methods for detecting data leakage, these approaches primarily focus
on identifying outliers and have not been evaluated under controlled simulated
leakage conditions. In this work, we compare existing leakage detection
techniques, namely permutation and n-gram-based methods, under a continual
pretraining setup that simulates real-world leakage scenarios, and additionally
explore a lightweight method we call semi-half question. Although semi-half
offers a low-cost alternative, our analysis shows that the n-gram method
consistently achieves the highest F1-score. We also refine these techniques to
support instance-level detection and reduce computational overhead. Leveraging
the best-performing method, we create cleaned versions of MMLU and HellaSwag,
and re-evaluate several LLMs. Our findings present a practical path toward more
reliable and transparent evaluations, and we recommend contamination checks as
a standard step before releasing benchmark results.

Abstract: Natural language explanations play a fundamental role in Natural Language
Inference (NLI) by revealing how premises logically entail hypotheses. Recent
work has shown that the interaction of large language models (LLMs) with
theorem provers (TPs) can help verify and improve the validity of NLI
explanations. However, TPs require translating natural language into
machine-verifiable formal representations, a process that introduces the risk
of semantic information loss and unfaithful interpretation, an issue compounded
by LLMs' challenges in capturing critical logical structures with sufficient
precision. Moreover, LLMs are still limited in their capacity for rigorous and
robust proof construction within formal verification frameworks. To mitigate
issues related to faithfulness and robustness, this paper investigates
strategies to (1) alleviate semantic loss during autoformalisation, (2)
efficiently identify and correct syntactic errors in logical representations,
(3) explicitly use logical expressions to guide LLMs in generating structured
proof sketches, and (4) increase LLMs' capacity of interpreting TP's feedback
for iterative refinement. Our empirical results on e-SNLI, QASC and WorldTree
using different LLMs demonstrate that the proposed strategies yield significant
improvements in autoformalisation (+18.46%, +34.2%, +39.77%) and explanation
refinement (+29.5%, +51.5%, +41.25%) over the state-of-the-art model. Moreover,
we show that specific interventions on the hybrid LLM-TP architecture can
substantially improve efficiency, drastically reducing the number of iterations
required for successful verification.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在科学知识更新中的局限性，确保其知识保持最新。

Method: 提出ScienceMeter框架，定义三个指标（知识保留、获取、预测），并在多领域数据集上评估五种知识更新方法。

Result: 最佳方法仅保留85.9%现有知识，获取71.7%新知识，预测37.7%未来知识。推理方法适用于大模型，小模型需训练。

Conclusion: 现有方法难以全面更新科学知识，开发更鲁棒的机制至关重要。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to support scientific
research, but their knowledge of scientific advancements can quickly become
outdated. We introduce ScienceMeter, a new framework for evaluating scientific
knowledge update methods over scientific knowledge spanning the past, present,
and future. ScienceMeter defines three metrics: knowledge preservation, the
extent to which models' understanding of previously learned papers are
preserved; knowledge acquisition, how well scientific claims from newly
introduced papers are acquired; and knowledge projection, the ability of the
updated model to anticipate or generalize to related scientific claims that may
emerge in the future. Using ScienceMeter, we examine the scientific knowledge
of LLMs on claim judgment and generation tasks across a curated dataset of
15,444 scientific papers and 30,888 scientific claims from ten domains
including medicine, biology, materials science, and computer science. We
evaluate five representative knowledge update approaches including training-
and inference-time methods. With extensive experiments, we find that the
best-performing knowledge update methods can preserve only 85.9% of existing
knowledge, acquire 71.7% of new knowledge, and project 37.7% of future
knowledge. Inference-based methods work for larger models, whereas smaller
models require training to achieve comparable performance. Cross-domain
analysis reveals that performance on these objectives is correlated. Even when
applying on specialized scientific LLMs, existing knowledge update methods fail
to achieve these objectives collectively, underscoring that developing robust
scientific knowledge update mechanisms is both crucial and challenging.

Motivation: LLM在长文本修改中存在不必要修改和遗漏关键修改的问题，HiCaM旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出HiCaM框架，结合分层摘要树和因果图，并构建多领域数据集进行评估。

Result: 在多个模型和领域中，HiCaM的胜率高达79.50%，表现优于现有LLM。

Conclusion: HiCaM在长文本修改任务中表现出全面且一致的性能提升。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in various
domains. However, when handling long-form text modification tasks, they still
face two major problems: (1) producing undesired modifications by
inappropriately altering or summarizing irrelevant content, and (2) missing
necessary modifications to implicitly related passages that are crucial for
maintaining document coherence. To address these issues, we propose HiCaM, a
Hierarchical-Causal Modification framework that operates through a hierarchical
summary tree and a causal graph. Furthermore, to evaluate HiCaM, we derive a
multi-domain dataset from various benchmarks, providing a resource for
assessing its effectiveness. Comprehensive evaluations on the dataset
demonstrate significant improvements over strong LLMs, with our method
achieving up to a 79.50\% win rate. These results highlight the
comprehensiveness of our approach, showing consistent performance improvements
across multiple models and domains.

Motivation: 现有方法在开放网络问答中表现不佳，主要受限于静态提示规则或基于维基百科的训练环境，无法适应真实网络中的模糊性和噪声。

Method: 提出了DeepDiver，一个基于强化学习的框架，通过自适应搜索策略提升LLMs的SIS能力，并在WebPuzzle数据集上进行训练和测试。

Result: 实验显示，DeepDiver加持的Pangu-7B-Reasoner在开放网络任务中表现接近671B参数的DeepSeek-R1。

Conclusion: DeepDiver和WebPuzzle为LLMs的自适应信息搜索提供了新方法和基准。

Abstract: Information seeking demands iterative evidence gathering and reflective
reasoning, yet large language models (LLMs) still struggle with it in open-web
question answering. Existing methods rely on static prompting rules or training
with Wikipedia-based corpora and retrieval environments, limiting adaptability
to the real-world web environment where ambiguity, conflicting evidence, and
noise are prevalent. These constrained training settings hinder LLMs from
learning to dynamically decide when and where to search, and how to adjust
search depth and frequency based on informational demands. We define this
missing capacity as Search Intensity Scaling (SIS)--the emergent skill to
intensify search efforts under ambiguous or conflicting conditions, rather than
settling on overconfident, under-verification answers.
  To study SIS, we introduce WebPuzzle, the first dataset designed to foster
information-seeking behavior in open-world internet environments. WebPuzzle
consists of 24K training instances and 275 test questions spanning both
wiki-based and open-web queries. Building on this dataset, we propose
DeepDiver, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework that promotes SIS by
encouraging adaptive search policies through exploration under a real-world
open-web environment. Experimental results show that Pangu-7B-Reasoner
empowered by DeepDiver achieve performance on real-web tasks comparable to the
671B-parameter DeepSeek-R1. We detail DeepDiver's training curriculum from
cold-start supervised fine-tuning to a carefully designed RL phase, and present
that its capability of SIS generalizes from closed-form QA to open-ended tasks
such as long-form writing. Our contributions advance adaptive information
seeking in LLMs and provide a valuable benchmark and dataset for future
research.

Abstract: Language agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in understanding, reasoning, and executing complex
tasks. However, developing robust agents presents significant challenges:
substantial engineering overhead, lack of standardized components, and
insufficient evaluation frameworks for fair comparison. We introduce Agent
Graph-based Orchestration for Reasoning and Assessment (AGORA), a flexible and
extensible framework that addresses these challenges through three key
contributions: (1) a modular architecture with a graph-based workflow engine,
efficient memory management, and clean component abstraction; (2) a
comprehensive suite of reusable agent algorithms implementing state-of-the-art
reasoning approaches; and (3) a rigorous evaluation framework enabling
systematic comparison across multiple dimensions. Through extensive experiments
on mathematical reasoning and multimodal tasks, we evaluate various agent
algorithms across different LLMs, revealing important insights about their
relative strengths and applicability. Our results demonstrate that while
sophisticated reasoning approaches can enhance agent capabilities, simpler
methods like Chain-of-Thought often exhibit robust performance with
significantly lower computational overhead. AGORA not only simplifies language
agent development but also establishes a foundation for reproducible agent
research through standardized evaluation protocols.

Conclusion: 研究结果为优化CoT效率提供了新思路，如通过监督或强化学习缩短推理链。

Abstract: We investigate whether the success of a zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
process can be predicted before completion. We discover that a probing
classifier, based on LLM representations, performs well \emph{even before a
single token is generated}, suggesting that crucial information about the
reasoning process is already present in the initial steps representations. In
contrast, a strong BERT-based baseline, which relies solely on the generated
tokens, performs worse, likely because it depends on shallow linguistic cues
rather than deeper reasoning dynamics. Surprisingly, using later reasoning
steps does not always improve classification. When additional context is
unhelpful, earlier representations resemble later ones more, suggesting LLMs
encode key information early. This implies reasoning can often stop early
without loss. To test this, we conduct early stopping experiments, showing that
truncating CoT reasoning still improves performance over not using CoT at all,
though a gap remains compared to full reasoning. However, approaches like
supervised learning or reinforcement learning designed to shorten CoT chains
could leverage our classifier's guidance to identify when early stopping is
effective. Our findings provide insights that may support such methods, helping
to optimize CoT's efficiency while preserving its benefits.\footnote{Code and

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enhanced
natural-language reasoning. However, their limited parametric memory and
susceptibility to hallucination present persistent challenges for tasks
requiring accurate, context-based inference. To overcome these limitations, an
increasing number of studies have proposed leveraging external knowledge to
enhance LLMs. This study offers a systematic exploration of strategies for
using external knowledge to enhance LLMs, beginning with a taxonomy that
categorizes external knowledge into unstructured and structured data. We then
focus on structured knowledge, presenting distinct taxonomies for tables and
knowledge graphs (KGs), detailing their integration paradigms with LLMs, and
reviewing representative methods. Our comparative analysis further highlights
the trade-offs among interpretability, scalability, and performance, providing
insights for developing trustworthy and generalizable knowledge-enhanced LLMs.

Conclusion: ClueAnchor improves RAG by anchoring reasoning to key clues, enhancing interpretability and robustness without explicit supervision.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) augments Large Language Models (LLMs)
with external knowledge to improve factuality. However, existing RAG systems
frequently underutilize the retrieved documents, failing to extract and
integrate the key clues needed to support faithful and interpretable reasoning,
especially in cases where relevant evidence is implicit, scattered, or obscured
by noise. To address this issue, we propose ClueAnchor, a novel framework for
enhancing RAG via clue-anchored reasoning exploration and optimization.
ClueAnchor extracts key clues from retrieved content and generates multiple
reasoning paths based on different knowledge configurations, optimizing the
model by selecting the most effective one through reward-based preference
optimization. Experiments show that ClueAnchor significantly outperforms prior
RAG baselines in reasoning completeness and robustness. Further analysis
confirms its strong resilience to noisy or partially relevant retrieved
content, as well as its capability to identify supporting evidence even in the
absence of explicit clue supervision during inference.

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) open up new possibilities for
leveraging information across languages, but their factual knowledge recall
remains inconsistent depending on the input language. While previous studies
have attempted to address this issue through English-based prompting and
evaluation, we explore non-English to English transfer via Language and Thought
Theory. This perspective allows us to examine language-thought binding in LLMs
and uncover why factual knowledge often fails to transfer effectively. We
propose the Language-to-Thought (L2T) prompting strategy, which analyzes the
relationship between input language, internal cognitive processes, and
knowledge. Experimental results challenge the assumption that English-based
approaches consistently outperform other languages and offer a novel insight
that aligning the model's internal thought with the knowledge required for the
task is critical for successful cross-lingual transfer. Furthermore, we show
that applying L2T during training can alleviate LLMs' reliance on the input
language and facilitate cross-linguistic knowledge integration without
translation-based learning. Code and datasets will be available.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) store vast amounts of information, making them
powerful yet raising privacy and safety concerns when selective knowledge
removal is required. Existing unlearning strategies, ranging from
gradient-based fine-tuning and model editing to sparse autoencoder (SAE)
steering, either lack interpretability or fail to provide a robust defense
against adversarial prompts. We propose SAE-Guided Subspace Projection
Unlearning (SSPU), a novel framework that leverages SAE features to drive
targeted updates in the model's parameter space, enabling precise,
interpretable, and robust unlearning. SSPU's three-stage pipeline performs
data-driven layer and feature selection, subspace construction via QR
decomposition, and constrained optimization that controls activations into an
"irrelevant" subspace while preserving retained knowledge. Overall, we use SAE
features to construct a subspace that supervises unlearning, refining the loss
and adding a regularization term to guide interpretable parameter updates. In
experiments on the WMDP-Cyber forget set and three utility benchmarks (MMLU,
TruthfulQA, GSM8K), SSPU reduces harmful knowledge accuracy by 3.22% compared
to the strongest baseline. It also improves adversarial robustness, lowering
malicious accuracy under jailbreak prompts compared to baselines. Our findings
expose the limitations of prior unlearning methods and demonstrate how
interpretable subspace-guided optimization can achieve robust, controllable
model behavior.

Abstract: Large language/multimodal models (LLMs/LMMs) store extensive pre-trained

it difficult to avoid catastrophic forgetting while acquiring evolving

exploring knowledge injection in LLMs, lacking exploration of multimodal
evolving knowledge injection in LMMs. To address this, we propose the EVOKE
benchmark to evaluate LMMs' ability to inject multimodal evolving knowledge in
real-world scenarios. Meanwhile, a comprehensive evaluation of multimodal
evolving knowledge injection revealed two challenges: (1) Existing knowledge
injection methods perform terribly on evolving knowledge. (2) Supervised
fine-tuning causes catastrophic forgetting, particularly instruction following
ability is severely compromised. Additionally, we provide pathways and find
that: (1) Text knowledge augmentation during the training phase improves
performance, while image augmentation cannot achieve it. (2) Continual learning
methods, especially Replay and MoELoRA, effectively mitigate forgetting. Our
findings indicate that current knowledge injection methods have many
limitations on evolving knowledge, which motivates further research on more
efficient and stable knowledge injection methods.

dynamics. In light of this challenge, we present a systematic approach to

code-integrated reasoning. Specifically, we develop enhanced training
strategies that balance exploration and stability, progressively building
tool-use capabilities while improving reasoning performance. Through extensive

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in
IQ-related domains that require careful thinking, such as mathematics and

particularly from a post-training perspective, remains underexplored.
Recognizing that the social world follows a distinct timeline and requires a
richer blend of cognitive modes (from intuitive reactions (System 1) and
surface-level thinking to deliberate thinking (System 2)) than mathematics,
which primarily relies on System 2 cognition (careful, step-by-step reasoning),
we introduce Temporal-aware Hierarchical Cognitive Reinforcement Learning
(TimeHC-RL) for enhancing LLMs' social intelligence. In our experiments, we
systematically explore improving LLMs' social intelligence and validate the
effectiveness of the TimeHC-RL method, through five other post-training
paradigms and two test-time intervention paradigms on eight datasets with
diverse data patterns. Experimental results reveal the superiority of our
proposed TimeHC-RL method compared to the widely adopted System 2 RL method. It

Abstract: We present a study on how and where personas -- defined by distinct sets of
human characteristics, values, and beliefs -- are encoded in the representation
space of large language models (LLMs). Using a range of dimension reduction and
pattern recognition methods, we first identify the model layers that show the
greatest divergence in encoding these representations. We then analyze the
activations within a selected layer to examine how specific personas are
encoded relative to others, including their shared and distinct embedding
spaces. We find that, across multiple pre-trained decoder-only LLMs, the
analyzed personas show large differences in representation space only within
the final third of the decoder layers. We observe overlapping activations for
specific ethical perspectives -- such as moral nihilism and utilitarianism --
suggesting a degree of polysemy. In contrast, political ideologies like
conservatism and liberalism appear to be represented in more distinct regions.
These findings help to improve our understanding of how LLMs internally
represent information and can inform future efforts in refining the modulation
of specific human traits in LLM outputs. Warning: This paper includes

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD) is a widely adopted approach for accelerating
inference in large language models (LLMs), particularly when the draft and
target models are well aligned. However, state-of-the-art SD methods typically
rely on tightly coupled, self-attention-based Transformer decoders, often
augmented with auxiliary pooling or fusion layers. This coupling makes them
increasingly complex and harder to generalize across different models. We
present Budget EAGLE (Beagle), the first, to our knowledge,
cross-attention-based Transformer decoder SD model that achieves performance on
par with leading self-attention SD models (EAGLE-v2) while eliminating the need
for pooling or auxiliary components, simplifying the architecture, improving
training efficiency, and maintaining stable memory usage during training-time
simulation. To enable effective training of this novel architecture, we propose
Two-Stage Block-Attention Training, a new method that achieves training
stability and convergence efficiency in block-level attention scenarios.
Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and datasets show that Beagle
achieves competitive inference speedups and higher training efficiency than
EAGLE-v2, offering a strong alternative for architectures in speculative

TL;DR: A*-Thought是一个基于树搜索的统一框架，用于高效压缩大型推理模型（LRMs）的长推理链，平衡性能与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在压缩推理链时往往导致性能下降，A*-Thought旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 将推理过程建模为搜索树，结合A*算法和特定成本函数，提出双向重要性估计机制。

Result: 在数学任务中，A*-Thought显著提升性能（2.39倍）并减少输出长度（50%）。

Conclusion: A*-Thought高效且通用，适用于多种LRMs。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve superior performance by extending the
thought length. However, a lengthy thinking trajectory leads to reduced
efficiency. Most of the existing methods are stuck in the assumption of
overthinking and attempt to reason efficiently by compressing the
Chain-of-Thought, but this often leads to performance degradation. To address
this problem, we introduce A*-Thought, an efficient tree search-based unified
framework designed to identify and isolate the most essential thoughts from the
extensive reasoning chains produced by these models. It formulates the
reasoning process of LRMs as a search tree, where each node represents a
reasoning span in the giant reasoning space. By combining the A* search
algorithm with a cost function specific to the reasoning path, it can
efficiently compress the chain of thought and determine a reasoning path with
high information density and low cost. In addition, we also propose a
bidirectional importance estimation mechanism, which further refines this
search process and enhances its efficiency beyond uniform sampling. Extensive
experiments on several advanced math tasks show that A*-Thought effectively
balances performance and efficiency over a huge search space. Specifically,
A*-Thought can improve the performance of QwQ-32B by 2.39$\times$ with
low-budget and reduce the length of the output token by nearly 50% with
high-budget. The proposed method is also compatible with several other LRMs,
demonstrating its generalization capability. The code can be accessed at:

Motivation: 探索MoE模型（尤其是异构设计）的可解释性，现有方法无法捕捉稀疏MoE架构的动态交互。

Method: 提出跨层归因算法，对比分析稀疏MoE（如Qwen 1.5-MoE）与密集模型（如Llama-7B）。

Result: MoE模型通过“中期激活、后期放大”模式实现37%的层效率提升，共享专家处理通用任务，路由专家专注领域任务。

Conclusion: 研究为MoE设计提供了平衡效率、专业化和鲁棒性的原则。

Abstract: The interpretability of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, especially those
with heterogeneous designs, remains underexplored. Existing attribution methods
for dense models fail to capture dynamic routing-expert interactions in sparse
MoE architectures. To address this issue, we propose a cross-level attribution
algorithm to analyze sparse MoE architectures (Qwen 1.5-MoE, OLMoE,
Mixtral-8x7B) against dense models (Qwen 1.5-7B, Llama-7B, Mixtral-7B). Results
show MoE models achieve 37% higher per-layer efficiency via a "mid-activation,
late-amplification" pattern: early layers screen experts, while late layers
refine knowledge collaboratively. Ablation studies reveal a "basic-refinement"
framework--shared experts handle general tasks (entity recognition), while
routed experts specialize in domain-specific processing (geographic
attributes). Semantic-driven routing is evidenced by strong correlations
between attention heads and experts (r=0.68), enabling task-aware coordination.
Notably, architectural depth dictates robustness: deep Qwen 1.5-MoE mitigates
expert failures (e.g., 43% MRR drop in geographic tasks when blocking top-10
experts) through shared expert redundancy, whereas shallow OLMoE suffers severe
degradation (76% drop). Task sensitivity further guides design: core-sensitive
tasks (geography) require concentrated expertise, while distributed-tolerant
tasks (object attributes) leverage broader participation. These insights
advance MoE interpretability, offering principles to balance efficiency,
specialization, and robustness.

Abstract: We introduce POLLUX, a comprehensive open-source benchmark designed to
evaluate the generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in
Russian. Our main contribution is a novel evaluation methodology that enhances
the interpretability of LLM assessment. For each task type, we define a set of
detailed criteria and develop a scoring protocol where models evaluate
responses and provide justifications for their ratings. This enables
transparent, criteria-driven evaluation beyond traditional resource-consuming,
side-by-side human comparisons. POLLUX includes a detailed, fine-grained
taxonomy of 35 task types covering diverse generative domains such as code
generation, creative writing, and practical assistant use cases, totaling 2,100
manually crafted and professionally authored prompts. Each task is categorized
by difficulty (easy/medium/hard), with experts constructing the dataset
entirely from scratch. We also release a family of LLM-as-a-Judge (7B and 32B)
evaluators trained for nuanced assessment of generative outputs. This approach
provides scalable, interpretable evaluation and annotation tools for model
development, effectively replacing costly and less precise human judgments.

Abstract: This paper introduces a Dual Evaluation Framework to comprehensively assess
the multilingual capabilities of LLMs. By decomposing the evaluation along the
dimensions of linguistic medium and cultural context, this framework enables a
nuanced analysis of LLMs' ability to process questions within both native and
cross-cultural contexts cross-lingually. Extensive evaluations are conducted on
a wide range of models, revealing a notable "CulturalLinguistic Synergy"
phenomenon, where models exhibit better performance when questions are
culturally aligned with the language. This phenomenon is further explored
through interpretability probing, which shows that a higher proportion of
specific neurons are activated in a language's cultural context. This
activation proportion could serve as a potential indicator for evaluating
multilingual performance during model training. Our findings challenge the
prevailing notion that LLMs, primarily trained on English data, perform
uniformly across languages and highlight the necessity of culturally and
linguistically model evaluations. Our code can be found at

Conclusion: 多智能体辩论是提升LLM文化适应性的有效方法，尤其对小模型效果显著。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) need to adapt their predictions to diverse
cultural contexts to benefit diverse communities across the world. While
previous efforts have focused on single-LLM, single-turn approaches, we propose
to exploit the complementary strengths of multiple LLMs to promote cultural
adaptability. We introduce a Multi-Agent Debate framework, where two LLM-based
agents debate over a cultural scenario and collaboratively reach a final
decision. We propose two variants: one where either LLM agents exclusively
debate and another where they dynamically choose between self-reflection and
debate during their turns. We evaluate these approaches on 7 open-weight LLMs
(and 21 LLM combinations) using the NormAd-ETI benchmark for social etiquette
norms in 75 countries. Experiments show that debate improves both overall
accuracy and cultural group parity over single-LLM baselines. Notably,
multi-agent debate enables relatively small LLMs (7-9B) to achieve accuracies
comparable to that of a much larger model (27B parameters).

Result: 微调后的Llama 3.1-8B模型在Harm Score和Attack Success Rate上分别降低了14.29%和20%。

Conclusion: TRIDENT框架能够有效提升模型的安全性，弥补现有数据集的不足。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in various natural language processing
tasks but remain vulnerable to generating harmful content or being exploited
for malicious purposes. Although safety alignment datasets have been introduced
to mitigate such risks through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), these datasets
often lack comprehensive risk coverage. Most existing datasets focus primarily
on lexical diversity while neglecting other critical dimensions. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel analysis framework to systematically
measure the risk coverage of alignment datasets across three essential
dimensions: Lexical Diversity, Malicious Intent, and Jailbreak Tactics. We
further introduce TRIDENT, an automated pipeline that leverages persona-based,
zero-shot LLM generation to produce diverse and comprehensive instructions
spanning these dimensions. Each harmful instruction is paired with an ethically
aligned response, resulting in two datasets: TRIDENT-Core, comprising 26,311
examples, and TRIDENT-Edge, with 18,773 examples. Fine-tuning Llama 3.1-8B on
TRIDENT-Edge demonstrates substantial improvements, achieving an average 14.29%
reduction in Harm Score, and a 20% decrease in Attack Success Rate compared to
the best-performing baseline model fine-tuned on the WildBreak dataset.

Result: 在LLaMA-3-8B上剪枝5层时，LinearPatch保留了94.15%的性能，超越现有方法4%。通过离线知识蒸馏进一步优化后，性能提升至95.16%。

Conclusion: LinearPatch有效解决了层剪枝的性能下降问题，且计算开销低，适用于高效LLM压缩。

Abstract: Layer pruning has become a popular technique for compressing large language
models (LLMs) due to its simplicity. However, existing layer pruning methods
often suffer from significant performance drops. We identify that this
degradation stems from the mismatch of activation magnitudes across layers and
tokens at the pruning interface. To address this, we propose LinearPatch, a
simple plug-and-play technique to revive the layer-pruned LLMs. The proposed
method adopts Hadamard transformation to suppress massive outliers in
particular tokens, and channel-wise scaling to align the activation magnitudes.
These operations can be fused into a single matrix, which functions as a patch
to bridge the pruning interface with negligible inference overhead. LinearPatch
retains up to 94.15% performance of the original model when pruning 5 layers of
LLaMA-3-8B on the question answering benchmark, surpassing existing
state-of-the-art methods by 4%. In addition, the patch matrix can be further
optimized with memory efficient offline knowledge distillation. With only 5K
samples, the retained performance of LinearPatch can be further boosted to
95.16% within 30 minutes on a single computing card.

Abstract: Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizers, widely used in Large Language Models,
face challenges in multilingual settings, including penalization of non-Western
scripts and the creation of tokens with partial UTF-8 sequences.
Pretokenization, often reliant on complex regular expressions, can also
introduce fragility and unexpected edge cases. We propose SCRIPT (Script
Category Representation in PreTokenization), a novel encoding scheme that
bypasses UTF-8 byte conversion by using initial tokens based on Unicode script
and category properties. This approach enables a simple, rule-based
pretokenization strategy that respects script boundaries, offering a robust
alternative to pretokenization strategies based on regular expressions. We also
introduce and validate a constrained BPE merging strategy that enforces
character integrity, applicable to both SCRIPT-BPE and byte-based BPE. Our
experiments demonstrate that SCRIPT-BPE achieves competitive compression while
eliminating encoding-based penalties for non-Latin-script languages.

Abstract: We explore a method for improving the performance of large language models
through self-reflection and reinforcement learning. By incentivizing the model
to generate better self-reflections when it answers incorrectly, we demonstrate
that a model's ability to solve complex, verifiable tasks can be enhanced even
when generating synthetic data is infeasible and only binary feedback is
available. Our framework operates in two stages: first, upon failing a given
task, the model generates a self-reflective commentary analyzing its previous
attempt; second, the model is given another attempt at the task with the
self-reflection in context. If the subsequent attempt succeeds, the tokens
generated during the self-reflection phase are rewarded. Our experimental
results show substantial performance gains across a variety of model
architectures, as high as 34.7% improvement at math equation writing and 18.1%
improvement at function calling. Notably, smaller fine-tuned models (1.5
billion to 7 billion parameters) outperform models in the same family that are
10 times larger. Our novel paradigm is thus an exciting pathway to more useful

Abstract: Dataset diversity plays a pivotal role for the successful training of many
machine learning models, particularly in the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage
of large language model (LLM) development. Despite increasing recognition of
its importance, systematic analyses of dataset diversity still remain
underexplored. To address this gap, this work presents a systematic taxonomy of
existing diversity-control strategies, which primarily focus on the instruction
component, operating at either macroscopic (entire instruction semantics) or
mesoscopic levels (instruction units), and furthermore introduces a novel
analysis of microscopic diversity within the response component, specifically
analyzing the statistical distribution of tokens in SFT training samples. In
the experimental evaluation, we construct fixed-size datasets (e.g., 10,000
samples each) from a corpus of 117,000 open-source SFT samples, incorporating
six distinct diversity-control strategies spanning macro-, meso-, and
microscopic levels applied to both instructions and responses. We then
fine-tune LLMs on these datasets to assess the six diversity-control
strategies. Results reveal that while macroscopic and mesoscopic strategies
lead to higher performance with increasing diversity, the microscopic strategy
in responses exhibits both a stronger correlation between model performance and
the degree of diversity and superior performance with maximum diversity across
all strategies. These findings offer actionable insights for constructing
high-performance SFT datasets.

Result: 认知标记在分布内表现稳定，但在分布外不一致，表明其用于置信度估计的可靠性存在问题。

Conclusion: 需要改进认知标记与模型实际不确定性之间的对齐，以提高置信度估计的可靠性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in high-stakes domains,
accurately assessing their confidence is crucial. Humans typically express
confidence through epistemic markers (e.g., "fairly confident") instead of
numerical values. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs consistently use
these markers to reflect their intrinsic confidence due to the difficulty of
quantifying uncertainty associated with various markers. To address this gap,
we first define marker confidence as the observed accuracy when a model employs
an epistemic marker. We evaluate its stability across multiple
question-answering datasets in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution
settings for open-source and proprietary LLMs. Our results show that while
markers generalize well within the same distribution, their confidence is
inconsistent in out-of-distribution scenarios. These findings raise significant
concerns about the reliability of epistemic markers for confidence estimation,
underscoring the need for improved alignment between marker based confidence
and actual model uncertainty. Our code is available at

Method: 在BERT、Pythia 160M和1.4B等模型上进行单周期预训练实验，比较不同dropout水平对下游任务的影响。

Result: 不使用dropout时，语言建模、BLiMP、SQuAD和MNLI等任务性能更优，且模型编辑效果更好。

Conclusion: 建议在单周期预训练中不使用dropout。

Abstract: Originally, dropout was seen as a breakthrough regularization technique that
reduced overfitting and improved performance in almost all applications of deep
learning by reducing overfitting. Yet, single-epoch pretraining tasks common to
modern LLMs yield minimal overfitting, leading to dropout not being used for
large LLMs. Nevertheless, no thorough empirical investigation has been done on
the role of dropout in LM pretraining. Through experiments in single-epoch
pretraining of both masked (BERT) and autoregressive (Pythia 160M and 1.4B) LMs
with varying levels of dropout, we find that downstream performance in language
modeling, morpho-syntax (BLiMP), question answering (SQuAD), and
natural-language inference (MNLI) improves when dropout is not applied during
pretraining. We additionally find that the recently-introduced "early dropout"
also degrades performance over applying no dropout at all. We further
investigate the models' editability, and find that models trained without
dropout are more successful in gradient-based model editing (MEND) and
equivalent in representation-based model editing (ReFT). Therefore, we advocate
to drop dropout during single-epoch pretraining.

Motivation: 当前法律应用中的LLM评估主要关注事实准确性，忽略了语言质量（如清晰度、连贯性、术语准确性），需填补这一空白。

Method: 1. 开发回归模型评估法律文本质量；2. 创建专门的法律问题集；3. 用该框架分析49个LLM。

Result: 1. 模型质量在140亿参数后趋于稳定；2. 工程选择影响有限；3. 推理模型表现优于基础架构。Qwen3系列在性价比上表现最佳。

Conclusion: 研究建立了法律LLM的标准化评估协议，揭示了当前训练数据精炼方法的局限性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in legal applications,
current evaluation benchmarks tend to focus mainly on factual accuracy while
largely neglecting important linguistic quality aspects such as clarity,
coherence, and terminology. To address this gap, we propose three steps: First,
we develop a regression model to evaluate the quality of legal texts based on
clarity, coherence, and terminology. Second, we create a specialized set of
legal questions. Third, we analyze 49 LLMs using this evaluation framework.
  Our analysis identifies three key findings: First, model quality levels off
at 14 billion parameters, with only a marginal improvement of $2.7\%$ noted at
72 billion parameters. Second, engineering choices such as quantization and
context length have a negligible impact, as indicated by statistical
significance thresholds above 0.016. Third, reasoning models consistently
outperform base architectures. A significant outcome of our research is the
release of a ranking list and Pareto analysis, which highlight the Qwen3 series
as the optimal choice for cost-performance tradeoffs. This work not only
establishes standardized evaluation protocols for legal LLMs but also uncovers
fundamental limitations in current training data refinement approaches. Code

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit extensive medical knowledge but are
prone to hallucinations and inaccurate citations, which pose a challenge to
their clinical adoption and regulatory compliance. Current methods, such as
Retrieval Augmented Generation, partially address these issues by grounding
answers in source documents, but hallucinations and low fact-level
explainability persist. In this work, we introduce a novel atomic fact-checking
framework designed to enhance the reliability and explainability of LLMs used
in medical long-form question answering. This method decomposes LLM-generated
responses into discrete, verifiable units called atomic facts, each of which is
independently verified against an authoritative knowledge base of medical
guidelines. This approach enables targeted correction of errors and direct
tracing to source literature, thereby improving the factual accuracy and
explainability of medical Q&A. Extensive evaluation using multi-reader
assessments by medical experts and an automated open Q&A benchmark demonstrated
significant improvements in factual accuracy and explainability. Our framework
achieved up to a 40% overall answer improvement and a 50% hallucination
detection rate. The ability to trace each atomic fact back to the most relevant
chunks from the database provides a granular, transparent explanation of the
generated responses, addressing a major gap in current medical AI applications.
This work represents a crucial step towards more trustworthy and reliable
clinical applications of LLMs, addressing key prerequisites for clinical
application and fostering greater confidence in AI-assisted healthcare.

Motivation: 解决语言模型研究中难以区分记忆与泛化的问题，明确将记忆分为无意记忆和泛化两部分。

Method: 通过完全消除泛化来计算总记忆量，训练不同规模的模型并观察记忆与泛化的关系。

Result: 发现模型在容量填满后开始“顿悟”，无意记忆减少，泛化能力增强。训练了数百个模型，建立了容量与数据规模的缩放规律。

Conclusion: 该方法为模型容量和记忆行为提供了量化工具，有助于理解模型的学习动态。

Abstract: We propose a new method for estimating how much a model ``knows'' about a
datapoint and use it to measure the capacity of modern language models. Prior
studies of language model memorization have struggled to disentangle
memorization from generalization. We formally separate memorization into two
components: \textit{unintended memorization}, the information a model contains
about a specific dataset, and \textit{generalization}, the information a model
contains about the true data-generation process. When we completely eliminate
generalization, we can compute the total memorization, which provides an
estimate of model capacity: our measurements estimate that GPT-style models
have a capacity of approximately 3.6 bits per parameter. We train language
models on datasets of increasing size and observe that models memorize until
their capacity fills, at which point ``grokking'' begins, and unintended
memorization decreases as models begin to generalize. We train hundreds of
transformer language models ranging from $500K$ to $1.5B$ parameters and
produce a series of scaling laws relating model capacity and data size to
membership inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在表达虚假信息时往往使用肯定语言，导致用户过度依赖和信任受损，因此需要研究如何使LLM的不确定性表达更忠实反映其内在不确定性。

Method: 通过系统研究LLM的忠实性校准能力，评估多种模型、数据集和提示策略，并提出了MetaFaith方法，一种基于人类元认知的提示校准方法。

Result: LLM在忠实性校准任务中表现不佳，现有干预措施效果有限；MetaFaith显著提升了忠实性，最高提升61%，人类评估中83%优于原始生成。

Conclusion: MetaFaith是一种有效的忠实性校准方法，填补了LLM不确定性表达领域的空白。

Abstract: A critical component in the trustworthiness of LLMs is reliable uncertainty
communication, yet LLMs often use assertive language when conveying false
claims, leading to over-reliance and eroded trust. We present the first
systematic study of $\textit{faithful confidence calibration}$ of LLMs,
benchmarking models' ability to use linguistic expressions of uncertainty that
$\textit{faithfully reflect}$ their intrinsic uncertainty, across a
comprehensive array of models, datasets, and prompting strategies. Our results
demonstrate that LLMs largely fail at this task, and that existing
interventions are insufficient: standard prompt approaches provide only
marginal gains, and existing, factuality-based calibration techniques can even
harm faithful calibration. To address this critical gap, we introduce
MetaFaith, a novel prompt-based calibration approach inspired by human
metacognition. We show that MetaFaith robustly improves faithful calibration
across diverse models and task domains, enabling up to 61% improvement in
faithfulness and achieving an 83% win rate over original generations as judged
by humans.

Abstract: This paper presents AlphaOne ($\alpha$1), a universal framework for
modulating reasoning progress in large reasoning models (LRMs) at test time.
$\alpha$1 first introduces $\alpha$ moment, which represents the scaled
thinking phase with a universal parameter $\alpha$. Within this scaled
pre-$\alpha$ moment phase, it dynamically schedules slow thinking transitions
by modeling the insertion of reasoning transition tokens as a Bernoulli
stochastic process. After the $\alpha$ moment, $\alpha$1 deterministically
terminates slow thinking with the end-of-thinking token, thereby fostering fast
reasoning and efficient answer generation. This approach unifies and
generalizes existing monotonic scaling methods by enabling flexible and dense
slow-to-fast reasoning modulation. Extensive empirical studies on various
challenging benchmarks across mathematical, coding, and scientific domains
demonstrate $\alpha$1's superior reasoning capability and efficiency. Project

Conclusion: 该方法为高效、可扩展的LLM部署提供了潜力。

Abstract: Large language models excel at many tasks but often incur high inference
costs during deployment. To mitigate hallucination, many systems use a
knowledge graph to enhance retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG). However,
the large amount of retrieved knowledge contexts increase these inference costs
further. A promising solution to balance performance and cost is LLM routing,
which directs simple queries to smaller LLMs and complex ones to larger LLMs.
However, no dedicated routing methods currently exist for RAG, and existing
training-based routers face challenges scaling to this domain due to the need
for extensive training data. We observe that the score distributions produced
by the retrieval scorer strongly correlate with query difficulty. Based on
this, we propose a novel, training-free routing framework, the first tailored
to KG-RAG that effectively balances performance and cost in a plug-and-play
manner. Experiments show our method reduces calls to larger LLMs by up to 50%
without sacrificing response quality, demonstrating its potential for efficient
and scalable LLM deployment.

Method: 研究首先评估了四种最先进的VLMs在PAIRS和SocialCounterfactuals数据集上的表现，发现模型存在性别和种族偏见。随后提出了一种后处理方法，通过调整隐藏层的残差来减少偏见。

Result: 研究发现VLMs的隐藏层在公平性水平上存在显著波动，某些残差会加剧偏见。提出的后处理方法优于其他训练策略，显著提高了模型的公平性和置信度可靠性。

Abstract: Social bias is a critical issue in large vision-language models (VLMs), where
fairness- and ethics-related problems harm certain groups of people in society.
It is unknown to what extent VLMs yield social bias in generative responses. In
this study, we focus on evaluating and mitigating social bias on both the
model's response and probability distribution. To do so, we first evaluate four
state-of-the-art VLMs on PAIRS and SocialCounterfactuals datasets with the
multiple-choice selection task. Surprisingly, we find that models suffer from
generating gender-biased or race-biased responses. We also observe that models
are prone to stating their responses are fair, but indeed having mis-calibrated
confidence levels towards particular social groups. While investigating why
VLMs are unfair in this study, we observe that VLMs' hidden layers exhibit
substantial fluctuations in fairness levels. Meanwhile, residuals in each layer
show mixed effects on fairness, with some contributing positively while some
lead to increased bias. Based on these findings, we propose a post-hoc method
for the inference stage to mitigate social bias, which is training-free and
model-agnostic. We achieve this by ablating bias-associated residuals while
amplifying fairness-associated residuals on model hidden layers during
inference. We demonstrate that our post-hoc method outperforms the competing
training strategies, helping VLMs have fairer responses and more reliable
confidence levels.

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) in clinical settings faces critical

performance, pose risks to sensitive clinical data privacy, while local LLMs
preserve privacy but often fail at complex clinical interpretation tasks. We
propose MedOrchestra, a hybrid framework where a cloud LLM decomposes complex
clinical tasks into manageable subtasks and prompt generation, while a local
LLM executes these subtasks in a privacy-preserving manner. Without accessing
clinical data, the cloud LLM generates and validates subtask prompts using
clinical guidelines and synthetic test cases. The local LLM executes subtasks
locally and synthesizes outputs generated by the cloud LLM. We evaluate
MedOrchestra on pancreatic cancer staging using 100 radiology reports under
NCCN guidelines. On free-text reports, MedOrchestra achieves 70.21% accuracy,
outperforming local model baselines (without guideline: 48.94%, with guideline:

Abstract: If AI models can detect when they are being evaluated, the effectiveness of
evaluations might be compromised. For example, models could have systematically
different behavior during evaluations, leading to less reliable benchmarks for
deployment and governance decisions. We investigate whether frontier language
models can accurately classify transcripts based on whether they originate from
evaluations or real-world deployment, a capability we call evaluation
awareness. To achieve this, we construct a diverse benchmark of 1,000 prompts
and transcripts from 61 distinct datasets. These span public benchmarks (e.g.,
MMLU, SWEBench), real-world deployment interactions, and agent trajectories
from scaffolding frameworks (e.g., web-browsing agents). Frontier models
clearly demonstrate above-random evaluation awareness (Gemini-2.5-Pro reaches
an AUC of $0.83$), but do not yet surpass our simple human baseline (AUC of
$0.92$). Furthermore, both AI models and humans are better at identifying
evaluations in agentic settings compared to chat settings. Additionally, we
test whether models can identify the purpose of the evaluation. Under
multiple-choice and open-ended questioning, AI models far outperform random
chance in identifying what an evaluation is testing for. Our results indicate
that frontier models already exhibit a substantial, though not yet superhuman,
level of evaluation-awareness. We recommend tracking this capability in future
models.

Result: 在三个数据集上性能提升5%-10%，达到SOTA。

Conclusion: CoMaPOI通过协作代理解决了LLM在复杂时空任务中的挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for the next
Point-Of-Interest (POI) prediction task, leveraging their capabilities in
semantic understanding of POI trajectories. However, previous LLM-based
methods, which are superficially adapted to next POI prediction, largely
overlook critical challenges associated with applying LLMs to this task.
Specifically, LLMs encounter two critical challenges: (1) a lack of intrinsic
understanding of numeric spatiotemporal data, which hinders accurate modeling
of users' spatiotemporal distributions and preferences; and (2) an excessively
large and unconstrained candidate POI space, which often results in random or
irrelevant predictions. To address these issues, we propose a Collaborative
Multi Agent Framework for Next POI Prediction, named CoMaPOI. Through the close
interaction of three specialized agents (Profiler, Forecaster, and Predictor),
CoMaPOI collaboratively addresses the two critical challenges. The Profiler
agent is responsible for converting numeric data into language descriptions,
enhancing semantic understanding. The Forecaster agent focuses on dynamically
constraining and refining the candidate POI space. The Predictor agent
integrates this information to generate high-precision predictions. Extensive
experiments on three benchmark datasets (NYC, TKY, and CA) demonstrate that
CoMaPOI achieves state of the art performance, improving all metrics by 5% to
10% compared to SOTA baselines. This work pioneers the investigation of
challenges associated with applying LLMs to complex spatiotemporal tasks by
leveraging tailored collaborative agents.

Abstracts, Methods sections, and data dictionary descriptions of the dataset.
  Results: We extracted 35 key findings described in the Abstracts across 5
Alzheimer's studies. On average, LLM agents approximately reproduced 53.2% of
findings per study. Numeric values and range-based findings often differed
between studies and agents. The agents also applied statistical methods or
parameters that varied from the originals, though overall trends and
significance were sometimes similar.
  Discussion: In some cases, LLM-based agents replicated research techniques
and findings. In others, they failed due to implementation flaws or missing
methodological detail. These discrepancies show the current limits of LLMs in
fully automating reproducibility assessments. Still, this early investigation
highlights the potential of structured agent-based systems to provide scalable
evaluation of scientific rigor.
  Conclusion: This exploratory work illustrates both the promise and

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on

relevance estimates to those for LLMs, and further evaluate the impact of these
"relevant" subsets on downstream task performance for both physician trainees

Rationales can, at times, improve model reliability, even outperforming their

performance and reliability improvements, while both are driven by the
intrinsic difficulty of the task. These findings provide informative

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in simulating human
behaviors and performing theory-of-mind (ToM) reasoning, a crucial skill for
complex social interactions. In this study, we investigate the role of ToM
reasoning in aligning agentic behaviors with human norms in negotiation tasks,
using the ultimatum game as a controlled environment. We initialized LLM agents
with different prosocial beliefs (including Greedy, Fair, and Selfless) and
reasoning methods like chain-of-thought (CoT) and varying ToM levels, and
examined their decision-making processes across diverse LLMs, including
reasoning models like o3-mini and DeepSeek-R1 Distilled Qwen 32B. Results from
2,700 simulations indicated that ToM reasoning enhances behavior alignment,
decision-making consistency, and negotiation outcomes. Consistent with previous
findings, reasoning models exhibit limited capability compared to models with
ToM reasoning, different roles of the game benefits with different orders of
ToM reasoning. Our findings contribute to the understanding of ToM's role in
enhancing human-AI interaction and cooperative decision-making. The code used

Motivation: 中文有毒内容检测对LLMs具有挑战性，尤其是多模态扰动内容易使SOTA LLMs失效，需探索解决方案。

Method: 提出3种扰动策略和8种具体方法，构建数据集，评估9种LLMs，并尝试ICL和SFT增强。

Result: LLMs对扰动多模态中文内容检测能力弱，ICL/SFT可能导致过度修正。

Conclusion: 需改进LLMs对多模态中文内容的鲁棒性，避免微调带来的负面影响。

Abstract: Detecting toxic content using language models is important but challenging.
While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
understanding Chinese, recent studies show that simple character substitutions
in toxic Chinese text can easily confuse the state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs. In
this paper, we highlight the multimodal nature of Chinese language as a key
challenge for deploying LLMs in toxic Chinese detection. First, we propose a
taxonomy of 3 perturbation strategies and 8 specific approaches in toxic
Chinese content. Then, we curate a dataset based on this taxonomy, and
benchmark 9 SOTA LLMs (from both the US and China) to assess if they can detect
perturbed toxic Chinese text. Additionally, we explore cost-effective
enhancement solutions like in-context learning (ICL) and supervised fine-tuning
(SFT). Our results reveal two important findings. (1) LLMs are less capable of
detecting perturbed multimodal Chinese toxic contents. (2) ICL or SFT with a
small number of perturbed examples may cause the LLMs "overcorrect'':
misidentify many normal Chinese contents as toxic.

Abstract: Recent studies on personas have improved the way Large Language Models (LLMs)
interact with users. However, the effect of personas on domain-specific
question-answering (QA) tasks remains a subject of debate. This study analyzes
whether personas enhance specialized QA performance by introducing two types of
persona: Profession-Based Personas (PBPs) (e.g., scientist), which directly
relate to domain expertise, and Occupational Personality-Based Personas (OPBPs)
(e.g., scientific person), which reflect cognitive tendencies rather than
explicit expertise. Through empirical evaluations across multiple scientific
domains, we demonstrate that while PBPs can slightly improve accuracy, OPBPs
often degrade performance, even when semantically related to the task. Our
findings suggest that persona relevance alone does not guarantee effective
knowledge utilization and that they may impose cognitive constraints that
hinder optimal knowledge application. Future research can explore how nuanced
distinctions in persona representations guide LLMs, potentially contributing to
reasoning and knowledge retrieval that more closely mirror human social
conceptualization.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) have
enabled the creation of highly realistic synthetic content, raising concerns
about the potential for malicious use, such as misinformation and manipulation.
Moreover, detecting Machine-Generated Text (MGT) remains challenging due to the
lack of robust benchmarks that assess generalization to real-world scenarios.
In this work, we present a pipeline to test the resilience of state-of-the-art
MGT detectors (e.g., Mage, Radar, LLM-DetectAIve) to linguistically informed
adversarial attacks. To challenge the detectors, we fine-tune language models
using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to shift the MGT style toward
human-written text (HWT). This exploits the detectors' reliance on stylistic
clues, making new generations more challenging to detect. Additionally, we
analyze the linguistic shifts induced by the alignment and which features are
used by detectors to detect MGT texts. Our results show that detectors can be
easily fooled with relatively few examples, resulting in a significant drop in
detection performance. This highlights the importance of improving detection
methods and making them robust to unseen in-domain texts.

Abstract: The availability of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a unique
opportunity to reinvigorate research on Knowledge Engineering (KE) automation,
a trend already evident in recent efforts developing LLM-based methods and
tools for the automatic generation of Competency Questions (CQs). However, the
evaluation of these tools lacks standardisation. This undermines the
methodological rigour and hinders the replication and comparison of results. To
address this gap, we introduce Bench4KE, an extensible API-based benchmarking
system for KE automation. Its first release focuses on evaluating tools that
generate CQs automatically. CQs are natural language questions used by ontology
engineers to define the functional requirements of an ontology. Bench4KE
provides a curated gold standard consisting of CQ datasets from four real-world
ontology projects. It uses a suite of similarity metrics to assess the quality
of the CQs generated. We present a comparative analysis of four recent CQ
generation systems, which are based on LLMs, establishing a baseline for future
research. Bench4KE is also designed to accommodate additional KE automation
tasks, such as SPARQL query generation, ontology testing and drafting. Code and

accordingly, our framework encourages strategies such as batching and caching
to mitigate inference costs. We show that algorithms optimal in the classical
setting can lose efficiency when LLM inferences dominate the cost under certain
optimizations.

Abstract: The scientific literature is growing rapidly, making it hard to keep track of
the state-of-the-art. Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) aim to identify and
evaluate all relevant papers on a topic. After retrieving a set of candidate
papers, the abstract screening phase determines initial relevance. To date,
abstract screening methods using large language models (LLMs) focus on binary
classification settings; existing question answering (QA) based ranking
approaches suffer from error propagation. LLMs offer a unique opportunity to
evaluate the SLR's inclusion and exclusion criteria, yet, existing benchmarks
do not provide them exhaustively. We manually extract these criteria as well as
research questions for 57 SLRs, mostly in the medical domain, enabling
principled comparisons between approaches. Moreover, we propose LGAR, a
zero-shot LLM Guided Abstract Ranker composed of an LLM based graded relevance
scorer and a dense re-ranker. Our extensive experiments show that LGAR
outperforms existing QA-based methods by 5-10 pp. in mean average precision.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in automated story

Abstract: To fully leverage the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in a
trustworthy manner, it is desirable to couple multiple AI and non-AI systems
together seamlessly for constraining and ensuring correctness of the output.
This paper introduces a novel parallel discrete event simulation (PDES) based
methodology to combine multiple AI and non-AI agents in a causal, rule-based
way. Our approach tightly integrates the concept of passage of time, with each
agent considered as an entity in the PDES framework and responding to prior
requests from other agents. Such coupling mechanism enables the agents to work
in a co-operative environment towards a common goal while many tasks run in
parallel throughout the simulation. It further enables setting up boundaries to
the outputs of the AI agents by applying necessary dynamic constraints using
non-AI agents while allowing for scalability through deployment of hundreds of
such agents in a larger compute cluster. Distributing smaller AI agents can
enable extremely scalable simulations in the future, addressing local memory
bottlenecks for model parameter storage. Within a PDES involving both AI and
non-AI agents, we break down the problem at hand into structured steps, when
necessary, providing a set of multiple choices to the AI agents, and then
progressively solve these steps towards a final goal. At each step, the non-AI
agents act as unbiased auditors, verifying each action by the AI agents so that
certain rules of engagement are followed. We evaluate our approach by solving
four problems from four different domains and comparing the results with those
from AI models alone. Our results show greater accuracy in solving problems
from various domains where the AI models struggle to solve the problems solely
by themselves. Results show that overall accuracy of our approach is 68% where
as the accuracy of vanilla models is less than 23%.

constructing high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets with minimal
sample requirements, with a forward-looking design that extends to both
pretraining and posttraining phases; (2) enhanced multimodal reasoning
capabilities for cross-modal integration and clinical task understanding; and
(3) a systematic evaluation system that assesses model performance across
medical modalities and task types. Our experiments demonstrate that Infi-Med
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in general medical reasoning while
maintaining rapid adaptability to clinical scenarios. The framework establishes
a solid foundation for deploying MLLMs in real-world healthcare settings by
balancing model effectiveness with operational constraints.

different combinations of tags into the original instructions. Experiments with
multiple backbones in diverse domain benchmarks show that the proposed method
generates significantly better evolved data than other methods. Furthermore, we
conduct a thorough analysis of the evolved data, demonstrating that Tag-Evol is

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) error correction aims to correct
recognition errors while preserving accurate text. Although traditional
approaches demonstrate moderate effectiveness, LLMs offer a paradigm that
eliminates the need for training and labeled data. However, directly using LLMs
will encounter hallucinations problem, which may lead to the modification of
the correct text. To address this problem, we propose the Reliable LLM
Correction Framework (RLLM-CF), which consists of three stages: (1) error
pre-detection, (2) chain-of-thought sub-tasks iterative correction, and (3)
reasoning process verification. The advantage of our method is that it does not
require additional information or fine-tuning of the model, and ensures the
correctness of the LLM correction under multi-pass programming. Experiments on
AISHELL-1, AISHELL-2, and Librispeech show that the GPT-4o model enhanced by
our framework achieves 21%, 11%, 9%, and 11.4% relative reductions in CER/WER.

Abstract: Large language models and vision-language models (which we jointly call LMs)

fields. However, their capabilities in affective analysis (i.e. sentiment

complexity of affective analysis tasks. In this paper, we introduce MMAFFBen,
the first extensive open-source benchmark for multilingual multimodal affective
analysis. MMAFFBen encompasses text, image, and video modalities across 35
languages, covering four key affective analysis tasks: sentiment polarity,
sentiment intensity, emotion classification, and emotion intensity. Moreover,
we construct the MMAFFIn dataset for fine-tuning LMs on affective analysis
tasks, and further develop MMAFFLM-3b and MMAFFLM-7b based on it. We evaluate
various representative LMs, including GPT-4o-mini, providing a systematic

Abstract: In an era of exponential scientific growth, identifying novel research ideas
is crucial and challenging in academia. Despite potential, the lack of an
appropriate benchmark dataset hinders the research of novelty detection. More
importantly, simply adopting existing NLP technologies, e.g., retrieving and
then cross-checking, is not a one-size-fits-all solution due to the gap between
textual similarity and idea conception. In this paper, we propose to harness
large language models (LLMs) for scientific novelty detection (ND), associated
with two new datasets in marketing and NLP domains. To construct the
considerate datasets for ND, we propose to extract closure sets of papers based
on their relationship, and then summarize their main ideas based on LLMs. To
capture idea conception, we propose to train a lightweight retriever by
distilling the idea-level knowledge from LLMs to align ideas with similar
conception, enabling efficient and accurate idea retrieval for LLM novelty
detection. Experiments show our method consistently outperforms others on the
proposed benchmark datasets for idea retrieval and ND tasks. Codes and data are

TL;DR: 论文研究了在机器翻译场景中，四种质量反馈机制对用户决策准确性和适当依赖的影响，发现隐式反馈（尤其是QA表格）效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统在日常生活中的广泛应用，用户需要反馈机制来负责任地使用AI，尤其是在无法评估AI预测质量的场景中。

Method: 比较了四种质量反馈机制：显式反馈（错误高亮和LLM解释）和隐式反馈（回译和QA表格），在机器翻译场景中测试用户决策。

Result: 除错误高亮外，所有反馈类型均显著提升决策准确性和适当依赖；隐式反馈（尤其是QA表格）效果最佳。

Conclusion: 隐式反馈（如QA表格）在提升决策准确性、用户信任和减轻心理负担方面优于显式反馈。

Abstract: As people increasingly use AI systems in work and daily life, feedback
mechanisms that help them use AI responsibly are urgently needed, particularly
in settings where users are not equipped to assess the quality of AI
predictions. We study a realistic Machine Translation (MT) scenario where
monolingual users decide whether to share an MT output, first without and then
with quality feedback. We compare four types of quality feedback: explicit
feedback that directly give users an assessment of translation quality using 1)
error highlights and 2) LLM explanations, and implicit feedback that helps
users compare MT inputs and outputs through 3) backtranslation and 4)
question-answer (QA) tables. We find that all feedback types, except error
highlights, significantly improve both decision accuracy and appropriate
reliance. Notably, implicit feedback, especially QA tables, yields
significantly greater gains than explicit feedback in terms of decision
accuracy, appropriate reliance, and user perceptions, receiving the highest
ratings for helpfulness and trust, and the lowest for mental burden.

Motivation: 现有方法在生成动态文本嵌入时需要重新编码整个语料库，计算开销大。GSTransform旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 基于Guided Space Transformation，利用预计算嵌入中的指令相关信息，通过轻量级转换机制实时调整嵌入。

Result: 在三个指令感知下游任务和九个真实数据集上，GSTransform在质量和效率上均优于现有方法，速度提升6~300倍。

Conclusion: GSTransform是一种高效且高质量的指令跟随文本嵌入解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate an important task named instruction-following
text embedding, which generates dynamic text embeddings that adapt to user
instructions, highlighting specific attributes of text. Despite recent
advancements, existing approaches suffer from significant computational
overhead, as they require re-encoding the entire corpus for each new
instruction. To address this challenge, we propose GSTransform, a novel
instruction-following text embedding framework based on Guided Space
Transformation. Our key observation is that instruction-relevant information is
inherently encoded in generic embeddings but remains underutilized. Instead of
repeatedly encoding the corpus for each instruction, GSTransform is a
lightweight transformation mechanism that adapts pre-computed embeddings in
real time to align with user instructions, guided by a small amount of text
data with instruction-focused label annotation. We conduct extensive
experiments on three instruction-awareness downstream tasks across nine
real-world datasets, demonstrating that GSTransform improves
instruction-following text embedding quality over state-of-the-art methods
while achieving dramatic speedups of 6~300x in real-time processing on
large-scale datasets. The source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 少样本提示在有限标注数据下高效推理，但其性能依赖示例选择质量。HED-LM通过混合选择流程解决这一问题。

Method: HED-LM采用混合选择流程：先基于欧氏距离筛选候选示例，再用LLM评分上下文相关性重新排序。

Result: 在疲劳检测任务中，HED-LM的宏F1分数为69.13±10.71%，优于随机选择（59.30±10.13%）和仅距离过滤（67.61±11.39%）。

Conclusion: HED-LM结合数值相似性和上下文相关性，提升了少样本提示的鲁棒性，适用于医疗监测、工业安全等场景。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot optimization with HED-LM (Hybrid
Euclidean Distance with Large Language Models) to improve example selection for
sensor-based classification tasks. While few-shot prompting enables efficient
inference with limited labeled data, its performance largely depends on the
quality of selected examples. HED-LM addresses this challenge through a hybrid
selection pipeline that filters candidate examples based on Euclidean distance
and re-ranks them using contextual relevance scored by large language models
(LLMs). To validate its effectiveness, we apply HED-LM to a fatigue detection
task using accelerometer data characterized by overlapping patterns and high
inter-subject variability. Unlike simpler tasks such as activity recognition,
fatigue detection demands more nuanced example selection due to subtle
differences in physiological signals. Our experiments show that HED-LM achieves
a mean macro F1-score of 69.13$\pm$10.71%, outperforming both random selection
(59.30$\pm$10.13%) and distance-only filtering (67.61$\pm$11.39%). These
represent relative improvements of 16.6% and 2.3%, respectively. The results
confirm that combining numerical similarity with contextual relevance improves
the robustness of few-shot prompting. Overall, HED-LM offers a practical
solution to improve performance in real-world sensor-based learning tasks and
shows potential for broader applications in healthcare monitoring, human
activity recognition, and industrial safety scenarios.

Motivation: 抑郁症检测通常仅使用单一模态，而多模态数据（如语音、声学特征和生物标志物）能提供更全面的信息。青少年抑郁症常伴随其他症状（如自杀倾向和睡眠障碍），多任务学习和纵向分析能进一步提升检测效果。

Abstract: Speech is a noninvasive digital phenotype that can offer valuable insights
into mental health conditions, but it is often treated as a single modality. In
contrast, we propose the treatment of patient speech data as a trimodal
multimedia data source for depression detection. This study explores the
potential of large language model-based architectures for speech-based
depression prediction in a multimodal regime that integrates speech-derived
text, acoustic landmarks, and vocal biomarkers. Adolescent depression presents
a significant challenge and is often comorbid with multiple disorders, such as
suicidal ideation and sleep disturbances. This presents an additional
opportunity to integrate multi-task learning (MTL) into our study by
simultaneously predicting depression, suicidal ideation, and sleep disturbances
using the multimodal formulation. We also propose a longitudinal analysis
strategy that models temporal changes across multiple clinical interactions,
allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the conditions' progression. Our
proposed approach, featuring trimodal, longitudinal MTL is evaluated on the
Depression Early Warning dataset. It achieves a balanced accuracy of 70.8%,
which is higher than each of the unimodal, single-task, and non-longitudinal
methods.

Result: 实验表明，提出的动态提示方案优于静态提示方法。

Conclusion: RAG-based动态提示能有效提升LLMs在因果关系任务中的表现。

Abstract: Causality detection and mining are important tasks in information retrieval
due to their enormous use in information extraction, and knowledge graph
construction. To solve these tasks, in existing literature there exist several
solutions -- both unsupervised and supervised. However, the unsupervised
methods suffer from poor performance and they often require significant human
intervention for causal rule selection, leading to poor generalization across
different domains. On the other hand, supervised methods suffer from the lack
of large training datasets. Recently, large language models (LLMs) with
effective prompt engineering are found to be effective to overcome the issue of
unavailability of large training dataset. Yet, in existing literature, there
does not exist comprehensive works on causality detection and mining using LLM
prompting. In this paper, we present several retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) based dynamic prompting schemes to enhance LLM performance in causality
detection and extraction tasks. Extensive experiments over three datasets and
five LLMs validate the superiority of our proposed RAG-based dynamic prompting
over other static prompting schemes.

Conclusion: LKD-KGC在构建高质量领域特定知识图谱方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) structure real-world entities and their relationships
into triples, enhancing machine reasoning for various tasks. While
domain-specific KGs offer substantial benefits, their manual construction is
often inefficient and requires specialized knowledge. Recent approaches for
knowledge graph construction (KGC) based on large language models (LLMs), such
as schema-guided KGC and reference knowledge integration, have proven
efficient. However, these methods are constrained by their reliance on manually
defined schema, single-document processing, and public-domain references,
making them less effective for domain-specific corpora that exhibit complex
knowledge dependencies and specificity, as well as limited reference knowledge.
To address these challenges, we propose LKD-KGC, a novel framework for
unsupervised domain-specific KG construction. LKD-KGC autonomously analyzes
document repositories to infer knowledge dependencies, determines optimal
processing sequences via LLM driven prioritization, and autoregressively
generates entity schema by integrating hierarchical inter-document contexts.
This schema guides the unsupervised extraction of entities and relationships,
eliminating reliance on predefined structures or external knowledge. Extensive
experiments show that compared with state-of-the-art baselines, LKD-KGC
generally achieves improvements of 10% to 20% in both precision and recall
rate, demonstrating its potential in constructing high-quality domain-specific
KGs.

Abstract: Any-to-any generative models aim to enable seamless interpretation and
generation across multiple modalities within a unified framework, yet their
ability to preserve relationships across modalities remains uncertain. Do
unified models truly achieve cross-modal coherence, or is this coherence merely
perceived? To explore this, we introduce ACON, a dataset of 1,000 images (500
newly contributed) paired with captions, editing instructions, and Q&A pairs to
evaluate cross-modal transfers rigorously. Using three consistency
criteria-cyclic consistency, forward equivariance, and conjugated
equivariance-our experiments reveal that any-to-any models do not consistently
demonstrate greater cross-modal consistency than specialized models in
pointwise evaluations such as cyclic consistency. However, equivariance
evaluations uncover weak but observable consistency through structured analyses
of the intermediate latent space enabled by multiple editing operations. We

Abstract: Endowing dialogue agents with persona information has proven to significantly
improve the consistency and diversity of their generations. While much focus
has been placed on aligning dialogues with provided personas, the adaptation to
the interlocutor's profile remains largely underexplored. In this work, we
investigate three key aspects: (1) a model's ability to align responses with
both the provided persona and the interlocutor's; (2) its robustness when
dealing with familiar versus unfamiliar interlocutors and topics, and (3) the
impact of additional fine-tuning on specific persona-based dialogues. We
evaluate dialogues generated with diverse speaker pairings and topics, framing
the evaluation as an author identification task and employing both
LLM-as-a-judge and human evaluations. By systematically masking or disclosing
information about the interlocutor, we assess its impact on dialogue
generation. Results show that access to the interlocutor's persona improves the
recognition of the target speaker, while masking it does the opposite. Although
models generalise well across topics, they struggle with unfamiliar
interlocutors. Finally, we found that in zero-shot settings, LLMs often copy
biographical details, facilitating identification but trivialising the task.

LLMs for decryption accuracy and semantic comprehension across different
encryption schemes. Our findings reveal key insights into the strengths and

Abstract: Labor market analysis relies on extracting insights from job advertisements,

extraction efficiency and performance, achieving state-of-the-art results with
a lightweight bi-encoder model. To support robust evaluation, we introduce
\textbf{Skill-XL}, a new benchmark with exhaustive, sentence-level skill
annotations that explicitly address the redundancy in the large label space.
Finally, we present \textbf{JobBERT V2}, an improved job title normalization
model that leverages extracted skills to produce high-quality job title

Conclusion: PRISM通过显式关联偏见维度，增强了嵌入的预测能力和可解释性。

Abstract: Semantic Text Embedding is a fundamental NLP task that encodes textual
content into vector representations, where proximity in the embedding space
reflects semantic similarity. While existing embedding models excel at
capturing general meaning, they often overlook ideological nuances, limiting
their effectiveness in tasks that require an understanding of political bias.
To address this gap, we introduce PRISM, the first framework designed to
Produce inteRpretable polItical biaS eMbeddings. PRISM operates in two key
stages: (1) Controversial Topic Bias Indicator Mining, which systematically
extracts fine-grained political topics and their corresponding bias indicators
from weakly labeled news data, and (2) Cross-Encoder Political Bias Embedding,
which assigns structured bias scores to news articles based on their alignment
with these indicators. This approach ensures that embeddings are explicitly
tied to bias-revealing dimensions, enhancing both interpretability and
predictive power. Through extensive experiments on two large-scale datasets, we
demonstrate that PRISM outperforms state-of-the-art text embedding models in
political bias classification while offering highly interpretable
representations that facilitate diversified retrieval and ideological analysis.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have experienced rapid development
in recent years. However, in the financial domain, there is a notable lack of
effective and specialized multimodal evaluation datasets. To advance the
development of MLLMs in the finance domain, we introduce FinMME, encompassing
more than 11,000 high-quality financial research samples across 18 financial
domains and 6 asset classes, featuring 10 major chart types and 21 subtypes. We
ensure data quality through 20 annotators and carefully designed validation
mechanisms. Additionally, we develop FinScore, an evaluation system
incorporating hallucination penalties and multi-dimensional capability
assessment to provide an unbiased evaluation. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o exhibit
unsatisfactory performance on FinMME, highlighting its challenging nature. The
benchmark exhibits high robustness with prediction variations under different
prompts remaining below 1%, demonstrating superior reliability compared to
existing datasets. Our dataset and evaluation protocol are available at

Conclusion: MHIM方法有效提升了抑郁检测任务的可解释性和性能。

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical need for improved explainability in
text-based depression detection. While offering predictive outcomes, current
solutions often overlook the understanding of model predictions which can
hinder trust in the system. We propose the use of Masked Hard Instance Mining
(MHIM) to enhance the explainability in the depression detection task. MHIM
strategically masks attention weights within the model, compelling it to
distribute attention across a wider range of salient features. We evaluate MHIM
on two datasets representing distinct languages: Thai (Thai-Maywe) and English
(DAIC-WOZ). Our results demonstrate that MHIM significantly improves
performance in terms of both prediction accuracy and explainability metrics.

Abstract: Suicidal thoughts and behaviors are increasingly recognized as a critical
societal concern, highlighting the urgent need for effective tools to enable
early detection of suicidal risk. In this work, we develop robust machine
learning models that leverage Reddit posts to automatically classify them into
four distinct levels of suicide risk severity. We frame this as a multi-class

the deep contextual embeddings from Robustly Optimized BERT Approach (RoBERTa),
a state-of-the-art deep learning transformer model, with the statistical
term-weighting of TF-IDF, further compressed with PCA, to boost the accuracy
and reliability of suicide risk assessment. To address data imbalance and
overfitting, we explore various data resampling techniques and data
augmentation strategies to enhance model generalization. Additionally, we
compare our model's performance against that of using RoBERTa only, the BERT
model and other traditional machine learning classifiers. Experimental results
demonstrate that the hybrid model can achieve improved performance, giving a
best weighted $F_{1}$ score of 0.7512.

Conclusion: SPLAENet在立场检测任务中表现出色，尤其在处理错误信息内容时具有显著优势。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of social media has generated an overwhelming volume of
user-generated content, conveying implicit opinions and contributing to the
spread of misinformation. The method aims to enhance the detection of stance
where misinformation can polarize user opinions. Stance detection has emerged
as a crucial approach to effectively analyze underlying biases in shared
information and combating misinformation. This paper proposes a novel method
for \textbf{S}tance \textbf{P}rediction through a \textbf{L}abel-fused dual
cross-\textbf{A}ttentive \textbf{E}motion-aware neural \textbf{Net}work
(SPLAENet) in misinformative social media user-generated content. The proposed
method employs a dual cross-attention mechanism and a hierarchical attention
network to capture inter and intra-relationships by focusing on the relevant
parts of source text in the context of reply text and vice versa. We
incorporate emotions to effectively distinguish between different stance
categories by leveraging the emotional alignment or divergence between the
texts. We also employ label fusion that uses distance-metric learning to align
extracted features with stance labels, improving the method's ability to
accurately distinguish between stances. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
significant improvements achieved by SPLAENet over existing state-of-the-art
methods. SPLAENet demonstrates an average gain of 8.92\% in accuracy and
17.36\% in F1-score on the RumourEval dataset. On the SemEval dataset, it
achieves average gains of 7.02\% in accuracy and 10.92\% in F1-score. On the
P-stance dataset, it demonstrates average gains of 10.03\% in accuracy and
11.18\% in F1-score. These results validate the effectiveness of the proposed
method for stance detection in the context of misinformative social media
content.

Conclusion: RATAS为教育技术中的自动化评分提供了高效、可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated answer grading is a critical challenge in educational technology,
with the potential to streamline assessment processes, ensure grading
consistency, and provide timely feedback to students. However, existing
approaches are often constrained to specific exam formats, lack
interpretability in score assignment, and struggle with real-world
applicability across diverse subjects and assessment types. To address these
limitations, we introduce RATAS (Rubric Automated Tree-based Answer Scoring), a
novel framework that leverages state-of-the-art generative AI models for
rubric-based grading of textual responses. RATAS is designed to support a wide
range of grading rubrics, enable subject-agnostic evaluation, and generate
structured, explainable rationales for assigned scores. We formalize the
automatic grading task through a mathematical framework tailored to
rubric-based assessment and present an architecture capable of handling
complex, real-world exam structures. To rigorously evaluate our approach, we
construct a unique, contextualized dataset derived from real-world
project-based courses, encompassing diverse response formats and varying levels
of complexity. Empirical results demonstrate that RATAS achieves high
reliability and accuracy in automated grading while providing interpretable
feedback that enhances transparency for both students and nstructors.

Abstract: Retrieving the biological impacts of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is
essential for target identification (Target ID) in drug development. Given the
vast number of proteins involved, this process remains time-consuming and
challenging. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) frameworks have supported Target ID; however, no benchmark currently
exists for identifying the biological impacts of PPIs. To bridge this gap, we
introduce the RAG Benchmark for PPIs (RAGPPI), a factual question-answer
benchmark of 4,420 question-answer pairs that focus on the potential biological
impacts of PPIs. Through interviews with experts, we identified criteria for a
benchmark dataset, such as a type of QA and source. We built a gold-standard
dataset (500 QA pairs) through expert-driven data annotation. We developed an
ensemble auto-evaluation LLM that reflected expert labeling characteristics,
which facilitates the construction of a silver-standard dataset (3,720 QA
pairs). We are committed to maintaining RAGPPI as a resource to support the
research community in advancing RAG systems for drug discovery QA solutions.

Conclusion: ICH-Qwen为ICH的可持续发展提供了理论与实践参考，并为数字人文学科研究开辟新路径。

Abstract: The intangible cultural heritage (ICH) of China, a cultural asset transmitted
across generations by various ethnic groups, serves as a significant testament
to the evolution of human civilization and holds irreplaceable value for the
preservation of historical lineage and the enhancement of cultural
self-confidence. However, the rapid pace of modernization poses formidable
challenges to ICH, including threats damage, disappearance and discontinuity of
inheritance. China has the highest number of items on the UNESCO Intangible
Cultural Heritage List, which is indicative of the nation's abundant cultural
resources and emphasises the pressing need for ICH preservation. In recent
years, the rapid advancements in large language modelling have provided a novel
technological approach for the preservation and dissemination of ICH. This
study utilises a substantial corpus of open-source Chinese ICH data to develop
a large language model, ICH-Qwen, for the ICH domain. The model employs natural
language understanding and knowledge reasoning capabilities of large language
models, augmented with synthetic data and fine-tuning techniques. The
experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of ICH-Qwen in executing tasks
specific to the ICH domain. It is anticipated that the model will provide
intelligent solutions for the protection, inheritance and dissemination of
intangible cultural heritage, as well as new theoretical and practical
references for the sustainable development of intangible cultural heritage.
Furthermore, it is expected that the study will open up new paths for digital
humanities research.

Result: LegalSearchLM在LEGAR BENCH上比基线方法提升6-20%，并在域外案例上表现优于生成模型15%。

Conclusion: LegalSearchLM在规模和多样性上显著优于现有方法，展示了强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Legal Case Retrieval (LCR), which retrieves relevant cases from a query case,
is a fundamental task for legal professionals in research and decision-making.
However, existing studies on LCR face two major limitations. First, they are
evaluated on relatively small-scale retrieval corpora (e.g., 100-55K cases) and
use a narrow range of criminal query types, which cannot sufficiently reflect
the complexity of real-world legal retrieval scenarios. Second, their reliance
on embedding-based or lexical matching methods often results in limited
representations and legally irrelevant matches. To address these issues, we
present: (1) LEGAR BENCH, the first large-scale Korean LCR benchmark, covering
411 diverse crime types in queries over 1.2M legal cases; and (2)
LegalSearchLM, a retrieval model that performs legal element reasoning over the
query case and directly generates content grounded in the target cases through
constrained decoding. Experimental results show that LegalSearchLM outperforms
baselines by 6-20% on LEGAR BENCH, achieving state-of-the-art performance. It
also demonstrates strong generalization to out-of-domain cases, outperforming
naive generative models trained on in-domain data by 15%.

Conclusion: LACE展示了在物联网平台上实现安全、灵活且用户友好访问控制的潜力。

Abstract: Access control in the Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming increasingly
complex, as policies must account for dynamic and contextual factors such as
time, location, user behavior, and environmental conditions. However, existing
platforms either offer only coarse-grained controls or rely on rigid rule
matching, making them ill-suited for semantically rich or ambiguous access
scenarios. Moreover, the policy authoring process remains fragmented: domain
experts describe requirements in natural language, but developers must manually
translate them into code, introducing semantic gaps and potential
misconfiguration. In this work, we present LACE, the Language-based Access
Control Engine, a hybrid framework that leverages large language models (LLMs)
to bridge the gap between human intent and machine-enforceable logic. LACE
combines prompt-guided policy generation, retrieval-augmented reasoning, and
formal validation to support expressive, interpretable, and verifiable access
control. It enables users to specify policies in natural language,
automatically translates them into structured rules, validates semantic
correctness, and makes access decisions using a hybrid LLM-rule-based engine.
We evaluate LACE in smart home environments through extensive experiments. LACE
achieves 100% correctness in verified policy generation and up to 88% decision
accuracy with 0.79 F1-score using DeepSeek-V3, outperforming baselines such as
GPT-3.5 and Gemini. The system also demonstrates strong scalability under
increasing policy volume and request concurrency. Our results highlight LACE's
potential to enable secure, flexible, and user-friendly access control across
real-world IoT platforms.

it has declined in popularity in contemporary cognitive science, largely
because labor-intensive transcription and annotation preclude large sample
sizes. Here, we develop methods to automate the transcription and annotation of
verbal reports of reasoning using natural language processing tools, allowing
for large-scale analysis of think-aloud data. In our study, 640 participants
thought aloud while playing the Game of 24, a mathematical reasoning task. We
automatically transcribed the recordings and coded the transcripts as search
graphs, finding moderate inter-rater reliability with humans. We analyze these
graphs and characterize consistency and variation in human reasoning traces.
Our work demonstrates the value of think-aloud data at scale and serves as a
proof of concept for the automated analysis of verbal reports.

Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), as an effective alternative medicine, has
been receiving increasing attention. In recent years, the rapid development of
large language models (LLMs) tailored for TCM has underscored the need for an
objective and comprehensive evaluation framework to assess their performance on
real-world tasks. However, existing evaluation datasets are limited in scope
and primarily text-based, lacking a unified and standardized multimodal
question-answering (QA) benchmark. To address this issue, we introduce
TCM-Ladder, the first multimodal QA dataset specifically designed for
evaluating large TCM language models. The dataset spans multiple core
disciplines of TCM, including fundamental theory, diagnostics, herbal formulas,
internal medicine, surgery, pharmacognosy, and pediatrics. In addition to
textual content, TCM-Ladder incorporates various modalities such as images and
videos. The datasets were constructed using a combination of automated and
manual filtering processes and comprise 52,000+ questions in total. These
questions include single-choice, multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, diagnostic
dialogue, and visual comprehension tasks. We trained a reasoning model on
TCM-Ladder and conducted comparative experiments against 9 state-of-the-art
general domain and 5 leading TCM-specific LLMs to evaluate their performance on
the datasets. Moreover, we propose Ladder-Score, an evaluation method
specifically designed for TCM question answering that effectively assesses
answer quality regarding terminology usage and semantic expression. To our
knowledge, this is the first work to evaluate mainstream general domain and
TCM-specific LLMs on a unified multimodal benchmark. The datasets and
leaderboard are publicly available at https://tcmladder.com or

Method: ERU-KG结合信息性模块（通过参考和术语级建模）和短语性模块（生成候选关键词），提升效率和准确性。

Result: 在关键词生成基准测试中优于无监督基线，达到监督模型89%的性能，且在文本检索任务中表现优异，推理速度最快。

Conclusion: ERU-KG高效且灵活，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: Unsupervised keyphrase prediction has gained growing interest in recent
years. However, existing methods typically rely on heuristically defined
importance scores, which may lead to inaccurate informativeness estimation. In
addition, they lack consideration for time efficiency. To solve these problems,
we propose ERU-KG, an unsupervised keyphrase generation (UKG) model that
consists of an informativeness and a phraseness module. The former estimates
the relevance of keyphrase candidates, while the latter generate those
candidates. The informativeness module innovates by learning to model
informativeness through references (e.g., queries, citation contexts, and
titles) and at the term-level, thereby 1) capturing how the key concepts of
documents are perceived in different contexts and 2) estimating informativeness
of phrases more efficiently by aggregating term informativeness, removing the
need for explicit modeling of the candidates. ERU-KG demonstrates its
effectiveness on keyphrase generation benchmarks by outperforming unsupervised
baselines and achieving on average 89\% of the performance of a supervised
model for top 10 predictions. Additionally, to highlight its practical utility,
we evaluate the model on text retrieval tasks and show that keyphrases
generated by ERU-KG are effective when employed as query and document
expansions. Furthermore, inference speed tests reveal that ERU-KG is the
fastest among baselines of similar model sizes. Finally, our proposed model can
switch between keyphrase generation and extraction by adjusting
hyperparameters, catering to diverse application requirements.

Abstract: Automated radiology report generation from chest X-ray (CXR) images has the
potential to improve clinical efficiency and reduce radiologists' workload.
However, most datasets, including the publicly available MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert
Plus, consist entirely of free-form reports, which are inherently variable and
unstructured. This variability poses challenges for both generation and
evaluation: existing models struggle to produce consistent, clinically
meaningful reports, and standard evaluation metrics fail to capture the nuances
of radiological interpretation. To address this, we introduce Structured
Radiology Report Generation (SRRG), a new task that reformulates free-text
radiology reports into a standardized format, ensuring clarity, consistency,
and structured clinical reporting. We create a novel dataset by restructuring
reports using large language models (LLMs) following strict structured
reporting desiderata. Additionally, we introduce SRR-BERT, a fine-grained
disease classification model trained on 55 labels, enabling more precise and
clinically informed evaluation of structured reports. To assess report quality,
we propose F1-SRR-BERT, a metric that leverages SRR-BERT's hierarchical disease
taxonomy to bridge the gap between free-text variability and structured
clinical reporting. We validate our dataset through a reader study conducted by
five board-certified radiologists and extensive benchmarking experiments.

Abstract: Inverse Text Normalization (ITN) is crucial for converting spoken Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) outputs into well-formatted written text, enhancing
both readability and usability. Despite its importance, the integration of
streaming ITN within streaming ASR remains largely unexplored due to challenges
in accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability, particularly in low-resource and
limited-context scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a streaming pretrained
language model for ITN, leveraging pretrained linguistic representations for
improved robustness. To address streaming constraints, we propose Dynamic
Context-Aware during training and inference, enabling adaptive chunk size
adjustments and the integration of right-context information. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method achieves accuracy comparable to
non-streaming ITN and surpasses existing streaming ITN models on a Vietnamese
dataset, all while maintaining low latency, ensuring seamless integration into
ASR systems.

Conclusion: 模型在多语言手语翻译中表现出色，解决了语言冲突和对齐问题。

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) aims to convert sign language (SL) videos
into spoken language text, thereby bridging the communication gap between the
sign and the spoken community. While most existing works focus on translating a
single sign language into a single spoken language (one-to-one SLT), leveraging
multilingual resources could mitigate low-resource issues and enhance
accessibility. However, multilingual SLT (MLSLT) remains unexplored due to
language conflicts and alignment difficulties across SLs and spoken languages.
To address these challenges, we propose a multilingual gloss-free model with
dual CTC objectives for token-level SL identification and spoken text
generation. Our model supports 10 SLs and handles one-to-one, many-to-one, and
many-to-many SLT tasks, achieving competitive performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods on three widely adopted benchmarks: multilingual
SP-10, PHOENIX14T, and CSL-Daily.

Conclusion: 研究创建的数据对训练泛化能力强的模型有价值，但准确评估模型效果需要真实数据。

Abstract: Accurate modeling of subjective phenomena such as emotion expression requires
data annotated with authors' intentions. Commonly such data is collected by
asking study participants to donate and label genuine content produced in the
real world, or create content fitting particular labels during the study.
Asking participants to create content is often simpler to implement and
presents fewer risks to participant privacy than data donation. However, it is
unclear if and how study-created content may differ from genuine content, and
how differences may impact models. We collect study-created and genuine
multimodal social media posts labeled for emotion and compare them on several
dimensions, including model performance. We find that compared to genuine
posts, study-created posts are longer, rely more on their text and less on
their images for emotion expression, and focus more on emotion-prototypical
events. The samples of participants willing to donate versus create posts are
demographically different. Study-created data is valuable to train models that
generalize well to genuine data, but realistic effectiveness estimates require
genuine data.

Abstract: Cultural content poses challenges for machine translation systems due to the

Abstract: Cross-lingual transfer from related high-resource languages is a
well-established strategy to enhance low-resource language technologies. Prior
work has shown that adapters show promise for, e.g., improving low-resource
machine translation (MT). In this work, we investigate an adapter souping
method combined with cross-attention fine-tuning of a pre-trained MT model to
leverage language transfer for three low-resource Creole languages, which
exhibit relatedness to different language groups across distinct linguistic
dimensions. Our approach improves performance substantially over baselines.
However, we find that linguistic relatedness -- or even a lack thereof -- does
not covary meaningfully with adapter performance. Surprisingly, our
cross-attention fine-tuning approach appears equally effective with randomly
initialized adapters, implying that the benefit of adapters in this setting
lies in parameter regularization, and not in meaningful information transfer.
We provide analysis supporting this regularization hypothesis. Our findings
underscore the reality that neural language processing involves many success
factors, and that not all neural methods leverage linguistic knowledge in
intuitive ways.

Abstract: Cultural Heritage (CH) data hold invaluable knowledge, reflecting the

detects offensive terms in CH metadata and provides contextual insights into
their historical background and contemporary perception. We leverage a
multilingual vocabulary co-created with marginalized communities, researchers,
and CH professionals, along with traditional NLP techniques and Large Language
Models (LLMs). Available as a standalone web app and integrated with major CH
platforms, the tool has processed over 7.9 million records, contextualizing the
contentious terms detected in their metadata. Rather than erasing these terms,
our approach seeks to inform, making biases visible and providing actionable
insights for creating more inclusive and accessible CH collections.

Abstract: Current translation systems, despite being highly multilingual, cover only 5%

low-resource languages requires data-efficient methods that rely on
cross-lingual and cross-modal knowledge transfer. To this end, we propose a
character-based approach to improve adaptability to new languages and
modalities. Our method leverages SONAR, a multilingual fixed-size embedding
space with different modules for encoding and decoding. We use a
teacher-student approach with parallel translation data to obtain a
character-level encoder. Then, using ASR data, we train a lightweight adapter
to connect a massively multilingual CTC ASR model (MMS), to the character-level
encoder, potentially enabling speech translation from 1,000+ languages.
Experimental results in text translation for 75 languages on FLORES+
demonstrate that our character-based approach can achieve better language
transfer than traditional subword-based models, especially outperforming them
in low-resource settings, and demonstrating better zero-shot generalizability
to unseen languages. Our speech adaptation, maximizing knowledge transfer from
the text modality, achieves state-of-the-art results in speech-to-text

Abstract: We propose a Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT) approach that integrates

recognition as an intermediate step, we enhance cross-lingual transfer,
enabling translation even for languages with no labeled speech data. Our system
builds on a multilingual LLM, which we extend to process speech and phonemes.
Training follows a curriculum learning strategy that progressively introduces
more complex tasks. Experiments on multilingual S2TT benchmarks show that
phoneme-augmented CoT improves translation quality in low-resource conditions
and enables zero-resource translation, while slightly impacting high-resource
performance. Despite this trade-off, our findings demonstrate that
phoneme-based CoT is a promising step toward making S2TT more accessible across

Abstract: Arabic dialect identification (ADI) systems are essential for large-scale

Furthermore, we present an analysis of our approach and demonstrate that voice

In this work, we challenge this assumption in the context of two underexplored,

a large-scale analysis across 28 languages, we show that multilingual training
is neither necessary nor inherently beneficial for effective transfer. Instead,
we find that confounding factors - such as fine-tuning data composition and

Abstract: Crowd work platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk and Prolific are vital for
research, yet workers' growing use of generative AI tools poses challenges.
Researchers face compromised data validity as AI responses replace authentic
human behavior, while workers risk diminished roles as AI automates tasks. To
address this, we propose a hybrid framework using digital twins, personalized
AI models that emulate workers' behaviors and preferences while keeping humans
in the loop. We evaluate our system with an experiment (n=88 crowd workers) and
in-depth interviews with crowd workers (n=5) and social science researchers
(n=4). Our results suggest that digital twins may enhance productivity and
reduce decision fatigue while maintaining response quality. Both researchers
and workers emphasized the importance of transparency, ethical data use, and
worker agency. By automating repetitive tasks and preserving human engagement
for nuanced ones, digital twins may help balance scalability with authenticity.

Motivation: 解决语音基础模型（SFM）在微调时资源有限的问题，提升多语言LID和ASR的性能。

Method: 采用冻结上游训练、部分微调、低秩适应等策略，结合数据增强和LID CTC损失进行正则化。

Result: 在ML-SUPERB 2.0上，LID准确率相对提升14%，ASR CER相对降低30%，并在挑战赛中排名第二。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了多语言语音处理的性能，尤其在资源受限的情况下。

Abstract: Multilingual speech processing with self-supervised or supervised pre-trained
Speech Foundation Models (SFM) has achieved strong performance on tasks like
Language Identification (LID) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). However,
these models struggle with limited resources during fine-tuning. This paper
enhances multilingual LID and ASR on ML-SUPERB 2.0 by exploring multiple
strategies for adapting SFMs, including frozen upstream training, partial
fine-tuning, and low-rank adaptation. Furthermore, we employ data augmentation
to mitigate performance gaps in few-shot settings and introduce LID
Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss for regularization. Our
approach achieves a 14% relative improvement in LID accuracy and a 30% relative
reduction in ASR CER over the baseline on ML-SUPERB 2.0, securing second place
in the Interspeech 2025 ML-SUPERB 2.0 Challenge.

Abstract: Automating primary stress identification has been an active research field
due to the role of stress in encoding meaning and aiding speech comprehension.
Previous studies relied mainly on traditional acoustic features and English
datasets. In this paper, we investigate the approach of fine-tuning a
pre-trained transformer model with an audio frame classification head. Our
experiments use a new Croatian training dataset, with test sets in Croatian,
Serbian, the Chakavian dialect, and Slovenian. By comparing an SVM classifier
using traditional acoustic features with the fine-tuned speech transformer, we
demonstrate the transformer's superiority across the board, achieving
near-perfect results for Croatian and Serbian, with a 10-point performance drop
for the more distant Chakavian and Slovenian. Finally, we show that only a few
hundred multi-syllabic training words suffice for strong performance. We
release our datasets and model under permissive licenses.

Motivation: HF患者表型多样，影响治疗和预后，需开发高性能且可解释的分类模型。

Method: 使用结构化（临床测量）和非结构化（出院信）数据，训练BERT和Aug-Linear模型，并与基线比较。通过SHAP、LIME和临床医生标注评估可解释性。

Result: BERT和Aug-Linear模型表现最佳（AUC=0.84和0.81），Aug-Linear的可解释性更接近临床医生标注。

Conclusion: 出院信是HF表型分类的最佳数据源，Aug-Linear模型在性能与可解释性间取得平衡，适合临床决策。

Abstract: Objective: Heart failure (HF) patients present with diverse phenotypes
affecting treatment and prognosis. This study evaluates models for phenotyping
HF patients based on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) classes, using
structured and unstructured data, assessing performance and interpretability.
  Materials and Methods: The study analyzes all HF hospitalizations at both
Amsterdam UMC hospitals (AMC and VUmc) from 2015 to 2023 (33,105
hospitalizations, 16,334 patients). Data from AMC were used for model training,
and from VUmc for external validation. The dataset was unlabelled and included
tabular clinical measurements and discharge letters. Silver labels for LVEF
classes were generated by combining diagnosis codes, echocardiography results,
and textual mentions. Gold labels were manually annotated for 300 patients for
testing. Multiple Transformer-based (black-box) and Aug-Linear (white-box)
models were trained and compared with baselines on structured and unstructured
data. To evaluate interpretability, two clinicians annotated 20 discharge
letters by highlighting information they considered relevant for LVEF
classification. These were compared to SHAP and LIME explanations from
black-box models and the inherent explanations of Aug-Linear models.
  Results: BERT-based and Aug-Linear models, using discharge letters alone,
achieved the highest classification results (AUC=0.84 for BERT, 0.81 for
Aug-Linear on external validation), outperforming baselines. Aug-Linear
explanations aligned more closely with clinicians' explanations than post-hoc
explanations on black-box models.
  Conclusions: Discharge letters emerged as the most informative source for
phenotyping HF patients. Aug-Linear models matched black-box performance while
providing clinician-aligned interpretability, supporting their use in
transparent clinical decision-making.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the Meta PL unsupervised domain adaptation
framework for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). We introduce a Multi-Stage
Domain Adaptation pipeline (MSDA), a sample-efficient, two-stage adaptation
approach that integrates self-supervised learning with semi-supervised
techniques. MSDA is designed to enhance the robustness and generalization of
ASR models, making them more adaptable to diverse conditions. It is
particularly effective for low-resource languages like Greek and in weakly
supervised scenarios where labeled data is scarce or noisy. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that Meta PL can be applied effectively to ASR
tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art methods, and providing more robust solutions for unsupervised
domain adaptation in ASR. Our ablations highlight the necessity of utilizing a
cascading approach when combining self-supervision with self-training.

Conclusion: WikiGap提升了用户对其他语言版本信息的认知，促进了语言版本间的知识公平。

Abstract: With more than 11 times as many pageviews as the next, English Wikipedia
dominates global knowledge access relative to other language editions. Readers
are prone to assuming English Wikipedia as a superset of all language editions,
leading many to prefer it even when their primary language is not English.
Other language editions, however, comprise complementary facts rooted in their
respective cultures and media environments, which are marginalized in English
Wikipedia. While Wikipedia's user interface enables switching between language
editions through its Interlanguage Link (ILL) system, it does not reveal to
readers that other language editions contain valuable, complementary
information. We present WikiGap, a system that surfaces complementary facts
sourced from other Wikipedias within the English Wikipedia interface.
Specifically, by combining a recent multilingual information-gap discovery
method with a user-centered design, WikiGap enables access to complementary
information from French, Russian, and Chinese Wikipedia. In a mixed-methods
study (n=21), WikiGap significantly improved fact-finding accuracy, reduced
task time, and received a 32-point higher usability score relative to
Wikipedia's current ILL-based navigation system. Participants reported
increased awareness of the availability of complementary information in
non-English editions and reconsidered the completeness of English Wikipedia.
WikiGap thus paves the way for improved epistemic equity across language
editions.

Abstract: Turn-taking in dialogue follows universal constraints but also varies
significantly. This study examines how demographic (sex, age, education) and
individual factors shape turn-taking using a large dataset of US English
conversations (Fisher). We analyze Transition Floor Offset (TFO) and find
notable interspeaker variation. Sex and age have small but significant effects
female speakers and older individuals exhibit slightly shorter offsets - while
education shows no effect. Lighter topics correlate with shorter TFOs. However,
individual differences have a greater impact, driven by a strong idiosyncratic
and an even stronger "dyadosyncratic" component - speakers in a dyad resemble
each other more than they resemble themselves in different dyads. This suggests
that the dyadic relationship and joint activity are the strongest determinants
of TFO, outweighing demographic influences.

Motivation: LLM在视觉输入不一致时产生的幻觉问题影响了其可靠性，当前研究多关注事后修正或微调，而预处理技术的研究较少。

Result: 在HaloQuest数据集上，幻觉率降低了44.3%，通过NLI分数验证。

Conclusion: 智能输入预处理可显著提升LLM的事实基础，为更可靠的多模态系统铺平道路。

Abstract: Visual hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs), where the model
generates responses that are inconsistent with the visual input, pose a
significant challenge to their reliability, particularly in contexts where
precise and trustworthy outputs are critical. Current research largely
emphasizes post-hoc correction or model-specific fine-tuning strategies, with
limited exploration of preprocessing techniques to address hallucination issues
at the input stage. This study presents a novel ensemble-based preprocessing
framework that adaptively selects the most appropriate filtering approach --
noise reduced (NR), edge enhanced (EE), or unaltered input (org) based on the
type of question posed, resulting into reduced hallucination without requiring
any modifications to the underlying model architecture or training pipeline.
Evaluated on the `HaloQuest' dataset -- a benchmark designed to test multimodal
reasoning on visually complex inputs, our method achieves a 44.3% reduction in
hallucination rates, as measured by Natural Language Inference (NLI) scores
using SelfCheckGPT. This demonstrates that intelligent input conditioning alone
can significantly enhance factual grounding in LLM responses. The findings
highlight the importance of adaptive preprocessing techniques in mitigating
hallucinations, paving the way for more reliable multimodal systems capable of
addressing real-world challenges.

Conclusion: DINO-R1通过强化学习成功提升了视觉基础模型的推理能力，GRQO策略有效且稳定。

Abstract: The recent explosive interest in the reasoning capabilities of large language
models, such as DeepSeek-R1, has demonstrated remarkable success through
reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning frameworks, exemplified by methods
like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). However, such reasoning
abilities remain underexplored and notably absent in vision foundation models,
including representation models like the DINO series. In this work, we propose
\textbf{DINO-R1}, the first such attempt to incentivize visual in-context
reasoning capabilities of vision foundation models using reinforcement
learning. Specifically, DINO-R1 introduces \textbf{Group Relative Query
Optimization (GRQO)}, a novel reinforcement-style training strategy explicitly
designed for query-based representation models, which computes query-level
rewards based on group-normalized alignment quality. We also apply
KL-regularization to stabilize the objectness distribution to reduce the
training instability. This joint optimization enables dense and expressive
supervision across queries while mitigating overfitting and distributional
drift. Building upon Grounding-DINO, we train a series of DINO-R1 family models
that integrate a visual prompt encoder and a visual-guided query selection
mechanism. Extensive experiments on COCO, LVIS, and ODinW demonstrate that
DINO-R1 significantly outperforms supervised fine-tuning baselines, achieving
strong generalization in both open-vocabulary and closed-set visual prompting
scenarios.

Method: 设计四种基于游戏的诊断任务，通过理论框架分析CoT的三种失败模式，并提出结构化干预措施。

Result: CoT可能通过错误分解、解决子任务或总结答案降低推理性能，结构化干预可提升准确性。

Conclusion: 有效的CoT推理不仅需要更多步骤，还需确保步骤结构合理。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress across domains,
yet their ability to perform inductive reasoning - inferring latent rules from
sparse examples - remains limited. It is often assumed that chain-of-thought
(CoT) prompting, as used in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), enhances such
reasoning. We investigate this assumption with creating four controlled,
diagnostic game-based tasks - chess, Texas Hold'em, dice games, and blackjack -
with hidden human-defined rules. We find that CoT reasoning can degrade
inductive performance, with LRMs often underperforming their non-reasoning
counterparts.
  To explain this, we present a theoretical framework that reveals how
reasoning steps can amplify error through three failure modes: incorrect
sub-task decomposition, incorrect sub-task solving, and incorrect final answer
summarization. Based on our theoretical and empirical analysis, we introduce
structured interventions that adapt CoT generation according to our identified
failure types. These interventions improve inductive accuracy without
retraining. Our findings suggest that effective (CoT) reasoning depends not
only on taking more steps but also on ensuring those steps are well-structured.

Conclusion: LFMs的鲁棒性策略应联合解决幻觉和越狱攻击，因为它们具有共同的优化动态。

Abstract: Large foundation models (LFMs) are susceptible to two distinct
vulnerabilities: hallucinations and jailbreak attacks. While typically studied
in isolation, we observe that defenses targeting one often affect the other,
hinting at a deeper connection.
  We propose a unified theoretical framework that models jailbreaks as
token-level optimization and hallucinations as attention-level optimization.
Within this framework, we establish two key propositions: (1) \textit{Similar
Loss Convergence} - the loss functions for both vulnerabilities converge
similarly when optimizing for target-specific outputs; and (2) \textit{Gradient
Consistency in Attention Redistribution} - both exhibit consistent gradient
behavior driven by shared attention dynamics.
  We validate these propositions empirically on LLaVA-1.5 and MiniGPT-4,
showing consistent optimization trends and aligned gradients. Leveraging this
connection, we demonstrate that mitigation techniques for hallucinations can
reduce jailbreak success rates, and vice versa. Our findings reveal a shared
failure mode in LFMs and suggest that robustness strategies should jointly
address both vulnerabilities.

Result: 实验表明，Mixpert在多任务学习中显著提升性能，且计算成本较低。

Conclusion: Mixpert是一种高效且通用的解决方案，适用于多模态大语言模型中的视觉任务处理。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) require a nuanced interpretation of
complex image information, typically leveraging a vision encoder to perceive
various visual scenarios. However, relying solely on a single vision encoder to
handle diverse task domains proves difficult and inevitably leads to conflicts.
Recent work enhances data perception by directly integrating multiple
domain-specific vision encoders, yet this structure adds complexity and limits
the potential for joint optimization. In this paper, we introduce Mixpert, an
efficient mixture-of-vision-experts architecture that inherits the joint
learning advantages from a single vision encoder while being restructured into
a multi-expert paradigm for task-specific fine-tuning across different visual
tasks. Additionally, we design a dynamic routing mechanism that allocates input
images to the most suitable visual expert. Mixpert effectively alleviates
domain conflicts encountered by a single vision encoder in multi-task learning
with minimal additional computational cost, making it more efficient than
multiple encoders. Furthermore, Mixpert integrates seamlessly into any MLLM,
with experimental results demonstrating substantial performance gains across
various tasks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in reinforcement learning, particularly through Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have significantly improved multimodal
large language models for complex reasoning tasks. However, two critical
limitations persist: 1) they often produce unfocused, verbose reasoning chains
that obscure salient spatiotemporal cues and 2) binary rewarding fails to
account for partially correct answers, resulting in high reward variance and
inefficient learning. In this paper, we propose TW-GRPO, a novel framework that
enhances visual reasoning with focused thinking and dense reward granularity.
Specifically, we employs a token weighting mechanism that prioritizes tokens
with high informational density (estimated by intra-group variance),
suppressing redundant tokens like generic reasoning prefixes. Furthermore, we
reformulate RL training by shifting from single-choice to multi-choice QA
tasks, where soft rewards enable finer-grained gradient estimation by
distinguishing partial correctness. Additionally, we propose question-answer
inversion, a data augmentation strategy to generate diverse multi-choice
samples from existing benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance on several video reasoning and general understanding benchmarks.
Notably, TW-GRPO achieves 50.4\% accuracy on CLEVRER (18.8\% improvement over
Video-R1) and 65.8\% on MMVU. Our codes are available at

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a powerful paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs), achieving
state-of-the-art performance on tasks with structured, verifiable answers.
Applying RLVR to Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) presents significant opportunities but
is complicated by the broader, heterogeneous nature of vision-language tasks
that demand nuanced visual, logical, and spatial capabilities. As such,
training MLLMs using RLVR on multiple datasets could be beneficial but creates
challenges with conflicting objectives from interaction among diverse datasets,
highlighting the need for optimal dataset mixture strategies to improve
generalization and reasoning. We introduce a systematic post-training framework
for Multimodal LLM RLVR, featuring a rigorous data mixture problem formulation
and benchmark implementation. Specifically, (1) We developed a multimodal RLVR
framework for multi-dataset post-training by curating a dataset that contains
different verifiable vision-language problems and enabling multi-domain online
RL learning with different verifiable rewards; (2) We proposed a data mixture
strategy that learns to predict the RL fine-tuning outcome from the data
mixture distribution, and consequently optimizes the best mixture.
Comprehensive experiments showcase that multi-domain RLVR training, when
combined with mixture prediction strategies, can significantly boost MLLM
general reasoning capacities. Our best mixture improves the post-trained
model's accuracy on out-of-distribution benchmarks by an average of 5.24%
compared to the same model post-trained with uniform data mixture, and by a
total of 20.74% compared to the pre-finetuning baseline.

Abstract: Employing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for long video
understanding remains a challenging problem due to the dilemma between the
substantial number of video frames (i.e., visual tokens) versus the limited
context length of language models. Traditional uniform sampling often leads to
selection of irrelevant content, while post-training MLLMs on thousands of
frames imposes a substantial computational burden. In this paper, we propose
threading keyframes with narratives (Nar-KFC), a plug-and-play module to
facilitate effective and efficient long video perception. Nar-KFC generally
involves two collaborative steps. First, we formulate the keyframe selection
process as an integer quadratic programming problem, jointly optimizing
query-relevance and frame-diversity. To avoid its computational complexity, a
customized greedy search strategy is designed as an efficient alternative.
Second, to mitigate the temporal discontinuity caused by sparse keyframe
sampling, we further introduce interleaved textual narratives generated from
non-keyframes using off-the-shelf captioners. These narratives are inserted
between keyframes based on their true temporal order, forming a coherent and
compact representation. Nar-KFC thus serves as a temporal- and content-aware
compression strategy that complements visual and textual modalities.
Experimental results on multiple long-video benchmarks demonstrate that Nar-KFC
significantly improves the performance of popular MLLMs. Code will be made
publicly available.

Motivation: 研究多模态大语言模型在理解物理世界（如运动规律、空间关系和因果关系）方面的能力不足，尤其是在复杂场景中的视觉物理推理表现较差。

Method: 提出了MVPBench基准，通过视觉链式思维（CoT）评估模型的物理推理能力，并设计了基于图的CoT一致性指标。

Result: 实验表明，即使是先进的MLLMs在视觉物理推理上也表现不佳，且RL后训练对齐可能损害空间推理能力。

Conclusion: 当前MLLMs的视觉物理推理能力有限，需要重新思考微调方法。

Abstract: Understanding the physical world - governed by laws of motion, spatial
relations, and causality - poses a fundamental challenge for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). While recent advances such as OpenAI o3 and GPT-4o
demonstrate impressive perceptual and reasoning capabilities, our investigation
reveals these models struggle profoundly with visual physical reasoning,
failing to grasp basic physical laws, spatial interactions, and causal effects
in complex scenes. More importantly, they often fail to follow coherent
reasoning chains grounded in visual evidence, especially when multiple steps
are needed to arrive at the correct answer. To rigorously evaluate this
capability, we introduce MVPBench, a curated benchmark designed to rigorously
evaluate visual physical reasoning through the lens of visual chain-of-thought
(CoT). Each example features interleaved multi-image inputs and demands not
only the correct final answer but also a coherent, step-by-step reasoning path
grounded in evolving visual cues. This setup mirrors how humans reason through
real-world physical processes over time. To ensure fine-grained evaluation, we
introduce a graph-based CoT consistency metric that verifies whether the
reasoning path of model adheres to valid physical logic. Additionally, we
minimize shortcut exploitation from text priors, encouraging models to rely on
visual understanding. Experimental results reveal a concerning trend: even
cutting-edge MLLMs exhibit poor visual reasoning accuracy and weak image-text
alignment in physical domains. Surprisingly, RL-based post-training alignment -
commonly believed to improve visual reasoning performance - often harms spatial
reasoning, suggesting a need to rethink current fine-tuning practices.

Abstract: Multimodal hallucination in multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
restricts the correctness of MLLMs. However, multimodal hallucinations are
multi-sourced and arise from diverse causes. Existing benchmarks fail to
adequately distinguish between perception-induced hallucinations and
reasoning-induced hallucinations. This failure constitutes a significant issue
and hinders the diagnosis of multimodal reasoning failures within MLLMs. To
address this, we propose the {\dataset} benchmark, which isolates reasoning
hallucinations by constructing questions where input images are correctly
perceived by MLLMs yet reasoning errors persist. {\dataset} introduces
multi-granular evaluation metrics: accuracy, factuality, and LLMs hallucination
score for hallucination quantification. Our analysis reveals that (1) the model
scale, data scale, and training stages significantly affect the degree of
logical, fabrication, and factual hallucinations; (2) current MLLMs show no
effective improvement on spatial hallucinations caused by misinterpreted
spatial relationships, indicating their limited visual reasoning capabilities;
and (3) question types correlate with distinct hallucination patterns,
highlighting targeted challenges and potential mitigation strategies. To
address these challenges, we propose {\method}, a method that combines
curriculum reinforcement fine-tuning to encourage models to generate
logic-consistent reasoning chains by stepwise reducing learning difficulty, and
collaborative hint inference to reduce reasoning complexity. {\method}
establishes a baseline on {\dataset}, and reduces the logical hallucinations in
original base models.

Abstract: Periodic or quasi-periodic phenomena reveal intrinsic characteristics in
various natural processes, such as weather patterns, movement behaviors,
traffic flows, and biological signals. Given that these phenomena span multiple
modalities, the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer
promising potential to effectively capture and understand their complex nature.
However, current MLLMs struggle with periodic tasks due to limitations in: 1)
lack of temporal modelling and 2) conflict between short and long periods. This
paper introduces Period-LLM, a multimodal large language model designed to
enhance the performance of periodic tasks across various modalities, and
constructs a benchmark of various difficulty for evaluating the cross-modal
periodic capabilities of large models. Specially, We adopt an "Easy to Hard
Generalization" paradigm, starting with relatively simple text-based tasks and
progressing to more complex visual and multimodal tasks, ensuring that the
model gradually builds robust periodic reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we
propose a "Resisting Logical Oblivion" optimization strategy to maintain
periodic reasoning abilities during semantic alignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed Period-LLM over existing MLLMs in
periodic tasks. The code is available at

Conclusion: Reason-SVG通过整合DwT、SFT和混合奖励引导的RL，为LLM在SVG生成领域提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Generating high-quality Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) is challenging for
Large Language Models (LLMs), as it requires advanced reasoning for structural
validity, semantic faithfulness, and visual coherence -- capabilities in which
current LLMs often fall short. In this work, we introduce Reason-SVG, a novel
framework designed to enhance LLM reasoning for SVG generation. Reason-SVG
pioneers the "Drawing-with-Thought" (DwT) paradigm, in which models generate
both SVG code and explicit design rationales, mimicking the human creative
process. Reason-SVG adopts a two-stage training strategy: First, Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) trains the LLM on the DwT paradigm to activate foundational
reasoning abilities. Second, Reinforcement Learning (RL), utilizing Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), empowers the model to generate both DwT
and SVGs rationales through refined, reward-driven reasoning. To facilitate
reasoning-driven SVG generation, we design a Hybrid Reward function that
evaluates the presence and utility of DwT reasoning, along with structural
validity, semantic alignment, and visual quality. We also introduce the
SVGX-DwT-10k dataset, a high-quality corpus of 10,000 SVG-DwT pairs, where each
SVG code is generated based on explicit DwT reasoning. By integrating DwT, SFT,
and Hybrid Reward-guided RL, Reason-SVG significantly improves LLM performance
in generating accurate and visually compelling SVGs, potentially fostering "Aha

Abstract: Previous research has investigated the application of Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) in understanding 3D scenes by interpreting them as
videos. These approaches generally depend on comprehensive 3D data inputs, such
as point clouds or reconstructed Bird's-Eye View (BEV) maps. In our research,
we advance this field by enhancing the capability of MLLMs to understand and
reason in 3D spaces directly from video data, without the need for additional
3D input. We propose a novel and efficient method, the Video-3D Geometry Large
Language Model (VG LLM). Our approach employs a 3D visual geometry encoder that
extracts 3D prior information from video sequences. This information is
integrated with visual tokens and fed into the MLLM. Extensive experiments have
shown that our method has achieved substantial improvements in various tasks
related to 3D scene understanding and spatial reasoning, all directly learned
from video sources. Impressively, our 4B model, which does not rely on explicit
3D data inputs, achieves competitive results compared to existing
state-of-the-art methods, and even surpasses the Gemini-1.5-Pro in the

Abstract: Large vision-language models have become widely adopted to advance in various
domains. However, developing a trustworthy system with minimal interpretable
characteristics of large-scale models presents a significant challenge. One of
the most prevalent terms associated with the fallacy functions caused by these
systems is hallucination, where the language model generates a response that
does not correspond to the visual content. To mitigate this problem, several
approaches have been developed, and one prominent direction is to ameliorate
the decoding process. In this paper, we propose a new Bijective Maximum
Likelihood Learning (BIMA) approach to hallucination mitigation using
normalizing flow theories. The proposed BIMA method can efficiently mitigate
the hallucination problem in prevailing vision-language models, resulting in
significant improvements. Notably, BIMA achieves the average F1 score of 85.06%
on POPE benchmark and remarkably reduce CHAIRS and CHAIRI by 7.6% and 2.6%,
respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first studies
that contemplates the bijection means to reduce hallucination induced by large
vision-language models.

Abstract: Vision-language models pre-trained at large scale have shown unprecedented
adaptability and generalization to downstream tasks. Although its
discriminative potential has been widely explored, its reliability and
uncertainty are still overlooked. In this work, we investigate the capabilities
of CLIP models under the split conformal prediction paradigm, which provides
theoretical guarantees to black-box models based on a small, labeled
calibration set. In contrast to the main body of literature on conformal
predictors in vision classifiers, foundation models exhibit a particular
characteristic: they are pre-trained on a one-time basis on an inaccessible
source domain, different from the transferred task. This domain drift
negatively affects the efficiency of the conformal sets and poses additional
challenges. To alleviate this issue, we propose Conf-OT, a transfer learning
setting that operates transductive over the combined calibration and query
sets. Solving an optimal transport problem, the proposed method bridges the
domain gap between pre-training and adaptation without requiring additional
data splits but still maintaining coverage guarantees. We comprehensively
explore this conformal prediction strategy on a broad span of 15 datasets and
three non-conformity scores. Conf-OT provides consistent relative improvements
of up to 20% on set efficiency while being 15 times faster than popular
transductive approaches.

Result: LLMs的层次知识不足限制了视觉LLMs的表现，微调后LLMs的层次一致性提升更明显。

Conclusion: 视觉LLMs的完全层次理解需依赖LLMs具备相应的分类知识。

Abstract: This paper reveals that many state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs)
lack hierarchical knowledge about our visual world, unaware of even
well-established biology taxonomies. This shortcoming makes LLMs a bottleneck
for vision LLMs' hierarchical visual understanding (e.g., recognizing Anemone
Fish but not Vertebrate). We arrive at these findings using about one million
four-choice visual question answering (VQA) tasks constructed from six
taxonomies and four image datasets. Interestingly, finetuning a vision LLM
using our VQA tasks reaffirms LLMs' bottleneck effect to some extent because
the VQA tasks improve the LLM's hierarchical consistency more than the vision
LLM's. We conjecture that one cannot make vision LLMs understand visual
concepts fully hierarchical until LLMs possess corresponding taxonomy
knowledge.

Abstract: Recent advances in test-time optimization have led to remarkable reasoning
capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling them to solve highly
complex problems in math and coding. However, the reasoning capabilities of
multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) still significantly lag, especially for complex
video-language tasks. To address this issue, we present SiLVR, a Simple
Language-based Video Reasoning framework that decomposes complex video
understanding into two stages. In the first stage, SiLVR transforms raw video
into language-based representations using multisensory inputs, such as short
clip captions and audio/speech subtitles. In the second stage, language
descriptions are fed into a powerful reasoning LLM to solve complex
video-language understanding tasks. To handle long-context multisensory inputs,
we use an adaptive token reduction scheme, which dynamically determines the
temporal granularity with which to sample the tokens. Our simple, modular, and
training-free video reasoning framework achieves the best-reported results on
Video-MME (long), Video-MMMU (comprehension), Video-MMLU, CGBench, and EgoLife.
Furthermore, our empirical study focused on video reasoning capabilities shows
that, despite not being explicitly trained on video, strong reasoning LLMs can
effectively aggregate multisensory input information from video, speech, and
audio for complex temporal, causal, long-context, and knowledge acquisition
reasoning tasks in video. Code is available at https://github.com/CeeZh/SILVR.

Abstract: Language-driven action localization in videos requires not only semantic
alignment between language query and video segment, but also prediction of
action boundaries.
  However, the language query primarily describes the main content of an action
and usually lacks specific details of action start and end boundaries, which
increases the subjectivity of manual boundary annotation and leads to boundary
uncertainty in training data.
  In this paper, on one hand, we propose to expand the original query by
generating textual descriptions of the action start and end boundaries through
LLMs, which can provide more detailed boundary cues for localization and thus
reduce the impact of boundary uncertainty.
  On the other hand, to enhance the tolerance to boundary uncertainty during
training, we propose to model probability scores of action boundaries by
calculating the semantic similarities between frames and the expanded query as
well as the temporal distances between frames and the annotated boundary
frames. They can provide more consistent boundary supervision, thus improving
the stability of training.
  Our method is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly and easily integrated into
any existing models of language-driven action localization in an off-the-shelf
manner. Experimental results on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method.

Abstract: Despite advances in general video understanding, Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs) face challenges in precise temporal localization due to discrete
time representations and limited temporally aware datasets. Existing methods
for temporal expression either conflate time with text-based numerical values,
add a series of dedicated temporal tokens, or regress time using specialized
temporal grounding heads. To address these issues, we introduce DisTime, a
lightweight framework designed to enhance temporal comprehension in Video-LLMs.
DisTime employs a learnable token to create a continuous temporal embedding
space and incorporates a Distribution-based Time Decoder that generates
temporal probability distributions, effectively mitigating boundary ambiguities
and maintaining temporal continuity. Additionally, the Distribution-based Time
Encoder re-encodes timestamps to provide time markers for Video-LLMs. To
overcome temporal granularity limitations in existing datasets, we propose an
automated annotation paradigm that combines the captioning capabilities of
Video-LLMs with the localization expertise of dedicated temporal models. This
leads to the creation of InternVid-TG, a substantial dataset with 1.25M
temporally grounded events across 179k videos, surpassing ActivityNet-Caption
by 55 times. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DisTime achieves
state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks in three time-sensitive tasks
while maintaining competitive performance in Video QA tasks. Code and data are

vision-language models (LVLMs). However, training LVLMs with reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT) is computationally expensive, posing a significant challenge
to scaling model size. In this work, we propose ProxyThinker, an inference-time
technique that enables large models to inherit the visual reasoning
capabilities from small, slow-thinking visual reasoners without any training.
By subtracting the output distributions of base models from those of RFT
reasoners, ProxyThinker modifies the decoding dynamics and successfully elicits
the slow-thinking reasoning demonstrated by the emerged sophisticated behaviors
such as self-verification and self-correction. ProxyThinker consistently boosts
performance on challenging visual benchmarks on spatial, mathematical, and
multi-disciplinary reasoning, enabling untuned base models to compete with the
performance of their full-scale RFT counterparts. Furthermore, our
implementation efficiently coordinates multiple language models with
parallelism techniques and achieves up to 38 $\times$ faster inference compared
to previous decoding-time methods, paving the way for the practical deployment
of ProxyThinker. Code is available at

TL;DR: Agent-X是一个用于评估视觉中心智能体多步深度推理能力的大规模基准测试，包含828个任务，覆盖多种真实视觉场景。现有模型在多步视觉任务中表现不佳，成功率低于50%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在评估视觉中心智能体的多步深度推理能力方面存在不足，缺乏真实、多模态和多步任务的评估框架。

Method: 提出Agent-X基准测试，包含六类真实视觉任务，并设计细粒度的步级评估框架，分析推理步骤的正确性和工具使用的有效性。

Result: 当前最佳模型（如GPT、Gemini、Qwen）在多步视觉任务中成功率低于50%，揭示了推理和工具使用能力的瓶颈。

Conclusion: Agent-X为视觉中心智能体的多步推理研究提供了重要基准，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Deep reasoning is fundamental for solving complex tasks, especially in
vision-centric scenarios that demand sequential, multimodal understanding.
However, existing benchmarks typically evaluate agents with fully synthetic,
single-turn queries, limited visual modalities, and lack a framework to assess
reasoning quality over multiple steps as required in real-world settings. To
address this, we introduce Agent-X, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating
vision-centric agents multi-step and deep reasoning capabilities in real-world,
multimodal settings. Agent- X features 828 agentic tasks with authentic visual
contexts, including images, multi-image comparisons, videos, and instructional
text. These tasks span six major agentic environments: general visual
reasoning, web browsing, security and surveillance, autonomous driving, sports,
and math reasoning. Our benchmark requires agents to integrate tool use with
explicit, stepwise decision-making in these diverse settings. In addition, we
propose a fine-grained, step-level evaluation framework that assesses the
correctness and logical coherence of each reasoning step and the effectiveness
of tool usage throughout the task. Our results reveal that even the
best-performing models, including GPT, Gemini, and Qwen families, struggle to
solve multi-step vision tasks, achieving less than 50% full-chain success.
These findings highlight key bottlenecks in current LMM reasoning and tool-use
capabilities and identify future research directions in vision-centric agentic
reasoning models. Our data and code are publicly available at

Abstract: Foundation models trained at scale exhibit remarkable emergent behaviors,
learning new capabilities beyond their initial training objectives. We find
such emergent behaviors in biological vision models via large-scale contrastive
vision-language training. To achieve this, we first curate TreeOfLife-200M,
comprising 214 million images of living organisms, the largest and most diverse
biological organism image dataset to date. We then train BioCLIP 2 on
TreeOfLife-200M to distinguish different species. Despite the narrow training
objective, BioCLIP 2 yields extraordinary accuracy when applied to various
biological visual tasks such as habitat classification and trait prediction. We
identify emergent properties in the learned embedding space of BioCLIP 2. At
the inter-species level, the embedding distribution of different species aligns
closely with functional and ecological meanings (e.g., beak sizes and
habitats). At the intra-species level, instead of being diminished, the
intra-species variations (e.g., life stages and sexes) are preserved and better
separated in subspaces orthogonal to inter-species distinctions. We provide
formal proof and analyses to explain why hierarchical supervision and
contrastive objectives encourage these emergent properties. Crucially, our
results reveal that these properties become increasingly significant with
larger-scale training data, leading to a biologically meaningful embedding
space.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) are expected to perform effective multimodal

such as diagram understanding and spatial problem solving. However, current VLM
reasoning lacks large-scale and well-structured training datasets. To bridge
this gap, we propose VisualSphinx, a first-of-its-kind large-scale synthetic

generates the code of grounding synthesis image synthesis for puzzle sample
assembly. Experiments demonstrate that VLM trained using GRPO on VisualSphinx
benefit from logical coherence and readability of our dataset and exhibit
improved performance on logical reasoning tasks. The enhanced reasoning
capabilities developed from VisualSphinx also benefit other reasoning tasks
such as algebraic reasoning, arithmetic reasoning and geometry reasoning.

Conclusion: MPR为T2I模型提供了一种灵活且上下文相关的代表性测量和优化方法，有助于提升生成模型的公平性。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generative models can create vivid, realistic images from
textual descriptions. As these models proliferate, they expose new concerns
about their ability to represent diverse demographic groups, propagate
stereotypes, and efface minority populations. Despite growing attention to the
"safe" and "responsible" design of artificial intelligence (AI), there is no
established methodology to systematically measure and control representational
harms in image generation. This paper introduces a novel framework to measure
the representation of intersectional groups in images generated by T2I models
by applying the Multi-Group Proportional Representation (MPR) metric. MPR
evaluates the worst-case deviation of representation statistics across given
population groups in images produced by a generative model, allowing for
flexible and context-specific measurements based on user requirements. We also
develop an algorithm to optimize T2I models for this metric. Through
experiments, we demonstrate that MPR can effectively measure representation
statistics across multiple intersectional groups and, when used as a training
objective, can guide models toward a more balanced generation across
demographic groups while maintaining generation quality.

Abstract: Generating images from text involving complex and novel object arrangements
remains a significant challenge for current text-to-image (T2I) models.
Although prior layout-based methods improve object arrangements using spatial
constraints with 2D layouts, they often struggle to capture 3D positioning and
sacrifice quality and coherence. In this work, we introduce ComposeAnything, a
novel framework for improving compositional image generation without retraining
existing T2I models. Our approach first leverages the chain-of-thought
reasoning abilities of LLMs to produce 2.5D semantic layouts from text,
consisting of 2D object bounding boxes enriched with depth information and
detailed captions. Based on this layout, we generate a spatial and depth aware
coarse composite of objects that captures the intended composition, serving as
a strong and interpretable prior that replaces stochastic noise initialization
in diffusion-based T2I models. This prior guides the denoising process through
object prior reinforcement and spatial-controlled denoising, enabling seamless
generation of compositional objects and coherent backgrounds, while allowing
refinement of inaccurate priors. ComposeAnything outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on the T2I-CompBench and NSR-1K benchmarks for prompts with 2D/3D
spatial arrangements, high object counts, and surreal compositions. Human
evaluations further demonstrate that our model generates high-quality images
with compositions that faithfully reflect the text.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
multimodal understanding, yet their capabilities for scientific reasoning

scientific reasoning through domain-grounded visual question answering.Our
benchmark features 1,378 carefully constructed question-answer pairs spanning
diverse STEM disciplines, each demanding domain knowledge, integration of
visual evidence, and higher-order reasoning. Compared to prior multimodal
benchmarks, CSVQA places greater emphasis on real-world scientific content and
complex reasoning.We additionally propose a rigorous evaluation protocol to
systematically assess whether model predictions are substantiated by valid
intermediate reasoning steps based on curated explanations. Our comprehensive
evaluation of 15 VLMs on this benchmark reveals notable performance
disparities, as even the top-ranked proprietary model attains only 49.6\%

Conclusion: S4-Driver通过自监督学习和3D空间表示优化，显著提升了自动驾驶运动规划的性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: The latest advancements in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have
spurred a strong renewed interest in end-to-end motion planning approaches for
autonomous driving. Many end-to-end approaches rely on human annotations to
learn intermediate perception and prediction tasks, while purely
self-supervised approaches--which directly learn from sensor inputs to generate
planning trajectories without human annotations often underperform the state of
the art. We observe a key gap in the input representation space: end-to-end
approaches built on MLLMs are often pretrained with reasoning tasks in 2D image
space rather than the native 3D space in which autonomous vehicles plan. To
this end, we propose S4-Driver, a scalable self-supervised motion planning
algorithm with spatio-temporal visual representation, based on the popular PaLI
multimodal large language model. S4-Driver uses a novel sparse volume strategy
to seamlessly transform the strong visual representation of MLLMs from
perspective view to 3D space without the need to finetune the vision encoder.
This representation aggregates multi-view and multi-frame visual inputs and
enables better prediction of planning trajectories in 3D space. To validate our
method, we run experiments on both nuScenes and Waymo Open Motion Dataset (with
in-house camera data). Results show that S4-Driver performs favorably against
existing supervised multi-task approaches while requiring no human annotations.
It also demonstrates great scalability when pretrained on large volumes of
unannotated driving logs.

Abstract: The advent of foundation models, particularly Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
and Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), has redefined the frontiers of
artificial intelligence, enabling remarkable generalization across diverse
tasks with minimal or no supervision. Yet, their potential in biometric
recognition and analysis remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we
introduce a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates the zero-shot and few-shot
performance of state-of-the-art publicly available VLMs and MLLMs across six
biometric tasks spanning the face and iris modalities: face verification, soft
biometric attribute prediction (gender and race), iris recognition,
presentation attack detection (PAD), and face manipulation detection (morphs
and deepfakes). A total of 41 VLMs were used in this evaluation. Experiments
show that embeddings from these foundation models can be used for diverse
biometric tasks with varying degrees of success. For example, in the case of
face verification, a True Match Rate (TMR) of 96.77 percent was obtained at a
False Match Rate (FMR) of 1 percent on the Labeled Face in the Wild (LFW)
dataset, without any fine-tuning. In the case of iris recognition, the TMR at 1
percent FMR on the IITD-R-Full dataset was 97.55 percent without any
fine-tuning. Further, we show that applying a simple classifier head to these
embeddings can help perform DeepFake detection for faces, Presentation Attack
Detection (PAD) for irides, and extract soft biometric attributes like gender
and ethnicity from faces with reasonably high accuracy. This work reiterates
the potential of pretrained models in achieving the long-term vision of
Artificial General Intelligence.

Abstract: While adversarial attacks on vision-and-language pretraining (VLP) models
have been explored, generating natural adversarial samples crafted through
realistic and semantically meaningful perturbations remains an open challenge.
Existing methods, primarily designed for classification tasks, struggle when
adapted to VLP models due to their restricted optimization spaces, leading to
ineffective attacks or unnatural artifacts. To address this, we propose
\textbf{LightD}, a novel framework that generates natural adversarial samples
for VLP models via semantically guided relighting. Specifically, LightD
leverages ChatGPT to propose context-aware initial lighting parameters and
integrates a pretrained relighting model (IC-light) to enable diverse lighting
adjustments. LightD expands the optimization space while ensuring perturbations
align with scene semantics. Additionally, gradient-based optimization is
applied to the reference lighting image to further enhance attack effectiveness
while maintaining visual naturalness. The effectiveness and superiority of the
proposed LightD have been demonstrated across various VLP models in tasks such

Result: 在公开基准数据集上的实验表明，PCD在分类和检测任务上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PCD通过分阶段和双向蒸馏策略，显著提升了知识蒸馏的效果。

Abstract: In knowledge distillation (KD), logit distillation (LD) aims to transfer
class-level knowledge from a more powerful teacher network to a small student
model via accurate teacher-student alignment at the logits level. Since
high-confidence object classes usually dominate the distillation process,
low-probability classes which also contain discriminating information are
downplayed in conventional methods, leading to insufficient knowledge transfer.
To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective LD method termed
Progressive Class-level Distillation (PCD). In contrast to existing methods
which perform all-class ensemble distillation, our PCD approach performs
stage-wise distillation for step-by-step knowledge transfer. More specifically,
we perform ranking on teacher-student logits difference for identifying
distillation priority from scratch, and subsequently divide the entire LD
process into multiple stages. Next, bidirectional stage-wise distillation
incorporating fine-to-coarse progressive learning and reverse coarse-to-fine
refinement is conducted, allowing comprehensive knowledge transfer via
sufficient logits alignment within separate class groups in different
distillation stages. Extension experiments on public benchmarking datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to state-of-the-arts for
both classification and detection tasks.

Abstract: Visual Grounding is a task that aims to localize a target region in an image
based on a free-form natural language description. With the rise of Transformer
architectures, there is an increasing need for larger datasets to boost
performance. However, the high cost of manual annotation poses a challenge,
hindering the scale of data and the ability of large models to enhance their
effectiveness. Previous pseudo label generation methods heavily rely on
human-labeled captions of the original dataset, limiting scalability and
diversity. To address this, we propose D2AF, a robust annotation framework for
visual grounding using only input images. This approach overcomes dataset size
limitations and enriches both the quantity and diversity of referring
expressions. Our approach leverages multimodal large models and object
detection models. By implementing dual-driven annotation strategies, we
effectively generate detailed region-text pairs using both closed-set and
open-set approaches. We further conduct an in-depth analysis of data quantity
and data distribution. Our findings demonstrate that increasing data volume
enhances model performance. However, the degree of improvement depends on how
well the pseudo labels broaden the original data distribution. Based on these
insights, we propose a consistency and distribution aware filtering method to
further improve data quality by effectively removing erroneous and redundant
data. This approach effectively eliminates noisy data, leading to improved
performance. Experiments on three visual grounding tasks demonstrate that our
method significantly improves the performance of existing models and achieves
state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has become a foundation model
and has been applied to various vision and multimodal tasks. However, recent
works indicate that CLIP falls short in distinguishing detailed differences in
images and shows suboptimal performance on dense-prediction and vision-centric
multimodal tasks. Therefore, this work focuses on improving existing CLIP
models, aiming to capture as many visual details in images as possible. We find
that a specific type of generative models, unCLIP, provides a suitable
framework for achieving our goal. Specifically, unCLIP trains an image
generator conditioned on the CLIP image embedding. In other words, it inverts
the CLIP image encoder. Compared to discriminative models like CLIP, generative
models are better at capturing image details because they are trained to learn
the data distribution of images. Additionally, the conditional input space of
unCLIP aligns with CLIP's original image-text embedding space. Therefore, we
propose to invert unCLIP (dubbed un$^2$CLIP) to improve the CLIP model. In this
way, the improved image encoder can gain unCLIP's visual detail capturing
ability while preserving its alignment with the original text encoder
simultaneously. We evaluate our improved CLIP across various tasks to which
CLIP has been applied, including the challenging MMVP-VLM benchmark, the
dense-prediction open-vocabulary segmentation task, and multimodal large
language model tasks. Experiments show that un$^2$CLIP significantly improves
the original CLIP and previous CLIP improvement methods. Code and models will

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) are large-scale, pre-trained AI systems that have
revolutionized natural language processing and computer vision, and are now
advancing geospatial analysis and Earth Observation (EO). They promise improved
generalization across tasks, scalability, and efficient adaptation with minimal

grounded in the 17 Sustainable Development Goals with extremely diverse tasks
ranging from asset wealth prediction to environmental hazard detection. This
study provides a rigorous, interdisciplinary assessment of geospatial FMs and
offers critical insights into their role in attaining sustainability goals. Our
findings show: (1) While not universally superior, FMs often outperform
traditional approaches across diverse tasks and datasets. (2) Evaluating FMs
should go beyond accuracy to include transferability, generalization, and
energy efficiency as key criteria for their responsible use. (3) FMs enable
scalable, SDG-grounded solutions, offering broad utility for tackling complex
sustainability challenges. Critically, we advocate for a paradigm shift from
model-centric development to impact-driven deployment, and emphasize metrics

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于适配器的持续学习方法中参数冗余和未能利用跨任务共享知识的问题。

Method: 提出CL-LoRA，结合任务共享适配器（学习跨任务知识）和任务特定适配器（捕获新任务独特特征），使用随机正交矩阵和知识蒸馏。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，减少训练和推理计算量。

Conclusion: CL-LoRA为预训练模型的持续学习提供了更高效和可扩展的范式。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to learn new classes sequentially while
retaining the knowledge of previously learned classes. Recently, pre-trained
models (PTMs) combined with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) have shown
remarkable performance in rehearsal-free CIL without requiring exemplars from
previous tasks. However, existing adapter-based methods, which incorporate
lightweight learnable modules into PTMs for CIL, create new adapters for each
new task, leading to both parameter redundancy and failure to leverage shared
knowledge across tasks. In this work, we propose ContinuaL Low-Rank Adaptation
(CL-LoRA), which introduces a novel dual-adapter architecture combining
\textbf{task-shared adapters} to learn cross-task knowledge and
\textbf{task-specific adapters} to capture unique features of each new task.
Specifically, the shared adapters utilize random orthogonal matrices and
leverage knowledge distillation with gradient reassignment to preserve
essential shared knowledge. In addition, we introduce learnable block-wise
weights for task-specific adapters, which mitigate inter-task interference
while maintaining the model's plasticity. We demonstrate CL-LoRA consistently
achieves promising performance under multiple benchmarks with reduced training
and inference computation, establishing a more efficient and scalable paradigm
for continual learning with pre-trained models.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have made impressive strides
in understanding spatio-temporal relationships in videos. However, when spatial
information is obscured, these models struggle to capture purely temporal
patterns. We introduce $\textbf{SpookyBench}$, a benchmark where information is
encoded solely in temporal sequences of noise-like frames, mirroring natural
phenomena from biological signaling to covert communication. Interestingly,
while humans can recognize shapes, text, and patterns in these sequences with
over 98% accuracy, state-of-the-art VLMs achieve 0% accuracy. This performance
gap highlights a critical limitation: an over-reliance on frame-level spatial
features and an inability to extract meaning from temporal cues. Furthermore,
when trained in data sets with low spatial signal-to-noise ratios (SNR),
temporal understanding of models degrades more rapidly than human perception,
especially in tasks requiring fine-grained temporal reasoning. Overcoming this
limitation will require novel architectures or training paradigms that decouple
spatial dependencies from temporal processing. Our systematic analysis shows
that this issue persists across model scales and architectures. We release
SpookyBench to catalyze research in temporal pattern recognition and bridge the
gap between human and machine video understanding. Dataset and code has been
made available on our project website: https://timeblindness.github.io/.

Conclusion: 概率框架为多模态对比学习提供了更灵活的工具，支持多种任务，并揭示了损失函数和对齐度量的新可能性。

Abstract: Multimodal contrastive learning is a methodology for linking different data
modalities; the canonical example is linking image and text data. The
methodology is typically framed as the identification of a set of encoders, one
for each modality, that align representations within a common latent space. In
this work, we focus on the bimodal setting and interpret contrastive learning
as the optimization of (parameterized) encoders that define conditional
probability distributions, for each modality conditioned on the other,
consistent with the available data. This provides a framework for multimodal
algorithms such as crossmodal retrieval, which identifies the mode of one of
these conditional distributions, and crossmodal classification, which is
similar to retrieval but includes a fine-tuning step to make it task specific.
  The framework we adopt also gives rise to crossmodal generative models. This
probabilistic perspective suggests two natural generalizations of contrastive
learning: the introduction of novel probabilistic loss functions, and the use
of alternative metrics for measuring alignment in the common latent space. We
study these generalizations of the classical approach in the multivariate
Gaussian setting. In this context we view the latent space identification as a
low-rank matrix approximation problem. This allows us to characterize the
capabilities of loss functions and alignment metrics to approximate natural
statistics, such as conditional means and covariances; doing so yields novel
variants on contrastive learning algorithms for specific mode-seeking and for
generative tasks. The framework we introduce is also studied through numerical
experiments on multivariate Gaussians, the labeled MNIST dataset, and on a data
assimilation application arising in oceanography.

Method: 提出DrVD-Bench，包含三个模块（视觉证据理解、推理轨迹评估和报告生成评估），涵盖7,789个图像-问题对，覆盖20种任务类型、17种诊断类别和5种成像模态。

Result: 测试19种VLMs发现，随着推理复杂性增加，性能显著下降；部分模型展现出类似人类推理的迹象，但仍依赖表面相关性。

Conclusion: DrVD-Bench为开发临床可信的VLMs提供了严格的结构化评估框架。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit strong zero-shot generalization on
natural images and show early promise in interpretable medical image analysis.
However, existing benchmarks do not systematically evaluate whether these
models truly reason like human clinicians or merely imitate superficial
patterns. To address this gap, we propose DrVD-Bench, the first multimodal
benchmark for clinical visual reasoning. DrVD-Bench consists of three modules:
Visual Evidence Comprehension, Reasoning Trajectory Assessment, and Report
Generation Evaluation, comprising a total of 7,789 image-question pairs. Our
benchmark covers 20 task types, 17 diagnostic categories, and five imaging
modalities-CT, MRI, ultrasound, radiography, and pathology. DrVD-Bench is
explicitly structured to reflect the clinical reasoning workflow from modality
recognition to lesion identification and diagnosis. We benchmark 19 VLMs,
including general-purpose and medical-specific, open-source and proprietary
models, and observe that performance drops sharply as reasoning complexity
increases. While some models begin to exhibit traces of human-like reasoning,
they often still rely on shortcut correlations rather than grounded visual
understanding. DrVD-Bench offers a rigorous and structured evaluation framework
to guide the development of clinically trustworthy VLMs.

Method: ScaleLong包含269个长视频，每个视频设计4-8个问题，覆盖四个时间尺度（秒、十秒、分钟、小时）。

Result: 评估23个MLLM显示U形性能曲线，最短和最长时间尺度表现最佳，中间尺度表现较差。视觉标记容量提升有助于所有时间尺度的推理。

Conclusion: ScaleLong为长视频理解提供了细粒度的多时间尺度基准测试。

Abstract: Although long-video understanding demands that models capture hierarchical
temporal information -- from clip (seconds) and shot (tens of seconds) to event
(minutes) and story (hours) -- existing benchmarks either neglect this
multi-scale design or scatter scale-specific questions across different videos,
preventing direct comparison of model performance across timescales on the same
content. To address this, we introduce ScaleLong, the first benchmark to
disentangle these factors by embedding questions targeting four hierarchical
timescales -- clip (seconds), shot (tens of seconds), event (minutes), and
story (hours) -- all within the same video content. This within-content
multi-timescale questioning design enables direct comparison of model
performance across timescales on identical videos. ScaleLong features 269 long
videos (avg.\ 86\,min) from 5 main categories and 36 sub-categories, with 4--8
carefully designed questions, including at least one question for each
timescale. Evaluating 23 MLLMs reveals a U-shaped performance curve, with
higher accuracy at the shortest and longest timescales and a dip at
intermediate levels. Furthermore, ablation studies show that increased visual
token capacity consistently enhances reasoning across all timescales. ScaleLong
offers a fine-grained, multi-timescale benchmark for advancing MLLM
capabilities in long-video understanding. The code and dataset are available

Conclusion: Point-MoE为3D理解提供了一种可扩展的路径，即让模型自动发现数据中的结构，而非依赖人工标注或域监督。

Abstract: While scaling laws have transformed natural language processing and computer
vision, 3D point cloud understanding has yet to reach that stage. This can be
attributed to both the comparatively smaller scale of 3D datasets, as well as
the disparate sources of the data itself. Point clouds are captured by diverse
sensors (e.g., depth cameras, LiDAR) across varied domains (e.g., indoor,
outdoor), each introducing unique scanning patterns, sampling densities, and
semantic biases. Such domain heterogeneity poses a major barrier towards
training unified models at scale, especially under the realistic constraint
that domain labels are typically inaccessible at inference time. In this work,
we propose Point-MoE, a Mixture-of-Experts architecture designed to enable
large-scale, cross-domain generalization in 3D perception. We show that
standard point cloud backbones degrade significantly in performance when
trained on mixed-domain data, whereas Point-MoE with a simple top-k routing
strategy can automatically specialize experts, even without access to domain
labels. Our experiments demonstrate that Point-MoE not only outperforms strong
multi-domain baselines but also generalizes better to unseen domains. This work
highlights a scalable path forward for 3D understanding: letting the model
discover structure in diverse 3D data, rather than imposing it via manual
curation or domain supervision.

Abstract: Text-to-Video (T2V) retrieval aims to identify the most relevant item from a
gallery of videos based on a user's text query. Traditional methods rely solely
on aligning video and text modalities to compute the similarity and retrieve
relevant items. However, recent advancements emphasise incorporating auxiliary

performance and bridge the semantic gap between these modalities. Auxiliary
information can include visual attributes, such as objects; temporal and
spatial context; and textual descriptions, such as speech and rephrased
captions. This survey comprehensively reviews 81 research papers on
Text-to-Video retrieval that utilise such auxiliary information. It provides a
detailed analysis of their methodologies; highlights state-of-the-art results
on benchmark datasets; and discusses available datasets and their auxiliary
information. Additionally, it proposes promising directions for future

Abstract: In this work, we focus on the task of weakly supervised affordance grounding,
where a model is trained to identify affordance regions on objects using
human-object interaction images and egocentric object images without dense
labels. Previous works are mostly built upon class activation maps, which are
effective for semantic segmentation but may not be suitable for locating
actions and functions. Leveraging recent advanced foundation models, we develop
a supervised training pipeline based on pseudo labels. The pseudo labels are
generated from an off-the-shelf part segmentation model, guided by a mapping
from affordance to part names. Furthermore, we introduce three key enhancements
to the baseline model: a label refining stage, a fine-grained feature alignment
process, and a lightweight reasoning module. These techniques harness the
semantic knowledge of static objects embedded in off-the-shelf foundation
models to improve affordance learning, effectively bridging the gap between
objects and actions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the performance of
the proposed model has achieved a breakthrough improvement over existing
methods. Our codes are available at https://github.com/woyut/WSAG-PLSP .

Abstract: Gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy is essential in identifying GI tract
abnormalities in order to detect diseases in their early stages and improve
patient outcomes. Although deep learning has shown success in supporting GI
diagnostics and decision-making, these models require curated datasets with
labels that are expensive to acquire. Foundation models offer a promising
solution by learning general-purpose representations, which can be finetuned
for specific tasks, overcoming data scarcity. Developing foundation models for
medical imaging holds significant potential, but the sensitive and protected
nature of medical data presents unique challenges. Foundation model training
typically requires extensive datasets, and while hospitals generate large
volumes of data, privacy restrictions prevent direct data sharing, making
foundation model training infeasible in most scenarios. In this work, we
propose a FL framework for training foundation models for gastroendoscopy
imaging, enabling data to remain within local hospital environments while
contributing to a shared model. We explore several established FL algorithms,
assessing their suitability for training foundation models without relying on
task-specific labels, conducting experiments in both homogeneous and
heterogeneous settings. We evaluate the trained foundation model on three
critical downstream tasks--classification, detection, and segmentation--and
demonstrate that it achieves improved performance across all tasks,
highlighting the effectiveness of our approach in a federated,
privacy-preserving setting.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of pathology foundation models in both research
and clinical decision support systems, exploring their security has become a
critical concern. However, despite their growing impact, the vulnerability of
these models to adversarial attacks remains largely unexplored. In this work,
we present the first systematic investigation into the security of pathology
foundation models for whole slide image~(WSI) analysis against adversarial
attacks. Specifically, we introduce the principle of \textit{local perturbation
with global impact} and propose a label-free attack framework that operates
without requiring access to downstream task labels. Under this attack
framework, we revise four classical white-box attack methods and redefine the
perturbation budget based on the characteristics of WSI. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on three representative pathology foundation models
across five datasets and six downstream tasks. Despite modifying only 0.1\% of
patches per slide with imperceptible noise, our attack leads to downstream
accuracy degradation that can reach up to 20\% in the worst cases. Furthermore,
we analyze key factors that influence attack success, explore the relationship
between patch-level vulnerability and semantic content, and conduct a
preliminary investigation into potential defence strategies. These findings lay
the groundwork for future research on the adversarial robustness and reliable
deployment of pathology foundation models. Our code is publicly available at:

Abstract: Learning a generalizable bimanual manipulation policy is extremely
challenging for embodied agents due to the large action space and the need for
coordinated arm movements. Existing approaches rely on Vision-Language-Action
(VLA) models to acquire bimanual policies. However, transferring knowledge from
single-arm datasets or pre-trained VLA models often fails to generalize
effectively, primarily due to the scarcity of bimanual data and the fundamental
differences between single-arm and bimanual manipulation. In this paper, we
propose a novel bimanual foundation policy by fine-tuning the leading
text-to-video models to predict robot trajectories and training a lightweight
diffusion policy for action generation. Given the lack of embodied knowledge in
text-to-video models, we introduce a two-stage paradigm that fine-tunes
independent text-to-flow and flow-to-video models derived from a pre-trained
text-to-video model. Specifically, optical flow serves as an intermediate
variable, providing a concise representation of subtle movements between
images. The text-to-flow model predicts optical flow to concretize the intent
of language instructions, and the flow-to-video model leverages this flow for
fine-grained video prediction. Our method mitigates the ambiguity of language
in single-stage text-to-video prediction and significantly reduces the
robot-data requirement by avoiding direct use of low-level actions. In
experiments, we collect high-quality manipulation data for real dual-arm robot,
and the results of simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method.

Conclusion: STORK是一种高效且通用的DM采样方法，适用于中NFE范围，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
high-fidelity image and video generation. Because high-quality generations with
DMs typically require a large number of function evaluations (NFEs), resulting
in slow sampling, there has been extensive research successfully reducing the
NFE to a small range (<10) while maintaining acceptable image quality. However,
many practical applications, such as those involving Stable Diffusion 3.5,
FLUX, and SANA, commonly operate in the mid-NFE regime (20-50 NFE) to achieve
superior results, and, despite the practical relevance, research on the
effective sampling within this mid-NFE regime remains underexplored. In this
work, we propose a novel, training-free, and structure-independent DM ODE
solver called the Stabilized Taylor Orthogonal Runge--Kutta (STORK) method,
based on a class of stiff ODE solvers with a Taylor expansion adaptation.
Unlike prior work such as DPM-Solver, which is dependent on the semi-linear
structure of the DM ODE, STORK is applicable to any DM sampling, including
noise-based and flow matching-based models. Within the 20-50 NFE range, STORK
achieves improved generation quality, as measured by FID scores, across
unconditional pixel-level generation and conditional latent-space generation
tasks using models like Stable Diffusion 3.5 and SANA. Code is available at

Abstract: This work investigates Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA), where a model
adapts to a target domain without access to source data. A new augmentation
technique, Shuffle PatchMix (SPM), and a novel reweighting strategy are
introduced to enhance performance. SPM shuffles and blends image patches to
generate diverse and challenging augmentations, while the reweighting strategy
prioritizes reliable pseudo-labels to mitigate label noise. These techniques
are particularly effective on smaller datasets like PACS, where overfitting and
pseudo-label noise pose greater risks. State-of-the-art results are achieved on
three major benchmarks: PACS, VisDA-C, and DomainNet-126. Notably, on PACS,
improvements of 7.3% (79.4% to 86.7%) and 7.2% are observed in single-target
and multi-target settings, respectively, while gains of 2.8% and 0.7% are
attained on DomainNet-126 and VisDA-C. This combination of advanced
augmentation and robust pseudo-label reweighting establishes a new benchmark
for SFDA. The code is available at: https://github.com/PrasannaPulakurthi/SPM

Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成中表现出色，但现有采样方法依赖一阶Langevin动力学，利用Hessian几何提升质量时面临高计算成本问题。

Method: 引入LML方法，通过低秩近似和阻尼机制训练免费地逼近扩散Hessian几何，避免显式二次复杂度计算。

Result: 实验表明，LML方法显著提升预训练扩散模型的图像生成质量，计算开销几乎可忽略。

Conclusion: LML方法为扩散模型提供了一种高效利用Hessian几何的途径，提升了生成质量。

Abstract: The diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated the remarkable capability of
generating images via learning the noised score function of data distribution.
Current DM sampling techniques typically rely on first-order Langevin dynamics
at each noise level, with efforts concentrated on refining inter-level
denoising strategies. While leveraging additional second-order Hessian geometry
to enhance the sampling quality of Langevin is a common practice in Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), the naive attempts to utilize Hessian geometry in
high-dimensional DMs lead to quadratic-complexity computational costs,
rendering them non-scalable. In this work, we introduce a novel
Levenberg-Marquardt-Langevin (LML) method that approximates the diffusion
Hessian geometry in a training-free manner, drawing inspiration from the
celebrated Levenberg-Marquardt optimization algorithm. Our approach introduces
two key innovations: (1) A low-rank approximation of the diffusion Hessian,
leveraging the DMs' inherent structure and circumventing explicit
quadratic-complexity computations; (2) A damping mechanism to stabilize the
approximated Hessian. This LML approximated Hessian geometry enables the
diffusion sampling to execute more accurate steps and improve the image
generation quality. We further conduct a theoretical analysis to substantiate
the approximation error bound of low-rank approximation and the convergence
property of the damping mechanism. Extensive experiments across multiple
pretrained DMs validate that the LML method significantly improves image
generation quality, with negligible computational overhead.

Conclusion: LTM3D提供了一个通用框架，支持多模态、多表示的3D生成。

Abstract: We present LTM3D, a Latent Token space Modeling framework for conditional 3D
shape generation that integrates the strengths of diffusion and auto-regressive
(AR) models. While diffusion-based methods effectively model continuous latent
spaces and AR models excel at capturing inter-token dependencies, combining
these paradigms for 3D shape generation remains a challenge. To address this,
LTM3D features a Conditional Distribution Modeling backbone, leveraging a
masked autoencoder and a diffusion model to enhance token dependency learning.
Additionally, we introduce Prefix Learning, which aligns condition tokens with
shape latent tokens during generation, improving flexibility across modalities.
We further propose a Latent Token Reconstruction module with
Reconstruction-Guided Sampling to reduce uncertainty and enhance structural
fidelity in generated shapes. Our approach operates in token space, enabling
support for multiple 3D representations, including signed distance fields,
point clouds, meshes, and 3D Gaussian Splatting. Extensive experiments on
image- and text-conditioned shape generation tasks demonstrate that LTM3D
outperforms existing methods in prompt fidelity and structural accuracy while
offering a generalizable framework for multi-modal, multi-representation 3D
generation.

Motivation: 交互式视频生成（IVG）中，用户控制运动元素（如对象轨迹）的挑战在于现有训练无关方法（如注意力掩码）会导致感知质量下降。论文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出两种解决方案：1）掩码归一化，通过分布匹配缓解注意力掩码引起的内部协变量偏移；2）时间内在扩散先验，确保初始噪声与IVG条件对齐。

Result: 实验表明，掩码归一化和时间内在扩散先验显著提升了感知质量和轨迹控制，优于现有IVG技术。

Conclusion: 论文通过域适应启发的解决方案，成功解决了IVG中的关键问题，为高质量交互式视频生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Text-conditioned diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for
high-quality video generation. However, enabling Interactive Video Generation
(IVG), where users control motion elements such as object trajectory, remains
challenging. Recent training-free approaches introduce attention masking to
guide trajectory, but this often degrades perceptual quality. We identify two
key failure modes in these methods, both of which we interpret as domain shift
problems, and propose solutions inspired by domain adaptation. First, we
attribute the perceptual degradation to internal covariate shift induced by
attention masking, as pretrained models are not trained to handle masked
attention. To address this, we propose mask normalization, a pre-normalization
layer designed to mitigate this shift via distribution matching. Second, we
address initialization gap, where the randomly sampled initial noise does not
align with IVG conditioning, by introducing a temporal intrinsic diffusion
prior that enforces spatio-temporal consistency at each denoising step.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that mask
normalization and temporal intrinsic denoising improve both perceptual quality
and trajectory control over the existing state-of-the-art IVG techniques.

Conclusion: VLMs在构建和维护3D场景表示上存在瓶颈，Disjoint-3DQA为长时空间推理研究提供了明确挑战。

Abstract: An embodied AI assistant operating on egocentric video must integrate spatial
cues across time - for instance, determining where an object A, glimpsed a few
moments ago lies relative to an object B encountered later. We introduce
Disjoint-3DQA , a generative QA benchmark that evaluates this ability of VLMs
by posing questions about object pairs that are not co-visible in the same
frame. We evaluated seven state-of-the-art VLMs and found that models lag
behind human performance by 28%, with steeper declines in accuracy (60% to 30
%) as the temporal gap widens. Our analysis further reveals that providing
trajectories or bird's-eye-view projections to VLMs results in only marginal
improvements, whereas providing oracle 3D coordinates leads to a substantial
20% performance increase. This highlights a core bottleneck of multi-frame VLMs
in constructing and maintaining 3D scene representations over time from visual
signals. Disjoint-3DQA therefore sets a clear, measurable challenge for
long-horizon spatial reasoning and aims to catalyze future research at the
intersection of vision, language, and embodied AI.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D human-aware generation have made significant progress.
However, existing methods still struggle with generating novel Human Object
Interaction (HOI) from text, particularly for open-set objects. We identify
three main challenges of this task: precise human-object relation reasoning,
affordance parsing for any object, and detailed human interaction pose
synthesis aligning description and object geometry. In this work, we propose a
novel zero-shot 3D HOI generation framework without training on specific
datasets, leveraging the knowledge from large-scale pre-trained models.
Specifically, the human-object relations are inferred from large language
models (LLMs) to initialize object properties and guide the optimization
process. Then we utilize a pre-trained 2D image diffusion model to parse unseen
objects and extract contact points, avoiding the limitations imposed by
existing 3D asset knowledge. The initial human pose is generated by sampling
multiple hypotheses through multi-view SDS based on the input text and object
geometry. Finally, we introduce a detailed optimization to generate
fine-grained, precise, and natural interaction, enforcing realistic 3D contact
between the 3D object and the involved body parts, including hands in grasping.
This is achieved by distilling human-level feedback from LLMs to capture
detailed human-object relations from the text instruction. Extensive
experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach compared to prior works,
particularly in terms of the fine-grained nature of interactions and the
ability to handle open-set 3D objects.

Conclusion: K-EVER²为视觉内容的情感理解提供了可扩展和通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding what emotions images evoke in their viewers is a foundational
goal in human-centric visual computing. While recent advances in
vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise for visual emotion analysis
(VEA), several key challenges remain unresolved. Emotional cues in images are
often abstract, overlapping, and entangled, making them difficult to model and
interpret. Moreover, VLMs struggle to align these complex visual patterns with
emotional semantics due to limited supervision and sparse emotional grounding.
Finally, existing approaches lack structured affective knowledge to resolve
ambiguity and ensure consistent emotional reasoning across diverse visual
domains.
  To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{K-EVER\textsuperscript{2}},
a knowledge-enhanced framework for emotion reasoning and retrieval. Our
approach introduces a semantically structured formulation of visual emotion
cues and integrates external affective knowledge through multimodal alignment.
Without relying on handcrafted labels or direct emotion supervision,
K-EVER\textsuperscript{2} achieves robust and interpretable emotion predictions
across heterogeneous image types.
  We validate our framework on three representative benchmarks, Emotion6,
EmoSet, and M-Disaster, covering social media imagery, human-centric scenes,
and disaster contexts. K-EVER\textsuperscript{2} consistently outperforms
strong CNN and VLM baselines, achieving up to a \textbf{19\% accuracy gain} for
specific emotions and a \textbf{12.3\% average accuracy gain} across all
emotion categories. Our results demonstrate a scalable and generalizable
solution for advancing emotional understanding of visual content.

Abstract: Video understanding has made remarkable progress in recent years, largely
driven by advances in deep models and the availability of large-scale annotated
datasets. However, existing works typically ignore the inherent domain shifts
encountered in real-world video applications, leaving domain generalization
(DG) in video understanding underexplored. Hence, we propose Video
Understanding Domain Generalization (VUDG), a novel dataset designed
specifically for evaluating the DG performance in video understanding. VUDG
contains videos from 11 distinct domains that cover three types of domain
shifts, and maintains semantic similarity across different domains to ensure
fair and meaningful evaluation. We propose a multi-expert progressive
annotation framework to annotate each video with both multiple-choice and
open-ended question-answer pairs. Extensive experiments on 9 representative
large video-language models (LVLMs) and several traditional video question
answering methods show that most models (including state-of-the-art LVLMs)
suffer performance degradation under domain shifts. These results highlight the
challenges posed by VUDG and the difference in the robustness of current models
to data distribution shifts. We believe VUDG provides a valuable resource for
prompting future research in domain generalization video understanding.

Conclusion: CroDiNo-KD为跨模态知识蒸馏提供了新思路，展示了其在RGBD语义分割中的有效性。

Abstract: Multi-modal RGB and Depth (RGBD) data are predominant in many domains such as
robotics, autonomous driving and remote sensing. The combination of these
multi-modal data enhances environmental perception by providing 3D spatial
context, which is absent in standard RGB images. Although RGBD multi-modal data
can be available to train computer vision models, accessing all sensor
modalities during the inference stage may be infeasible due to sensor failures
or resource constraints, leading to a mismatch between data modalities
available during training and inference. Traditional Cross-Modal Knowledge
Distillation (CMKD) frameworks, developed to address this task, are typically
based on a teacher/student paradigm, where a multi-modal teacher distills
knowledge into a single-modality student model. However, these approaches face
challenges in teacher architecture choices and distillation process selection,
thus limiting their adoption in real-world scenarios. To overcome these issues,
we introduce CroDiNo-KD (Cross-Modal Disentanglement: a New Outlook on
Knowledge Distillation), a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework
for RGBD semantic segmentation. Our approach simultaneously learns
single-modality RGB and Depth models by exploiting disentanglement
representation, contrastive learning and decoupled data augmentation with the
aim to structure the internal manifolds of neural network models through
interaction and collaboration. We evaluated CroDiNo-KD on three RGBD datasets
across diverse domains, considering recent CMKD frameworks as competitors. Our
findings illustrate the quality of CroDiNo-KD, and they suggest reconsidering
the conventional teacher/student paradigm to distill information from
multi-modal data to single-modality neural networks.

Conclusion: SORCE-1K是一个有效的基准，多嵌入表示和MLLM特征为解决小物体检索任务提供了潜力。

Abstract: Text-to-Image Retrieval (T2IR) is a highly valuable task that aims to match a
given textual query to images in a gallery. Existing benchmarks primarily focus
on textual queries describing overall image semantics or foreground salient
objects, possibly overlooking inconspicuous small objects, especially in
complex environments. Such small object retrieval is crucial, as in real-world
applications, the targets of interest are not always prominent in the image.
Thus, we introduce SORCE (Small Object Retrieval in Complex Environments), a
new subfield of T2IR, focusing on retrieving small objects in complex images
with textual queries. We propose a new benchmark, SORCE-1K, consisting of
images with complex environments and textual queries describing less
conspicuous small objects with minimal contextual cues from other salient
objects. Preliminary analysis on SORCE-1K finds that existing T2IR methods
struggle to capture small objects and encode all the semantics into a single
embedding, leading to poor retrieval performance on SORCE-1K. Therefore, we
propose to represent each image with multiple distinctive embeddings. We
leverage Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to extract multiple
embeddings for each image instructed by a set of Regional Prompts (ReP).
Experimental results show that our multi-embedding approach through MLLM and
ReP significantly outperforms existing T2IR methods on SORCE-1K. Our
experiments validate the effectiveness of SORCE-1K for benchmarking SORCE
performances, highlighting the potential of multi-embedding representation and
text-customized MLLM features for addressing this task.

Motivation: 传统SSL假设标记和未标记数据共享相同的类别分布，但实践中未标记数据常包含异常类别数据（异常值），导致模型性能下降。现有方法依赖单一模型的预测差异，在标记数据不足时效果不佳。

Method: DAC通过训练多个具有不同偏见的模型，利用它们在未标记数据上的预测差异来检测异常值。通过鼓励模型对异常值有不同偏见但对内点一致预测，实现鲁棒的异常检测。

Result: DAC在标记数据不足的情况下仍能有效检测异常值，性能优于传统SSL和现有开放集SSL方法。

Conclusion: DAC通过多模型预测差异解决了开放集SSL中的异常检测问题，尤其在标记数据不足时表现优越。

Abstract: Conventional semi-supervised learning (SSL) ideally assumes that labeled and
unlabeled data share an identical class distribution, however in practice, this
assumption is easily violated, as unlabeled data often includes unknown class
data, i.e., outliers. The outliers are treated as noise, considerably degrading
the performance of SSL models. To address this drawback, we propose a novel
framework, Diversify and Conquer (DAC), to enhance SSL robustness in the
context of open-set semi-supervised learning. In particular, we note that
existing open-set SSL methods rely on prediction discrepancies between inliers
and outliers from a single model trained on labeled data. This approach can be
easily failed when the labeled data is insufficient, leading to performance
degradation that is worse than naive SSL that do not account for outliers. In
contrast, our approach exploits prediction disagreements among multiple models
that are differently biased towards the unlabeled distribution. By leveraging
the discrepancies arising from training on unlabeled data, our method enables
robust outlier detection even when the labeled data is underspecified. Our key
contribution is constructing a collection of differently biased models through
a single training process. By encouraging divergent heads to be differently
biased towards outliers while making consistent predictions for inliers, we
exploit the disagreement among these heads as a measure to identify unknown
concepts. Our code is available at https://github.com/heejokong/DivCon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注外观跨模态检索，忽略了场景上下文信息，而后者能提供有价值的补充。

Method: 1. 第一阶段：通过对齐文本提示与行人特定区域进行外观定位。2. 第二阶段：利用多模态大语言模型SceneRanker，结合行人外观和全局场景上下文进行重排序。

Result: 在SCENEPERSON-13W数据集上验证了框架在场景级检索中的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的SA-Person框架通过结合外观和场景信息，提升了文本人物检索的性能。

Abstract: Text-based person retrieval aims to identify a target individual from a
gallery of images based on a natural language description. It presents a
significant challenge due to the complexity of real-world scenes and the
ambiguity of appearance-related descriptions. Existing methods primarily
emphasize appearance-based cross-modal retrieval, often neglecting the
contextual information embedded within the scene, which can offer valuable
complementary insights for retrieval. To address this, we introduce
SCENEPERSON-13W, a large-scale dataset featuring over 100,000 scenes with rich
annotations covering both pedestrian appearance and environmental cues. Based
on this, we propose SA-Person, a two-stage retrieval framework. In the first
stage, it performs discriminative appearance grounding by aligning textual cues
with pedestrian-specific regions. In the second stage, it introduces
SceneRanker, a training-free, scene-aware re-ranking method leveraging
multimodal large language models to jointly reason over pedestrian appearance
and the global scene context. Experiments on SCENEPERSON-13W validate the
effectiveness of our framework in challenging scene-level retrieval scenarios.
The code and dataset will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Transformers have been seldom employed in point cloud roof plane instance
segmentation, which is the focus of this study, and existing superpoint
Transformers suffer from limited performance due to the use of low-quality
superpoints. To address this challenge, we establish two criteria that
high-quality superpoints for Transformers should satisfy and introduce a
corresponding two-stage superpoint generation process. The superpoints
generated by our method not only have accurate boundaries, but also exhibit
consistent geometric sizes and shapes, both of which greatly benefit the
feature learning of superpoint Transformers. To compensate for the limitations
of deep learning features when the training set size is limited, we incorporate
multidimensional handcrafted features into the model. Additionally, we design a
decoder that combines a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network with a Transformer module to
improve instance prediction and mask extraction. Finally, our network's
predictions are refined using traditional algorithm-based postprocessing. For
evaluation, we annotated a real-world dataset and corrected annotation errors
in the existing RoofN3D dataset. Experimental results show that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on our dataset, as well as both the
original and reannotated RoofN3D datasets. Moreover, our model is not sensitive
to plane boundary annotations during training, significantly reducing the
annotation burden. Through comprehensive experiments, we also identified key
factors influencing roof plane segmentation performance: in addition to roof
types, variations in point cloud density, density uniformity, and 3D point
precision have a considerable impact. These findings underscore the importance
of incorporating data augmentation strategies that account for point cloud
quality to enhance model robustness under diverse and challenging conditions.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的U形编码器-解码器架构在医学图像分割中表现优异，但难以充分利用预训练视觉骨干（如ResNet、ViT、VMamba）的能力，主要由于结构不匹配。

Conclusion: ACM-UNet通过结合CNN和SSM的优势，实现了高性能和高效计算，为医学图像分割提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: The U-shaped encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections has become a
prevailing paradigm in medical image segmentation due to its simplicity and
effectiveness. While many recent works aim to improve this framework by
designing more powerful encoders and decoders, employing advanced convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) for local feature extraction, Transformers or state
space models (SSMs) such as Mamba for global context modeling, or hybrid
combinations of both, these methods often struggle to fully utilize pretrained
vision backbones (e.g., ResNet, ViT, VMamba) due to structural mismatches. To
bridge this gap, we introduce ACM-UNet, a general-purpose segmentation
framework that retains a simple UNet-like design while effectively
incorporating pretrained CNNs and Mamba models through a lightweight adapter
mechanism. This adapter resolves architectural incompatibilities and enables
the model to harness the complementary strengths of CNNs and SSMs-namely,
fine-grained local detail extraction and long-range dependency modeling.
Additionally, we propose a hierarchical multi-scale wavelet transform module in
the decoder to enhance feature fusion and reconstruction fidelity. Extensive
experiments on the Synapse and ACDC benchmarks demonstrate that ACM-UNet
achieves state-of-the-art performance while remaining computationally
efficient. Notably, it reaches 85.12% Dice Score and 13.89mm HD95 on the
Synapse dataset with 17.93G FLOPs, showcasing its effectiveness and
scalability. Code is available at: https://github.com/zyklcode/ACM-UNet.

Abstract: Object detection has recently seen an interesting trend in terms of the most
innovative research work, this task being of particular importance in the field
of remote sensing, given the consistency of these images in terms of
geographical coverage and the objects present. Furthermore, Deep Learning (DL)
models, in particular those based on Transformers, are especially relevant for
visual computing tasks in general, and target detection in particular. Thus,
the present work proposes an application of Deformable-DETR model, a specific
architecture using deformable attention mechanisms, on remote sensing images in
two different modes, especially optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). To
achieve this objective, two datasets are used, one optical, which is Pleiades
Aircraft dataset, and the other SAR, in particular SAR Ship Detection Dataset
(SSDD). The results of a 10-fold stratified validation showed that the proposed
model performed particularly well, obtaining an F1 score of 95.12% for the
optical dataset and 94.54% for SSDD, while comparing these results with several
models detections, especially those based on CNNs and transformers, as well as
those specifically designed to detect different object classes in remote
sensing images.

Method: 提出加权卷积框架，分离卷积核权重优化（使用SGD）和密度函数优化（使用DIRECT-L）。

Result: 实验显示，加权卷积在图像去噪任务中损失降低53%，测试精度提高，但执行时间增加11%。

Conclusion: 加权卷积在多种超参数下表现稳健，未来将应用于2D和3D图像任务。

Abstract: The paper introduces the weighted convolution, a novel approach to the
convolution for signals defined on regular grids (e.g., 2D images) through the
application of an optimal density function to scale the contribution of
neighbouring pixels based on their distance from the central pixel. This choice
differs from the traditional uniform convolution, which treats all neighbouring
pixels equally. Our weighted convolution can be applied to convolutional neural
network problems to improve the approximation accuracy. Given a convolutional
network, we define a framework to compute the optimal density function through
a minimisation model. The framework separates the optimisation of the
convolutional kernel weights (using stochastic gradient descent) from the
optimisation of the density function (using DIRECT-L). Experimental results on
a learning model for an image-to-image task (e.g., image denoising) show that
the weighted convolution significantly reduces the loss (up to 53% improvement)
and increases the test accuracy compared to standard convolution. While this
method increases execution time by 11%, it is robust across several
hyperparameters of the learning model. Future work will apply the weighted
convolution to real-case 2D and 3D image convolutional learning problems.

Result: 在四个公开数据集上验证，UST-RUN显著优于基线方法，例如在前列腺数据集上Dice分数提升了12.94%。

Conclusion: UST-RUN有效解决了MiDSS场景的挑战，为医学图像分割提供了新思路。

Abstract: Both limited annotation and domain shift are prevalent challenges in medical
image segmentation. Traditional semi-supervised segmentation and unsupervised
domain adaptation methods address one of these issues separately. However, the
coexistence of limited annotation and domain shift is quite common, which
motivates us to introduce a novel and challenging scenario: Mixed Domain
Semi-supervised medical image Segmentation (MiDSS), where limited labeled data
from a single domain and a large amount of unlabeled data from multiple
domains. To tackle this issue, we propose the UST-RUN framework, which fully
leverages intermediate domain information to facilitate knowledge transfer. We
employ Unified Copy-paste (UCP) to construct intermediate domains, and propose
a Symmetric GuiDance training strategy (SymGD) to supervise unlabeled data by
merging pseudo-labels from intermediate samples. Subsequently, we introduce a
Training Process aware Random Amplitude MixUp (TP-RAM) to progressively
incorporate style-transition components into intermediate samples. To generate
more diverse intermediate samples, we further select reliable samples with
high-quality pseudo-labels, which are then mixed with other unlabeled data.
Additionally, we generate sophisticated intermediate samples with high-quality
pseudo-labels for unreliable samples, ensuring effective knowledge transfer for
them. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the superiority
of UST-RUN. Notably, UST-RUN achieves a 12.94% improvement in Dice score on the
Prostate dataset. Our code is available at https://github.com/MQinghe/UST-RUN

Abstract: We introduce GARLIC (GAussian Representation LearnIng for spaCe
partitioning), a novel indexing structure based on \(N\)-dimensional Gaussians
for efficiently learning high-dimensional vector spaces. Our approach is
inspired from Gaussian splatting techniques, typically used in 3D rendering,
which we adapt for high-dimensional search and classification. We optimize
Gaussian parameters using information-theoretic objectives that balance
coverage, assignment confidence, and structural and semantic consistency. A key
contribution is to progressively refine the representation through split and
clone operations, handling hundreds of dimensions, thus handling varying data
densities. GARLIC offers the fast building times of traditional space
partitioning methods (e.g., under \(\sim5\) min build time for SIFT1M) while
achieving \(\sim50\%\) Recall10@10 in low-candidate regimes. Experimental
results on standard benchmarks demonstrate our method's consistency in (a)
\(k\)-NN retrieval, outperforming methods, such as Faiss-IVF, in fast-recall by
using about half their probes for the same Recall10@10 in Fashion-MNIST, and
(b) in classification tasks, beating by \(\sim15\%\) accuracy other majority
voting methods. Further, we show strong generalization capabilities,
maintaining high accuracy even with downsampled training data: using just
\(1\%\) of the training data returns \(\sim 45\%\) Recall@1, thus making GARLIC
quite powerful for applications requiring both speed and accuracy.

Motivation: 现有对比学习框架仅在损失端进行特征对比，分支间无信息交换，限制了表示学习能力。

Method: 引入子分支，允许分支间在损失端之前交换信息，提出PoCCA框架。

Result: 在无额外训练数据情况下，PoCCA在下游任务中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: PoCCA通过分支间信息交换提升了点云表示学习效果。

Abstract: Contrastive learning is an essential method in self-supervised learning. It
primarily employs a multi-branch strategy to compare latent representations
obtained from different branches and train the encoder. In the case of
multi-modal input, diverse modalities of the same object are fed into distinct
branches. When using single-modal data, the same input undergoes various
augmentations before being fed into different branches. However, all existing
contrastive learning frameworks have so far only performed contrastive
operations on the learned features at the final loss end, with no information
exchange between different branches prior to this stage. In this paper, for
point cloud unsupervised learning without the use of extra training data, we
propose a Contrastive Cross-branch Attention-based framework for Point cloud
data (termed PoCCA), to learn rich 3D point cloud representations. By
introducing sub-branches, PoCCA allows information exchange between different
branches before the loss end. Experimental results demonstrate that in the case
of using no extra training data, the representations learned with our
self-supervised model achieve state-of-the-art performances when used for
downstream tasks on point clouds.

Conclusion: LaGa通过捕捉视角依赖语义，实现了更全面的3D场景理解。

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) enable high-quality 3D
scene reconstruction from RGB images. Many studies extend this paradigm for
language-driven open-vocabulary scene understanding. However, most of them
simply project 2D semantic features onto 3D Gaussians and overlook a
fundamental gap between 2D and 3D understanding: a 3D object may exhibit
various semantics from different viewpoints--a phenomenon we term
view-dependent semantics. To address this challenge, we propose LaGa (Language
Gaussians), which establishes cross-view semantic connections by decomposing
the 3D scene into objects. Then, it constructs view-aggregated semantic
representations by clustering semantic descriptors and reweighting them based
on multi-view semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LaGa
effectively captures key information from view-dependent semantics, enabling a
more comprehensive understanding of 3D scenes. Notably, under the same
settings, LaGa achieves a significant improvement of +18.7% mIoU over the

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) generation have enabled models to

often struggle with complex instructions involving multiple objects,
attributes, and spatial relationships. Existing benchmarks for evaluating T2I
models primarily focus on general text-image alignment and fail to capture the
nuanced requirements of complex, multi-faceted prompts. Given this gap, we

evaluate T2I models under complex instructions. LongBench-T2I consists of 500
intricately designed prompts spanning nine diverse visual evaluation
dimensions, enabling a thorough assessment of a model's ability to follow
complex instructions. Beyond benchmarking, we propose an agent framework
(Plan2Gen) that facilitates complex instruction-driven image generation without
requiring additional model training. This framework integrates seamlessly with
existing T2I models, using large language models to interpret and decompose
complex prompts, thereby guiding the generation process more effectively. As
existing evaluation metrics, such as CLIPScore, fail to adequately capture the
nuances of complex instructions, we introduce an evaluation toolkit that
automates the quality assessment of generated images using a set of
multi-dimensional metrics. The data and code are released at

Abstract: Chinese Character Recognition (CCR) is a fundamental technology for
intelligent document processing. Unlike Latin characters, Chinese characters
exhibit unique spatial structures and compositional rules, allowing for the use
of fine-grained semantic information in representation. However, existing
approaches are usually based on auto-regressive as well as edit distance
post-process and typically rely on a single-level character representation. In
this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Multi-Granularity Image-Text Aligning
(Hi-GITA) framework based on a contrastive paradigm. To leverage the abundant
fine-grained semantic information of Chinese characters, we propose
multi-granularity encoders on both image and text sides. Specifically, the
Image Multi-Granularity Encoder extracts hierarchical image representations
from character images, capturing semantic cues from localized strokes to
holistic structures. The Text Multi-Granularity Encoder extracts stroke and
radical sequence representations at different levels of granularity. To better
capture the relationships between strokes and radicals, we introduce
Multi-Granularity Fusion Modules on the image and text sides, respectively.
Furthermore, to effectively bridge the two modalities, we further introduce a
Fine-Grained Decoupled Image-Text Contrastive loss, which aligns image and text
representations across multiple granularities. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed Hi-GITA significantly outperforms existing
zero-shot CCR methods. For instance, it brings about 20% accuracy improvement
in handwritten character and radical zero-shot settings. Code and models will
be released soon.

While recent advances in AI-driven user interface (UI) agents show promise,
most existing datasets and methods focus on short, low-complexity tasks in
mobile or web applications, failing to capture the demands of professional

engineering UI interaction learning for precision tasks. Specifically, VideoCAD
is a large-scale synthetic dataset consisting of over 41K annotated video
recordings of CAD operations, generated using an automated framework for
collecting high-fidelity UI action data from human-made CAD designs. Compared
to existing datasets, VideoCAD offers an order of magnitude higher complexity
in UI interaction learning for real-world engineering tasks, having up to a 20x
longer time horizon than other datasets. We show two important downstream
applications of VideoCAD: learning UI interactions from professional precision
3D CAD tools and a visual question-answering (VQA) benchmark designed to
evaluate multimodal large language models' (LLM) spatial reasoning and video
understanding abilities. To learn the UI interactions, we propose
VideoCADFormer - a state-of-the-art model in learning CAD interactions directly

VideoCADFormer and the VQA benchmark derived from VideoCAD reveal key

constrained settings to larger scale, diversity and realism. Code, model, and

renderings). ViStoryBench is carefully curated to balance narrative structures
and visual elements, featuring stories with single and multiple protagonists to
test models' ability to maintain character consistency. Additionally, it
includes complex plots and intricate world-building to challenge models in
generating accurate visuals. To ensure comprehensive comparisons, our benchmark
incorporates a wide range of evaluation metrics assessing critical aspects.
This structured and multifaceted framework enables researchers to thoroughly
identify both the strengths and weaknesses of different models, fostering
targeted improvements.

Abstract: Humans can intuitively compose and arrange scenes in the 3D space for
photography. However, can advanced AI image generators plan scenes with similar
3D spatial awareness when creating images from text or image prompts? We
present GenSpace, a novel benchmark and evaluation pipeline to comprehensively
assess the spatial awareness of current image generation models. Furthermore,
standard evaluations using general Vision-Language Models (VLMs) frequently
fail to capture the detailed spatial errors. To handle this challenge, we
propose a specialized evaluation pipeline and metric, which reconstructs 3D
scene geometry using multiple visual foundation models and provides a more
accurate and human-aligned metric of spatial faithfulness. Our findings show
that while AI models create visually appealing images and can follow general
instructions, they struggle with specific 3D details like object placement,
relationships, and measurements. We summarize three core limitations in the
spatial perception of current state-of-the-art image generation models: 1)
Object Perspective Understanding, 2) Egocentric-Allocentric Transformation and
3) Metric Measurement Adherence, highlighting possible directions for improving
spatial intelligence in image generation.

Result: 在仅6个采样步骤且无需CFG的情况下，实现了最先进的视频对象移除效果。

Conclusion: MiniMax-Remover在效率和效果上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in video diffusion models have driven rapid progress in video
editing techniques. However, video object removal, a critical subtask of video
editing, remains challenging due to issues such as hallucinated objects and
visual artifacts. Furthermore, existing methods often rely on computationally
expensive sampling procedures and classifier-free guidance (CFG), resulting in
slow inference. To address these limitations, we propose MiniMax-Remover, a
novel two-stage video object removal approach. Motivated by the observation
that text condition is not best suited for this task, we simplify the
pretrained video generation model by removing textual input and cross-attention
layers, resulting in a more lightweight and efficient model architecture in the
first stage. In the second stage, we distilled our remover on successful videos
produced by the stage-1 model and curated by human annotators, using a minimax
optimization strategy to further improve editing quality and inference speed.
Specifically, the inner maximization identifies adversarial input noise ("bad
noise") that makes failure removals, while the outer minimization step trains
the model to generate high-quality removal results even under such challenging
conditions. As a result, our method achieves a state-of-the-art video object
removal results with as few as 6 sampling steps and doesn't rely on CFG,
significantly improving inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness and superiority of MiniMax-Remover compared to existing
methods. Codes and Videos are available at: https://minimax-remover.github.io.

Abstract: Attention is a fundamental component of the human visual recognition system.
The inclusion of attention in a convolutional neural network amplifies relevant
visual features and suppresses the less important ones. Integrating attention
mechanisms into convolutional neural networks enhances model performance and
interpretability. Spatial and channel attention mechanisms have shown
significant advantages across many downstream tasks in medical imaging. While
existing attention modules have proven to be effective, their design often
lacks a robust theoretical underpinning. In this study, we address this gap by
proposing a non-linear attention architecture for cardiac MRI reconstruction
and hypothesize that insights from ecological principles can guide the
development of effective and efficient attention mechanisms. Specifically, we
investigate a non-linear ecological difference equation that describes
single-species population growth to devise a parameter-free attention module

Conclusion: 3DGEER通过精确的数学推导和高效的计算方法，显著提升了渲染质量和效率。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) marks a significant milestone in balancing the
quality and efficiency of differentiable rendering. However, its high
efficiency stems from an approximation of projecting 3D Gaussians onto the
image plane as 2D Gaussians, which inherently limits rendering
quality--particularly under large Field-of-View (FoV) camera inputs. While
several recent works have extended 3DGS to mitigate these approximation errors,
none have successfully achieved both exactness and high efficiency
simultaneously. In this work, we introduce 3DGEER, an Exact and Efficient
Volumetric Gaussian Rendering method. Starting from first principles, we derive
a closed-form expression for the density integral along a ray traversing a 3D
Gaussian distribution. This formulation enables precise forward rendering with
arbitrary camera models and supports gradient-based optimization of 3D Gaussian
parameters. To ensure both exactness and real-time performance, we propose an
efficient method for computing a tight Particle Bounding Frustum (PBF) for each
3D Gaussian, enabling accurate and efficient ray-Gaussian association. We also
introduce a novel Bipolar Equiangular Projection (BEAP) representation to
accelerate ray association under generic camera models. BEAP further provides a
more uniform ray sampling strategy to apply supervision, which empirically
improves reconstruction quality. Experiments on multiple pinhole and fisheye
datasets show that our method consistently outperforms prior methods,
establishing a new state-of-the-art in real-time neural rendering.

Motivation: 医学影像AI面临患者变异性、图像伪影和模型泛化能力不足的挑战，尤其是3D影像的数据稀缺和协议不一致问题。

Method: MEAL框架利用四种增强变体，通过专用编码器处理，并结合三种融合策略（CC、FL、BD）构建多编码器模型，保留增强感知特征。

Result: 在CT到T1加权MRI的翻译任务中，MEAL-BD在未见数据和预定义测试数据上表现最佳，PSNR和SSIM得分高于其他方法。

Conclusion: MEAL通过将增强视为多样化特征的来源，支持协议不变的学习，推动了临床可靠的医学影像解决方案。

Abstract: Medical imaging is critical for diagnostics, but clinical adoption of
advanced AI-driven imaging faces challenges due to patient variability, image
artifacts, and limited model generalization. While deep learning has
transformed image analysis, 3D medical imaging still suffers from data scarcity
and inconsistencies due to acquisition protocols, scanner differences, and
patient motion. Traditional augmentation uses a single pipeline for all
transformations, disregarding the unique traits of each augmentation and
struggling with large data volumes.
  To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-encoder Augmentation-Aware
Learning (MEAL) framework that leverages four distinct augmentation variants
processed through dedicated encoders. Three fusion strategies such as
concatenation (CC), fusion layer (FL), and adaptive controller block (BD) are
integrated to build multi-encoder models that combine augmentation-specific
features before decoding. MEAL-BD uniquely preserves augmentation-aware
representations, enabling robust, protocol-invariant feature learning.
  As demonstrated in a Computed Tomography (CT)-to-T1-weighted Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (MRI) translation study, MEAL-BD consistently achieved the
best performance on both unseen- and predefined-test data. On both geometric
transformations (like rotations and flips) and non-augmented inputs, MEAL-BD
outperformed other competing methods, achieving higher mean peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM)
scores. These results establish MEAL as a reliable framework for preserving
structural fidelity and generalizing across clinically relevant variability. By
reframing augmentation as a source of diverse, generalizable features, MEAL
supports robust, protocol-invariant learning, advancing clinically reliable
medical imaging solutions.

Conclusion: 论文揭示了对抗攻击对SLAM系统的严重威胁，强调了在关键应用中提升模型鲁棒性的必要性。

Abstract: Continuous advancements in deep learning have led to significant progress in
feature detection, resulting in enhanced accuracy in tasks like Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM). Nevertheless, the vulnerability of deep neural
networks to adversarial attacks remains a challenge for their reliable
deployment in applications, such as navigation of autonomous agents. Even
though CNN-based SLAM algorithms are a growing area of research there is a
notable absence of a comprehensive presentation and examination of adversarial
attacks targeting CNN-based feature detectors, as part of a SLAM system. Our
work introduces black-box adversarial perturbations applied to the RGB images
fed into the GCN-SLAM algorithm. Our findings on the TUM dataset [30] reveal
that even attacks of moderate scale can lead to tracking failure in as many as
76% of the frames. Moreover, our experiments highlight the catastrophic impact
of attacking depth instead of RGB input images on the SLAM system.

Conclusion: PatchDEMUX是一种通用且有效的方法，可为多标签分类任务提供可证明的鲁棒性防御。

Abstract: Deep learning techniques have enabled vast improvements in computer vision
technologies. Nevertheless, these models are vulnerable to adversarial patch
attacks which catastrophically impair performance. The physically realizable
nature of these attacks calls for certifiable defenses, which feature provable
guarantees on robustness. While certifiable defenses have been successfully
applied to single-label classification, limited work has been done for
multi-label classification. In this work, we present PatchDEMUX, a certifiably
robust framework for multi-label classifiers against adversarial patches. Our
approach is a generalizable method which can extend any existing certifiable
defense for single-label classification; this is done by considering the
multi-label classification task as a series of isolated binary classification
problems to provably guarantee robustness. Furthermore, in the scenario where
an attacker is limited to a single patch we propose an additional certification
procedure that can provide tighter robustness bounds. Using the current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) single-label certifiable defense PatchCleanser as a
backbone, we find that PatchDEMUX can achieve non-trivial robustness on the
MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets while maintaining high clean performance

Conclusion: Bi-JCR为多机器人协作提供了一种高效且实用的标定和表示方法。

Abstract: Robot manipulation, especially bimanual manipulation, often requires setting
up multiple cameras on multiple robot manipulators. Before robot manipulators
can generate motion or even build representations of their environments, the
cameras rigidly mounted to the robot need to be calibrated. Camera calibration
is a cumbersome process involving collecting a set of images, with each
capturing a pre-determined marker. In this work, we introduce the Bi-Manual
Joint Calibration and Representation Framework (Bi-JCR). Bi-JCR enables
multiple robot manipulators, each with cameras mounted, to circumvent taking
images of calibration markers. By leveraging 3D foundation models for dense,
marker-free multi-view correspondence, Bi-JCR jointly estimates: (i) the
extrinsic transformation from each camera to its end-effector, (ii) the
inter-arm relative poses between manipulators, and (iii) a unified,
scale-consistent 3D representation of the shared workspace, all from the same
captured RGB image sets. The representation, jointly constructed from images
captured by cameras on both manipulators, lives in a common coordinate frame
and supports collision checking and semantic segmentation to facilitate
downstream bimanual coordination tasks. We empirically evaluate the robustness
of Bi-JCR on a variety of tabletop environments, and demonstrate its
applicability on a variety of downstream tasks.

Abstract: Image editing is an important task in computer graphics, vision, and VFX,
with recent diffusion-based methods achieving fast and high-quality results.
However, edits requiring significant structural changes, such as non-rigid

Existing few step editing approaches produce artifacts such as irrelevant
texture or struggle to preserve key attributes of the source image (e.g.,
pose). We introduce Cora, a novel editing framework that addresses these
limitations by introducing correspondence-aware noise correction and
interpolated attention maps. Our method aligns textures and structures between
the source and target images through semantic correspondence, enabling accurate
texture transfer while generating new content when necessary. Cora offers
control over the balance between content generation and preservation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that, quantitatively and qualitatively, Cora excels in
maintaining structure, textures, and identity across diverse edits, including
pose changes, object addition, and texture refinements. User studies confirm
that Cora delivers superior results, outperforming alternatives.

Abstract: Understanding Greenland's subglacial topography is critical for projecting
the future mass loss of the ice sheet and its contribution to global sea-level
rise. However, the complex and sparse nature of observational data,
particularly information about the bed topography under the ice sheet,
significantly increases the uncertainty in model projections. Bed topography is
traditionally measured by airborne ice-penetrating radar that measures the ice
thickness directly underneath the aircraft, leaving data gap of tens of
kilometers in between flight lines. This study introduces a deep learning
framework, which we call as DeepTopoNet, that integrates radar-derived ice
thickness observations and BedMachine Greenland data through a novel dynamic
loss-balancing mechanism. Among all efforts to reconstruct bed topography,
BedMachine has emerged as one of the most widely used datasets, combining mass
conservation principles and ice thickness measurements to generate
high-resolution bed elevation estimates. The proposed loss function adaptively
adjusts the weighting between radar and BedMachine data, ensuring robustness in
areas with limited radar coverage while leveraging the high spatial resolution
of BedMachine predictions i.e. bed estimates. Our approach incorporates
gradient-based and trend surface features to enhance model performance and
utilizes a CNN architecture designed for subgrid-scale predictions. By
systematically testing on the Upernavik Isstr{\o}m) region, the model achieves
high accuracy, outperforming baseline methods in reconstructing subglacial
terrain. This work demonstrates the potential of deep learning in bridging
observational gaps, providing a scalable and efficient solution to inferring
subglacial topography.

Abstract: A long-held challenge in no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA)
learning from human subjective perception is the lack of objective
generalization to unseen natural distortions. To address this, we integrate a
novel Depth-Guided cross-attention and refinement (Depth-CAR) mechanism, which
distills scene depth and spatial features into a structure-aware representation
for improved NR-IQA. This brings in the knowledge of object saliency and
relative contrast of the scene for more discriminative feature learning.
Additionally, we introduce the idea of TCB (Transformer-CNN Bridge) to fuse
high-level global contextual dependencies from a transformer backbone with
local spatial features captured by a set of hierarchical CNN (convolutional
neural network) layers. We implement TCB and Depth-CAR as multimodal
attention-based projection functions to select the most informative features,
which also improve training time and inference efficiency. Experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed DGIQA model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on both synthetic and authentic benchmark datasets. More
importantly, DGIQA outperforms SOTA models on cross-dataset evaluations as well
as in assessing natural image distortions such as low-light effects, hazy

management; however, most existing methods depend on labor intensive
pixel-level annotations. A further challenge arises when models trained on one
field (source domain) fail to generalize to new fields (target domain) due to
domain shifts, such as variations in lighting, camera setups, soil composition,
and crop growth stages. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) addresses this by
enabling adaptation without target-domain labels, but current UDA methods
struggle with occlusions and visual blending between crops and weeds, leading
to misclassifications in real-world conditions. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce MaskAdapt, a novel approach that enhances segmentation accuracy
through multimodal contextual learning by integrating RGB images with features
derived from depth data. By computing depth gradients from depth maps, our
method captures spatial transitions that help resolve texture ambiguities.
These gradients, through a cross-attention mechanism, refines RGB feature
representations, resulting in sharper boundary delineation. In addition, we
propose a geometry-aware masking strategy that applies horizontal, vertical,
and stochastic masks during training. This encourages the model to focus on the
broader spatial context for robust visual recognition. Evaluations on real
agricultural datasets demonstrate that MaskAdapt consistently outperforms
existing State-of-the-Art (SOTA) UDA methods, achieving improved segmentation
mean Intersection over Union (mIOU) across diverse field conditions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种开源街景映射框架，用于自动测量和映射地面物体（如道路）、3D定位已知尺寸物体（如门和停车标志）以及测量直径（如街树），以提升建筑环境审计的效率和准确性。


<details>

Motivation: 传统建筑环境审计依赖耗时且昂贵的人工调查，而现有的街景图像映射方法和工具尚未形成通用框架，限制了审计效率。

Method: 研究提出了一个开源框架，包含三种管道：地面物体宽度测量、已知尺寸物体的3D定位和直径测量。

Result: 通过三个案例研究（道路宽度测量、停车标志定位和街树直径测量）验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架为建筑环境审计提供了自动化和标准化的解决方案，提高了生产力和准确性。

Abstract: Built environment auditing refers to the systematic documentation and
assessment of urban and rural spaces' physical, social, and environmental
characteristics, such as walkability, road conditions, and traffic lights. It
is used to collect data for the evaluation of how built environments impact
human behavior, health, mobility, and overall urban functionality.
Traditionally, built environment audits were conducted using field surveys and
manual observations, which were time-consuming and costly. The emerging street
view imagery, e.g., Google Street View, has become a widely used data source
for conducting built environment audits remotely. Deep learning and computer
vision techniques can extract and classify objects from street images to
enhance auditing productivity. Before meaningful analysis, the detected objects
need to be geospatially mapped for accurate documentation. However, the mapping
methods and tools based on street images are underexplored, and there are no
universal frameworks or solutions yet, imposing difficulties in auditing the
street objects. In this study, we introduced an open source street view mapping
framework, providing three pipelines to map and measure: 1) width measurement
for ground objects, such as roads; 2) 3D localization for objects with a known
dimension (e.g., doors and stop signs); and 3) diameter measurements (e.g.,
street trees). These pipelines can help researchers, urban planners, and other
professionals automatically measure and map target objects, promoting built
environment auditing productivity and accuracy. Three case studies, including
road width measurement, stop sign localization, and street tree diameter
measurement, are provided in this paper to showcase pipeline usage.

Result: SIPL显著提升了图像恢复任务的性能，例如在PromptIR模型上实现了PSNR的显著提升。

Conclusion: SIPL是一种高效且广泛适用的方法，能够无缝集成到多种架构中，提升图像恢复任务的性能。

Abstract: Unified image restoration models for diverse and mixed degradations often
suffer from unstable optimization dynamics and inter-task conflicts. This paper
introduces Self-Improved Privilege Learning (SIPL), a novel paradigm that
overcomes these limitations by innovatively extending the utility of privileged
information (PI) beyond training into the inference stage. Unlike conventional
Privilege Learning, where ground-truth-derived guidance is typically discarded
after training, SIPL empowers the model to leverage its own preliminary outputs
as pseudo-privileged signals for iterative self-refinement at test time.
Central to SIPL is Proxy Fusion, a lightweight module incorporating a learnable
Privileged Dictionary. During training, this dictionary distills essential
high-frequency and structural priors from privileged feature representations.
Critically, at inference, the same learned dictionary then interacts with
features derived from the model's initial restoration, facilitating a
self-correction loop. SIPL can be seamlessly integrated into various backbone
architectures, offering substantial performance improvements with minimal
computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SIPL
significantly advances the state-of-the-art on diverse all-in-one image
restoration benchmarks. For instance, when integrated with the PromptIR model,
SIPL achieves remarkable PSNR improvements of +4.58 dB on composite degradation
tasks and +1.28 dB on diverse five-task benchmarks, underscoring its
effectiveness and broad applicability. Codes are available at our project page

Abstract: Vision-based 6-DOF bronchoscopy localization offers a promising solution for
accurate and cost-effective interventional guidance. However, existing methods
struggle with 1) limited generalization across patient cases due to scarce
labeled data, and 2) poor robustness under visual degradation, as bronchoscopy
procedures frequently involve artifacts such as occlusions and motion blur that
impair visual information. To address these challenges, we propose PANSv2, a
generalizable and robust bronchoscopy localization framework. Motivated by PANS
that leverages multiple visual cues for pose likelihood measurement, PANSv2
integrates depth estimation, landmark detection, and centerline constraints
into a unified pose optimization framework that evaluates pose probability and
solves for the optimal bronchoscope pose. To further enhance generalization
capabilities, we leverage the endoscopic foundation model EndoOmni for depth
estimation and the video foundation model EndoMamba for landmark detection,
incorporating both spatial and temporal analyses. Pretrained on diverse
endoscopic datasets, these models provide stable and transferable visual
representations, enabling reliable performance across varied bronchoscopy
scenarios. Additionally, to improve robustness to visual degradation, we
introduce an automatic re-initialization module that detects tracking failures
and re-establishes pose using landmark detections once clear views are
available. Experimental results on bronchoscopy dataset encompassing 10 patient
cases show that PANSv2 achieves the highest tracking success rate, with an
18.1% improvement in SR-5 (percentage of absolute trajectory error under 5 mm)
compared to existing methods, showing potential towards real clinical usage.

Abstract: Remote sensing image (RSI) denoising is an important topic in the field of
remote sensing. Despite the impressive denoising performance of RSI denoising
methods, most current deep learning-based approaches function as black boxes
and lack integration with physical information models, leading to limited
interpretability. Additionally, many methods may struggle with insufficient
attention to non-local self-similarity in RSI and require tedious tuning of
regularization parameters to achieve optimal performance, particularly in
conventional iterative optimization approaches. In this paper, we first propose
a novel RSI denoising method named sparse tensor-aided representation network
(STAR-Net), which leverages a low-rank prior to effectively capture the
non-local self-similarity within RSI. Furthermore, we extend STAR-Net to a
sparse variant called STAR-Net-S to deal with the interference caused by
non-Gaussian noise in original RSI for the purpose of improving robustness.
Different from conventional iterative optimization, we develop an alternating
direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-guided deep unrolling network, in which
all regularization parameters can be automatically learned, thus inheriting the
advantages of both model-based and deep learning-based approaches and
successfully addressing the above-mentioned shortcomings. Comprehensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that STAR-Net and
STAR-Net-S outperform state-of-the-art RSI denoising methods.

Conclusion: 该框架通过捕捉长距离空间依赖性和优化语义表示，有效解决了FBIC的挑战。

Abstract: Fine-grained bird image classification (FBIC) is not only of great
significance for ecological monitoring and species identification, but also
holds broad research value in the fields of image recognition and fine-grained
visual modeling. Compared with general image classification tasks, FBIC poses
more formidable challenges: 1) the differences in species size and imaging
distance result in the varying sizes of birds presented in the images; 2)
complex natural habitats often introduce strong background interference; 3) and
highly flexible poses such as flying, perching, or foraging result in
substantial intra-class variability. These factors collectively make it
difficult for traditional methods to stably extract discriminative features,
thereby limiting the generalizability and interpretability of models in
real-world applications. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a
fine-grained bird classification framework based on strip-aware spatial
perception, which aims to capture long-range spatial dependencies across entire
rows or columns in bird images, thereby enhancing the model's robustness and
interpretability. The proposed method incorporates two novel modules:
extensional perception aggregator (EPA) and channel semantic weaving (CSW).
Specifically, EPA integrates local texture details with global structural cues
by aggregating information across horizontal and vertical spatial directions.
CSW further refines the semantic representations by adaptively fusing
long-range and short-range information along the channel dimension. Built upon
a ResNet-50 backbone, the model enables jump-wise connection of extended
structural features across the spatial domain. Experimental results on the
CUB-200-2011 dataset demonstrate that our framework achieves significant
performance improvements while maintaining architectural efficiency.

Abstract: Face recognition systems are designed to be robust against changes in head
pose, illumination, and blurring during image capture. If a malicious person
presents a face photo of the registered user, they may bypass the
authentication process illegally. Such spoofing attacks need to be detected
before face recognition. In this paper, we propose a spoofing attack detection
method based on Vision Transformer (ViT) to detect minute differences between
live and spoofed face images. The proposed method utilizes the intermediate
features of ViT, which have a good balance between local and global features
that are important for spoofing attack detection, for calculating loss in
training and score in inference. The proposed method also introduces two data
augmentation methods: face anti-spoofing data augmentation and patch-wise data
augmentation, to improve the accuracy of spoofing attack detection. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments using
the OULU-NPU and SiW datasets.

Abstract: Bridge models in image restoration construct a diffusion process from
degraded to clear images. However, existing methods typically require training
a bridge model from scratch for each specific type of degradation, resulting in
high computational costs and limited performance. This work aims to efficiently
leverage pretrained generative priors within existing image restoration bridges
to eliminate this requirement. The main challenge is that standard generative
models are typically designed for a diffusion process that starts from pure
noise, while restoration tasks begin with a low-quality image, resulting in a
mismatch in the state distributions between the two processes. To address this
challenge, we propose a transition equation that bridges two diffusion
processes with the same endpoint distribution. Based on this, we introduce the
IRBridge framework, which enables the direct utilization of generative models
within image restoration bridges, offering a more flexible and adaptable
approach to image restoration. Extensive experiments on six image restoration
tasks demonstrate that IRBridge efficiently integrates generative priors,
resulting in improved robustness and generalization performance. Code will be
available at GitHub.

Abstract: 3D point cloud anomaly detection is essential for robust vision systems but
is challenged by pose variations and complex geometric anomalies. Existing
patch-based methods often suffer from geometric fidelity issues due to discrete
voxelization or projection-based representations, limiting fine-grained anomaly
localization. We introduce Pose-Aware Signed Distance Field (PASDF), a novel
framework that integrates 3D anomaly detection and repair by learning a
continuous, pose-invariant shape representation. PASDF leverages a Pose
Alignment Module for canonicalization and a SDF Network to dynamically
incorporate pose, enabling implicit learning of high-fidelity anomaly repair
templates from the continuous SDF. This facilitates precise pixel-level anomaly
localization through an Anomaly-Aware Scoring Module. Crucially, the continuous
3D representation in PASDF extends beyond detection, facilitating in-situ
anomaly repair. Experiments on Real3D-AD and Anomaly-ShapeNet demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance, achieving high object-level AUROC scores of 80.2%
and 90.0%, respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of
continuous geometric representations in advancing 3D anomaly detection and
facilitating practical anomaly region repair. The code is available at

Abstract: Recently, methods leveraging diffusion model priors to assist monocular
geometric estimation (e.g., depth and normal) have gained significant attention
due to their strong generalization ability. However, most existing works focus
on estimating geometric properties within the camera coordinate system of
individual video frames, neglecting the inherent ability of diffusion models to
determine inter-frame correspondence. In this work, we demonstrate that,
through appropriate design and fine-tuning, the intrinsic consistency of video
generation models can be effectively harnessed for consistent geometric
estimation. Specifically, we 1) select geometric attributes in the global
coordinate system that share the same correspondence with video frames as the
prediction targets, 2) introduce a novel and efficient conditioning method by
reusing positional encodings, and 3) enhance performance through joint training
on multiple geometric attributes that share the same correspondence. Our
results achieve superior performance in predicting global geometric attributes
in videos and can be directly applied to reconstruction tasks. Even when
trained solely on static video data, our approach exhibits the potential to
generalize to dynamic video scenes.

The proposed operator maintains the same number of trainable parameters and is
fully compatible with existing CNN architectures. Although developed for 2D
image data, the framework is generalisable to signals on regular grids of
arbitrary dimensions, such as 3D volumetric data or 1D time series. We propose
an efficient implementation of the weighted convolution by pre-computing the
density function and achieving execution times comparable to standard
convolution layers. We evaluate our method on two deep learning tasks: image
classification using the CIFAR-100 dataset [KH+09] and image denoising using
the DIV2K dataset [AT17]. Experimental results with state-of-the-art
classification (e.g., VGG [SZ15], ResNet [HZRS16]) and denoising (e.g., DnCNN
[ZZC+17], NAFNet [CCZS22]) methods show that the weighted convolution improves
performance with respect to standard convolution across different quantitative
metrics. For example, VGG achieves an accuracy of 66.94% with weighted
convolution versus 56.89% with standard convolution on the classification
problem, while DnCNN improves the PSNR value from 20.17 to 22.63 on the
denoising problem. All models were trained on the CINECA Leonardo cluster to
reduce the execution time and improve the tuning of the density function
values. The PyTorch implementation of the weighted convolution is publicly
available at: https://github.com/cammarasana123/weightedConvolution2.0.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语OCR缺乏模拟真实书籍布局的大规模多样化数据集，限制了现代OCR模型的训练。

Method: 通过合成生成843,622张文档图像，包含6.9亿单词，覆盖10种阿拉伯字体，提供无噪声的干净数据。

Result: SARD为OCR和视觉语言模型的开发和评估提供了高质量资源，并展示了基准测试结果。

Conclusion: SARD填补了阿拉伯语OCR数据集的空白，为模型训练提供了可控且可扩展的环境。

Abstract: Arabic Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is essential for converting vast
amounts of Arabic print media into digital formats. However, training modern
OCR models, especially powerful vision-language models, is hampered by the lack
of large, diverse, and well-structured datasets that mimic real-world book
layouts. Existing Arabic OCR datasets often focus on isolated words or lines or
are limited in scale, typographic variety, or structural complexity found in
books. To address this significant gap, we introduce SARD (Large-Scale
Synthetic Arabic OCR Dataset). SARD is a massive, synthetically generated
dataset specifically designed to simulate book-style documents. It comprises
843,622 document images containing 690 million words, rendered across ten
distinct Arabic fonts to ensure broad typographic coverage. Unlike datasets
derived from scanned documents, SARD is free from real-world noise and
distortions, offering a clean and controlled environment for model training.
Its synthetic nature provides unparalleled scalability and allows for precise
control over layout and content variation. We detail the dataset's composition
and generation process and provide benchmark results for several OCR models,
including traditional and deep learning approaches, highlighting the challenges
and opportunities presented by this dataset. SARD serves as a valuable resource
for developing and evaluating robust OCR and vision-language models capable of
processing diverse Arabic book-style texts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统独立像素近似（IPA）方法因简化假设引入偏差，而现有深度学习模型对辐射强度变化和视角变化敏感，导致COT估计不准确。

Method: 提出CAAC模型，结合注意力机制和角度嵌入，考虑卫星视角几何和3D辐射效应，并通过多角度训练策略实现角度不变性。

Result: CAAC显著优于现有深度学习模型，将云属性检索误差降低了至少九倍。

Conclusion: CAAC通过角度不变性和注意力机制，显著提高了COT估计的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Cloud Optical Thickness (COT) is a critical cloud property influencing
Earth's climate, weather, and radiation budget. Satellite radiance measurements
enable global COT retrieval, but challenges like 3D cloud effects, viewing
angles, and atmospheric interference must be addressed to ensure accurate
estimation. Traditionally, the Independent Pixel Approximation (IPA) method,
which treats individual pixels independently, has been used for COT estimation.
However, IPA introduces significant bias due to its simplified assumptions.
Recently, deep learning-based models have shown improved performance over IPA
but lack robustness, as they are sensitive to variations in radiance intensity,
distortions, and cloud shadows. These models also introduce substantial errors
in COT estimation under different solar and viewing zenith angles. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel angle-invariant, attention-based deep
model called Cloud-Attention-Net with Angle Coding (CAAC). Our model leverages
attention mechanisms and angle embeddings to account for satellite viewing
geometry and 3D radiative transfer effects, enabling more accurate retrieval of
COT. Additionally, our multi-angle training strategy ensures angle invariance.
Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that CAAC significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art deep learning models, reducing cloud
property retrieval errors by at least a factor of nine.

Conclusion: DCF有效解决了半监督医学图像分割中的关键问题，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Confronting the critical challenge of insufficiently annotated samples in
medical domain, semi-supervised medical image segmentation (SSMIS) emerges as a
promising solution. Specifically, most methodologies following the Mean Teacher
(MT) or Dual Students (DS) architecture have achieved commendable results.
However, to date, these approaches face a performance bottleneck due to two
inherent limitations, \textit{e.g.}, the over-coupling problem within MT
structure owing to the employment of exponential moving average (EMA)
mechanism, as well as the severe cognitive bias between two students of DS
structure, both of which potentially lead to reduced efficacy, or even model
collapse eventually. To mitigate these issues, a Decoupled Competitive
Framework (DCF) is elaborated in this work, which utilizes a straightforward
competition mechanism for the update of EMA, effectively decoupling students
and teachers in a dynamical manner. In addition, the seamless exchange of
invaluable and precise insights is facilitated among students, guaranteeing a
better learning paradigm. The DCF introduced undergoes rigorous validation on
three publicly accessible datasets, which encompass both 2D and 3D datasets.
The results demonstrate the superiority of our method over previous
cutting-edge competitors. Code will be available at

Abstract: The accurate estimation of 6D pose remains a challenging task within the
computer vision domain, even when utilizing 3D point cloud data. Conversely, in
the manufacturing domain, instances arise where leveraging prior knowledge can
yield advancements in this endeavor. This study focuses on the disassembly of
starter motors to augment the engineering of product life cycles. A pivotal
objective in this context involves the identification and 6D pose estimation of
bolts affixed to the motors, facilitating automated disassembly within the
manufacturing workflow. Complicating matters, the presence of occlusions and
the limitations of single-view data acquisition, notably when motors are placed
in a clamping system, obscure certain portions and render some bolts
imperceptible. Consequently, the development of a comprehensive pipeline
capable of acquiring complete bolt information is imperative to avoid oversight
in bolt detection. In this paper, employing the task of bolt detection within
the scope of our project as a pertinent use case, we introduce a meticulously
devised pipeline. This multi-stage pipeline effectively captures the 6D
information with regard to all bolts on the motor, thereby showcasing the
effective utilization of prior knowledge in handling this challenging task. The
proposed methodology not only contributes to the field of 6D pose estimation
but also underscores the viability of integrating domain-specific insights to
tackle complex problems in manufacturing and automation.

Motivation: FACS编码过程耗时且昂贵，且自动化检测精度不足，无法完整表示面部表情。因此，需要一种新的编码系统来克服这些限制。

Method: 提出了一种无监督的数据驱动编码系统Facial Basis，通过局部化和可解释的3D面部运动单元，解决了FACS的三个结构性问题。

Result: Facial Basis在预测自闭症诊断中表现优于常用AU检测器，证明了其全面编码面部行为的重要性。

Conclusion: Facial Basis是首个替代FACS的面部表情分解方法，具有开源实现。

Abstract: The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) has been used by numerous studies to
investigate the links between facial behavior and mental health. The laborious
and costly process of FACS coding has motivated the development of machine
learning frameworks for Action Unit (AU) detection. Despite intense efforts
spanning three decades, the detection accuracy for many AUs is considered to be
below the threshold needed for behavioral research. Also, many AUs are excluded
altogether, making it impossible to fulfill the ultimate goal of FACS-the
representation of any facial expression in its entirety. This paper considers
an alternative approach. Instead of creating automated tools that mimic FACS
experts, we propose to use a new coding system that mimics the key properties
of FACS. Specifically, we construct a data-driven coding system called the
Facial Basis, which contains units that correspond to localized and
interpretable 3D facial movements, and overcomes three structural limitations
of automated FACS coding. First, the proposed method is completely
unsupervised, bypassing costly, laborious and variable manual annotation.
Second, Facial Basis reconstructs all observable movement, rather than relying
on a limited repertoire of recognizable movements (as in automated FACS).
Finally, the Facial Basis units are additive, whereas AUs may fail detection
when they appear in a non-additive combination. The proposed method outperforms
the most frequently used AU detector in predicting autism diagnosis from
in-person and remote conversations, highlighting the importance of encoding
facial behavior comprehensively. To our knowledge, Facial Basis is the first
alternative to FACS for deconstructing facial expressions in videos into
localized movements. We provide an open source implementation of the method at
github.com/sariyanidi/FacialBasis.

Abstract: This paper presents DreamDance, a novel character art animation framework
capable of producing stable, consistent character and scene motion conditioned
on precise camera trajectories. To achieve this, we re-formulate the animation
task as two inpainting-based steps: Camera-aware Scene Inpainting and
Pose-aware Video Inpainting. The first step leverages a pre-trained image
inpainting model to generate multi-view scene images from the reference art and
optimizes a stable large-scale Gaussian field, which enables coarse background
video rendering with camera trajectories. However, the rendered video is rough
and only conveys scene motion. To resolve this, the second step trains a
pose-aware video inpainting model that injects the dynamic character into the
scene video while enhancing background quality. Specifically, this model is a
DiT-based video generation model with a gating strategy that adaptively
integrates the character's appearance and pose information into the base
background video. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the
effectiveness and generalizability of DreamDance, producing high-quality and
consistent character animations with remarkable camera dynamics.

Abstract: Traditional diagnostic methods like colonoscopy are invasive yet critical
tools necessary for accurately diagnosing colorectal cancer (CRC). Detection of
CRC at early stages is crucial for increasing patient survival rates. However,
colonoscopy is dependent on obtaining adequate and high-quality endoscopic
images. Prolonged invasive procedures are inherently risky for patients, while
suboptimal or insufficient images hamper diagnostic accuracy. These images,
typically derived from video frames, often exhibit similar patterns, posing
challenges in discrimination. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel
Deep Learning network built on a Few-Shot Learning architecture, which includes
a tailored feature extractor, task interpolation, relational embedding, and a
bi-level routing attention mechanism. The Few-Shot Learning paradigm enables
our model to rapidly adapt to unseen fine-grained endoscopic image patterns,
and the task interpolation augments the insufficient images artificially from
varied instrument viewpoints. Our relational embedding approach discerns
critical intra-image features and captures inter-image transitions between
consecutive endoscopic frames, overcoming the limitations of Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs). The integration of a light-weight attention mechanism
ensures a concentrated analysis of pertinent image regions. By training on
diverse datasets, the model's generalizability and robustness are notably
improved for handling endoscopic images. Evaluated on Kvasir dataset, our model
demonstrated superior performance, achieving an accuracy of 90.1\%, precision
of 0.845, recall of 0.942, and an F1 score of 0.891. This surpasses current
state-of-the-art methods, presenting a promising solution to the challenges of
invasive colonoscopy by optimizing CRC detection through advanced image
analysis.

Abstract: Historical maps offer an invaluable perspective into territory evolution
across past centuries--long before satellite or remote sensing technologies
existed. Deep learning methods have shown promising results in segmenting
historical maps, but publicly available datasets typically focus on a single
map type or period, require extensive and costly annotations, and are not
suited for nationwide, long-term analyses. In this paper, we introduce a new
dataset of historical maps tailored for analyzing large-scale, long-term land
use and land cover evolution with limited annotations. Spanning metropolitan
France (548,305 km^2), our dataset contains three map collections from the
18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. We provide both comprehensive modern labels and
22,878 km^2 of manually annotated historical labels for the 18th and 19th
century maps. Our dataset illustrates the complexity of the segmentation task,
featuring stylistic inconsistencies, interpretive ambiguities, and significant
landscape changes (e.g., marshlands disappearing in favor of forests). We
assess the difficulty of these challenges by benchmarking three approaches: a
fully-supervised model trained with historical labels, and two
weakly-supervised models that rely only on modern annotations. The latter
either use the modern labels directly or first perform image-to-image
translation to address the stylistic gap between historical and contemporary
maps. Finally, we discuss how these methods can support long-term environment
monitoring, offering insights into centuries of landscape transformation. Our

innovations: (1) A pose-conditioned 3D joint diffusion model that synthesizes
consistent multi-view images in arbitrary poses alongside corresponding 3D
Gaussian Splats (3DGS) reconstruction at each diffusion step; (2) A
compositional 3DGS refinement module that enhances the details of local body
parts through image-to-image refinement and seamlessly integrates them using a
novel crop-aware camera ray map, producing a cohesive detailed 3D avatar. These
components allow AdaHuman to generate highly realistic standardized A-pose
avatars with minimal self-occlusion, enabling rigging and animation with any
input motion. Extensive evaluation on public benchmarks and in-the-wild images

in both avatar reconstruction and reposing. Code and models will be publicly

Abstract: Motion-related artifacts are inevitable in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)

Manual review cannot objectively quantify motion in anatomical scans, and

network to estimate motion severity using only synthetically corrupted volumes.
We validate our method with one held-out site from our training cohort and with
14 fully independent datasets, including one with manual ratings, achieving a
representative $R^2 = 0.65$ versus manual labels and significant
thickness-motion correlations in 12/15 datasets. Furthermore, our predicted

Prediction, a post-hoc procedure which offers statistical guarantees that are

problem of Conformal Object Detection (COD) and introduce a novel method,
Sequential Conformal Risk Control (SeqCRC), that extends the statistical
guarantees of Conformal Risk Control (CRC) to two sequential tasks with two
parameters, as required in the COD setting. Then, we propose loss functions and
prediction sets suited to applying CRC to different applications and
certification requirements. Finally, we present a conformal toolkit, enabling
replication and further exploration of our methods. Using this toolkit, we
perform extensive experiments, yielding a benchmark that validates the
investigated methods and emphasizes trade-offs and other practical
consequences.

Abstract: Medical image challenges have played a transformative role in advancing the
field, catalyzing algorithmic innovation and establishing new performance
standards across diverse clinical applications. Image registration, a
foundational task in neuroimaging pipelines, has similarly benefited from the
Learn2Reg initiative. Building on this foundation, we introduce the Large-scale
Unsupervised Brain MRI Image Registration (LUMIR) challenge, a next-generation
benchmark designed to assess and advance unsupervised brain MRI registration.
Distinct from prior challenges that leveraged anatomical label maps for
supervision, LUMIR removes this dependency by providing over 4,000 preprocessed
T1-weighted brain MRIs for training without any label maps, encouraging
biologically plausible deformation modeling through self-supervision. In
addition to evaluating performance on 590 held-out test subjects, LUMIR
introduces a rigorous suite of zero-shot generalization tasks, spanning
out-of-domain imaging modalities (e.g., FLAIR, T2-weighted, T2*-weighted),
disease populations (e.g., Alzheimer's disease), acquisition protocols (e.g.,
9.4T MRI), and species (e.g., macaque brains). A total of 1,158 subjects and
over 4,000 image pairs were included for evaluation. Performance was assessed
using both segmentation-based metrics (Dice coefficient, 95th percentile
Hausdorff distance) and landmark-based registration accuracy (target
registration error). Across both in-domain and zero-shot tasks, deep
learning-based methods consistently achieved state-of-the-art accuracy while
producing anatomically plausible deformation fields. The top-performing deep
learning-based models demonstrated diffeomorphic properties and inverse
consistency, outperforming several leading optimization-based methods, and
showing strong robustness to most domain shifts, the exception being a drop in
performance on out-of-domain contrasts.

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D robotic manipulation have improved grasping of
everyday objects, but transparent and specular materials remain challenging due
to depth sensing limitations. While several 3D reconstruction and depth
completion approaches address these challenges, they suffer from setup
complexity or limited observation information utilization. To address this,
leveraging the power of single view 3D object reconstruction approaches, we
propose a training free framework SR3D that enables robotic grasping of
transparent and specular objects from a single view observation. Specifically,
given single view RGB and depth images, SR3D first uses the external visual
models to generate 3D reconstructed object mesh based on RGB image. Then, the
key idea is to determine the 3D object's pose and scale to accurately localize
the reconstructed object back into its original depth corrupted 3D scene.
Therefore, we propose view matching and keypoint matching mechanisms,which
leverage both the 2D and 3D's inherent semantic and geometric information in
the observation to determine the object's 3D state within the scene, thereby
reconstructing an accurate 3D depth map for effective grasp detection.
Experiments in both simulation and real world show the reconstruction
effectiveness of SR3D.

TL;DR: 提出了FrENet，一种针对RAW图像去模糊的频率增强网络，通过自适应频率位置调制模块和频域跳跃连接，显著提升了去模糊效果和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法主要关注sRGB图像，而RAW图像具有更高的恢复潜力但研究不足。FrENet旨在解决RAW图像去模糊的独特挑战。

Method: FrENet直接在频域操作，引入自适应频率位置调制模块和频域跳跃连接，动态调整频率成分并保留高频细节。

Result: FrENet在RAW图像去模糊上优于现有方法，恢复质量更高且计算效率更高，还可扩展到sRGB图像。

Conclusion: FrENet为RAW图像去模糊提供了高效解决方案，并展示了在sRGB图像上的扩展潜力。

Abstract: Image deblurring plays a crucial role in enhancing visual clarity across
various applications. Although most deep learning approaches primarily focus on
sRGB images, which inherently lose critical information during the image signal
processing pipeline, RAW images, being unprocessed and linear, possess superior
restoration potential but remain underexplored. Deblurring RAW images presents
unique challenges, particularly in handling frequency-dependent blur while
maintaining computational efficiency. To address these issues, we propose
Frequency Enhanced Network (FrENet), a framework specifically designed for
RAW-to-RAW deblurring that operates directly in the frequency domain. We
introduce a novel Adaptive Frequency Positional Modulation module, which
dynamically adjusts frequency components according to their spectral positions,
thereby enabling precise control over the deblurring process. Additionally,
frequency domain skip connections are adopted to further preserve
high-frequency details. Experimental results demonstrate that FrENet surpasses
state-of-the-art deblurring methods in RAW image deblurring, achieving
significantly better restoration quality while maintaining high efficiency in
terms of reduced MACs. Furthermore, FrENet's adaptability enables it to be
extended to sRGB images, where it delivers comparable or superior performance
compared to methods specifically designed for sRGB data. The code will be
available at https://github.com/WenlongJiao/FrENet .

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of reconstructing a high-resolution
hyperspectral image from a low-resolution multispectral observation. While
spatial super-resolution and spectral super-resolution have been extensively
studied, joint spatio-spectral super-resolution remains relatively explored. We
propose an end-to-end model-driven framework that explicitly decomposes the
joint spatio-spectral super-resolution problem into spatial super-resolution,
spectral super-resolution and fusion tasks. Each sub-task is addressed by
unfolding a variational-based approach, where the operators involved in the
proximal gradient iterative scheme are replaced with tailored learnable
modules. In particular, we design an upsampling operator for spatial
super-resolution based on classical back-projection algorithms, adapted to
handle arbitrary scaling factors. Spectral reconstruction is performed using
learnable cluster-based upsampling and downsampling operators. For image
fusion, we integrate low-frequency estimation and high-frequency injection
modules to combine the spatial and spectral information from spatial
super-resolution and spectral super-resolution outputs. Additionally, we
introduce an efficient nonlocal post-processing step that leverages image
self-similarity by combining a multi-head attention mechanism with residual
connections. Extensive evaluations on several datasets and sampling factors
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The source code will be

Conclusion: TumorGen为AI驱动的癌症诊断提供了高效且真实的肿瘤合成解决方案。

Abstract: Tumor data synthesis offers a promising solution to the shortage of annotated
medical datasets. However, current approaches either limit tumor diversity by
using predefined masks or employ computationally expensive two-stage processes
with multiple denoising steps, causing computational inefficiency.
Additionally, these methods typically rely on binary masks that fail to capture
the gradual transitions characteristic of tumor boundaries. We present
TumorGen, a novel Boundary-Aware Tumor-Mask Synthesis with Rectified Flow
Matching for efficient 3D tumor synthesis with three key components: a
Boundary-Aware Pseudo Mask Generation module that replaces strict binary masks
with flexible bounding boxes; a Spatial-Constraint Vector Field Estimator that
simultaneously synthesizes tumor latents and masks using rectified flow
matching to ensure computational efficiency; and a VAE-guided mask refiner that
enhances boundary realism. TumorGen significantly improves computational
efficiency by requiring fewer sampling steps while maintaining pathological
accuracy through coarse and fine-grained spatial constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate TumorGen's superior performance over existing tumor
synthesis methods in both efficiency and realism, offering a valuable
contribution to AI-driven cancer diagnostics.

Conclusion: 该方法高效且准确，适用于高维数据中的正则化参数估计。

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating a regularization parameter, or a
shrinkage coefficient $\alpha \in (0,1)$ for Regularized Tyler's M-estimator
(RTME). In particular, we propose to estimate an optimal shrinkage coefficient
by setting $\alpha$ as the solution to a suitably chosen objective function;
namely the leave-one-out cross-validated (LOOCV) log-likelihood loss. Since
LOOCV is computationally prohibitive even for moderate sample size $n$, we
propose a computationally efficient approximation for the LOOCV log-likelihood
loss that eliminates the need for invoking the RTME procedure $n$ times for
each sample left out during the LOOCV procedure. This approximation yields an
$O(n)$ reduction in the running time complexity for the LOOCV procedure, which
results in a significant speedup for computing the LOOCV estimate. We
demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed approach on synthetic
high-dimensional data sampled from heavy-tailed elliptical distributions, as
well as on real high-dimensional datasets for object recognition, face
recognition, and handwritten digit's recognition. Our experiments show that the
proposed approach is efficient and consistently more accurate than other
methods in the literature for shrinkage coefficient estimation.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) renders pixels by rasterizing Gaussian
primitives, where conditional alpha-blending dominates the time cost in the
rendering pipeline. This paper proposes TC-GS, an algorithm-independent
universal module that expands Tensor Core (TCU) applicability for 3DGS, leading
to substantial speedups and seamless integration into existing 3DGS
optimization frameworks. The key innovation lies in mapping alpha computation
to matrix multiplication, fully utilizing otherwise idle TCUs in existing 3DGS
implementations. TC-GS provides plug-and-play acceleration for existing
top-tier acceleration algorithms tightly coupled with rendering pipeline
designs, like Gaussian compression and redundancy elimination algorithms.
Additionally, we introduce a global-to-local coordinate transformation to
mitigate rounding errors from quadratic terms of pixel coordinates caused by
Tensor Core half-precision computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method maintains rendering quality while providing an additional 2.18x
speedup over existing Gaussian acceleration algorithms, thus reaching up to a
total 5.6x acceleration. The code is currently available at anonymous

achieve this. Specifically, we propose a parameter-free frame generation
strategy, as well as a multi-reference attention mechanism, that effectively
integrate appearance information from both the front and back selfies into the
video diffusion model. Additionally, we introduce an image-based fine-tuning
strategy to enhance frame sharpness and improve the generation of shadows and

Abstract: Reconstructing visual stimuli from EEG signals is a crucial step in realizing
brain-computer interfaces. In this paper, we propose a transformer-based EEG
signal encoder integrating the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and the gating
mechanism. Guided by the feature alignment and category-aware fusion losses,
this encoder is used to extract features related to visual stimuli from EEG
signals. Subsequently, with the aid of a pre-trained diffusion model, these
features are reconstructed into visual stimuli. To verify the effectiveness of
the model, we conducted EEG-to-image generation and classification tasks using
the THINGS-EEG dataset. To address the limitations of quantitative analysis at
the semantic level, we combined WordNet-based classification and semantic
similarity metrics to propose a novel semantic-based score, emphasizing the
ability of our model to transfer neural activities into visual representations.
Experimental results show that our model significantly improves semantic

Abstract: In this paper, we leverage the advantages of event cameras to resist harsh

simple and efficient long-sequence event Re-ID model, namely the Spike-guided
Spatiotemporal Semantic Coupling and Expansion Network (S3CE-Net). To better
handle asynchronous event data, we build S3CE-Net based on spiking neural
networks (SNNs). The S3CE-Net incorporates the Spike-guided Spatial-temporal
Attention Mechanism (SSAM) and the Spatiotemporal Feature Sampling Strategy
(STFS). The SSAM is designed to carry out semantic interaction and association
in both spatial and temporal dimensions, leveraging the capabilities of SNNs.
The STFS involves sampling spatial feature subsequences and temporal feature
subsequences from the spatiotemporal dimensions, driving the Re-ID model to
perceive broader and more robust effective semantics. Notably, the STFS
introduces no additional parameters and is only utilized during the training
stage. Therefore, S3CE-Net is a low-parameter and high-efficiency model for
long-sequence event-based person Re-ID. Extensive experiments have verified
that our S3CE-Net achieves outstanding performance on many mainstream
long-sequence event-based person Re-ID datasets. Code is available

Abstract: LiDAR semantic segmentation plays a vital role in autonomous driving.
Existing voxel-based methods for LiDAR semantic segmentation apply uniform
partition to the 3D LiDAR point cloud to form a structured representation based
on cartesian/cylindrical coordinates. Although these methods show impressive
performance, the drawback of existing voxel-based methods remains in two
aspects: (1) it requires a large enough input voxel resolution, which brings a
large amount of computation cost and memory consumption. (2) it does not well
handle the unbalanced point distribution of LiDAR point cloud. In this paper,
we propose a non-uniform cylindrical partition network named NUC-Net to tackle
the above challenges. Specifically, we propose the Arithmetic Progression of
Interval (API) method to non-uniformly partition the radial axis and generate
the voxel representation which is representative and efficient. Moreover, we
propose a non-uniform multi-scale aggregation method to improve contextual
information. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on SemanticKITTI
and nuScenes datasets with much faster speed and much less training time. And
our method can be a general component for LiDAR semantic segmentation, which
significantly improves both the accuracy and efficiency of the uniform
counterpart by $4 \times$ training faster and $2 \times$ GPU memory reduction
and $3 \times$ inference speedup. We further provide theoretical analysis
towards understanding why NUC is effective and how point distribution affects
performance. Code is available at

Abstract: Accurate 6D object pose estimation is essential for robotic grasping and
manipulation, particularly in agriculture, where fruits and vegetables exhibit
high intra-class variability in shape, size, and texture. The vast majority of
existing methods rely on instance-specific CAD models or require depth sensors
to resolve geometric ambiguities, making them impractical for real-world
agricultural applications. In this work, we introduce PLANTPose, a novel
framework for category-level 6D pose estimation that operates purely on RGB
input. PLANTPose predicts both the 6D pose and deformation parameters relative
to a base mesh, allowing a single category-level CAD model to adapt to unseen
instances. This enables accurate pose estimation across varying shapes without
relying on instance-specific data. To enhance realism and improve
generalization, we also leverage Stable Diffusion to refine synthetic training
images with realistic texturing, mimicking variations due to ripeness and
environmental factors and bridging the domain gap between synthetic data and
the real world. Our evaluations on a challenging benchmark that includes
bananas of various shapes, sizes, and ripeness status demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework in handling large intraclass variations while
maintaining accurate 6D pose predictions, significantly outperforming the
state-of-the-art RGB-based approach MegaPose.

Abstract: Domain-wall dynamics in ferroelectric materials are strongly
position-dependent since each polar interface is locked into a unique local
microstructure. This necessitates spatially resolved studies of the
wall-pinning using scanning-probe microscopy techniques. The pinning centers
and preexisting domain walls are usually sparse within image plane, precluding
the use of dense hyperspectral imaging modes and requiring time-consuming human
experimentation. Here, a large area epitaxial PbTiO$_3$ film on cubic KTaO$_3$
were investigated to quantify the electric field driven dynamics of the
polar-strain domain structures using ML-controlled automated Piezoresponse
Force Microscopy. Analysis of 1500 switching events reveals that domain wall
displacement depends not only on field parameters but also on the local
ferroelectric-ferroelastic configuration. For example, twin boundaries in
polydomains regions like a$_1^-$/$c^+$ $\parallel$ a$_2^-$/$c^-$ stay pinned up
to a certain level of bias magnitude and change only marginally as the bias
increases from 20V to 30V, whereas single variant boundaries like a$_2^+$/$c^+$
$\parallel$ a$_2^-$/$c^-$ stack are already activated at 20V. These statistics
on the possible ferroelectric and ferroelastic wall orientations, together with
the automated, high-throughput AFM workflow, can be distilled into a predictive
map that links domain configurations to pulse parameters. This
microstructure-specific rule set forms the foundation for designing
ferroelectric memories.

Abstract: Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) is a minimally invasive procedure
that improves coronary blood flow and treats coronary artery disease. Although
PCI typically requires 2D X-ray angiography (XRA) to guide catheter placement
at real-time, computed tomography angiography (CTA) may substantially improve
PCI by providing precise information of 3D vascular anatomy and status. To
leverage real-time XRA and detailed 3D CTA anatomy for PCI, accurate multimodal
image registration of XRA and CTA is required, to guide the procedure and avoid
complications. This is a challenging process as it requires registration of
images from different geometrical modalities (2D -> 3D and vice versa), with
variations in contrast and noise levels. In this paper, we propose a novel
multimodal coronary artery image registration method based on a swarm
optimization algorithm, which effectively addresses challenges such as large
deformations, low contrast, and noise across these imaging modalities. Our
algorithm consists of two main modules: 1) preprocessing of XRA and CTA images
separately, and 2) a registration module based on feature extraction using the
Steger and Superpixel Particle Swarm Optimization algorithms. Our technique was
evaluated on a pilot dataset of 28 pairs of XRA and CTA images from 10 patients
who underwent PCI. The algorithm was compared with four state-of-the-art (SOTA)
methods in terms of registration accuracy, robustness, and efficiency. Our
method outperformed the selected SOTA baselines in all aspects. Experimental

Motivation: 胎盘分割在T2*加权成像中面临边界对比弱、缺乏标注数据和运动伪影的挑战，需要一种鲁棒的分割方法。

Method: 结合掩码自编码（MAE）进行自监督预训练、掩码伪标签（MPL）进行无监督域适应，以及全局-局部协作对齐特征。

Result: 在临床数据集上，该方法在多回波间泛化良好，优于单回波和简单融合基线。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统利用多回波T2*加权MRI进行胎盘分割的工作。

Abstract: Accurate placental segmentation is essential for quantitative analysis of the
placenta. However, this task is particularly challenging in T2*-weighted
placental imaging due to: (1) weak and inconsistent boundary contrast across
individual echoes; (2) the absence of manual ground truth annotations for all
echo times; and (3) motion artifacts across echoes caused by fetal and maternal
movement. In this work, we propose a contrast-augmented segmentation framework
that leverages complementary information across multi-echo T2*-weighted MRI to
learn robust, contrast-invariant representations. Our method integrates: (i)
masked autoencoding (MAE) for self-supervised pretraining on unlabeled
multi-echo slices; (ii) masked pseudo-labeling (MPL) for unsupervised domain
adaptation across echo times; and (iii) global-local collaboration to align
fine-grained features with global anatomical context. We further introduce a
semantic matching loss to encourage representation consistency across echoes of
the same subject. Experiments on a clinical multi-echo placental MRI dataset
demonstrate that our approach generalizes effectively across echo times and
outperforms both single-echo and naive fusion baselines. To our knowledge, this
is the first work to systematically exploit multi-echo T2*-weighted MRI for
placental segmentation.

Motivation: Sentinel-2卫星图像分辨率较低，无法捕捉小尺度特征（如房屋、街道），需超分辨率技术提升其分辨率。

Method: 结合Sentinel-2的时间过采样和高分辨率Pléiades Neo数据的学习先验，设计混合架构SEN4X。

Result: 在越南河内的城市土地覆盖分类任务中，SEN4X显著优于现有超分辨率基线。

Conclusion: SEN4X有效提升卫星图像分辨率，适用于小尺度特征分析。

Abstract: Super-resolution aims to increase the resolution of satellite images by
reconstructing high-frequency details, which go beyond na\"ive upsampling. This
has particular relevance for Earth observation missions like Sentinel-2, which
offer frequent, regular coverage at no cost; but at coarse resolution. Its
pixel footprint is too large to capture small features like houses, streets, or
hedge rows. To address this, we present SEN4X, a hybrid super-resolution
architecture that combines the advantages of single-image and multi-image
techniques. It combines temporal oversampling from repeated Sentinel-2
acquisitions with a learned prior from high-resolution Pl\'eiades Neo data. In
doing so, SEN4X upgrades Sentinel-2 imagery to 2.5 m ground sampling distance.
We test the super-resolved images on urban land-cover classification in Hanoi,
Vietnam. We find that they lead to a significant performance improvement over
state-of-the-art super-resolution baselines.

cameras, and ultrasound imagery. Its detailed scene graph annotations, covering
36 entities and 22 relations (568,235 triplets), enable robust modeling of
clinical interactions, supporting tasks like action recognition and
human-centric perception. We evaluate the surgical scene graph generation

Abstract: This paper presents a deep learning-based framework for classifying forestry

crane-out, cutting-and-to-processing, driving, and processing - the approach
employs a 3D ResNet-50 architecture implemented with PyTorchVideo. Trained on a

results underscore the effectiveness of spatiotemporal convolutional networks
for capturing both motion patterns and appearance in real-world forestry

  The system integrates standard preprocessing and augmentation techniques to
improve generalization, but overfitting is evident, highlighting the need for
more training data and better class balance. Despite these challenges, the
method demonstrates clear potential for reducing the manual workload associated
with traditional time studies, offering a scalable solution for operational

Abstract: Quantitative comparison of the quality of photoacoustic image reconstruction
algorithms remains a major challenge. No-reference image quality measures are
often inadequate, but full-reference measures require access to an ideal
reference image. While the ground truth is known in simulations, it is unknown
in vivo, or in phantom studies, as the reference depends on both the phantom
properties and the imaging system. We tackle this problem by using numerical
digital twins of tissue-mimicking phantoms and the imaging system to perform a
quantitative calibration to reduce the simulation gap. The contributions of
this paper are two-fold: First, we use this digital-twin framework to compare
multiple state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms. Second, among these is a
Fourier transform-based reconstruction algorithm for circular detection
geometries, which we test on experimental data for the first time. Our results
demonstrate the usefulness of digital phantom twins by enabling assessment of
the accuracy of the numerical forward model and enabling comparison of image
reconstruction schemes with full-reference image quality assessment. We show
that the Fourier transform-based algorithm yields results comparable to those
of iterative time reversal, but at a lower computational cost. All data and

TL;DR: 论文研究了监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL）在提升大语言模型（LLMs）推理能力中的作用，特别是回溯策略的贡献。通过系统实验，发现长链思维（CoT）和回溯对RL训练有积极影响，且RL更关注结构而非内容正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索SFT和RL在LLMs推理能力提升中的具体作用，尤其是回溯策略的贡献和优化使用。

Method: 在八个推理任务上系统比较SFT和RL的效果，并通过合成数据集控制回溯步骤和内容正确性进行实验。

Result: 长CoT和回溯能显著提升RL训练效果，且RL更注重结构模式而非内容正确性。

Conclusion: 研究结果为设计优化LLMs推理训练策略提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have effectively
improved their reasoning abilities, particularly on mathematical and logical
problems that have verifiable answers, through techniques such as supervised
finetuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). Prior research indicates that
RL effectively internalizes search strategies, enabling long chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning, with backtracking emerging naturally as a learned capability.
However, the precise benefits of backtracking, specifically, how significantly
it contributes to reasoning improvements and the optimal extent of its use,
remain poorly understood. In this work, we systematically investigate the
dynamics between SFT and RL on eight reasoning tasks: Countdown, Sudoku, Arc
1D, Geometry, Color Cube Rotation, List Functions, Zebra Puzzles, and Self
Reference. Our findings highlight that short CoT sequences used in SFT as a
warm-up do have moderate contribution to RL training, compared with cold-start
RL; however such contribution diminishes when tasks become increasingly
difficult. Motivated by this observation, we construct synthetic datasets
varying systematically in the number of backtracking steps and conduct
controlled experiments to isolate the influence of either the correctness
(content) or the structure (i.e., backtrack frequency). We find that (1) longer
CoT with backtracks generally induce better and more stable RL training, (2)
more challenging problems with larger search space tend to need higher numbers
of backtracks during the SFT stage. Additionally, we demonstrate through
experiments on distilled data that RL training is largely unaffected by the
correctness of long CoT sequences, suggesting that RL prioritizes structural
patterns over content correctness. Collectively, our results offer practical
insights into designing optimal training strategies to effectively scale
reasoning in LLMs.

Result: 实验表明MiCRo能有效捕捉多样化偏好并显著提升个性化效果。

Conclusion: MiCRo为RLHF中的奖励建模提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，支持多样化偏好对齐。

Abstract: Reward modeling is a key step in building safe foundation models when
applying reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to align Large
Language Models (LLMs). However, reward modeling based on the Bradley-Terry
(BT) model assumes a global reward function, failing to capture the inherently
diverse and heterogeneous human preferences. Hence, such oversimplification
limits LLMs from supporting personalization and pluralistic alignment.
Theoretically, we show that when human preferences follow a mixture
distribution of diverse subgroups, a single BT model has an irreducible error.
While existing solutions, such as multi-objective learning with fine-grained
annotations, help address this issue, they are costly and constrained by
predefined attributes, failing to fully capture the richness of human values.
In this work, we introduce MiCRo, a two-stage framework that enhances
personalized preference learning by leveraging large-scale binary preference
datasets without requiring explicit fine-grained annotations. In the first
stage, MiCRo introduces context-aware mixture modeling approach to capture
diverse human preferences. In the second stage, MiCRo integrates an online
routing strategy that dynamically adapts mixture weights based on specific
context to resolve ambiguity, allowing for efficient and scalable preference
adaptation with minimal additional supervision. Experiments on multiple
preference datasets demonstrate that MiCRo effectively captures diverse human
preferences and significantly improves downstream personalization.

these (Bhaskar Rao Designs, Symmetric Weighing Matrices, Balanced Ternary

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems show promise for
automating real-world tasks but struggle to transfer across domains due to
their domain-specific nature. Current approaches face two critical
shortcomings: they require complete architectural redesign and full retraining
of all components when applied to new domains. We introduce Workforce, a
hierarchical multi-agent framework that decouples strategic planning from
specialized execution through a modular architecture comprising: (i) a
domain-agnostic Planner for task decomposition, (ii) a Coordinator for subtask
management, and (iii) specialized Workers with domain-specific tool-calling
capabilities. This decoupling enables cross-domain transferability during both
inference and training phases: During inference, Workforce seamlessly adapts to
new domains by adding or modifying worker agents; For training, we introduce
Optimized Workforce Learning (OWL), which improves generalization across
domains by optimizing a domain-agnostic planner with reinforcement learning
from real-world feedback. To validate our approach, we evaluate Workforce on
the GAIA benchmark, covering various realistic, multi-domain agentic tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate Workforce achieves open-source
state-of-the-art performance (69.70%), outperforming commercial systems like
OpenAI's Deep Research by 2.34%. More notably, our OWL-trained 32B model
achieves 52.73% accuracy (+16.37%) and demonstrates performance comparable to
GPT-4o on challenging tasks. To summarize, by enabling scalable generalization

Abstract: Recent studies show that LLMs possess different skills and specialize in
different tasks. In fact, we observe that their varied performance occur in
several levels of granularity. For example, in the code optimization task, code
LLMs excel at different optimization categories and no one dominates others.
This observation prompts the question of how one leverages multiple LLM agents
to solve a coding problem without knowing their complementary strengths a
priori. We argue that a team of agents can learn from each other's successes
and failures so as to improve their own performance. Thus, a lesson is the
knowledge produced by an agent and passed on to other agents in the collective
solution process. We propose a lesson-based collaboration framework, design the
lesson solicitation--banking--selection mechanism, and demonstrate that a team
of small LLMs with lessons learned can outperform a much larger LLM and other
multi-LLM collaboration methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various
tasks but face deployment challenges due to their massive computational
demands. While post-training pruning methods like SparseGPT and Wanda can
effectively reduce the model size, but struggle to maintain model performance
at high sparsity levels, limiting their utility for downstream tasks. Existing
fine-tuning methods, such as full fine-tuning and LoRA, fail to preserve
sparsity as they require updating the whole dense metrics, not well-suited for
sparse LLMs. In this paper, we propose Sparsity Evolution Fine-Tuning (SEFT), a
novel method designed specifically for sparse LLMs. SEFT dynamically evolves
the sparse topology of pruned models during fine-tuning, while preserving the
overall sparsity throughout the process. The strengths of SEFT lie in its
ability to perform task-specific adaptation through a weight drop-and-grow
strategy, enabling the pruned model to self-adapt its sparse connectivity
pattern based on the target dataset. Furthermore, a sensitivity-driven pruning
criterion is employed to ensure that the desired sparsity level is consistently
maintained throughout fine-tuning. Our experiments on various LLMs, including
LLaMA families, DeepSeek, and Mistral, across a diverse set of benchmarks
demonstrate that SEFT achieves stronger performance while offering superior
memory and time efficiency compared to existing baselines. Our code is publicly

Motivation: Current CoT methods rely on intermediate steps, limiting scalability and generalization. Recursive reasoning lacks a principled framework and often requires costly pretraining.

Method: Flow CoT models recursive inference as progressive cognitive states. SCOUT uses progressive distillation and a cross-attention retrospective module for fine-tuning.

Result: SCOUT improves accuracy (up to 1.8%) and explanation quality across eight benchmarks, enabling deeper reasoning.

Conclusion: Flow CoT and SCOUT provide a scalable framework for enhancing LLM reasoning without pretraining.

Abstract: Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting improves the reasoning performance of large
language models (LLMs) by encouraging step by step thinking. However, CoT-based
methods depend on intermediate reasoning steps, which limits scalability and
generalization. Recent work explores recursive reasoning, where LLMs reuse
internal layers across iterations to refine latent representations without
explicit CoT supervision. While promising, these approaches often require
costly pretraining and lack a principled framework for how reasoning should
evolve across iterations. We address this gap by introducing Flow Chain of
Thought (Flow CoT), a reasoning paradigm that models recursive inference as a
progressive trajectory of latent cognitive states. Flow CoT frames each
iteration as a distinct cognitive stage deepening reasoning across iterations
without relying on manual supervision. To realize this, we propose SCOUT
(Stepwise Cognitive Optimization Using Teachers), a lightweight fine tuning
framework that enables Flow CoT style reasoning without the need for
pretraining. SCOUT uses progressive distillation to align each iteration with a
teacher of appropriate capacity, and a cross attention based retrospective
module that integrates outputs from previous iterations while preserving the
models original computation flow. Experiments across eight reasoning benchmarks
show that SCOUT consistently improves both accuracy and explanation quality,
achieving up to 1.8% gains under fine tuning. Qualitative analyses further
reveal that SCOUT enables progressively deeper reasoning across iterations
refining both belief formation and explanation granularity. These results not
only validate the effectiveness of SCOUT, but also demonstrate the practical
viability of Flow CoT as a scalable framework for enhancing reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: The rise of large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems (MAS)
introduces new security and reliability challenges. While these systems show
great promise in decomposing and coordinating complex tasks, they also face
multi-faceted risks across prompt manipulation, unsafe tool usage, and emergent
agent miscoordination. Existing guardrail mechanisms offer only partial
protection, primarily at the input-output level, and fall short in addressing
systemic or multi-point failures in MAS. In this work, we present a
system-level anomaly detection framework tailored for MAS, integrating
structural modeling with runtime behavioral oversight. Our approach consists of
two components. First, we propose a graph-based framework that models agent
interactions as dynamic execution graphs, enabling semantic anomaly detection
at node, edge, and path levels. Second, we introduce a pluggable SentinelAgent,
an LLM-powered oversight agent that observes, analyzes, and intervenes in MAS
execution based on security policies and contextual reasoning. By bridging
abstract detection logic with actionable enforcement, our method detects not
only single-point faults and prompt injections but also multi-agent collusion
and latent exploit paths. We validate our framework through two case studies,
including an email assistant and Microsoft's Magentic-One system, demonstrating
its ability to detect covert risks and provide explainable root-cause

Abstract: Understanding how data moves, transforms, and persists, known as data flow,

data-flow analyses from software engineering: reaching definitions, very busy
expressions, available expressions, live variable analysis, interval analysis,
type-state analysis, taint analysis, and concurrency analysis. These analyses
are instantiated across three real-world domains: cooking recipes, travel
routes, and automated plans. The benchmark includes 2,400 question-answer
pairs, with 100 examples for each domain-analysis combination. We evaluate
three types of LLMs: a reasoning-focused model (DeepSeek-R1 8B), a
general-purpose model (LLaMA 3.1 8B), and a code-specific model (Granite Code
8B). Each model is tested using majority voting over five sampled completions
per prompt. Results show that the reasoning model achieves higher accuracy, but
at the cost of over 20 times slower inference compared to the other models. In
contrast, the general-purpose and code-specific models perform close to random
chance. FABLE provides the first diagnostic benchmark to systematically
evaluate data-flow reasoning and offers insights for developing models with
stronger procedural understanding.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their
potential in planning and reasoning tasks, offering a flexible alternative to
classical pathfinding algorithms. However, most existing studies focus on LLMs'
independent reasoning capabilities and overlook the potential synergy between
LLMs and traditional algorithms. To fill this gap, we propose a comprehensive
evaluation benchmark GridRoute to assess how LLMs can take advantage of
traditional algorithms. We also propose a novel hybrid prompting technique
called Algorithm of Thought (AoT), which introduces traditional algorithms'
guidance into prompting. Our benchmark evaluates six LLMs ranging from 7B to
72B parameters across various map sizes, assessing their performance in
correctness, optimality, and efficiency in grid environments with varying
sizes. Our results show that AoT significantly boosts performance across all
model sizes, particularly in larger or more complex environments, suggesting a
promising approach to addressing path planning challenges. Our code is

Abstract: Although multi-agent systems based on large language models show strong
capabilities on multiple tasks, they are still limited by high computational
overhead, information loss, and robustness. Inspired by ResNet's residual
learning, we propose Residual Mixture-of-Agents (RMoA), integrating residual
connections to optimize efficiency and reliability. To maximize information
utilization from model responses while minimizing computational costs, we
innovatively design an embedding-based diversity selection mechanism that
greedily selects responses via vector similarity. Furthermore, to mitigate
iterative information degradation, we introduce a Residual Extraction Agent to
preserve cross-layer incremental information by capturing inter-layer response
differences, coupled with a Residual Aggregation Agent for hierarchical
information integration. Additionally, we propose an adaptive termination
mechanism that dynamically halts processing based on residual convergence,
further improving inference efficiency. RMoA achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the benchmarks of across alignment, mathematical reasoning, code
generation, and multitasking understanding, while significantly reducing
computational overhead. Code is available at

Result: SC在4-shot、8-shot和16-shot设置下，在九个数据集上对Mistral-7B、LLaMA-2-7B和Qwen2-7B模型实现了最先进的校准性能。

Conclusion: SC为ICL中的校准问题提供了统一框架，显著提升了模型性能，并能够灵活调整决策边界。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to adapt to new
tasks with just a few examples, but their predictions often suffer from
systematic biases, leading to unstable performances in classification. While
calibration techniques are proposed to mitigate these biases, we show that, in
the logit space, many of these methods are equivalent to merely shifting the
LLM's decision boundary without having the ability to alter its orientation.
This proves inadequate when biases cause the LLM to be severely misdirected. To
address these limitations and provide a unifying framework, we propose
Supervised Calibration (SC), a loss-minimization based framework which learns
an optimal, per-class affine transformation of the LLM's predictive
probabilities in the logit space without requiring external data beyond the
context. By using a more expressive functional class, SC not only subsumes many
existing calibration methods in ICL as special cases, but also enables the
ability to alter and even completely reverse the orientation of the LLM's
decision boundary. Furthermore, SC's loss-based nature facilitates the seamless
integration of two purpose-built regularization techniques: context-invariance
and directional trust-region. The former is designed to tackle the instability
issue in ICL, while the latter controls the degree of calibration. Finally, SC
delivers state-of-the-art performance over calibration baselines in the 4-shot,
8-shot, and 16-shot settings across all nine datasets for
Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, LLaMA-2-7B-chat, and Qwen2-7B-Instruct.

Motivation: 随着前沿大语言模型（LLM）规模的增加，后训练量化成为内存高效部署的标准。然而，现有攻击无法应用于复杂量化方法（如GGUF），论文填补了这一空白。

Method: 通过量化误差（全精度权重与量化版本的差异）构建恶意量化模型，攻击者在训练目标恶意LLM时约束其权重。

Result: 攻击在三种流行LLM和九种GGUF量化数据类型上成功，展示了在不安全代码生成（Δ=88.7%）、目标内容注入（Δ=85.0%）和良性指令拒绝（Δ=30.1%）中的有效性。

Conclusion: GGUF量化方法易受对抗干扰，仅依赖量化方案的复杂性不足以防御攻击。

Abstract: With the increasing size of frontier LLMs, post-training quantization has
become the standard for memory-efficient deployment. Recent work has shown that
basic rounding-based quantization schemes pose security risks, as they can be
exploited to inject malicious behaviors into quantized models that remain
hidden in full precision. However, existing attacks cannot be applied to more
complex quantization methods, such as the GGUF family used in the popular
ollama and llama.cpp frameworks. In this work, we address this gap by
introducing the first attack on GGUF. Our key insight is that the quantization
error -- the difference between the full-precision weights and their
(de-)quantized version -- provides sufficient flexibility to construct
malicious quantized models that appear benign in full precision. Leveraging
this, we develop an attack that trains the target malicious LLM while
constraining its weights based on quantization errors. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our attack on three popular LLMs across nine GGUF quantization
data types on three diverse attack scenarios: insecure code generation
($\Delta$=$88.7\%$), targeted content injection ($\Delta$=$85.0\%$), and benign
instruction refusal ($\Delta$=$30.1\%$). Our attack highlights that (1) the
most widely used post-training quantization method is susceptible to
adversarial interferences, and (2) the complexity of quantization schemes alone
is insufficient as a defense.

Abstract: Despite their remarkable achievements and widespread adoption, Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) have revealed significant security
vulnerabilities, highlighting the urgent need for robust safety evaluation
benchmarks. Existing MLLM safety benchmarks, however, fall short in terms of
data quality and coverge, and modal risk combinations, resulting in inflated
and contradictory evaluation results, which hinders the discovery and
governance of security concerns. Besides, we argue that vulnerabilities to
harmful queries and oversensitivity to harmless ones should be considered
simultaneously in MLLMs safety evaluation, whereas these were previously
considered separately. In this paper, to address these shortcomings, we
introduce Unified Safety Benchmarks (USB), which is one of the most
comprehensive evaluation benchmarks in MLLM safety. Our benchmark features
high-quality queries, extensive risk categories, comprehensive modal
combinations, and encompasses both vulnerability and oversensitivity
evaluations. From the perspective of two key dimensions: risk categories and
modality combinations, we demonstrate that the available benchmarks -- even the
union of the vast majority of them -- are far from being truly comprehensive.
To bridge this gap, we design a sophisticated data synthesis pipeline that
generates extensive, high-quality complementary data addressing previously
unexplored aspects. By combining open-source datasets with our synthetic data,
our benchmark provides 4 distinct modality combinations for each of the 61 risk
sub-categories, covering both English and Chinese across both vulnerability and
oversensitivity dimensions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving into autonomous agents that
cooperate across organizational boundaries, enabling joint disaster response,
supply-chain optimization, and other tasks that demand decentralized expertise
without surrendering data ownership. Yet, cross-domain collaboration shatters
the unified trust assumptions behind current alignment and containment
techniques. An agent benign in isolation may, when receiving messages from an
untrusted peer, leak secrets or violate policy, producing risks driven by
emergent multi-agent dynamics rather than classical software bugs. This
position paper maps the security agenda for cross-domain multi-agent LLM
systems. We introduce seven categories of novel security challenges, for each

Abstract: Automatic code generation has gained significant momentum with the advent of
Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4. Although many studies focus on
improving the effectiveness of LLMs for code generation, very limited work
tries to understand the generated code's characteristics and leverage that to
improve failed cases. In this paper, as the most straightforward characteristic
of code, we investigate the relationship between code complexity and the
success of LLM generated code. Using a large set of standard complexity
metrics, we first conduct an empirical analysis to explore their correlation
with LLM's performance on code generation (i.e., Pass@1). Using logistic
regression models, we identify which complexity metrics are most predictive of
code correctness. Building on these findings, we propose an iterative feedback
method, where LLMs are prompted to generate correct code based on complexity
metrics from previous failed outputs. We validate our approach across multiple
benchmarks (i.e., HumanEval, MBPP, LeetCode, and BigCodeBench) and various LLMs
(i.e., GPT-4o, GPT-3.5 Turbo, Llama 3.1, and GPT-o3 mini), comparing the
results with two baseline methods: (a) zero-shot generation, and (b) iterative
execution-based feedback without our code complexity insights. Experiment
results show that our approach makes notable improvements, particularly with a
smaller LLM (GPT3.5 Turbo), where, e.g., Pass@1 increased by 35.71% compared to
the baseline's improvement of 12.5% on the HumanEval dataset. The study expands
experiments to BigCodeBench and integrates the method with the Reflexion code
generation agent, leading to Pass@1 improvements of 20% (GPT-4o) and 23.07%
(GPT-o3 mini). The results highlight that complexity-aware feedback enhances
both direct LLM prompting and agent-based workflows.

Conclusion: 论文揭示了不确定性机制的潜在威胁，并提供了可验证的解决方案。

Abstract: Cautious predictions -- where a machine learning model abstains when
uncertain -- are crucial for limiting harmful errors in safety-critical
applications. In this work, we identify a novel threat: a dishonest institution
can exploit these mechanisms to discriminate or unjustly deny services under
the guise of uncertainty. We demonstrate the practicality of this threat by
introducing an uncertainty-inducing attack called Mirage, which deliberately
reduces confidence in targeted input regions, thereby covertly disadvantaging
specific individuals. At the same time, Mirage maintains high predictive
performance across all data points. To counter this threat, we propose
Confidential Guardian, a framework that analyzes calibration metrics on a
reference dataset to detect artificially suppressed confidence. Additionally,
it employs zero-knowledge proofs of verified inference to ensure that reported
confidence scores genuinely originate from the deployed model. This prevents
the provider from fabricating arbitrary model confidence values while
protecting the model's proprietary details. Our results confirm that
Confidential Guardian effectively prevents the misuse of cautious predictions,
providing verifiable assurances that abstention reflects genuine model
uncertainty rather than malicious intent.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents show considerable promise for automating
complex tasks using contextual reasoning; however, interactions involving
multiple agents and the system's susceptibility to prompt injection and other
forms of context manipulation introduce new vulnerabilities related to privacy
leakage and system exploitation. This position paper argues that the
well-established design principles in information security, which are commonly
referred to as security principles, should be employed when deploying LLM
agents at scale. Design principles such as defense-in-depth, least privilege,
complete mediation, and psychological acceptability have helped guide the
design of mechanisms for securing information systems over the last five
decades, and we argue that their explicit and conscientious adoption will help
secure agentic systems. To illustrate this approach, we introduce AgentSandbox,
a conceptual framework embedding these security principles to provide
safeguards throughout an agent's life-cycle. We evaluate with state-of-the-art
LLMs along three dimensions: benign utility, attack utility, and attack success
rate. AgentSandbox maintains high utility for its intended functions under both
benign and adversarial evaluations while substantially mitigating privacy
risks. By embedding secure design principles as foundational elements within
emerging LLM agent protocols, we aim to promote trustworthy agent ecosystems
aligned with user privacy expectations and evolving regulatory requirements.

MSQA, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark of 1,757 graduate-level materials
science questions in two formats: detailed explanatory responses and binary

precise factual knowledge and multi-step reasoning across seven materials
science sub-fields, such as structure-property relationships, synthesis
processes, and computational modeling. Through experiments with 10

While API-based proprietary LLMs achieve up to 84.5% accuracy, open-source

significantly due to overfitting and distributional shifts. MSQA represents the
first benchmark to jointly evaluate the factual and reasoning capabilities of

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made remarkable strides in
multimodal tasks such as visual question answering, visual grounding, and
complex reasoning. However, they remain limited by static training data,
susceptibility to hallucinations, and inability to verify claims against
up-to-date, external evidence, compromising their performance in dynamic
real-world applications. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a
practical solution to mitigate these challenges by allowing the LVLMs to access
large-scale knowledge databases via retrieval mechanisms, thereby grounding
model outputs in factual, contextually relevant information. Here in this
paper, we conduct the first systematic dissection of the multimodal RAG
pipeline for LVLMs, explicitly investigating (1) the retrieval phase: on the
modality configurations and retrieval strategies, (2) the re-ranking stage: on
strategies to mitigate positional biases and improve the relevance of retrieved
evidence, and (3) the generation phase: we further investigate how to best
integrate retrieved candidates into the final generation process. Finally, we
extend to explore a unified agentic framework that integrates re-ranking and
generation through self-reflection, enabling LVLMs to select relevant evidence
and suppress irrelevant context dynamically. Our full-stack exploration of RAG
for LVLMs yields substantial insights, resulting in an average performance
boost of 5% without any fine-tuning.

Abstract: Ensuring Vision-Language Models (VLMs) generate safe outputs is crucial for
their reliable deployment. However, LVLMs suffer from drastic safety
degradation compared to their LLM backbone. Even blank or irrelevant images can
trigger LVLMs to generate harmful responses to prompts that would otherwise be
refused in text-only contexts. The modality gap between image and text
representations has been recently hypothesized to contribute to safety
degradation of LVLMs. However, if and how the amount of modality gap affects
LVLMs' safety is not studied. In this work, we show that the amount of modality
gap is highly inversely correlated with VLMs' safety. Then, we show that this
modality gap is introduced during pretraining LVLMs and persists through
fine-tuning. Inspired by this observation, we propose a regularization to
reduce the modality gap during pretraining. Our extensive experiments on LLaVA
v1.5, ShareGPT4V, and MiniGPT-4 show that our method substantially improves
safety alignment of LVLMs, reducing unsafe rate by up to 16.3% without
compromising performance, and can further boost existing defenses by up to
18.2%.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对人类-AI对话中引用文本的生成方法QuAda，通过动态调整注意力机制，实现了对引用文本的高效利用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型缺乏显式机制来定位和利用对话中的引用文本，限制了其在引用感知对话中的表现。

Method: 提出span-conditioned生成框架，构建引用中心的数据管道，并设计轻量级训练方法QuAda，动态调整注意力机制。

Result: QuAda在五种代表性场景中表现良好，且能泛化到未见主题，参数更新少于2.8%。

Conclusion: QuAda为引用感知对话提供了一种高效、即插即用的解决方案。

Abstract: Human-AI conversation frequently relies on quoting earlier text-"check it
with the formula I just highlighted"-yet today's large language models (LLMs)
lack an explicit mechanism for locating and exploiting such spans. We formalise
the challenge as span-conditioned generation, decomposing each turn into the
dialogue history, a set of token-offset quotation spans, and an intent
utterance. Building on this abstraction, we introduce a quotation-centric data
pipeline that automatically synthesises task-specific dialogues, verifies
answer correctness through multi-stage consistency checks, and yields both a
heterogeneous training corpus and the first benchmark covering five
representative scenarios. To meet the benchmark's zero-overhead and
parameter-efficiency requirements, we propose QuAda, a lightweight
training-based method that attaches two bottleneck projections to every
attention head, dynamically amplifying or suppressing attention to quoted spans
at inference time while leaving the prompt unchanged and updating < 2.8% of
backbone weights. Experiments across models show that QuAda is suitable for all
scenarios and generalises to unseen topics, offering an effective,
plug-and-play solution for quotation-aware dialogue.

Result: 实验表明，针对性调优能带来显著性能提升，但效果因数据集和指标而异，凸显了调优的价值和标准评估的局限性。

Conclusion: 未来进展不仅依赖于架构改进，还需更清晰的优化和评估框架。

Abstract: Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with Knowledge Graphs (KGs) results
in complex systems with numerous hyperparameters that directly affect
performance. While such systems are increasingly common in retrieval-augmented
generation, the role of systematic hyperparameter optimization remains
underexplored. In this paper, we study this problem in the context of Cognee, a
modular framework for end-to-end KG construction and retrieval. Using three
multi-hop QA benchmarks (HotPotQA, TwoWikiMultiHop, and MuSiQue) we optimize
parameters related to chunking, graph construction, retrieval, and prompting.
Each configuration is scored using established metrics (exact match, F1, and
DeepEval's LLM-based correctness metric). Our results demonstrate that
meaningful gains can be achieved through targeted tuning. While the gains are
consistent, they are not uniform, with performance varying across datasets and
metrics. This variability highlights both the value of tuning and the
limitations of standard evaluation measures. While demonstrating the immediate
potential of hyperparameter tuning, we argue that future progress will depend
not only on architectural advances but also on clearer frameworks for
optimization and evaluation in complex, modular systems.

Conclusion: AXIOM成功结合了贝叶斯方法和DRL的优势，为低数据环境下的学习提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Current deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches achieve state-of-the-art
performance in various domains, but struggle with data efficiency compared to
human learning, which leverages core priors about objects and their
interactions. Active inference offers a principled framework for integrating
sensory information with prior knowledge to learn a world model and quantify
the uncertainty of its own beliefs and predictions. However, active inference
models are usually crafted for a single task with bespoke knowledge, so they
lack the domain flexibility typical of DRL approaches. To bridge this gap, we
propose a novel architecture that integrates a minimal yet expressive set of
core priors about object-centric dynamics and interactions to accelerate
learning in low-data regimes. The resulting approach, which we call AXIOM,
combines the usual data efficiency and interpretability of Bayesian approaches
with the across-task generalization usually associated with DRL. AXIOM
represents scenes as compositions of objects, whose dynamics are modeled as
piecewise linear trajectories that capture sparse object-object interactions.
The structure of the generative model is expanded online by growing and
learning mixture models from single events and periodically refined through
Bayesian model reduction to induce generalization. AXIOM masters various games
within only 10,000 interaction steps, with both a small number of parameters
compared to DRL, and without the computational expense of gradient-based
optimization.

Conclusion: LPASS方法在压缩和性能优化方面优于现有技术，同时节省计算资源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being extensively used for cybersecurity
purposes. One of them is the detection of vulnerable codes. For the sake of
efficiency and effectiveness, compression and fine-tuning techniques are being
developed, respectively. However, they involve spending substantial
computational efforts. In this vein, we analyse how Linear Probes (LPs) can be
used to provide an estimation on the performance of a compressed LLM at an
early phase -- before fine-tuning. We also show their suitability to set the
cut-off point when applying layer pruning compression. Our approach, dubbed
$LPASS$, is applied in BERT and Gemma for the detection of 12 of MITRE's Top 25
most dangerous vulnerabilities on 480k C/C++ samples. LPs can be computed in
142.97 s. and provide key findings: (1) 33.3 \% and 72.2\% of layers can be
removed, respectively, with no precision loss; (2) they provide an early
estimate of the post-fine-tuning and post-compression model effectiveness, with
3\% and 8.68\% as the lowest and average precision errors, respectively.
$LPASS$-based LLMs outperform the state of the art, reaching 86.9\% of accuracy
in multi-class vulnerability detection. Interestingly, $LPASS$-based compressed
versions of Gemma outperform the original ones by 1.6\% of F1-score at a
maximum while saving 29.4 \% and 23.8\% of training and inference time and
42.98\% of model size.

Result: 论文提出了针对LLMs在模式匹配中三大核心问题的解决方案，提升了自动化数据集成的可行性。

Conclusion: LLMs在模式匹配中有潜力，但需进一步优化以解决输出稳定性、表达性和计算效率问题。

Abstract: The growing need to integrate information from a large number of diverse
sources poses significant scalability challenges for data integration systems.
These systems often rely on manually written schema mappings, which are
complex, source-specific, and costly to maintain as sources evolve. While
recent advances suggest that large language models (LLMs) can assist in
automating schema matching by leveraging both structural and natural language
cues, key challenges remain. In this paper, we identify three core issues with
using LLMs for schema mapping: (1) inconsistent outputs due to sensitivity to
input phrasing and structure, which we propose methods to address through
sampling and aggregation techniques; (2) the need for more expressive mappings
(e.g., GLaV), which strain the limited context windows of LLMs; and (3) the
computational cost of repeated LLM calls, which we propose to mitigate through
strategies like data type prefiltering.

Conclusion: 开源InterMT数据集有望推动MLLMs在复杂交互能力上的进一步研究。

Abstract: As multimodal large models (MLLMs) continue to advance across challenging
tasks, a key question emerges: What essential capabilities are still missing? A
critical aspect of human learning is continuous interaction with the
environment -- not limited to language, but also involving multimodal
understanding and generation. To move closer to human-level intelligence,
models must similarly support multi-turn, multimodal interaction. In
particular, they should comprehend interleaved multimodal contexts and respond
coherently in ongoing exchanges. In this work, we present an initial
exploration through the InterMT -- the first preference dataset for multi-turn
multimodal interaction, grounded in real human feedback. In this exploration,
we particularly emphasize the importance of human oversight, introducing expert
annotations to guide the process, motivated by the fact that current MLLMs lack
such complex interactive capabilities. InterMT captures human preferences at
both global and local levels into nine sub-dimensions, consists of 15.6k
prompts, 52.6k multi-turn dialogue instances, and 32.4k human-labeled
preference pairs. To compensate for the lack of capability for multi-modal
understanding and generation, we introduce an agentic workflow that leverages
tool-augmented MLLMs to construct multi-turn QA instances. To further this
goal, we introduce InterMT-Bench to assess the ability of MLLMs in assisting
judges with multi-turn, multimodal tasks. We demonstrate the utility of
\InterMT through applications such as judge moderation and further reveal the
multi-turn scaling law of judge model. We hope the open-source of our data can
help facilitate further research on aligning current MLLMs to the next step.

Conclusion: E^2GraphRAG在效率和效果上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Graph-based RAG methods like GraphRAG have shown promising global
understanding of the knowledge base by constructing hierarchical entity graphs.
However, they often suffer from inefficiency and rely on manually pre-defined
query modes, limiting practical use. In this paper, we propose E^2GraphRAG, a
streamlined graph-based RAG framework that improves both Efficiency and
Effectiveness. During the indexing stage, E^2GraphRAG constructs a summary tree
with large language models and an entity graph with SpaCy based on document
chunks. We then construct bidirectional indexes between entities and chunks to
capture their many-to-many relationships, enabling fast lookup during both
local and global retrieval. For the retrieval stage, we design an adaptive
retrieval strategy that leverages the graph structure to retrieve and select
between local and global modes. Experiments show that E^2GraphRAG achieves up
to 10 times faster indexing than GraphRAG and 100 times speedup over LightRAG
in retrieval while maintaining competitive QA performance.

Abstract: The rapid spread of misinformation, further amplified by recent advances in
generative AI, poses significant threats to society, impacting public opinion,
democratic stability, and national security. Understanding and proactively
assessing these threats requires exploring methodologies that enable structured
and scalable misinformation generation. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach that leverages knowledge graphs (KGs) as structured semantic resources
to systematically generate fake triplets. By analyzing the structural
properties of KGs, such as the distance between entities and their predicates,
we identify plausibly false relationships. These triplets are then used to
guide large language models (LLMs) in generating misinformation statements with
varying degrees of credibility. By utilizing structured semantic relationships,
our deterministic approach produces misinformation inherently challenging for
humans to detect, drawing exclusively upon publicly available KGs (e.g.,
WikiGraphs).
  Additionally, we investigate the effectiveness of LLMs in distinguishing
between genuine and artificially generated misinformation. Our analysis
highlights significant limitations in current LLM-based detection methods,
underscoring the necessity for enhanced detection strategies and a deeper
exploration of inherent biases in generative models.

Abstract: To effectively engage in human society, the ability to adapt, filter

critical. As robots and intelligent agents become more integrated into human
life, there is a growing opportunity-and need-to offload the cognitive burden
on humans to these systems, particularly in dynamic, information-rich

  To fill this critical need, we present Multi-RAG, a multimodal
retrieval-augmented generation system designed to provide adaptive assistance
to humans in information-intensive circumstances. Our system aims to improve
situational understanding and reduce cognitive load by integrating and
reasoning over multi-source information streams, including video, audio, and
text. As an enabling step toward long-term human-robot partnerships, Multi-RAG
explores how multimodal information understanding can serve as a foundation for
adaptive robotic assistance in dynamic, human-centered situations. To evaluate
its capability in a realistic human-assistance proxy task, we benchmarked
Multi-RAG on the MMBench-Video dataset, a challenging multimodal video
understanding benchmark. Our system achieves superior performance compared to
existing open-source video large language models (Video-LLMs) and large
vision-language models (LVLMs), while utilizing fewer resources and less input

Conclusion: GenIC通过结合LLM能力和知识图谱上下文，有效提升了实例补全性能。

Abstract: Knowledge graph completion aims to address the gaps of knowledge bases by
adding new triples that represent facts. The complexity of this task depends on
how many parts of a triple are already known. Instance completion involves
predicting the relation-tail pair when only the head is given (h, ?, ?).
Notably, modern knowledge bases often contain entity descriptions and types,
which can provide valuable context for inferring missing facts. By leveraging
these textual descriptions and the ability of large language models to extract
facts from them and recognize patterns within the knowledge graph schema, we
propose an LLM-powered, end-to-end instance completion approach. Specifically,
we introduce GenIC: a two-step Generative Instance Completion framework. The
first step focuses on property prediction, treated as a multi-label
classification task. The second step is link prediction, framed as a generative
sequence-to-sequence task. Experimental results on three datasets show that our
method outperforms existing baselines. Our code is available at

Abstract: Digital tool-based agents that invoke external Application Programming
Interfaces (APIs) often rely on documentation to understand API functionality.
However, such documentation is frequently missing, outdated, privatized, or
inconsistent-hindering the development of reliable, general-purpose agents. In
this work, we propose learning API functionality directly from demonstrations
as a new paradigm applicable in scenarios without documentation. Using existing
API benchmarks, we collect demonstrations from both expert API-based agents and
from self-exploration. To understand what information demonstrations must
convey for successful task completion, we extensively study how the number of
demonstrations and the use of LLM-generated summaries and evaluations affect
the task success rate of the API-based agent. Our experiments across 3 datasets
and 5 models show that learning functionality from demonstrations remains a
non-trivial challenge, even for state-of-the-art LLMs. We find that providing
explicit function calls and natural language critiques significantly improves
the agent's task success rate due to more accurate parameter filling. We
analyze failure modes, identify sources of error, and highlight key open
challenges for future work in documentation-free, self-improving, API-based
agents.

Abstract: Over the last thirty years, considerable progress has been made with the
development of systems that can drive cars, play games, predict protein folding
and generate natural language. These systems are described as intelligent and
there has been a great deal of talk about the rapid increase in artificial
intelligence and its potential dangers. However, our theoretical understanding
of intelligence and ability to measure it lag far behind our capacity for
building systems that mimic intelligent human behaviour. There is no commonly
agreed definition of the intelligence that AI systems are said to possess.
No-one has developed a practical measure that would enable us to compare the
intelligence of humans, animals and AIs on a single ratio scale.
  This paper sets out a new universal measure of intelligence that is based on
the hypothesis that prediction is the most important component of intelligence.
As an agent interacts with its normal environment, the accuracy of its
predictions is summed up and the complexity of its predictions and perceived
environment is accounted for using Kolmogorov complexity. Two experiments were
carried out to evaluate the practical feasibility of the algorithm. These
demonstrated that it could measure the intelligence of an agent embodied in a
virtual maze and an agent that makes predictions about time-series data. This
universal measure could be the starting point for a new comparative science of
intelligence that ranks humans, animals and AIs on a single ratio scale.

Method: 通过LLM生成YES/NO问题作为弱启发式，结合过滤、排序和阈值投票机制构建集成预测器。

Result: 在10%成功率的测试集上，模型精度达50%（随机选择的5倍），加入专家启发式后提升至54%。

Conclusion: 结合LLM推理与人类洞察的简单可解释集成方法，适用于高风险决策领域（如风投）。

Abstract: Predicting startup success requires models that are both accurate and
interpretable. We present a lightweight ensemble framework that combines YES/NO
questions generated by large language models (LLMs), forming a transparent
decision-making system. Each question acts as a weak heuristic, and by
filtering, ranking, and aggregating them through a threshold-based voting
mechanism, we construct a strong ensemble predictor. On a test set where 10% of
startups are classified as successful, our approach achieves a precision rate
of 50%, representing a 5x improvement over random selection, while remaining
fully transparent. When we incorporate expert-guided heuristics into the
generation process, performance improves further to 54% precision. These
results highlight the value of combining LLM reasoning with human insight and
demonstrate that simple, interpretable ensembles can support high-stakes
decisions in domains such as venture capital (VC).

Abstract: This paper focuses on Zero-Trust Foundation Models (ZTFMs), a novel paradigm
that embeds zero-trust security principles into the lifecycle of foundation
models (FMs) for Internet of Things (IoT) systems. By integrating core tenets,
such as continuous verification, least privilege access (LPA), data
confidentiality, and behavioral analytics into the design, training, and
deployment of FMs, ZTFMs can enable secure, privacy-preserving AI across
distributed, heterogeneous, and potentially adversarial IoT environments. We
present the first structured synthesis of ZTFMs, identifying their potential to
transform conventional trust-based IoT architectures into resilient,
self-defending ecosystems. Moreover, we propose a comprehensive technical
framework, incorporating federated learning (FL), blockchain-based identity
management, micro-segmentation, and trusted execution environments (TEEs) to
support decentralized, verifiable intelligence at the network edge. In
addition, we investigate emerging security threats unique to ZTFM-enabled
systems and evaluate countermeasures, such as anomaly detection, adversarial
training, and secure aggregation. Through this analysis, we highlight key open
research challenges in terms of scalability, secure orchestration,
interpretable threat attribution, and dynamic trust calibration. This survey
lays a foundational roadmap for secure, intelligent, and trustworthy IoT
infrastructures powered by FMs.

Conclusion: Gemini 2.5 Pro是教育领域的领先AI模型。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to transform education, but the
research community lacks a robust, general benchmark to evaluate AI models for
learning. To assess state-of-the-art support for educational use cases, we ran
an "arena for learning" where educators and pedagogy experts conduct blind,
head-to-head, multi-turn comparisons of leading AI models. In particular, $N =
189$ educators drew from their experience to role-play realistic learning use
cases, interacting with two models sequentially, after which $N = 206$ experts
judged which model better supported the user's learning goals. The arena
evaluated a slate of state-of-the-art models: Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude 3.7
Sonnet, GPT-4o, and OpenAI o3. Excluding ties, experts preferred Gemini 2.5 Pro
in 73.2% of these match-ups -- ranking it first overall in the arena. Gemini
2.5 Pro also demonstrated markedly higher performance across key principles of
good pedagogy. Altogether, these results position Gemini 2.5 Pro as a leading

Result: 在五个实验中，RAIS的平均等错误率（EER）为1.953%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RAIS通过多样本选择和辅助标签生成，有效提升了音频深度伪造检测的持续学习性能。

Abstract: The performance of existing audio deepfake detection frameworks degrades when
confronted with new deepfake attacks. Rehearsal-based continual learning (CL),
which updates models using a limited set of old data samples, helps preserve
prior knowledge while incorporating new information. However, existing
rehearsal techniques don't effectively capture the diversity of audio
characteristics, introducing bias and increasing the risk of forgetting. To
address this challenge, we propose Rehearsal with Auxiliary-Informed Sampling
(RAIS), a rehearsal-based CL approach for audio deepfake detection. RAIS
employs a label generation network to produce auxiliary labels, guiding diverse
sample selection for the memory buffer. Extensive experiments show RAIS
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average Equal Error Rate
(EER) of 1.953 % across five experiences. The code is available at:

Conclusion: RealDrive通过任务相关的检索和扩散模型，显著提升了规划性能和安全行为。

Abstract: Learning-based planners generate natural human-like driving behaviors by
learning to reason about nuanced interactions from data, overcoming the rigid
behaviors that arise from rule-based planners. Nonetheless, data-driven
approaches often struggle with rare, safety-critical scenarios and offer
limited controllability over the generated trajectories. To address these
challenges, we propose RealDrive, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
framework that initializes a diffusion-based planning policy by retrieving the
most relevant expert demonstrations from the training dataset. By interpolating
between current observations and retrieved examples through a denoising
process, our approach enables fine-grained control and safe behavior across
diverse scenarios, leveraging the strong prior provided by the retrieved
scenario. Another key insight we produce is that a task-relevant retrieval
model trained with planning-based objectives results in superior planning
performance in our framework compared to a task-agnostic retriever.
Experimental results demonstrate improved generalization to long-tail events
and enhanced trajectory diversity compared to standard learning-based planners
-- we observe a 40% reduction in collision rate on the Waymo Open Motion
dataset with RAG.

Abstract: Next location prediction plays a critical role in understanding human
mobility patterns. However, existing approaches face two core limitations: (1)
they fall short in capturing the complex, multi-functional semantics of
real-world locations; and (2) they lack the capacity to model heterogeneous
behavioral dynamics across diverse user groups. To tackle these challenges, we
introduce NextLocMoE, a novel framework built upon large language models (LLMs)
and structured around a dual-level Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design. Our
architecture comprises two specialized modules: a Location Semantics MoE that
operates at the embedding level to encode rich functional semantics of
locations, and a Personalized MoE embedded within the Transformer backbone to
dynamically adapt to individual user mobility patterns. In addition, we
incorporate a history-aware routing mechanism that leverages long-term
trajectory data to enhance expert selection and ensure prediction stability.
Empirical evaluations across several real-world urban datasets show that
NextLocMoE achieves superior performance in terms of predictive accuracy,
cross-domain generalization, and interpretability

Abstract: Urban design is a multifaceted process that demands careful consideration of
site-specific constraints and collaboration among diverse professionals and
stakeholders. The advent of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) offers
transformative potential by improving the efficiency of design generation and
facilitating the communication of design ideas. However, most existing
approaches are not well integrated with human design workflows. They often
follow end-to-end pipelines with limited control, overlooking the iterative
nature of real-world design. This study proposes a stepwise generative urban
design framework that integrates multimodal diffusion models with human
expertise to enable more adaptive and controllable design processes. Instead of
generating design outcomes in a single end-to-end process, the framework
divides the process into three key stages aligned with established urban design
workflows: (1) road network and land use planning, (2) building layout
planning, and (3) detailed planning and rendering. At each stage, multimodal
diffusion models generate preliminary designs based on textual prompts and
image-based constraints, which can then be reviewed and refined by human
designers. We design an evaluation framework to assess the fidelity,
compliance, and diversity of the generated designs. Experiments using data from
Chicago and New York City demonstrate that our framework outperforms baseline
models and end-to-end approaches across all three dimensions. This study
underscores the benefits of multimodal diffusion models and stepwise generation
in preserving human control and facilitating iterative refinements, laying the
groundwork for human-AI interaction in urban design solutions.

Abstract: Although speech emotion recognition (SER) has advanced significantly with
deep learning, annotation remains a major hurdle. Human annotation is not only
costly but also subject to inconsistencies annotators often have different
preferences and may lack the necessary contextual knowledge, which can lead to
varied and inaccurate labels. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) have
emerged as a scalable alternative for annotating text data. However, the
potential of LLMs to perform emotional speech data annotation without human
supervision has yet to be thoroughly investigated. To address these problems,
we apply GPT-4o to annotate a multimodal dataset collected from the sitcom
Friends, using only textual cues as inputs. By crafting structured text
prompts, our methodology capitalizes on the knowledge GPT-4o has accumulated
during its training, showcasing that it can generate accurate and contextually
relevant annotations without direct access to multimodal inputs. Therefore, we
propose MELT, a multimodal emotion dataset fully annotated by GPT-4o. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of MELT by fine-tuning four self-supervised
learning (SSL) backbones and assessing speech emotion recognition performance
across emotion datasets. Additionally, our subjective experiments\' results
demonstrate a consistence performance improvement on SER.

Abstract: Past work has demonstrated that autonomous vehicles can drive more safely if
they communicate with one another than if they do not. However, their
communication has often not been human-understandable. Using natural language
as a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication protocol offers the potential for
autonomous vehicles to drive cooperatively not only with each other but also
with human drivers. In this work, we propose a suite of traffic tasks in
autonomous driving where vehicles in a traffic scenario need to communicate in
natural language to facilitate coordination in order to avoid an imminent
collision and/or support efficient traffic flow. To this end, this paper
introduces a novel method, LLM+Debrief, to learn a message generation and
high-level decision-making policy for autonomous vehicles through multi-agent
discussion. To evaluate LLM agents for driving, we developed a gym-like
simulation environment that contains a range of driving scenarios. Our
experimental results demonstrate that LLM+Debrief is more effective at
generating meaningful and human-understandable natural language messages to
facilitate cooperation and coordination than a zero-shot LLM agent. Our code

Result: 攻击查询集大小显著影响提取模型的准确率和保真度；基于迁移学习的攻击在小查询集下表现更优。

Conclusion: 联邦学习对ME攻击高度脆弱，需加强防御措施；迁移学习方法为攻击者提供了潜在优势。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative learning framework designed to
protect client data, yet it remains highly vulnerable to Intellectual Property
(IP) threats. Model extraction (ME) attacks pose a significant risk to Machine
Learning as a Service (MLaaS) platforms, enabling attackers to replicate
confidential models by querying black-box (without internal insight) APIs.
Despite FL's privacy-preserving goals, its distributed nature makes it
particularly susceptible to such attacks. This paper examines the vulnerability
of FL-based victim models to two types of model extraction attacks. For various
federated clients built under the NVFlare platform, we implemented ME attacks
across two deep learning architectures and three image datasets. We evaluate
the proposed ME attack performance using various metrics, including accuracy,
fidelity, and KL divergence. The experiments show that for different FL
clients, the accuracy and fidelity of the extracted model are closely related
to the size of the attack query set. Additionally, we explore a transfer
learning based approach where pretrained models serve as the starting point for
the extraction process. The results indicate that the accuracy and fidelity of
the fine-tuned pretrained extraction models are notably higher, particularly
with smaller query sets, highlighting potential advantages for attackers.

Abstract: Phishing email detection faces critical challenges from evolving adversarial
tactics and heterogeneous attack patterns. Traditional detection methods, such
as rule-based filters and denylists, often struggle to keep pace with these
evolving tactics, leading to false negatives and compromised security. While
machine learning approaches have improved detection accuracy, they still face
challenges adapting to novel phishing strategies. We present MultiPhishGuard, a
dynamic LLM-based multi-agent detection system that synergizes specialized
expertise with adversarial-aware reinforcement learning. Our framework employs
five cooperative agents (text, URL, metadata, explanation simplifier, and
adversarial agents) with automatically adjusted decision weights powered by a
Proximal Policy Optimization reinforcement learning algorithm. To address
emerging threats, we introduce an adversarial training loop featuring an
adversarial agent that generates subtle context-aware email variants, creating
a self-improving defense ecosystem and enhancing system robustness.
Experimental evaluations on public datasets demonstrate that MultiPhishGuard
significantly outperforms Chain-of-Thoughts, single-agent baselines and
state-of-the-art detectors, as validated by ablation studies and comparative
analyses. Experiments demonstrate that MultiPhishGuard achieves high accuracy
(97.89\%) with low false positive (2.73\%) and false negative rates (0.20\%).
Additionally, we incorporate an explanation simplifier agent, which provides
users with clear and easily understandable explanations for why an email is
classified as phishing or legitimate. This work advances phishing defense
through dynamic multi-agent collaboration and generative adversarial

TL;DR: 论文介绍了自适应防御代理（ADA），一种创新的自动化移动目标防御（AMTD）系统，旨在提升AI工作负载的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态防御依赖复杂昂贵的可信计算解决方案，ADA通过动态环境操作提供更高效、敏捷的零信任模型。

Result: ADA提供了一种更鲁棒、高效的安全模型，支持AI生态系统的最新进展。

Conclusion: ADA通过主动环境操作而非被动修补，为AI服务提供了更安全的零信任模型。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Adaptive Defense Agent (ADA), an innovative
Automated Moving Target Defense (AMTD) system designed to fundamentally enhance
the security posture of AI workloads. ADA operates by continuously and
automatically rotating these workloads at the infrastructure level, leveraging
the inherent ephemerality of Kubernetes pods. This constant managed churn
systematically invalidates attacker assumptions and disrupts potential kill
chains by regularly destroying and respawning AI service instances. This
methodology, applying principles of chaos engineering as a continuous,
proactive defense, offers a paradigm shift from traditional static defenses
that rely on complex and expensive confidential or trusted computing solutions
to secure the underlying compute platforms, while at the same time agnostically
supporting the latest advancements in agentic and nonagentic AI ecosystems and
solutions such as agent-to-agent (A2A) communication frameworks or model
context protocols (MCP). This AI-native infrastructure design, relying on the
widely proliferated cloud-native Kubernetes technologies, facilitates easier
deployment, simplifies maintenance through an inherent zero trust posture
achieved by rotation, and promotes faster adoption. We posit that ADA's novel
approach to AMTD provides a more robust, agile, and operationally efficient
zero-trust model for AI services, achieving security through proactive
environmental manipulation rather than reactive patching.

Motivation: 标准联邦学习在隐私保护和系统容错方面存在不足，可能导致数据泄露或训练中断。

Method: 结合本地差分隐私（LDP）、弹性状态管理和完整性验证机制（如ZKIPs）。

Result: 提出DP-RTFL框架，确保训练连续性、精确状态恢复和强数据隐私。

Conclusion: DP-RTFL适用于敏感数据场景（如金融风险评估），具有操作鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a critical paradigm for enabling
privacy-preserving machine learning, particularly in regulated sectors such as
finance and healthcare. However, standard FL strategies often encounter
significant operational challenges related to fault tolerance, system
resilience against concurrent client and server failures, and the provision of
robust, verifiable privacy guarantees essential for handling sensitive data.
These deficiencies can lead to training disruptions, data loss, compromised
model integrity, and non-compliance with data protection regulations (e.g.,
GDPR, CCPA). This paper introduces Differentially Private Resilient Temporal
Federated Learning (DP-RTFL), an advanced FL framework designed to ensure
training continuity, precise state recovery, and strong data privacy. DP-RTFL
integrates local Differential Privacy (LDP) at the client level with resilient
temporal state management and integrity verification mechanisms, such as
hash-based commitments (referred to as Zero-Knowledge Integrity Proofs or ZKIPs
in this context). The framework is particularly suited for critical
applications like credit risk assessment using sensitive financial data, aiming
to be operationally robust, auditable, and scalable for enterprise AI
deployments. The implementation of the DP-RTFL framework is available as
open-source.

Result: 在六个数据集上验证了框架的多样性和有效性，解决了七种不同的DR问题。

Conclusion: CADRE框架显著提升了FL模型的性能和可靠性，同时优化了资源利用。

Abstract: Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning (PPFL) is a decentralized machine
learning approach where multiple clients train a model collaboratively. PPFL
preserves privacy and security of the client's data by not exchanging it.
However, ensuring that data at each client is of high quality and ready for
federated learning (FL) is a challenge due to restricted data access. In this
paper, we introduce CADRE (Customizable Assurance of Data REadiness) for FL, a
novel framework that allows users to define custom data readiness (DR)
standards, metrics, rules, and remedies tailored to specific FL tasks. Our
framework generates comprehensive DR reports based on the user-defined metrics,
rules, and remedies to ensure datasets are optimally prepared for FL while
preserving privacy. We demonstrate the framework's practical application by
integrating it into an existing PPFL framework. We conducted experiments across
six diverse datasets, addressing seven different DR issues. The results
illustrate the framework's versatility and effectiveness in ensuring DR across
various dimensions, including data quality, privacy, and fairness. This
approach enhances the performance and reliability of FL models as well as
utilizes valuable resources by identifying and addressing data-related issues
before the training phase.

Result: 在多个公开基准测试中验证了KGMARK的有效性。

Conclusion: KGMARK成功解决了动态KG水印的挑战，具有鲁棒性、可检测性和透明性。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are ubiquitous in numerous real-world applications,
and watermarking facilitates protecting intellectual property and preventing
potential harm from AI-generated content. Existing watermarking methods mainly
focus on static plain text or image data, while they can hardly be applied to
dynamic graphs due to spatial and temporal variations of structured data. This
motivates us to propose KGMARK, the first graph watermarking framework that
aims to generate robust, detectable, and transparent diffusion fingerprints for
dynamic KG data. Specifically, we propose a novel clustering-based alignment
method to adapt the watermark to spatial variations. Meanwhile, we present a
redundant embedding strategy to harden the diffusion watermark against various
attacks, facilitating the robustness of the watermark to the temporal
variations. Additionally, we introduce a novel learnable mask matrix to improve
the transparency of diffusion fingerprints. By doing so, our KGMARK properly
tackles the variation challenges of structured data. Experiments on various
public benchmarks show the effectiveness of our proposed KGMARK.

Conclusion: 主张将问题寻求视为智能核心，推动以人为中心的AI发展。

Abstract: This study introduces a novel conceptual framework distinguishing
problem-seeking from problem-solving to clarify the unique features of human
intelligence in contrast to AI. Problem-seeking refers to the embodied,
emotionally grounded process by which humans identify and set goals, while
problem-solving denotes the execution of strategies aimed at achieving such
predefined objectives. The framework emphasizes that while AI excels at
efficiency and optimization, it lacks the orientation derived from experiential
grounding and the embodiment flexibility intrinsic to human cognition. To
empirically explore this distinction, the research analyzes metadata from 157
YouTube videos discussing AI. Conducting a thematic analysis combining
qualitative insights with keyword-based quantitative metrics, this
mixed-methods approach uncovers recurring themes in public discourse, including
privacy, job displacement, misinformation, optimism, and ethical concerns. The
results reveal a dual sentiment: public fascination with AI's capabilities
coexists with anxiety and skepticism about its societal implications. The
discussion critiques the orthogonality thesis, which posits that intelligence
is separable from goal content, and instead argues that human intelligence
integrates goal-setting and goal-pursuit. It underscores the centrality of
embodied cognition in human reasoning and highlights how AI's limitations come
from its current reliance on computational processing. The study advocates for
enhancing emotional and digital literacy to foster responsible AI engagement.
It calls for reframing public discourse to recognize AI as a tool that augments
-- rather than replaces -- human intelligence. By positioning problem seeking
at the core of cognition and as a critical dimension of intelligence, this
research offers new perspectives on ethically aligned and human-centered AI
development.

Conclusion: SearchAI能提升临床数据的可访问性，优化工作流程，减少管理负担，并提高编码和诊断准确性。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is making a major impact on healthcare,
particularly through its application in natural language processing (NLP) and
predictive analytics. The healthcare sector has increasingly adopted AI for
tasks such as clinical data analysis and medical code assignment. However,
searching for clinical information in large and often unorganized datasets
remains a manual and error-prone process. Assisting this process with
automations can help physicians improve their operational productivity
significantly.
  In this paper, we present a generative AI approach, coined SearchAI, to
enhance the accuracy and efficiency of searching clinical data. Unlike
traditional code assignment, which is a one-to-one problem, clinical data
search is a one-to-many problem, i.e., a given search query can map to a family
of codes. Healthcare professionals typically search for groups of related
diseases, drugs, or conditions that map to many codes, and therefore, they need
search tools that can handle keyword synonyms, semantic variants, and broad
open-ended queries. SearchAI employs a hierarchical model that respects the
coding hierarchy and improves the traversal of relationships from parent to
child nodes. SearchAI navigates these hierarchies predictively and ensures that
all paths are reachable without losing any relevant nodes.
  To evaluate the effectiveness of SearchAI, we conducted a series of
experiments using both public and production datasets. Our results show that
SearchAI outperforms default hierarchical traversals across several metrics,
including accuracy, robustness, performance, and scalability. SearchAI can help
make clinical data more accessible, leading to streamlined workflows, reduced
administrative burden, and enhanced coding and diagnostic accuracy.

Abstract: Monitoring and analyzing process traces is a critical task for modern
companies and organizations. In scenarios where there is a gap between trace
events and reference business activities, this entails an interpretation
problem, amounting to translating each event of any ongoing trace into the
corresponding step of the activity instance. Building on a recent approach that
frames the interpretation problem as an acceptance problem within an Abstract
Argumentation Framework (AAF), one can elegantly analyze plausible event
interpretations (possibly in an aggregated form), as well as offer explanations
for those that conflict with prior process knowledge. Since, in settings where
event-to-activity mapping is highly uncertain (or simply under-specified) this
reasoning-based approach may yield lowly-informative results and heavy
computation, one can think of discovering a sequencetagging model, trained to
suggest highly-probable candidate event interpretations in a context-aware way.
However, training such a model optimally may require using a large amount of
manually-annotated example traces. Considering the urgent need of developing
Green AI solutions enabling environmental and societal sustainability (with
reduced labor/computational costs and carbon footprint), we propose a
data/computation-efficient neuro-symbolic approach to the problem, where the
candidate interpretations returned by the example-driven sequence tagger is
refined by the AAF-based reasoner. This allows us to also leverage prior
knowledge to compensate for the scarcity of example data, as confirmed by
experimental results; clearly, this property is particularly useful in settings
where data annotation and model optimization costs are subject to stringent
constraints.

Abstract: Frequent cyber-attacks have elevated WebShell exploitation and defense to a
critical research focus within network security. However, there remains a
significant shortage of publicly available, well-categorized malicious-code
datasets organized by obfuscation method. Existing malicious-code generation
methods, which primarily rely on prompt engineering, often suffer from limited
diversity and high redundancy in the payloads they produce. To address these
limitations, we propose \textbf{RAWG}, a \textbf{R}eward-driven
\textbf{A}utomated \textbf{W}ebshell Malicious-code \textbf{G}enerator designed
for red-teaming applications. Our approach begins by categorizing webshell
samples from common datasets into seven distinct types of obfuscation. We then
employ a large language model (LLM) to extract and normalize key tokens from
each sample, creating a standardized, high-quality corpus. Using this curated
dataset, we perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on an open-source large model
to enable the generation of diverse, highly obfuscated webshell malicious
payloads. To further enhance generation quality, we apply Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO), treating malicious-code samples as "chosen" data and benign
code as "rejected" data during reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that RAWG significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art
methods in both payload diversity and escape effectiveness.

Conclusion: CHIP为DNN提供了全面的知识产权保护方案，支持所有权验证、用户追踪和动态使用控制。

Abstract: The pervasion of large-scale Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and their enormous
training costs make their intellectual property (IP) protection of paramount
importance. Recently introduced passport-based methods attempt to steer DNN
watermarking towards strengthening ownership verification against ambiguity
attacks by modulating the affine parameters of normalization layers.
Unfortunately, neither watermarking nor passport-based methods provide a
holistic protection with robust ownership proof, high fidelity, active usage
authorization and user traceability for offline access distributed models and
multi-user Machine-Learning as a Service (MLaaS) cloud model. In this paper, we
propose a Chameleon Hash-based Irreversible Passport (CHIP) protection
framework that utilizes the cryptographic chameleon hash function to achieve
all these goals. The collision-resistant property of chameleon hash allows for
strong model ownership claim upon IP infringement and liable user traceability,
while the trapdoor-collision property enables hashing of multiple user
passports and licensee certificates to the same immutable signature to realize
active usage control. Using the owner passport as an oracle, multiple
user-specific triplets, each contains a passport-aware user model, a user
passport, and a licensee certificate can be created for secure offline
distribution. The watermarked master model can also be deployed for MLaaS with
usage permission verifiable by the provision of any trapdoor-colliding user
passports. CHIP is extensively evaluated on four datasets and two architectures
to demonstrate its protection versatility and robustness. Our code is released
at https://github.com/Dshm212/CHIP.

Abstract: Since the 1990s, the integration of technology into daily life has led to the
creation of an extensive network of interconnected devices, transforming how
individuals and organizations operate. However, this digital transformation has
also spurred the rise of cybercrime, criminal activities perpetrated through
networks or computer systems. Cybercrime has become a global concern,
presenting significant challenges to security systems. Although advancements in
digital technology have enhanced efficiency, they have also opened new avenues
for exploitation by cybercriminals, highlighting the urgent need for advanced
cybersecurity measures. The escalating number of cyberattacks and associated
risks in the past decade highlights the critical importance of protecting
sensitive data and safeguarding information systems. Cybercrimes range from
financial fraud and phishing scams to identity theft and online harassment,
posing substantial risks to both individuals and organizations. In response,
governments, law enforcement agencies, and cybersecurity units have intensified
their efforts to address these threats. In recent years, India has experienced
a significant surge in cybercrime incidents, with a notable increase in cases
involving ransomware, data breaches, and social engineering attacks. The
growing penetration of internet services, the expansion of e-commerce, and the
rapid adoption of digital payment systems have made individuals and
organizations more vulnerable to cyber threats. Key areas affected include
banking, healthcare, and government sectors, which are frequently targeted due
to the sensitive nature of the data they handle. To combat these risks, there
is an increasing focus on public awareness, cybersecurity education, and robust
regulatory frameworks. This paper examines cybercrime, prevention strategies,
security protocols, and terminology to safeguard digital infrastructure.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) usage is expected to surge in the coming
decade, raising the need for heightened security measures to prevent airspace
violations and security threats. This study investigates deep learning
approaches to UAV classification focusing on the key issue of data scarcity. To
investigate this we opted to train the models using a total of 4,500 seconds of
audio samples, evenly distributed across a 9-class dataset. We leveraged
parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and data augmentations to mitigate the
data scarcity. This paper implements and compares the use of convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) and attention-based transformers. Our results show that,
CNNs outperform transformers by 1-2\% accuracy, while still being more
computationally efficient. These early findings, however, point to potential in
using transformers models; suggesting that with more data and further
optimizations they could outperform CNNs. Future works aims to upscale the
dataset to better understand the trade-offs between these approaches.

Abstract: Physics-driven deep learning (PD-DL) models have proven to be a powerful
approach for improved reconstruction of rapid MRI scans. In order to train
these models in scenarios where fully-sampled reference data is unavailable,
self-supervised learning has gained prominence. However, its application at
high acceleration rates frequently introduces artifacts, compromising image
fidelity. To mitigate this shortcoming, we propose a novel way to train PD-DL
networks via carefully-designed perturbations. In particular, we enhance the
k-space masking idea of conventional self-supervised learning with a novel
consistency term that assesses the model's ability to accurately predict the
added perturbations in a sparse domain, leading to more reliable and
artifact-free reconstructions. The results obtained from the fastMRI knee and
brain datasets show that the proposed training strategy effectively reduces
aliasing artifacts and mitigates noise amplification at high acceleration
rates, outperforming state-of-the-art self-supervised methods both visually and
quantitatively.

Conclusion: Discl-VC通过解耦和上下文学习，显著提升了语音转换的可控性和准确性。

Abstract: Currently, zero-shot voice conversion systems are capable of synthesizing the
voice of unseen speakers. However, most existing approaches struggle to
accurately replicate the speaking style of the source speaker or mimic the
distinctive speaking style of the target speaker, thereby limiting the
controllability of voice conversion. In this work, we propose Discl-VC, a novel
voice conversion framework that disentangles content and prosody information
from self-supervised speech representations and synthesizes the target
speaker's voice through in-context learning with a flow matching transformer.
To enable precise control over the prosody of generated speech, we introduce a
mask generative transformer that predicts discrete prosody tokens in a
non-autoregressive manner based on prompts. Experimental results demonstrate
the superior performance of Discl-VC in zero-shot voice conversion and its
remarkable accuracy in prosody control for synthesized speech.

Abstract: Dynamic hand gestures play a pivotal role in assistive human-robot
interaction (HRI), facilitating intuitive, non-verbal communication,
particularly for individuals with mobility constraints or those operating
robots remotely. Current gesture recognition methods are mostly limited to
short-range interactions, reducing their utility in scenarios demanding robust
assistive communication from afar. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach
designed specifically for assistive robotics, enabling dynamic gesture
recognition at extended distances of up to 30 meters, thereby significantly
improving accessibility and quality of life. Our proposed Distance-aware
Gesture Network (DiG-Net) effectively combines Depth-Conditioned Deformable
Alignment (DADA) blocks with Spatio-Temporal Graph modules, enabling robust
processing and classification of gesture sequences captured under challenging
conditions, including significant physical attenuation, reduced resolution, and
dynamic gesture variations commonly experienced in real-world assistive
environments. We further introduce the Radiometric Spatio-Temporal Depth
Attenuation Loss (RSTDAL), shown to enhance learning and strengthen model
robustness across varying distances. Our model demonstrates significant
performance improvement over state-of-the-art gesture recognition frameworks,
achieving a recognition accuracy of 97.3% on a diverse dataset with challenging
hyper-range gestures. By effectively interpreting gestures from considerable
distances, DiG-Net significantly enhances the usability of assistive robots in
home healthcare, industrial safety, and remote assistance scenarios, enabling
seamless and intuitive interactions for users regardless of physical

Abstract: Oceanographic forecasting impacts various sectors of society by supporting
environmental conservation and economic activities. Based on global circulation
models, traditional forecasting methods are computationally expensive and slow,
limiting their ability to provide rapid forecasts. Recent advances in deep
learning offer faster and more accurate predictions, although these data-driven
models are often trained with global data from numerical simulations, which may
not reflect reality. The emergence of such models presents great potential for
improving ocean prediction at a subregional domain. However, their ability to
predict fine-scale ocean processes, like mesoscale structures, remains largely
unknown. This work aims to adapt a graph neural network initially developed for
global weather forecasting to improve subregional ocean prediction,
specifically focusing on the Canary Current upwelling system. The model is
trained with satellite data and compared to state-of-the-art physical ocean
models to assess its performance in capturing ocean dynamics. Our results show
that the deep learning model surpasses traditional methods in precision despite
some challenges in upwelling areas. It demonstrated superior performance in
reducing RMSE errors compared to ConvLSTM and the GLORYS reanalysis,
particularly in regions with complex oceanic dynamics such as Cape Ghir, Cape
Bojador, and Cape Blanc. The model achieved improvements of up to 26.5%
relative to ConvLSTM and error reductions of up to 76% in 5-day forecasts
compared to the GLORYS reanalysis at these critical locations, highlighting its
enhanced capability to capture spatial variability and improve predictive
accuracy in complex areas. These findings suggest the viability of adapting
meteorological data-driven models for improving subregional medium-term ocean

automatically towards its target states, such that the policy can gradually
learn to take over under motion and contact guidance. We release a simulation

DexMachina significantly outperforms baseline methods. Our algorithm and
benchmark enable a functional comparison for hardware designs, and we present

Conclusion: RNop为高效mRNA设计提供了新方法，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: The mRNA optimization is critical for therapeutic and biotechnological
applications, since sequence features directly govern protein expression levels
and efficacy. However, current methods face significant challenges in
simultaneously achieving three key objectives: (1) fidelity (preventing
unintended amino acid changes), (2) computational efficiency (speed and
scalability), and (3) the scope of optimization variables considered
(multi-objective capability). Furthermore, existing methods often fall short of
comprehensively incorporating the factors related to the mRNA lifecycle and
translation process, including intrinsic mRNA sequence properties, secondary
structure, translation elongation kinetics, and tRNA availability. To address
these limitations, we introduce \textbf{RNop}, a novel deep learning-based
method for mRNA optimization. We collect a large-scale dataset containing over
3 million sequences and design four specialized loss functions, the GPLoss,
CAILoss, tAILoss, and MFELoss, which simultaneously enable explicit control
over sequence fidelity while optimizing species-specific codon adaptation, tRNA
availability, and desirable mRNA secondary structure features. Then, we
demonstrate RNop's effectiveness through extensive in silico and in vivo
experiments. RNop ensures high sequence fidelity, achieves significant
computational throughput up to 47.32 sequences/s, and yields optimized mRNA
sequences resulting in a significant increase in protein expression for
functional proteins compared to controls. RNop surpasses current methodologies
in both quantitative metrics and experimental validation, enlightening a new
dawn for efficient and effective mRNA design. Code and models will be available

Abstract: The increasing complexity of rotating machinery and the diversity of
operating conditions, such as rotating speed and varying torques, have
amplified the challenges in fault diagnosis in scenarios requiring domain
adaptation, particularly involving compound faults. This study addresses these
challenges by introducing a novel multi-output classification (MOC) framework
tailored for domain adaptation in partially labeled (PL) target datasets.
Unlike conventional multi-class classification (MCC) approaches, the proposed
MOC framework classifies the severity levels of compound faults simultaneously.
Furthermore, we explore various single-task and multi-task architectures
applicable to the MOC formulation-including shared trunk and cross-talk-based
designs-for compound fault diagnosis under PL conditions. Based on this
investigation, we propose a novel cross-talk layer structure that enables
selective information sharing across diagnostic tasks, effectively enhancing
classification performance in compound fault scenarios. In addition,
frequency-layer normalization was incorporated to improve domain adaptation
performance on motor vibration data. Compound fault conditions were implemented
using a motor-based test setup, and the proposed model was evaluated across six
domain adaptation scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate its superior
macro F1 performance compared to baseline models. We further showed that the
proposed mode's structural advantage is more pronounced in compound fault
settings through a single-fault comparison. We also found that frequency-layer
normalization fits the fault diagnosis task better than conventional methods.
Lastly, we discuss that this improvement primarily stems from the model's
structural ability to leverage inter-fault classification task interactions,
rather than from a simple increase in model parameters.

Abstract: We study the problem of fairly allocating indivisible goods to agents in an
online setting, where goods arrive sequentially and must be allocated
irrevocably to agents. Focusing on the popular fairness notions of
envy-freeness, proportionality, and maximin share fairness (and their
approximate variants), we ask how the availability of information on future
goods influences the existence and approximability of fair allocations. In the
absence of any such information, we establish strong impossibility results,
demonstrating the inherent difficulty of achieving even approximate fairness
guarantees. In contrast, we demonstrate that knowledge of additional
information -- such as aggregate of each agent's total valuations
(equivalently, normalized valuations) or the multiset of future goods values
(frequency predictions) -- would enable the design of fairer online algorithms.
Given normalization information, we propose an algorithm that achieves stronger
fairness guarantees than previously known results. Given frequency predictions,
we introduce a meta-algorithm that leverages frequency predictions to match the
best-known offline guarantees for a broad class of ''share-based'' fairness
notions. Our complementary impossibility results in each setting underscore
both the limitations imposed by uncertainty about future goods and the
potential of leveraging structured information to achieve fairer outcomes in
online fair division.

Abstract: Identifying evolutionary correspondences between cell types across species is
a fundamental challenge in comparative genomics and evolutionary biology.
Existing approaches often rely on either reference-based matching, which
imposes asymmetry by designating one species as the reference, or
projection-based matching, which may increase computational complexity and
obscure biological interpretability at the cell-type level. Here, we present
OT-MESH, an unsupervised computational framework leveraging entropy-regularized
optimal transport (OT) to systematically determine cross-species cell type
homologies. Our method uniquely integrates the Minimize Entropy of Sinkhorn
(MESH) technique to refine the OT plan. It begins by selecting genes with high
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) to capture the most informative features, from
which a cost matrix is constructed using cosine distances between cell-type
centroids. Importantly, the MESH procedure iteratively refines the cost matrix,
leading to a transport plan with significantly enhanced sparsity and
interpretability of the resulting correspondence matrices. Applied to retinal
bipolar cells (BCs) and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) from mouse and macaque,
OT-MESH accurately recovers known evolutionary relationships and uncovers novel
correspondences, one of which was independently validated experimentally. Thus,
our framework offers a principled, scalable, symmetric, and interpretable
solution for evolutionary cell type mapping, facilitating deeper insights into
cellular specialization and conservation across species.

Abstract: The coverage and composition of pretraining data significantly impacts the
generalization ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). To reduce the carbon
footprint and financial costs of training, some data mixing methods, which
applied the optimized domain weights of a small proxy model to train a larger
one, were proposed. However, these methods did not evolute with the training
dynamics. The existing online data mixing (ODM) method addressed this
limitation by applying the multi-armed bandit algorithm as data sampling
strategy. Yet, it did not consider the intra-domain interactions. In this
paper, we develop an actor-critic based online data mixing (AC-ODM) method,
which captures the varying domain weights by auxiliary actor-critic networks

constructing the dataset to pretrain a large target LLM, we directly apply the

efficiency of dynamical data mixing, but also expedite the convergence of
pretraining the target LLM. Numerical results demonstrate that AC-ODM-410M,
which invokes the sampling strategy obtained by a proxy LLM with 410M

improves performance on the zero-shot MMLU benchmark by 27.5% of accuracy,

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has achieved great
empirical success in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human
preference, and it is of great importance to study the statistical efficiency
of RLHF algorithms from a theoretical perspective. In this work, we consider
the online RLHF setting where the preference data is revealed during the
learning process and study action value function approximation. We design a
model-free posterior sampling algorithm for online RLHF inspired by Thompson
sampling and provide its theoretical guarantee. Specifically, we adopt Bellman
eluder (BE) dimension as the complexity measure of the function class and
establish $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound for the proposed algorithm with other
multiplicative factor depending on the horizon, BE dimension and the
$log$-bracketing number of the function class. Further, in the analysis, we
first establish the concentration-type inequality of the squared Bellman error
bound based on the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) generalization bound,
which plays the crucial rules in obtaining the eluder-type regret bound and may
be of independent interest.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become the most effective post-training
approach for improving the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). In
practice, because of the high demands on latency and memory, it is particularly
challenging to develop an efficient RL framework that reliably manages policy
models with hundreds to thousands of billions of parameters.
  In this paper, we present LlamaRL, a fully distributed, asynchronous RL
framework optimized for efficient training of large-scale LLMs with various
model sizes (8B, 70B, and 405B parameters) on GPU clusters ranging from a
handful to thousands of devices. LlamaRL introduces a streamlined,
single-controller architecture built entirely on native PyTorch, enabling
modularity, ease of use, and seamless scalability to thousands of GPUs. We also
provide a theoretical analysis of LlamaRL's efficiency, including a formal
proof that its asynchronous design leads to strict RL speed-up. Empirically, by
leveraging best practices such as colocated model offloading, asynchronous
off-policy training, and distributed direct memory access for weight
synchronization, LlamaRL achieves significant efficiency gains -- up to 10.7x
speed-up compared to DeepSpeed-Chat-like systems on a 405B-parameter policy
model. Furthermore, the efficiency advantage continues to grow with increasing
model scale, demonstrating the framework's suitability for future large-scale
RL training.

Abstract: We demonstrate that the inference operations of several open-weight large
language models (LLMs) can be mapped to an exactly equivalent linear system for
an input sequence without modifying the model weights or altering output
predictions. Extending techniques from image diffusion models that exhibit
local or piecewise linearity, we strategically alter the gradient computation
with respect to a given input sequence for a next-token prediction such that
the Jacobian of the model nearly exactly reproduces the forward prediction with
a linear system. We demonstrate this approach across models (Llama 3, Gemma 3,
Qwen 3, Phi 4, Mistral Ministral and OLMo 2, up to Llama 3.3 70B Q4) and show
through the singular value decomposition of the detached Jacobian that these
LLMs operate in extremely low-dimensional subspaces where many of the largest
singular vectors decode to concepts related to the most-likely output token.
This approach also allows us to examine the operation of each successive layer
(and its attention and MLP components) as nearly-exact linear systems and
observe the emergence of semantic concepts. Despite their expressive power and
global nonlinearity, modern LLMs can be interpreted through nearly-exact
locally linear decompositions that provide insights into their internal
representations and reveal interpretable semantic structures in the next-token
prediction process.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a trending paradigm for training large
language models (LLMs), particularly for reasoning tasks. Effective RL for LLMs
requires massive parallelization and poses an urgent need for efficient
training systems. Most existing large-scale RL systems for LLMs are synchronous
by alternating generation and training in a batch setting, where the rollouts
in each training batch are generated by the same (or latest) model. This
stabilizes RL training but suffers from severe system-level inefficiency.
Generation must wait until the longest output in the batch is completed before
model update, resulting in GPU underutilization. We present AReaL, a
\emph{fully asynchronous} RL system that completely decouples generation from
training. Rollout workers in AReaL continuously generate new outputs without
waiting, while training workers update the model whenever a batch of data is
collected. AReaL also incorporates a collection of system-level optimizations,
leading to substantially higher GPU utilization. To stabilize RL training,
AReaL balances the workload of rollout and training workers to control data
staleness, and adopts a staleness-enhanced PPO variant to better handle
outdated training samples. Extensive experiments on math and code reasoning
benchmarks show that AReaL achieves \textbf{up to 2.57$\times$ training
speedup} compared to the best synchronous systems with the same number of GPUs
and matched or even improved final performance. The code of AReaL is available

Conclusion: APL为提升语言模型安全性提供了高效且自动化的解决方案，适用于对抗性环境。

Abstract: Modern language models often rely on Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) to encourage safe behaviors. However, they remain vulnerable to
adversarial attacks due to three key limitations: (1) the inefficiency and high
cost of human annotation, (2) the vast diversity of potential adversarial
attacks, and (3) the risk of feedback bias and reward hacking. To address these
challenges, we introduce Adversarial Preference Learning (APL), an iterative
adversarial training method incorporating three key innovations. First, a
direct harmfulness metric based on the model's intrinsic preference
probabilities, eliminating reliance on external assessment. Second, a
conditional generative attacker that synthesizes input-specific adversarial
variations. Third, an iterative framework with automated closed-loop feedback,
enabling continuous adaptation through vulnerability discovery and mitigation.
Experiments on Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 demonstrate that APL significantly
enhances robustness, achieving 83.33% harmlessness win rate over the base model
(evaluated by GPT-4o), reducing harmful outputs from 5.88% to 0.43% (measured
by LLaMA-Guard), and lowering attack success rate by up to 65% according to
HarmBench. Notably, APL maintains competitive utility, with an MT-Bench score

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools but pose
significant safety risks through harmful outputs and vulnerability to
adversarial attacks. We propose SaP, short for Safety Polytope, a geometric
approach to LLM safety that learns and enforces multiple safety constraints
directly in the model's representation space. We develop a framework that
identifies safe and unsafe regions via the polytope's facets, enabling both
detection and correction of unsafe outputs through geometric steering. Unlike
existing approaches that modify model weights, SaP operates post-hoc in the
representation space, preserving model capabilities while enforcing safety
constraints. Experiments across multiple LLMs demonstrate that our method can
effectively detect unethical inputs, reduce adversarial attack success rates
while maintaining performance on standard tasks, thus highlighting the
importance of having an explicit geometric model for safety. Analysis of the
learned polytope facets reveals emergence of specialization in detecting
different semantic notions of safety, providing interpretable insights into how
safety is captured in LLMs' representation space.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great success in text modeling tasks
across domains. However, natural language exhibits inherent semantic
hierarchies and nuanced geometric structure, which current LLMs do not capture
completely owing to their reliance on Euclidean operations. Recent studies have
also shown that not respecting the geometry of token embeddings leads to
training instabilities and degradation of generative capabilities. These
findings suggest that shifting to non-Euclidean geometries can better align
language models with the underlying geometry of text. We thus propose to
operate fully in Hyperbolic space, known for its expansive, scale-free, and
low-distortion properties. We thus introduce HELM, a family of HypErbolic Large
Language Models, offering a geometric rethinking of the Transformer-based LLM
that addresses the representational inflexibility, missing set of necessary
operations, and poor scalability of existing hyperbolic LMs. We additionally
introduce a Mixture-of-Curvature Experts model, HELM-MICE, where each expert
operates in a distinct curvature space to encode more fine-grained geometric
structure from text, as well as a dense model, HELM-D. For HELM-MICE, we
further develop hyperbolic Multi-Head Latent Attention (HMLA) for efficient,
reduced-KV-cache training and inference. For both models, we develop essential
hyperbolic equivalents of rotary positional encodings and RMS normalization. We
are the first to train fully hyperbolic LLMs at billion-parameter scale, and
evaluate them on well-known benchmarks such as MMLU and ARC, spanning STEM
problem-solving, general knowledge, and commonsense reasoning. Our results show
consistent gains from our HELM architectures -- up to 4% -- over popular
Euclidean architectures used in LLaMA and DeepSeek, highlighting the efficacy
and enhanced reasoning afforded by hyperbolic geometry in large-scale LM
pretraining.

Abstract: Low-rank gradient-based optimization methods have significantly improved
memory efficiency during the training of large language models (LLMs), enabling
operations within constrained hardware without sacrificing performance.
However, these methods primarily emphasize memory savings, often overlooking
potential acceleration in convergence due to their reliance on standard
isotropic steepest descent techniques, which can perform suboptimally in the
highly anisotropic landscapes typical of deep networks, particularly LLMs. In
this paper, we propose SUMO (Subspace-Aware Moment-Orthogonalization), an
optimizer that employs exact singular value decomposition (SVD) for moment
orthogonalization within a dynamically adapted low-dimensional subspace,
enabling norm-inducing steepest descent optimization steps. By explicitly
aligning optimization steps with the spectral characteristics of the loss
landscape, SUMO effectively mitigates approximation errors associated with
commonly used methods like Newton-Schulz orthogonalization approximation. We
theoretically establish an upper bound on these approximation errors, proving
their dependence on the condition numbers of moments, conditions we
analytically demonstrate are encountered during LLM training. Furthermore, we
both theoretically and empirically illustrate that exact orthogonalization via
SVD substantially improves convergence rates while reducing overall complexity.
Empirical evaluations confirm that SUMO accelerates convergence, enhances
stability, improves performance, and reduces memory requirements by up to 20%
compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Multi-task model merging aims to consolidate knowledge from multiple
fine-tuned task-specific experts into a unified model while minimizing
performance degradation. Existing methods primarily approach this by minimizing
differences between task-specific experts and the unified model, either from a
parameter-level or a task-loss perspective. However, parameter-level methods
exhibit a significant performance gap compared to the upper bound, while
task-loss approaches entail costly secondary training procedures. In contrast,
we observe that performance degradation closely correlates with feature drift,
i.e., differences in feature representations of the same sample caused by model
merging. Motivated by this observation, we propose Layer-wise Optimal Task
Vector Merging (LOT Merging), a technique that explicitly minimizes feature
drift between task-specific experts and the unified model in a layer-by-layer
manner. LOT Merging can be formulated as a convex quadratic optimization
problem, enabling us to analytically derive closed-form solutions for the
parameters of linear and normalization layers. Consequently, LOT Merging
achieves efficient model consolidation through basic matrix operations.
Extensive experiments across vision and vision-language benchmarks demonstrate
that LOT Merging significantly outperforms baseline methods, achieving
improvements of up to 4.4% (ViT-B/32) over state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Current parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods for adapting pre-trained
language models to downstream tasks are susceptible to interference from noisy
data. Conventional noise-handling approaches either rely on laborious data
pre-processing or employ model architecture modifications prone to error
accumulation. In contrast to existing noise-process paradigms, we propose a
noise-robust adaptation method via asymmetric LoRA poisoning experts (LoPE), a
novel framework that enhances model robustness to noise only with generated
noisy data. Drawing inspiration from the mixture-of-experts architecture, LoPE
strategically integrates a dedicated poisoning expert in an asymmetric LoRA
configuration. Through a two-stage paradigm, LoPE performs noise injection on
the poisoning expert during fine-tuning to enhance its noise discrimination and
processing ability. During inference, we selectively mask the dedicated
poisoning expert to leverage purified knowledge acquired by normal experts for
noise-robust output. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoPE achieves
strong performance and robustness purely through the low-cost noise injection,
which completely eliminates the requirement of data cleaning.

is to exploit the superior energy compaction and decorrelation properties of
cosine projection to improve both model efficiency and accuracy. Specifically,
it projects the weight change from the low-rank adaptation into the discrete
cosine space. Then, the weight change is partitioned over different levels of
the discrete cosine spectrum, and each partition's most critical frequency
components are selected. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
MaCP across a wide range of single-modality tasks, including natural language

Abstract: Human-aligned deep learning models exhibit behaviors consistent with human
values, such as robustness, fairness, and honesty. Transferring these
behavioral properties to models trained on different tasks or data
distributions remains challenging: aligned behavior is easily forgotten during
fine-tuning, and collecting task-specific data that preserves this behavior can
be prohibitively costly. We introduce BIRD (Behavior Induction via
Representation-structure Distillation), a flexible framework for transferring
aligned behavior by matching the internal representation structure of a student
model to that of a teacher. Applied to out-of-distribution robustness in image
classification, BIRD outperforms fine-tuning, transfer learning, and continual
learning methods, improving robust accuracy by up to 16% over the next
strongest baseline. It remains effective even when the teacher is trained on a
much simpler dataset and is $25 \times$ smaller than the student. In a
large-scale study of over 400 teacher-student pairs, we show that three
interpretable and computable properties of the teacher's representations (i.e.,
task relevance, behavioral relevance, and complementary knowledge) explain up
to 85% of the variance in transfer success. These insights offer practical
guidance for teacher selection and design. BIRD turns small, well-aligned
models into scalable alignment seeds, removing a key bottleneck in deploying
safe AI systems in the wild.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of large large-scale neural networks, we still
lack unified notation for thinking about and describing their representational
spaces. We lack methods to reliably describe how their representations are
structured, how that structure emerges over training, and what kinds of
structures are desirable. This thesis introduces quantitative methods for
identifying systematic structure in a mapping between spaces, and leverages
them to understand how deep-learning models learn to represent information,
what representational structures drive generalisation, and how design decisions
condition the structures that emerge. To do this I identify structural
primitives present in a mapping, along with information theoretic
quantifications of each. These allow us to analyse learning, structure, and
generalisation across multi-agent reinforcement learning models,
sequence-to-sequence models trained on a single task, and Large Language
Models. I also introduce a novel, performant, approach to estimating the
entropy of vector space, that allows this analysis to be applied to models
ranging in size from 1 million to 12 billion parameters.
  The experiments here work to shed light on how large-scale distributed models
of cognition learn, while allowing us to draw parallels between those systems
and their human analogs. They show how the structures of language and the
constraints that give rise to them in many ways parallel the kinds of
structures that drive performance of contemporary neural networks.

(2018) suggest that a critical batch size (CBS), below which training will not
substantially degrade loss, can be estimated based on the gradient noise scale
during training. While their method has been adopted in practice, e.g., when
training GPT-3, strong assumptions are required to justify gradient noise as a
proxy for the CBS, which makes it unclear whether their approach should be
trusted in practice, limiting its applicability. In this paper, we introduce a
simple, empirical approach to directly measure the CBS and show how the CBS
evolves over training. Applying our approach to the OLMo models, we find that
CBS is near 0 at initialization, increases rapidly at first, and then plateaus
as training progresses. Furthermore, we find that this trend holds across
different model sizes (1B and 7B), suggesting CBS from small training runs can
inform larger-scale training runs. Our findings about how the CBS changes over
training motivate batch size warmup as a natural way to reliably train language
models at large batch size: start the batch size small and increase it as the
CBS grows. To validate this claim, we use batch size warmup to train OLMo 1B to
slightly better loss than the original training run with 43% fewer gradient
steps. This shows how our framework can be applied to reliably train language
models at larger batch sizes, increasing data parallelism without compromising
performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多头部差分门控自注意力机制（M-DGSA），通过动态抑制注意力噪声来提高Transformer对噪声输入的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准自注意力对所有查询-键交互一视同仁，导致Transformer易受噪声输入影响。受生物神经侧抑制启发，作者提出了一种动态门控机制。

Method: M-DGSA将每个注意力头分为兴奋和抑制分支，通过双softmax映射和sigmoid门控动态融合，实现上下文感知的对比增强。

Result: 在视觉和语言基准测试中，M-DGSA显著优于标准Transformer、Vision Transformer和Differential Transformer。

Conclusion: M-DGSA为自注意力提供了一种基于侧抑制的动态门控机制，并在实验中表现出噪声鲁棒性和跨领域适用性。

Abstract: Transformers excel across a large variety of tasks but remain susceptible to
corrupted inputs, since standard self-attention treats all query-key
interactions uniformly. Inspired by lateral inhibition in biological neural
circuits and building on the recent use by the Differential Transformer's use
of two parallel softmax subtraction for noise cancellation, we propose
Multihead Differential Gated Self-Attention (M-DGSA) that learns per-head
input-dependent gating to dynamically suppress attention noise. Each head
splits into excitatory and inhibitory branches whose dual softmax maps are
fused by a sigmoid gate predicted from the token embedding, yielding a
context-aware contrast enhancement. M-DGSA integrates seamlessly into existing
Transformer stacks with minimal computational overhead. We evaluate on both
vision and language benchmarks, demonstrating consistent robustness gains over
vanilla Transformer, Vision Transformer, and Differential Transformer
baselines. Our contributions are (i) a novel input-dependent gating mechanism
for self-attention grounded in lateral inhibition, (ii) a principled synthesis
of biological contrast-enhancement and self-attention theory, and (iii)
comprehensive experiments demonstrating noise resilience and cross-domain
applicability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注高层次应用评估，缺乏对结构推理能力的独立测试，因此需要专门评估LLMs在这方面的能力。

Method: 引入DSR-Bench，包含20种数据结构、35种操作和4140个问题实例，采用自动化确定性评估流程。

Result: 指令调优模型在基本多属性和多跳推理上表现不佳，推理导向模型在复杂结构上仍脆弱，最佳模型平均得分仅47%。

Conclusion: LLMs在多维数据和自然语言任务描述上表现不佳，揭示了实际部署中的关键差距。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for real-world tasks
that fundamentally involve data manipulation. A core requirement across these
tasks is the ability to perform structural reasoning--that is, to understand
and reason about data relationships. For example, customer requests require a
temporal ordering, which can be represented by data structures such as queues.
However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on high-level, application-driven
evaluations without isolating this fundamental capability. To address this gap,
we introduce DSR-Bench, a novel benchmark evaluating LLMs' structural reasoning
capabilities through data structures, which provide interpretable
representations of data relationships. DSR-Bench includes 20 data structures,
35 operations, and 4,140 problem instances, organized hierarchically for
fine-grained analysis of reasoning limitations. Our evaluation pipeline is
fully automated and deterministic, eliminating subjective human or model-based
judgments. Its synthetic nature also ensures scalability and minimizes data
contamination risks. We benchmark nine state-of-the-art LLMs. Our analysis
shows that instruction-tuned models struggle with basic multi-attribute and
multi-hop reasoning. Furthermore, while reasoning-oriented models perform
better, they remain fragile on complex and hybrid structures, with the best
model achieving an average score of only 47% on the challenge subset.
Crucially, models often perform poorly on multi-dimensional data and natural
language task descriptions, highlighting a critical gap for real-world
deployment.

Abstract: Developing autonomous agents capable of mastering complex, multi-step tasks
in unpredictable, interactive environments presents a significant challenge.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise for planning, existing
approaches often rely on problematic internal knowledge or make unrealistic
environmental assumptions. Although recent work explores learning planning
knowledge, they still retain limitations due to partial reliance on external
knowledge or impractical setups. Indeed, prior research has largely overlooked
developing agents capable of acquiring planning knowledge from scratch,
directly in realistic settings. While realizing this capability is necessary,
it presents significant challenges, primarily achieving robustness given the
substantial risk of incorporating LLMs' inaccurate knowledge. Moreover,
efficiency is crucial for practicality as learning can demand prohibitive
exploration. In response, we introduce Robust and Efficient Planning for
Open-world Agents (REPOA), a novel framework designed to tackle these issues.
REPOA features three key components: adaptive dependency learning and
fine-grained failure-aware operation memory to enhance robustness to knowledge
inaccuracies, and difficulty-based exploration to improve learning efficiency.
Our evaluation in two established open-world testbeds demonstrates REPOA's
robust and efficient planning, showcasing its capability to successfully obtain
challenging late-game items that were beyond the reach of prior approaches.

Motivation: 长上下文处理是LLM应用的关键需求，但自注意力模块的二次时间复杂度成为预填充阶段的瓶颈。现有稀疏注意力方法虽加速计算，但粗粒度检查导致模型精度损失。

Result: 在长上下文基准测试中，SALE在Llama-3.1-8B上对超过64K的序列实现至少3.36倍加速，同时保持模型质量。

Conclusion: SALE无需参数训练，可无缝集成到现有系统，在精度和效率的权衡上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Many advanced Large Language Model (LLM) applications require long-context
processing, but the self-attention module becomes a bottleneck during the
prefilling stage of inference due to its quadratic time complexity with respect
to sequence length. Existing sparse attention methods accelerate attention
computation by skipping less significant regions of the attention map. However,
these approaches typically perform coarse-grained inspection of the attention
map, rendering considerable loss in model accuracy. In this paper, we propose
SALE, a fine-grained sparse attention method that accelerates the long-context
prefilling stage of LLM with negligible loss in model accuracy. SALE achieves
fast and accurate fine-grained attention weight estimation through 4-bit
quantized query-key products, followed by block-sparse attention to accelerate
prefilling computations. For importance evaluation for query-key pairs, we
adopt our Relative Attention Score metric, which offers significantly higher
efficiency within our framework. We implement a custom CUDA kernel optimized
for our approach for hardware efficiency, reducing the additional overhead to
approximately 11% of the full attention latency. Notably, SALE requires no
parameter training and can be seamlessly integrated into existing systems with
trivial code modifications. Experiments on long-context benchmarks demonstrate
that our method outperforms existing approaches in accuracy-efficiency
trade-offs, achieving at least 3.36x speedups on Llama-3.1-8B for sequences
longer than 64K while maintaining model quality.

Conclusion: CodeV-R1框架在EDA领域表现出色，为LLM和EDA研究提供了新工具和数据。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained via reinforcement learning with
verifiable reward (RLVR) have achieved breakthroughs on tasks with explicit,
automatable verification, such as software programming and mathematical
problems. Extending RLVR to electronic design automation (EDA), especially
automatically generating hardware description languages (HDLs) like Verilog
from natural-language (NL) specifications, however, poses three key challenges:
the lack of automated and accurate verification environments, the scarcity of
high-quality NL-code pairs, and the prohibitive computation cost of RLVR. To
this end, we introduce CodeV-R1, an RLVR framework for training Verilog
generation LLMs. First, we develop a rule-based testbench generator that
performs robust equivalence checking against golden references. Second, we
propose a round-trip data synthesis method that pairs open-source Verilog
snippets with LLM-generated NL descriptions, verifies code-NL-code consistency
via the generated testbench, and filters out inequivalent examples to yield a
high-quality dataset. Third, we employ a two-stage "distill-then-RL" training
pipeline: distillation for the cold start of reasoning abilities, followed by
adaptive DAPO, our novel RLVR algorithm that can reduce training cost by
adaptively adjusting sampling rate. The resulting model, CodeV-R1-7B, achieves
68.6% and 72.9% pass@1 on VerilogEval v2 and RTLLM v1.1, respectively,
surpassing prior state-of-the-art by 12~20%, while matching or even exceeding
the performance of 671B DeepSeek-R1. We will release our model, training
pipeline, and dataset to facilitate research in EDA and LLM communities.

an SLM against prompting LLMs on the task of generating low-code workflows in
JSON form. We observe that while a good prompt can yield reasonable results,
fine-tuning improves quality by 10% on average. We also perform systematic

Abstract: Model editing techniques, particularly task arithmetic using task vectors,
have shown promise in efficiently modifying pre-trained models through
arithmetic operations like task addition and negation. Despite computational
advantages, these methods may inadvertently affect model fairness, creating
risks in sensitive applications like hate speech detection. However, the
fairness implications of task arithmetic remain largely unexplored, presenting
a critical gap in the existing literature. We systematically examine how
manipulating task vectors affects fairness metrics, including Demographic
Parity and Equalized Odds. To rigorously assess these effects, we benchmark
task arithmetic against full fine-tuning, a costly but widely used baseline,
and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a prevalent parameter-efficient fine-tuning
method. Additionally, we explore merging task vectors from models fine-tuned on
demographic subgroups vulnerable to hate speech, investigating whether fairness
outcomes can be controlled by adjusting task vector coefficients, potentially
enabling tailored model behavior. Our results offer novel insights into the
fairness implications of model editing and establish a foundation for
fairness-aware and responsible model editing practices.

Conclusion: GradPower是一种高效且通用的梯度变换方法，理论分析揭示了其机制与梯度噪声的关系。

Abstract: We propose GradPower, a lightweight gradient-transformation technique for
accelerating language model pre-training. Given a gradient vector $g=(g_i)_i$,
GradPower first applies the elementwise sign-power transformation:
$\varphi_p(g)=({\rm sign}(g_i)|g_i|^p)_{i}$ for a fixed $p>0$, and then feeds
the transformed gradient into a base optimizer. Notably, GradPower requires
only a single-line code change and no modifications to the base optimizer's
internal logic, including the hyperparameters. When applied to Adam (termed
AdamPower), GradPower consistently achieves lower terminal loss across diverse
architectures (LLaMA, Qwen2MoE), parameter scales (66M to 2B), datasets (C4,
OpenWebText), and learning-rate schedules (cosine, warmup-stable-decay). The
most pronounced gains are observed when training modern mixture-of-experts
models with warmup-stable-decay schedules. GradPower also integrates seamlessly
with other state-of-the-art optimizers, such as Muon, yielding further
improvements. Finally, we provide theoretical analyses that reveal the
underlying mechanism of GradPower and highlights the influence of gradient
noise.

Conclusion: W2SG现象在特定条件下更易出现，反向交叉熵损失是一种有效的优化方法。

Abstract: Weak-to-strong generalization (W2SG) refers to the phenomenon where a strong
student model, trained on a dataset labeled by a weak teacher, ultimately
outperforms the teacher on the target task. Recent studies attribute this
performance gain to the prediction misfit between the student and teacher
models. In this work, we theoretically investigate the emergence of W2SG
through a generalized bias-variance decomposition of Bregman divergence.
Specifically, we show that the expected population risk gap between the student
and teacher is quantified by the expected misfit between the two models. While
this aligns with previous results, our analysis removes several restrictive
assumptions, most notably, the convexity of the student's hypothesis class,
required in earlier works. Moreover, we show that W2SG is more likely to emerge
when the student model approximates its posterior mean teacher, rather than
mimicking an individual teacher. Using a concrete example, we demonstrate that
if the student model has significantly larger capacity than the teacher, it can
indeed converge to this posterior mean. Our analysis also suggests that
avoiding overfitting to the teacher's supervision and reducing the entropy of
student's prediction further facilitate W2SG. In addition, we show that the
reverse cross-entropy loss, unlike the standard forward cross-entropy, is less
sensitive to the predictive uncertainty of the teacher. Finally, we empirically
verify our theoretical insights and demonstrate that incorporating the reverse
cross-entropy loss consistently improves student performance.

Conclusion: ReCalKV为高效长上下文推理提供了有效的KV缓存压缩方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance, yet their
capability on long-context reasoning is often constrained by the excessive
memory required to store the Key-Value (KV) cache. This makes KV cache
compression an essential step toward enabling efficient long-context reasoning.
Recent methods have explored reducing the hidden dimensions of the KV cache,
but many introduce additional computation through projection layers or suffer
from significant performance degradation under high compression ratios. To
address these challenges, we propose ReCalKV, a post-training KV cache
compression method that reduces the hidden dimensions of the KV cache. We
develop distinct compression strategies for Keys and Values based on their
different roles and varying importance in the attention mechanism. For Keys, we
propose Head-wise Similarity-aware Reordering (HSR), which clusters similar
heads and applies grouped SVD to the key projection matrix, reducing additional
computation while preserving accuracy. For Values, we propose Offline
Calibration and Matrix Fusion (OCMF) to preserve accuracy without extra
computational overhead. Experiments show that ReCalKV outperforms existing
low-rank compression methods, achieving high compression ratios with minimal
performance loss. Code is available at:

Abstract: Large language models are typically trained on datasets collected from the
web, which may inadvertently contain harmful or sensitive personal information.
To address growing privacy concerns, unlearning methods have been proposed to
remove the influence of specific data from trained models. Of these, exact
unlearning -- which retrains the model from scratch without the target data --
is widely regarded the gold standard, believed to be robust against
privacy-related attacks. In this paper, we challenge this assumption by
introducing a novel data extraction attack that compromises even exact
unlearning. Our method leverages both the pre- and post-unlearning models: by
guiding the post-unlearning model using signals from the pre-unlearning model,
we uncover patterns that reflect the removed data distribution. Combining model
guidance with a token filtering strategy, our attack significantly improves
extraction success rates -- doubling performance in some cases -- across common
benchmarks such as MUSE, TOFU, and WMDP. Furthermore, we demonstrate our
attack's effectiveness on a simulated medical diagnosis dataset to highlight
real-world privacy risks associated with exact unlearning. In light of our
findings, which suggest that unlearning may, in a contradictory way, increase
the risk of privacy leakage, we advocate for evaluation of unlearning methods
to consider broader threat models that account not only for post-unlearning
models but also for adversarial access to prior checkpoints.

Conclusion: HierarchicalTopK填补了SAE设计中灵活性与可解释性之间的重要空白。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have proven to be powerful tools for interpreting
neural networks by decomposing hidden representations into disentangled,
interpretable features via sparsity constraints. However, conventional SAEs are
constrained by the fixed sparsity level chosen during training; meeting
different sparsity requirements therefore demands separate models and increases
the computational footprint during both training and evaluation. We introduce a
novel training objective, \emph{HierarchicalTopK}, which trains a single SAE to
optimise reconstructions across multiple sparsity levels simultaneously.
Experiments with Gemma-2 2B demonstrate that our approach achieves
Pareto-optimal trade-offs between sparsity and explained variance,
outperforming traditional SAEs trained at individual sparsity levels. Further
analysis shows that HierarchicalTopK preserves high interpretability scores
even at higher sparsity. The proposed objective thus closes an important gap
between flexibility and interpretability in SAE design.

Abstract: Controlling multiple behavioral attributes in large language models (LLMs) at

a unified and flexible approach that trains a single non-linear multi-label
classifier on hidden activations and computes intervention directions via
gradients at inference time. This avoids linearity assumptions, removes the
need for storing and tuning separate attribute vectors, and allows dynamic
composition of behaviors without retraining. To evaluate our method, we propose
two new benchmarks, ToneBank and DebateMix, targeting compositional behavioral
control. Empirical results across 3 model families, validated by both
activation-based classifiers and LLM-based judges, demonstrate that K-Steering
outperforms strong baselines in accurately steering multiple behaviors.

Abstract: Optimizing policies based on human preferences is key to aligning language

preference optimization, such as direct preference optimization. Conventional

symmetric losses, known for their robustness to label noise in classification,
leading to our Symmetric Preference Optimization (SymPO) method. We prove that
symmetric losses enable successful policy optimization even under noisy labels,
as the resulting reward remains rank-preserving -- a property sufficient for
policy improvement. Experiments on synthetic and real-world tasks demonstrate
the effectiveness of SymPO.

Conclusion: 因果感知LLMs能更准确地理解环境并做出高效决策。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in decision-making
due to the vast amount of knowledge stored within the models. However, these
pre-trained models are prone to lack reasoning abilities and are difficult to
adapt to new environments, further hindering their application to complex
real-world tasks. To address these challenges, inspired by the human cognitive
process, we propose Causal-aware LLMs, which integrate the structural causal
model (SCM) into the decision-making process to model, update, and utilize
structured knowledge of the environment in a ``learning-adapting-acting"
paradigm. Specifically, in the learning stage, we first utilize an LLM to
extract the environment-specific causal entities and their causal relations to
initialize a structured causal model of the environment. Subsequently,in the
adapting stage, we update the structured causal model through external feedback
about the environment, via an idea of causal intervention. Finally, in the
acting stage, Causal-aware LLMs exploit structured causal knowledge for more
efficient policy-making through the reinforcement learning agent. The above
processes are performed iteratively to learn causal knowledge, ultimately
enabling the causal-aware LLMs to achieve a more accurate understanding of the
environment and make more efficient decisions. Experimental results across 22
diverse tasks within the open-world game ``Crafter" validate the effectiveness
of our proposed method.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced and are increasingly
capable of tackling complex scientific problems, including those in physics.
Despite this progress, current LLMs often fail to emulate the concise,
principle-based reasoning characteristic of human experts, instead generating
lengthy and opaque solutions. This discrepancy highlights a crucial gap in
their ability to apply core physical principles for efficient and interpretable
problem solving. To systematically investigate this limitation, we introduce
PhySense, a novel principle-based physics reasoning benchmark designed to be
easily solvable by experts using guiding principles, yet deceptively difficult
for LLMs without principle-first reasoning. Our evaluation across multiple
state-of-the-art LLMs and prompt types reveals a consistent failure to align
with expert-like reasoning paths, providing insights for developing AI systems
with efficient, robust and interpretable principle-based scientific reasoning.

Conclusion: 蒸馏模型存在重大安全隐患，需开发专门的安全防护策略。

Abstract: Model distillation has become essential for creating smaller, deployable
language models that retain larger system capabilities. However, widespread
deployment raises concerns about resilience to adversarial manipulation. This
paper investigates vulnerability of distilled models to adversarial injection
of biased content during training. We demonstrate that adversaries can inject
subtle biases into teacher models through minimal data poisoning, which
propagates to student models and becomes significantly amplified. We propose
two propagation modes: Untargeted Propagation, where bias affects multiple
tasks, and Targeted Propagation, focusing on specific tasks while maintaining
normal behavior elsewhere. With only 25 poisoned samples (0.25% poisoning
rate), student models generate biased responses 76.9% of the time in targeted
scenarios - higher than 69.4% in teacher models. For untargeted propagation,
adversarial bias appears 6x-29x more frequently in student models on unseen
tasks. We validate findings across six bias types (targeted advertisements,
phishing links, narrative manipulations, insecure coding practices), various
distillation methods, and different modalities spanning text and code
generation. Our evaluation reveals shortcomings in current defenses -
perplexity filtering, bias detection systems, and LLM-based autorater
frameworks - against these attacks. Results expose significant security
vulnerabilities in distilled models, highlighting need for specialized
safeguards. We propose practical design principles for building effective
adversarial bias mitigation strategies.

Abstract: Training data mixtures greatly impact the generalization performance of large
language models. Existing domain reweighting methods often rely on costly
weight computations and require retraining when new data is introduced. To this
end, we introduce a flexible and efficient data mixing framework, Chameleon,
that employs leverage scores to quantify domain importance within a learned
embedding space. We first construct a domain affinity matrix over domain
embeddings. The induced leverage scores determine a mixture that upweights
domains sharing common representations in embedding space. This formulation
allows direct transfer to new data by computing the new domain embeddings. In
experiments, we demonstrate improvements over three key scenarios: (i) our
computed weights improve performance on pretraining domains with a fraction of
the compute of existing methods; (ii) Chameleon can adapt to data changes
without proxy retraining, boosting few-shot reasoning accuracies when
transferred to new data; (iii) our method enables efficient domain reweighting
in finetuning, consistently improving test perplexity on all finetuning domains
over uniform mixture. Our code is available at

Conclusion: REDI通过有效利用正负推理数据，为小模型在离线环境下的推理能力提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in model distillation demonstrate that data from advanced
reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI's o1) can effectively transfer
complex reasoning abilities to smaller, efficient student models. However,
standard practices employ rejection sampling, discarding incorrect reasoning
examples -- valuable, yet often underutilized data. This paper addresses the
critical question: How can both positive and negative distilled reasoning
traces be effectively leveraged to maximize LLM reasoning performance in an
offline setting? To this end, We propose Reinforcement Distillation (REDI), a
two-stage framework. Stage 1 learns from positive traces via Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT). Stage 2 further refines the model using both positive and
negative traces through our proposed REDI objective. This novel objective is a
simple, reference-free loss function that outperforms established methods like
DPO and SimPO in this distillation context. Our empirical evaluations
demonstrate REDI's superiority over baseline Rejection Sampling SFT or SFT
combined with DPO/SimPO on mathematical reasoning tasks. Notably, the
Qwen-REDI-1.5B model, post-trained on just 131k positive and negative examples
from the open Open-R1 dataset, achieves an 83.1% score on MATH-500 (pass@1).
Its performance matches or surpasses that of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B (a
model post-trained on 800k proprietary data) across various mathematical
reasoning benchmarks, establishing a new state-of-the-art for 1.5B models
post-trained offline with openly available data.

Conclusion: 在自由生成任务中，steering vectors的控制强度与文本质量之间存在权衡，结合提示方法可优化效果。

Abstract: Steering vectors are a lightweight method for controlling text properties by
adding a learned bias to language model activations at inference time. So far,
steering vectors have predominantly been evaluated in multiple-choice settings,
while their effectiveness in free-form generation tasks remains understudied.
Moving "Beyond Multiple Choice," we thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of
steering vectors in adaptively controlling topical focus, sentiment, toxicity,
and readability in abstractive summaries of the NEWTS dataset. We find that
steering effectively controls the targeted summary properties, but high
steering strengths consistently degrade both intrinsic and extrinsic text
quality. Compared to steering, prompting offers weaker control, while
preserving text quality. Combining steering and prompting yields the strongest
control over text properties and offers the most favorable efficacy-quality
trade-off at moderate steering strengths. Our results underscore the practical
trade-off between control strength and text quality preservation when applying
steering vectors to free-form generation tasks.

Abstract: Finding the right initialisation for neural networks is crucial to ensure
smooth training and good performance. In transformers, the wrong initialisation
can lead to one of two failure modes of self-attention layers: rank collapse,
where all tokens collapse into similar representations, and entropy collapse,
where highly concentrated attention scores lead to training instability. While
the right initialisation has been extensively studied in feed-forward networks,
an exact description of signal propagation through a full transformer block has
so far been lacking. Here, we provide an analytical theory of signal
propagation through vanilla transformer blocks with self-attention layers,
layer normalisation, skip connections and ReLU MLP. To treat the self-attention
layer, we draw on a formal parallel with the Random Energy Model from
statistical physics. We identify and characterise two regimes governed by the
variance of the query and key initialisations: a low-variance regime, where we
recover the known rank collapse behaviour; and a previously unexplored
high-variance regime, where signal is preserved but \textit{entropy collapse}
occurs. In the low-variance regime, we calculate the critical strength for the
residual connection to ensure signal propagation. Our theory yields
trainability diagrams that identify the correct choice of initialisation
hyper-parameters for a given architecture. Experiments with BERT-style models
trained on TinyStories validate our predictions. Our theoretical framework
gives a unified perspective on the two failure modes of self-attention and
gives quantitative predictions on the scale of both weights and residual
connections that guarantees smooth training.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities across a
spectrum of tasks in financial services, including report generation, chatbots,
sentiment analysis, regulatory compliance, investment advisory, financial
knowledge retrieval, and summarization. However, their intrinsic complexity and
lack of transparency pose significant challenges, especially in the highly
regulated financial sector, where interpretability, fairness, and
accountability are critical. As far as we are aware, this paper presents the
first application in the finance domain of understanding and utilizing the
inner workings of LLMs through mechanistic interpretability, addressing the
pressing need for transparency and control in AI systems. Mechanistic
interpretability is the most intuitive and transparent way to understand LLM
behavior by reverse-engineering their internal workings. By dissecting the
activations and circuits within these models, it provides insights into how
specific features or components influence predictions - making it possible not
only to observe but also to modify model behavior. In this paper, we explore
the theoretical aspects of mechanistic interpretability and demonstrate its
practical relevance through a range of financial use cases and experiments,
including applications in trading strategies, sentiment analysis, bias, and
hallucination detection. While not yet widely adopted, mechanistic
interpretability is expected to become increasingly vital as adoption of LLMs
increases. Advanced interpretability tools can ensure AI systems remain
ethical, transparent, and aligned with evolving financial regulations. In this
paper, we have put special emphasis on how these techniques can help unlock
interpretability requirements for regulatory and compliance purposes -
addressing both current needs and anticipating future expectations from
financial regulators globally.

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展且高效，适用于任意N:M稀疏性，提升了训练效率。

Abstract: Network pruning reduces the computational requirements of large neural
networks, with N:M sparsity -- retaining only N out of every M consecutive
weights -- offering a compelling balance between compressed model quality and
hardware acceleration. However, N:M sparsity only accelerates forward-pass
computations, as N:M patterns are not preserved during matrix transposition,
limiting efficiency during training where both passes are computationally
intensive. While transposable N:M sparsity has been proposed to address this
limitation, existing methods for finding transposable N:M sparse masks either
fail to scale to large models or are restricted to M=4 which results in
suboptimal compression-accuracy trade-off. We introduce an efficient solver for
transposable N:M masks that scales to billion-parameter models. We formulate
mask generation as optimal transport problems and solve through entropy
regularization and Dykstra's algorithm, followed by a rounding procedure. Our
tensor-based implementation exploits GPU parallelism, achieving up to 100x
speedup with only 1-10% error compared to existing methods. Our approach can be
integrated with layer-wise N:M pruning frameworks including Wanda, SparseGPT
and ALPS to produce transposable N:M sparse models with arbitrary N:M values.
Experiments show that LLaMA3.2-8B with transposable 16:32 sparsity maintains
performance close to its standard N:M counterpart and outperforms standard 2:4
sparse model, showing the practical value of our approach.

Conclusion: GraMa为神经元学习能力提供了更有效的度量，ReGraMa方法在提升RL代理性能方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents frequently suffer from neuronal
activity loss, which impairs their ability to adapt to new data and learn
continually. A common method to quantify and address this issue is the
tau-dormant neuron ratio, which uses activation statistics to measure the
expressive ability of neurons. While effective for simple MLP-based agents,
this approach loses statistical power in more complex architectures. To address
this, we argue that in advanced RL agents, maintaining a neuron's learning
capacity, its ability to adapt via gradient updates, is more critical than
preserving its expressive ability. Based on this insight, we shift the
statistical objective from activations to gradients, and introduce GraMa
(Gradient Magnitude Neural Activity Metric), a lightweight,
architecture-agnostic metric for quantifying neuron-level learning capacity. We
show that GraMa effectively reveals persistent neuron inactivity across diverse
architectures, including residual networks, diffusion models, and agents with
varied activation functions. Moreover, resetting neurons guided by GraMa
(ReGraMa) consistently improves learning performance across multiple deep RL
algorithms and benchmarks, such as MuJoCo and the DeepMind Control Suite.

Abstract: Vision foundation models pre-trained on massive data encode rich
representations of real-world concepts, which can be adapted to downstream
tasks by fine-tuning. However, fine-tuning foundation models on one task often
leads to the issue of concept forgetting on other tasks. Recent methods of
robust fine-tuning aim to mitigate forgetting of prior knowledge without
affecting the fine-tuning performance. Knowledge is often preserved by matching
the original and fine-tuned model weights or feature pairs. However, such
point-wise matching can be too strong, without explicit awareness of the
feature neighborhood structures that encode rich knowledge as well. We propose
a novel regularization method Proxy-FDA that explicitly preserves the
structural knowledge in feature space. Proxy-FDA performs Feature Distribution
Alignment (using nearest neighbor graphs) between the pre-trained and
fine-tuned feature spaces, and the alignment is further improved by informative
proxies that are generated dynamically to increase data diversity. Experiments
show that Proxy-FDA significantly reduces concept forgetting during
fine-tuning, and we find a strong correlation between forgetting and a
distributional distance metric (in comparison to L2 distance). We further
demonstrate Proxy-FDA's benefits in various fine-tuning settings (end-to-end,
few-shot and continual tuning) and across different tasks like image
classification, captioning and VQA.

proposed variant of dictionary learning that takes the dictionary to be a set
of data points from the activation distribution and reconstructs them with
gradient pursuit. We apply Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and ITDA to a large
text-to-image diffusion model, Flux 1, and consider the interpretability of
embeddings of both by introducing a visual automated interpretation pipeline.
We find that SAEs accurately reconstruct residual stream embeddings and beat
MLP neurons on interpretability. We are able to use SAE features to steer image

Abstract: Despite recent advancements in offline multi-task reinforcement learning

architecture, most approaches focus on a limited number of tasks, with scaling
to extremely massive tasks remaining a formidable challenge. In this paper, we
first revisit the key impact of task numbers on current MTRL method, and
further reveal that naively expanding the parameters proves insufficient to
counteract the performance degradation as the number of tasks escalates.
Building upon these insights, we propose M3DT, a novel mixture-of-experts (MoE)
framework that tackles task scalability by further unlocking the model's
parameter scalability. Specifically, we enhance both the architecture and the
optimization of the agent, where we strengthen the Decision Transformer (DT)
backbone with MoE to reduce task load on parameter subsets, and introduce a
three-stage training mechanism to facilitate efficient training with optimal
performance. Experimental results show that, by increasing the number of
experts, M3DT not only consistently enhances its performance as model expansion
on the fixed task numbers, but also exhibits remarkable task scalability,
successfully extending to 160 tasks with superior performance.

Abstract: Vision-language models like CLIP have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot
capabilities in classification and retrieval. However, these models often
struggle with compositional reasoning - the ability to understand the
relationships between concepts. A recent benchmark, SugarCrepe++, reveals that
previous works on improving compositionality have mainly improved lexical
sensitivity but neglected semantic understanding. In addition, downstream
retrieval performance often deteriorates, although one would expect that
improving compositionality should enhance retrieval. In this work, we introduce
CLIC (Compositionally-aware Learning in CLIP), a fine-tuning method based on a
novel training technique combining multiple images and their associated
captions. CLIC improves compositionality across architectures as well as
differently pre-trained CLIP models, both in terms of lexical and semantic
understanding, and achieves consistent gains in retrieval performance. This
even applies to the recent CLIPS, which achieves SOTA retrieval performance.
Nevertheless, the short fine-tuning with CLIC leads to an improvement in
retrieval and to the best compositional CLIP model on SugarCrepe++. All our

quantifying their influence on the model's prediction. However, evaluating
these methods empirically remains a significant challenge. To bypass this
shortcoming, several prior works have proposed axiomatic frameworks that any
feature attribution method should satisfy. In this work, we argue that such
axioms are often too restrictive, and propose in response a new feature
attribution framework, built from the ground up. Rather than imposing axioms,
we start by defining attributions for the simplest possible models, i.e.,
indicator functions, and use these as building blocks for more complex models.
We then show that one recovers several existing attribution methods, depending
on the choice of atomic attribution. Subsequently, we derive closed-form
expressions for attribution of deep ReLU networks, and take a step toward the
optimization of evaluation metrics with respect to feature attributions.

Conclusion: AFLoRA为异构环境中的LLM高效微调提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning has emerged as a promising approach to adapt foundation
models to downstream tasks using decentralized data. However, real-world
deployment remains challenging due to the high computational and communication
demands of fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) on clients with data and
system resources that are heterogeneous and constrained. In such settings, the
global model's performance is often bottlenecked by the weakest clients and
further degraded by the non-IID nature of local data. Although existing methods
leverage parameter-efficient techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to
reduce communication and computation overhead, they often fail to
simultaneously ensure accurate aggregation of low-rank updates and maintain low
system costs, thereby hindering overall performance. To address these
challenges, we propose AFLoRA, an adaptive and lightweight federated
fine-tuning framework for LLMs. AFLoRA decouples shared and client-specific
updates to reduce overhead and improve aggregation accuracy, incorporates
diagonal matrix-based rank pruning to better utilize local resources, and
employs rank-aware aggregation with public data refinement to strengthen
generalization under data heterogeneity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
AFLoRA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and efficiency,
providing a practical solution for efficient LLM adaptation in heterogeneous
environments in the real world.

Conclusion: NCM方法通过利用不变数据对，显著提升了模型鲁棒性，尤其在数据对质量高时效果更佳。

Abstract: Spurious correlations can cause model performance to degrade in new
environments. Prior causality-inspired works aim to learn invariant
representations (e.g., IRM) but typically underperform empirical risk
minimization (ERM). Recent alternatives improve robustness by leveraging
test-time data, but such data may be unavailable in practice. To address these
issues, we take a data-centric approach by leveraging invariant data pairs,
pairs of samples that would have the same prediction with the optimally robust
classifier. We prove that certain counterfactual pairs will naturally satisfy
this invariance property and introduce noisy counterfactual matching (NCM), a
simple constraint-based method for leveraging invariant pairs for enhanced
robustness, even with a small set of noisy pairs-in the ideal case, each pair
can eliminate one spurious feature. For linear causal models, we prove that the
test domain error can be upper bounded by the in-domain error and a term that
depends on the counterfactuals' diversity and quality. We validate on a
synthetic dataset and demonstrate on real-world benchmarks that linear probing
on a pretrained backbone improves robustness.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning in real-world applications often involves

Policy Gradient (DATD3), a novel actor-critic algorithm that employs depthwise

Abstract: Deep neural networks have been increasingly used in safety-critical
applications such as medical diagnosis and autonomous driving. However, many
studies suggest that they are prone to being poorly calibrated and have a
propensity for overconfidence, which may have disastrous consequences. In this
paper, unlike standard training such as stochastic gradient descent, we show
that the recently proposed sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) counteracts this
tendency towards overconfidence. The theoretical analysis suggests that SAM
allows us to learn models that are already well-calibrated by implicitly
maximizing the entropy of the predictive distribution. Inspired by this
finding, we further propose a variant of SAM, coined as CSAM, to ameliorate
model calibration. Extensive experiments on various datasets, including
ImageNet-1K, demonstrate the benefits of SAM in reducing calibration error.
Meanwhile, CSAM performs even better than SAM and consistently achieves lower
calibration error than other approaches

Conclusion: ADG为离线RL中的数据损坏问题提供了通用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world datasets collected from sensors or human inputs are prone to noise
and errors, posing significant challenges for applying offline reinforcement
learning (RL). While existing methods have made progress in addressing
corrupted actions and rewards, they remain insufficient for handling corruption
in high-dimensional state spaces and for cases where multiple elements in the
dataset are corrupted simultaneously. Diffusion models, known for their strong
denoising capabilities, offer a promising direction for this problem-but their
tendency to overfit noisy samples limits their direct applicability. To
overcome this, we propose Ambient Diffusion-Guided Dataset Recovery (ADG), a
novel approach that pioneers the use of diffusion models to tackle data
corruption in offline RL. First, we introduce Ambient Denoising Diffusion
Probabilistic Models (DDPM) from approximated distributions, which enable
learning on partially corrupted datasets with theoretical guarantees. Second,
we use the noise-prediction property of Ambient DDPM to distinguish between
clean and corrupted data, and then use the clean subset to train a standard
DDPM. Third, we employ the trained standard DDPM to refine the previously
identified corrupted data, enhancing data quality for subsequent offline RL
training. A notable strength of ADG is its versatility-it can be seamlessly
integrated with any offline RL algorithm. Experiments on a range of benchmarks,
including MuJoCo, Kitchen, and Adroit, demonstrate that ADG effectively
mitigates the impact of corrupted data and improves the robustness of offline
RL under various noise settings, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: LaCT为长上下文建模和测试时间训练提供了高效解决方案，有望推动相关领域研究。

Abstract: Test-Time Training (TTT) models context dependencies by adapting part of the
model's weights (referred to as fast weights) during inference. This fast
weight, akin to recurrent states in RNNs, stores temporary memories of past
tokens in the current sequence. Existing TTT methods struggled to show
effectiveness in handling long-context data, due to their inefficiency on
modern GPUs. The TTT layers in many of these approaches operate with extremely
low FLOPs utilization (often <5%) because they deliberately apply small online
minibatch sizes (e.g., updating fast weights every 16 or 64 tokens). Moreover,
a small minibatch implies fine-grained block-wise causal dependencies in the
data, unsuitable for data beyond 1D ordered sequences, like sets or
N-dimensional grids such as images or videos. In contrast, we pursue the
opposite direction by using an extremely large chunk update, ranging from 2K to
1M tokens across tasks of varying modalities, which we refer to as Large Chunk
Test-Time Training (LaCT). It improves hardware utilization by orders of
magnitude, and more importantly, facilitates scaling of nonlinear state size
(up to 40% of model parameters), hence substantially improving state capacity,
all without requiring cumbersome and error-prone kernel implementations. It
also allows easy integration of sophisticated optimizers, e.g. Muon for online
updates. We validate our approach across diverse modalities and tasks,
including novel view synthesis with image set, language models, and
auto-regressive video diffusion. Our approach can scale up to 14B-parameter AR
video diffusion model on sequences up to 56K tokens. In our longest sequence
experiment, we perform novel view synthesis with 1 million context length. We
hope this work will inspire and accelerate new research in the field of
long-context modeling and test-time training. Website:

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) memorize a vast amount of prior knowledge from
the Internet that help them on downstream tasks but also may notoriously sway
their outputs towards wrong or biased answers. In this work, we test how the
knowledge about popular subjects hurt the accuracy of vision language models
(VLMs) on standard, objective visual tasks of counting and identification. We
find that state-of-the-art VLMs are strongly biased (e.g, unable to recognize a
fourth stripe has been added to a 3-stripe Adidas logo) scoring an average of
17.05% accuracy in counting (e.g., counting stripes in an Adidas-like logo)
across 7 diverse domains from animals, logos, chess, board games, optical
illusions, to patterned grids. Insert text (e.g., "Adidas") describing the
subject name into the counterfactual image further decreases VLM accuracy. The
biases in VLMs are so strong that instructing them to double-check their
results or rely exclusively on image details to answer improves counting
accuracy by only +2 points, on average. Our work presents an interesting
failure mode in VLMs and an automated framework for testing VLM biases. Code

Abstract: Transformer-based models have gained increasing attention in time series
research, driving interest in Large Language Models (LLMs) and foundation
models for time series analysis. As the field moves toward multi-modality,
Large Vision Models (LVMs) are emerging as a promising direction. In the past,
the effectiveness of Transformer and LLMs in time series has been debated. When
it comes to LVMs, a similar question arises: are LVMs truely useful for time
series analysis? To address it, we design and conduct the first principled
study involving 4 LVMs, 8 imaging methods, 18 datasets and 26 baselines across
both high-level (classification) and low-level (forecasting) tasks, with
extensive ablation analysis. Our findings indicate LVMs are indeed useful for
time series classification but face challenges in forecasting. Although
effective, the contemporary best LVM forecasters are limited to specific types
of LVMs and imaging methods, exhibit a bias toward forecasting periods, and
have limited ability to utilize long look-back windows. We hope our findings

Abstract: Deep neural networks often develop spurious bias, reliance on correlations
between non-essential features and classes for predictions. For example, a
model may identify objects based on frequently co-occurring backgrounds rather
than intrinsic features, resulting in degraded performance on data lacking
these correlations. Existing mitigation approaches typically depend on external
annotations of spurious correlations, which may be difficult to obtain and are
not relevant to the spurious bias in a model. In this paper, we take a step
towards self-guided mitigation of spurious bias by proposing NeuronTune, a post
hoc method that directly intervenes in a model's internal decision process. Our
method probes in a model's latent embedding space to identify and regulate
neurons that lead to spurious prediction behaviors. We theoretically justify
our approach and show that it brings the model closer to an unbiased one.
Unlike previous methods, NeuronTune operates without requiring spurious
correlation annotations, making it a practical and effective tool for improving
model robustness. Experiments across different architectures and data
modalities demonstrate that our method significantly mitigates spurious bias in
a self-guided way.

Specifically, we exploit the one-to-one correspondence between depth-2 discrete
fully connected networks and disjunctive normal form (DNF) formulas by training
on Boolean functions. Under a Monte Carlo learning algorithm, our model
exhibits predictable training dynamics and the emergence of interpretable
features. This framework allows us to trace, in detail, how inductive bias and

Abstract: Mixture-of-experts networks (MoEs) have demonstrated remarkable efficiency in
modern deep learning. Despite their empirical success, the theoretical
foundations underlying their ability to model complex tasks remain poorly
understood. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of the expressive power
of MoEs in modeling complex tasks with two common structural priors:
low-dimensionality and sparsity. For shallow MoEs, we prove that they can
efficiently approximate functions supported on low-dimensional manifolds,
overcoming the curse of dimensionality. For deep MoEs, we show that
$\cO(L)$-layer MoEs with $E$ experts per layer can approximate piecewise
functions comprising $E^L$ pieces with compositional sparsity, i.e., they can
exhibit an exponential number of structured tasks. Our analysis reveals the
roles of critical architectural components and hyperparameters in MoEs,
including the gating mechanism, expert networks, the number of experts, and the
number of layers, and offers natural suggestions for MoE variants.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have showcased significant

identified critical issues specific to their Swift components, making them
insufficient or even irrelevant for assessing LLM coding capabilities on Swift.
Unlike these existing approaches, which prioritize rapid scaling and
generalization by automatically translating Python-centric benchmarks with
LLMs, we adopt a quality-over-quantity methodology. We present SwiftEval, the
first Swift-oriented benchmark consisting of 28 carefully hand-crafted
problems, and evaluate 44 popular Code LLMs on it. Our results show significant

Conclusion: GFM是一种轻量级模块化增强方法，可有效提升现有流匹配架构的性能。

Abstract: Flow matching casts sample generation as learning a continuous-time velocity
field that transports noise to data. Existing flow matching networks typically
predict each point's velocity independently, considering only its location and
time along its flow trajectory, and ignoring neighboring points. However, this
pointwise approach may overlook correlations between points along the
generation trajectory that could enhance velocity predictions, thereby
improving downstream generation quality. To address this, we propose Graph Flow
Matching (GFM), a lightweight enhancement that decomposes the learned velocity
into a reaction term -- any standard flow matching network -- and a diffusion
term that aggregates neighbor information via a graph neural module. This
reaction-diffusion formulation retains the scalability of deep flow models
while enriching velocity predictions with local context, all at minimal
additional computational cost. Operating in the latent space of a pretrained
variational autoencoder, GFM consistently improves Fr\'echet Inception Distance
(FID) and recall across five image generation benchmarks (LSUN Church, LSUN
Bedroom, FFHQ, AFHQ-Cat, and CelebA-HQ at $256\times256$), demonstrating its

Abstract: The expanding computational costs and limited resources underscore the
critical need for budgeted-iteration training, which aims to achieve optimal
learning within predetermined iteration budgets.While learning rate schedules
fundamentally govern the performance of different networks and tasks,
particularly in budgeted-iteration scenarios, their design remains largely
heuristic, lacking theoretical foundations.In addition, the optimal learning
rate schedule requires extensive trial-and-error selection, making the training
process inefficient.In this work, we propose the Unified Budget-Aware (UBA)
schedule, a theoretically grounded learning rate schedule that consistently
outperforms commonly-used schedules among diverse architectures and tasks under
different constrained training budgets.First, we bridge the gap by constructing
a novel training budget-aware optimization framework, which explicitly accounts
for the robustness to landscape curvature variations.From this framework, we
derive the UBA schedule, controlled by a single hyper-parameter $\varphi$ that
provides a trade-off between flexibility and simplicity, eliminating the need
for per-network numerical optimization. Moreover, we establish a theoretical
connection between $\varphi$ and the condition number, adding interpretation
and justification to our approach. Besides, we prove the convergence for
different values of $\varphi$.We offer practical guidelines for its selection
via theoretical analysis and empirical results.xtensive experimental results
show that UBA \textit{consistently surpasses} the commonly-used schedules
across diverse vision and language tasks, spanning network architectures (e.g.,
ResNet, OLMo) and scales, under different training-iteration budgets.

Motivation: 解决传统CBMs在复杂视觉任务中表现不佳的问题，同时保持模型的可解释性。

Result: OCB在复杂图像数据集上优于传统CBMs，同时保持可解释性。

Conclusion: OCB为复杂视觉任务提供了一种高性能且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Developing high-performing, yet interpretable models remains a critical
challenge in modern AI. Concept-based models (CBMs) attempt to address this by
extracting human-understandable concepts from a global encoding (e.g., image
encoding) and then applying a linear classifier on the resulting concept
activations, enabling transparent decision-making. However, their reliance on
holistic image encodings limits their expressiveness in object-centric
real-world settings and thus hinders their ability to solve complex vision
tasks beyond single-label classification. To tackle these challenges, we
introduce Object-Centric Concept Bottlenecks (OCB), a framework that combines
the strengths of CBMs and pre-trained object-centric foundation models,
boosting performance and interpretability. We evaluate OCB on complex image
datasets and conduct a comprehensive ablation study to analyze key components
of the framework, such as strategies for aggregating object-concept encodings.
The results show that OCB outperforms traditional CBMs and allows one to make
interpretable decisions for complex visual tasks.

Method: 设计了多种提示策略，引导预训练的慢思考LLMs进行推理，并在多个TSF基准上评估其零样本性能。

Result: 慢思考LLMs在零样本情况下表现出非平凡的预测能力，尤其在捕捉高级趋势和上下文变化方面。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在时序领域的推理潜力与局限性，为基于推理的TSF范式提供了初步探索。

Abstract: Time series forecasting (TSF) is a fundamental and widely studied task,
spanning methods from classical statistical approaches to modern deep learning
and multimodal language modeling. Despite their effectiveness, these methods
often follow a fast thinking paradigm emphasizing pattern extraction and direct
value mapping, while overlooking explicit reasoning over temporal dynamics and
contextual dependencies. Meanwhile, emerging slow-thinking LLMs (e.g.,
ChatGPT-o1, DeepSeek-R1) have demonstrated impressive multi-step reasoning
capabilities across diverse domains, suggesting a new opportunity for reframing
TSF as a structured reasoning task. This motivates a key question: can
slow-thinking LLMs effectively reason over temporal patterns to support time
series forecasting, even in zero-shot manner? To investigate this, in this
paper, we propose TimeReasoner, an extensive empirical study that formulates
TSF as a conditional reasoning task. We design a series of prompting strategies
to elicit inference-time reasoning from pretrained slow-thinking LLMs and
evaluate their performance across diverse TSF benchmarks. Our findings reveal
that slow-thinking LLMs exhibit non-trivial zero-shot forecasting capabilities,
especially in capturing high-level trends and contextual shifts. While
preliminary, our study surfaces important insights into the reasoning behaviors
of LLMs in temporal domains highlighting both their potential and limitations.
We hope this work catalyzes further research into reasoning-based forecasting
paradigms and paves the way toward more interpretable and generalizable TSF
frameworks.

Abstract: Model robustness indicates a model's capability to generalize well on
unforeseen distributional shifts, including data corruption, adversarial
attacks, and domain shifts. Data augmentation is one of the prevalent and
effective ways to enhance robustness. Despite the great success of
augmentations in different fields, a general theoretical understanding of their
efficacy in improving model robustness is lacking. We offer a unified
theoretical framework to clarify how augmentations can enhance model robustness
through the lens of loss surface flatness and PAC generalization bound. Our
work diverges from prior studies in that our analysis i) broadly encompasses
much of the existing augmentation methods, and ii) is not limited to specific
types of distribution shifts like adversarial attacks. We confirm our theories
through simulations on the existing common corruption and adversarial
robustness benchmarks based on the CIFAR and ImageNet datasets, as well as
domain generalization benchmarks including PACS and OfficeHome.

Abstract: Explainability is crucial for improving the transparency of black-box machine
learning models. With the advancement of explanation methods such as LIME and
SHAP, various XAI performance metrics have been developed to evaluate the
quality of explanations. However, different explainers can provide contrasting
explanations for the same prediction, introducing trade-offs across conflicting
quality metrics. Although available aggregation approaches improve robustness,
reducing explanations' variability, very limited research employed a
multi-criteria decision-making approach. To address this gap, this paper
introduces a multi-criteria rank-based weighted aggregation method that
balances multiple quality metrics simultaneously to produce an ensemble of
explanation models. Furthermore, we propose rank-based versions of existing XAI
metrics (complexity, faithfulness and stability) to better evaluate ranked
feature importance explanations. Extensive experiments on publicly available
datasets demonstrate the robustness of the proposed model across these metrics.
Comparative analyses of various multi-criteria decision-making and rank
aggregation algorithms showed that TOPSIS and WSUM are the best candidates for
this use case.

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic learning was proposed to address challenges with training
neural networks for complex reasoning tasks with the added benefits of
interpretability, reliability, and efficiency. Neuro-symbolic learning methods
traditionally train neural models in conjunction with symbolic programs, but
they face significant challenges that limit them to simplistic problems. On the
other hand, purely-neural foundation models now reach state-of-the-art
performance through prompting rather than training, but they are often
unreliable and lack interpretability. Supplementing foundation models with
symbolic programs, which we call neuro-symbolic prompting, provides a way to
use these models for complex reasoning tasks. Doing so raises the question:
What role does specialized model training as part of neuro-symbolic learning
have in the age of foundation models? To explore this question, we highlight
three pitfalls of traditional neuro-symbolic learning with respect to the
compute, data, and programs leading to generalization problems. This position
paper argues that foundation models enable generalizable neuro-symbolic
solutions, offering a path towards achieving the original goals of
neuro-symbolic learning without the downsides of training from scratch.

Abstract: Long-term forecasting of chaotic systems from short-term observations remains
a fundamental and underexplored challenge due to the intrinsic sensitivity to
initial conditions and the complex geometry of strange attractors. Existing
approaches often rely on long-term training data or focus on short-term
sequence correlations, struggling to maintain predictive stability and
dynamical coherence over extended horizons. We propose PhyxMamba, a novel
framework that integrates a Mamba-based state-space model with physics-informed
principles to capture the underlying dynamics of chaotic systems. By
reconstructing the attractor manifold from brief observations using time-delay
embeddings, PhyxMamba extracts global dynamical features essential for accurate
forecasting. Our generative training scheme enables Mamba to replicate the
physical process, augmented by multi-token prediction and attractor geometry
regularization for physical constraints, enhancing prediction accuracy and
preserving key statistical invariants. Extensive evaluations on diverse
simulated and real-world chaotic systems demonstrate that PhyxMamba delivers
superior long-term forecasting and faithfully captures essential dynamical
invariants from short-term data. This framework opens new avenues for reliably
predicting chaotic systems under observation-scarce conditions, with broad
implications across climate science, neuroscience, epidemiology, and beyond.

Conclusion: Adam通过抵抗简单性偏差，生成更复杂的特征和决策边界，从而提升模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Adam is the de facto optimization algorithm for several deep learning
applications, but an understanding of its implicit bias and how it differs from
other algorithms, particularly standard first-order methods such as
(stochastic) gradient descent (GD), remains limited. In practice, neural
networks trained with SGD are known to exhibit simplicity bias -- a tendency to
find simple solutions. In contrast, we show that Adam is more resistant to such
simplicity bias. To demystify this phenomenon, in this paper, we investigate
the differences in the implicit biases of Adam and GD when training two-layer
ReLU neural networks on a binary classification task involving synthetic data
with Gaussian clusters. We find that GD exhibits a simplicity bias, resulting
in a linear decision boundary with a suboptimal margin, whereas Adam leads to
much richer and more diverse features, producing a nonlinear boundary that is
closer to the Bayes' optimal predictor. This richer decision boundary also
allows Adam to achieve higher test accuracy both in-distribution and under
certain distribution shifts. We theoretically prove these results by analyzing
the population gradients. To corroborate our theoretical findings, we present
empirical results showing that this property of Adam leads to superior
generalization across datasets with spurious correlations where neural networks
trained with SGD are known to show simplicity bias and don't generalize well
under certain distributional shifts.

Conclusion: 通过区分时态图中的不变和可变组件，该方法显著提升了模型在OOD场景下的泛化能力。

Abstract: In the era of foundation models, Out-of- Distribution (OOD) problems, i.e.,
the data discrepancy between the training environments and testing
environments, hinder AI generalization. Further, relational data like graphs
disobeying the Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) condition makes
the problem more challenging, especially much harder when it is associated with
time. Motivated by this, to realize the robust invariant learning over temporal
graphs, we want to investigate what components in temporal graphs are most
invariant and representative with respect to labels. With the Information
Bottleneck (IB) method, we propose an error-bounded Invariant Link Selector
that can distinguish invariant components and variant components during the
training process to make the deep learning model generalizable for different
testing scenarios. Besides deriving a series of rigorous generalizable
optimization functions, we also equip the training with task-specific loss
functions, e.g., temporal link prediction, to make pretrained models solve
real-world application tasks like citation recommendation and merchandise
recommendation, as demonstrated in our experiments with state-of-the-art (SOTA)
methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/kthrn22/OOD-Linker.

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) seeks to build an agent that can continuously learn a
sequence of tasks, where a key challenge, namely Catastrophic Forgetting,
persists due to the potential knowledge interference among different tasks. On
the other hand, deep neural networks (DNNs) are shown to converge to a terminal
state termed Neural Collapse during training, where all class prototypes
geometrically form a static simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF). These
maximally and equally separated class prototypes make the ETF an ideal target
for model learning in CL to mitigate knowledge interference. Thus inspired,
several studies have emerged very recently to leverage a fixed global ETF in
CL, which however suffers from key drawbacks, such as impracticability and
limited performance.To address these challenges and fully unlock the potential
of ETF in CL, we propose Progressive Neural Collapse (ProNC), a novel framework
that completely removes the need of a fixed global ETF in CL. Specifically,
ProNC progressively expands the ETF target in a principled way by adding new
class prototypes as vertices for new tasks, ensuring maximal separability
across all encountered classes with minimal shifts from the previous ETF. We
next develop a new CL framework by plugging ProNC into commonly used CL
algorithm designs, where distillation is further leveraged to balance between
target shifting for old classes and target aligning for new classes. Extensive
experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms related baselines
while maintaining superior flexibility, simplicity, and efficiency.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) in autonomous driving employs a trial-and-error

crafting effective reward functions remains challenging, as conventional
approaches rely heavily on manual design and demonstrate limited efficacy in
complex scenarios. To address this issue, this study introduces a
responsibility-oriented reward function that explicitly incorporates traffic

Regulation Knowledge Graph and leveraged Vision-Language Models alongside
Retrieval-Augmented Generation techniques to automate reward assignment. This
integration guides agents to adhere strictly to traffic laws, thus minimizing
rule violations and optimizing decision-making performance in diverse driving
conditions. Experimental validations demonstrate that the proposed methodology
significantly improves the accuracy of assigning accident responsibilities and
effectively reduces the agent's liability in traffic incidents.

Abstract: The core of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is to learn the
in-distribution (ID) representation, which is distinguishable from OOD samples.
Previous work applied recognition-based methods to learn the ID features, which
tend to learn shortcuts instead of comprehensive representations. In this work,
we find surprisingly that simply using reconstruction-based methods could boost
the performance of OOD detection significantly. We deeply explore the main
contributors of OOD detection and find that reconstruction-based pretext tasks
have the potential to provide a generally applicable and efficacious prior,
which benefits the model in learning intrinsic data distributions of the ID
dataset. Specifically, we take Masked Image Modeling as a pretext task for our
OOD detection framework (MOOD). Without bells and whistles, MOOD outperforms
previous SOTA of one-class OOD detection by 5.7%, multi-class OOD detection by
3.0%, and near-distribution OOD detection by 2.1%. It even defeats the
10-shot-per-class outlier exposure OOD detection, although we do not include

Abstract: Compressing and pruning large machine learning models has become a critical
step towards their deployment in real-world applications. Standard pruning and
compression techniques are typically designed without taking the structure of
the network's weights into account, limiting their effectiveness. We explore
the impact of smooth regularization on neural network training and model
compression. By applying nuclear norm, first- and second-order derivative
penalties of the weights during training, we encourage structured smoothness
while preserving predictive performance on par with non-smooth models. We find
that standard pruning methods often perform better when applied to these smooth
models. Building on this observation, we apply a
Singular-Value-Decomposition-based compression method that exploits the
underlying smooth structure and approximates the model's weight tensors by
smaller low-rank tensors. Our approach enables state-of-the-art compression
without any fine-tuning - reaching up to $91\%$ accuracy on a smooth ResNet-18
on CIFAR-10 with $70\%$ fewer parameters.

Abstract: To address the computational and storage challenges posed by large-scale
datasets in deep learning, dataset distillation has been proposed to synthesize
a compact dataset that replaces the original while maintaining comparable model
performance. Unlike optimization-based approaches that require costly bi-level
optimization, distribution matching (DM) methods improve efficiency by aligning
the distributions of synthetic and original data, thereby eliminating nested
optimization. DM achieves high computational efficiency and has emerged as a
promising solution. However, existing DM methods, constrained to Euclidean
space, treat data as independent and identically distributed points,
overlooking complex geometric and hierarchical relationships. To overcome this
limitation, we propose a novel hyperbolic dataset distillation method, termed
HDD. Hyperbolic space, characterized by negative curvature and exponential
volume growth with distance, naturally models hierarchical and tree-like
structures. HDD embeds features extracted by a shallow network into the Lorentz
hyperbolic space, where the discrepancy between synthetic and original data is
measured by the hyperbolic (geodesic) distance between their centroids. By
optimizing this distance, the hierarchical structure is explicitly integrated
into the distillation process, guiding synthetic samples to gravitate towards
the root-centric regions of the original data distribution while preserving
their underlying geometric characteristics. Furthermore, we find that pruning
in hyperbolic space requires only 20% of the distilled core set to retain model
performance, while significantly improving training stability. Notably, HDD is
seamlessly compatible with most existing DM methods, and extensive experiments
on different datasets validate its effectiveness.

Abstract: Normalizing flows are promising generative models with advantages such as
theoretical rigor, analytical log-likelihood computation, and end-to-end
training. However, the architectural constraints to ensure invertibility and
tractable Jacobian computation limit their expressive power and practical
usability. Recent advancements utilize autoregressive modeling, significantly
enhancing expressive power and generation quality. However, such sequential
modeling inherently restricts parallel computation during inference, leading to
slow generation that impedes practical deployment. In this paper, we first
identify that strict sequential dependency in inference is unnecessary to
generate high-quality samples. We observe that patches in sequential modeling
can also be approximated without strictly conditioning on all preceding
patches. Moreover, the models tend to exhibit low dependency redundancy in the
initial layer and higher redundancy in subsequent layers. Leveraging these
observations, we propose a selective Jacobi decoding (SeJD) strategy that
accelerates autoregressive inference through parallel iterative optimization.
Theoretical analyses demonstrate the method's superlinear convergence rate and
guarantee that the number of iterations required is no greater than the
original sequential approach. Empirical evaluations across multiple datasets
validate the generality and effectiveness of our acceleration technique.
Experiments demonstrate substantial speed improvements up to 4.7 times faster
inference while keeping the generation quality and fidelity.

TL;DR: EB-Sampler是一种基于熵约束的自适应采样方法，用于加速掩码扩散模型的采样过程，性能提升2-3倍且不损失准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有掩码扩散模型（MDMs）的采样效率未被充分探索，而部分掩码序列可能包含多个确定性未知标记的信息。

Method: 提出EB-Sampler，通过动态解掩多个标记并预设误差容限，实现高效采样。

Result: 在编码和数学推理基准测试中，采样速度提升2-3倍，且在小规模推理任务（如迷宫和数独）中表现优异。

Conclusion: EB-Sampler为MDMs提供了一种高效且通用的采样解决方案。

Abstract: Recent masked diffusion models (MDMs) have shown competitive performance
compared to autoregressive models (ARMs) for language modeling. While most
literature has focused on performance enhancing sampling procedures, efficient
sampling from MDMs has been scarcely explored. We make the observation that
often a given sequence of partially masked tokens determines the values of
multiple unknown tokens deterministically, meaning that a single prediction of
a masked model holds additional information unused by standard sampling
procedures. Based on this observation, we introduce EB-Sampler, a simple
drop-in replacement for existing samplers, utilizing an Entropy Bounded
unmasking procedure that dynamically unmasks multiple tokens in one function
evaluation with predefined approximate error tolerance. We formulate the
EB-Sampler as part of a broad family of adaptive samplers for which we provide
an error analysis that motivates our algorithmic choices. EB-Sampler
accelerates sampling from current state of the art MDMs by roughly 2-3x on
standard coding and math reasoning benchmarks without loss in performance. We
also validate the same procedure works well on smaller reasoning tasks
including maze navigation and Sudoku, tasks ARMs often struggle with.

Abstract: Calibrating blackbox machine learning models to achieve risk control is
crucial to ensure reliable decision-making. A rich line of literature has been
studying how to calibrate a model so that its predictions satisfy explicit
finite-sample statistical guarantees under a fixed, static, and unknown
data-generating distribution. However, prediction-supported decisions may
influence the outcome they aim to predict, a phenomenon named performativity of
predictions, which is commonly seen in social science and economics. In this
paper, we introduce Performative Risk Control, a framework to calibrate models
to achieve risk control under performativity with provable theoretical
guarantees. Specifically, we provide an iteratively refined calibration
process, where we ensure the predictions are improved and risk-controlled
throughout the process. We also study different types of risk measures and
choices of tail bounds. Lastly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework by numerical experiments on the task of predicting credit default
risk. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first one to study
statistically rigorous risk control under performativity, which will serve as
an important safeguard against a wide range of strategic manipulation in
decision-making processes.

Abstract: The optimization of expensive black-box functions is ubiquitous in science
and engineering. A common solution to this problem is Bayesian optimization
(BO), which is generally comprised of two components: (i) a surrogate model and
(ii) an acquisition function, which generally require expensive re-training and
optimization steps at each iteration, respectively. Although recent work
enabled in-context surrogate models that do not require re-training, virtually
all existing BO methods still require acquisition function maximization to
select the next observation, which introduces many knobs to tune, such as Monte
Carlo samplers and multi-start optimizers. In this work, we propose a
completely in-context, zero-shot solution for BO that does not require
surrogate fitting or acquisition function optimization. This is done by using a
pre-trained deep generative model to directly sample from the posterior over
the optimum point. We show that this process is equivalent to Thompson sampling
and demonstrate the capabilities and cost-effectiveness of our foundation model
on a suite of real-world benchmarks. We achieve an efficiency gain of more than
35x in terms of wall-clock time when compared with Gaussian process-based BO,
enabling efficient parallel and distributed BO, e.g., for high-throughput
optimization.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) on graph-structured data typically faces non-IID
challenges, particularly in scenarios where each client holds a distinct
subgraph sampled from a global graph. In this paper, we introduce Federated
learning with Auxiliary projections (FedAux), a personalized subgraph FL
framework that learns to align, compare, and aggregate heterogeneously
distributed local models without sharing raw data or node embeddings. In
FedAux, each client jointly trains (i) a local GNN and (ii) a learnable
auxiliary projection vector (APV) that differentiably projects node embeddings
onto a 1D space. A soft-sorting operation followed by a lightweight 1D
convolution refines these embeddings in the ordered space, enabling the APV to
effectively capture client-specific information. After local training, these
APVs serve as compact signatures that the server uses to compute inter-client
similarities and perform similarity-weighted parameter mixing, yielding
personalized models while preserving cross-client knowledge transfer. Moreover,
we provide rigorous theoretical analysis to establish the convergence and
rationality of our design. Empirical evaluations across diverse graph
benchmarks demonstrate that FedAux substantially outperforms existing baselines
in both accuracy and personalization performance.

Abstract: Precision agriculture requires efficient autonomous systems for crop
monitoring, where agents must explore large-scale environments while minimizing
resource consumption. This work addresses the problem as an active exploration
task in a grid environment representing an agricultural field. Each cell may
contain targets (e.g., damaged crops) observable from nine predefined points of
view (POVs). Agents must infer the number of targets per cell using partial,
sequential observations.
  We propose a two-stage deep learning framework. A pre-trained LSTM serves as
a belief model, updating a probabilistic map of the environment and its
associated entropy, which defines the expected information gain (IG). This
allows agents to prioritize informative regions. A key contribution is the
inclusion of a POV visibility mask in the input, preserving the Markov property
under partial observability and avoiding revisits to already explored views.
  Three agent architectures were compared: an untrained IG-based agent
selecting actions to maximize entropy reduction; a DQN agent using CNNs over
local 3x3 inputs with belief, entropy, and POV mask; and a Double-CNN DQN agent
with wider spatial context. Simulations on 20x20 maps showed that the untrained
agent performs well despite its simplicity. The DQN agent matches this
performance when the POV mask is included, while the Double-CNN agent
consistently achieves superior exploration efficiency, especially in larger
environments.
  Results show that uncertainty-aware policies leveraging entropy, belief
states, and visibility tracking lead to robust and scalable exploration. Future
work includes curriculum learning, multi-agent cooperation with shared rewards,
transformer-based models, and intrinsic motivation mechanisms to further
enhance learning efficiency and policy generalization.

Abstract: Graph-level regression underpins many real-world applications, yet public
benchmarks remain heavily skewed toward molecular graphs and citation networks.
This limited diversity hinders progress on models that must generalize across
both homogeneous and heterogeneous graph structures. We introduce RelSC, a new
graph-regression dataset built from program graphs that combine syntactic and
semantic information extracted from source code. Each graph is labelled with
the execution-time cost of the corresponding program, providing a continuous
target variable that differs markedly from those found in existing benchmarks.
RelSC is released in two complementary variants. RelSC-H supplies rich node
features under a single (homogeneous) edge type, while RelSC-M preserves the
original multi-relational structure, connecting nodes through multiple edge
types that encode distinct semantic relationships. Together, these variants let
researchers probe how representation choice influences model behaviour. We
evaluate a diverse set of graph neural network architectures on both variants
of RelSC. The results reveal consistent performance differences between the
homogeneous and multi-relational settings, emphasising the importance of
structural representation. These findings demonstrate RelSC's value as a
challenging and versatile benchmark for advancing graph regression methods.

GELU's smooth, probabilistic profile, to achieve a more universally robust
balance between model expressivity and gradient stability. We conduct
comprehensive empirical evaluations across diverse modalities and

language and computer vision tasks and models. These results, achieved with

Abstract: Training neural networks on randomly generated artificial datasets yields
Bayesian models that capture the prior defined by the dataset-generating
distribution. Prior-data Fitted Networks (PFNs) are a class of methods designed
to leverage this insight. In an era of rapidly increasing computational
resources for pre-training and a near stagnation in the generation of new
real-world data in many applications, PFNs are poised to play a more important
role across a wide range of applications. They enable the efficient allocation
of pre-training compute to low-data scenarios. Originally applied to small
Bayesian modeling tasks, the field of PFNs has significantly expanded to
address more complex domains and larger datasets. This position paper argues
that PFNs and other amortized inference approaches represent the future of
Bayesian inference, leveraging amortized learning to tackle data-scarce

Abstract: In settings where ML models are used to inform the allocation of resources,
agents affected by the allocation decisions might have an incentive to
strategically change their features to secure better outcomes. While prior work
has studied strategic responses broadly, disentangling misreporting from
genuine modification remains a fundamental challenge. In this paper, we propose
a causally-motivated approach to identify and quantify how much an agent
misreports on average by distinguishing deceptive changes in their features
from genuine modification. Our key insight is that, unlike genuine
modification, misreported features do not causally affect downstream variables
(i.e., causal descendants). We exploit this asymmetry by comparing the causal
effect of misreported features on their causal descendants as derived from
manipulated datasets against those from unmanipulated datasets. We formally
prove identifiability of the misreporting rate and characterize the variance of
our estimator. We empirically validate our theoretical results using a
semi-synthetic and real Medicare dataset with misreported data, demonstrating
that our approach can be employed to identify misreporting in real-world
scenarios.

Conclusion: ADEL-FL 提供了一种有效的解决方案，适用于联邦学习中的延迟问题。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed edge devices while preserving data privacy, and typically operates
in a round-based synchronous manner. However, synchronous FL suffers from
latency bottlenecks due to device heterogeneity, where slower clients
(stragglers) delay or degrade global updates. Prior solutions, such as fixed
deadlines, client selection, and layer-wise partial aggregation, alleviate the
effect of stragglers, but treat round timing and local workload as static
parameters, limiting their effectiveness under strict time constraints. We
propose ADEL-FL, a novel framework that jointly optimizes per-round deadlines
and user-specific batch sizes for layer-wise aggregation. Our approach
formulates a constrained optimization problem minimizing the expected L2
distance to the global optimum under total training time and global rounds. We
provide a convergence analysis under exponential compute models and prove that
ADEL-FL yields unbiased updates with bounded variance. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that ADEL-FL outperforms alternative methods in both convergence
rate and final accuracy under heterogeneous conditions.

Conclusion: DMMV通过多模态分解有效解决了LVMs在LTSF中的偏差问题，显著提升了预测性能。

Abstract: Time series, typically represented as numerical sequences, can also be
transformed into images and texts, offering multi-modal views (MMVs) of the
same underlying signal. These MMVs can reveal complementary patterns and enable
the use of powerful pre-trained large models, such as large vision models

"forecasting periods". To harness this bias, we propose DMMV, a novel
decomposition-based multi-modal view framework that leverages trend-seasonal
decomposition and a novel backcast residual based adaptive decomposition to
integrate MMVs for LTSF. Comparative evaluations against 14 state-of-the-art

Abstract: Despite major advances in methodology, hyperparameter tuning remains a
crucial (and expensive) part of the development of machine learning systems.
Even ignoring architectural choices, deep neural networks have a large number
of optimization and regularization hyperparameters that need to be tuned
carefully per workload in order to obtain the best results. In a perfect world,
training algorithms would not require workload-specific hyperparameter tuning,
but would instead have default settings that performed well across many
workloads. Recently, there has been a growing literature on optimization
methods which attempt to reduce the number of hyperparameters -- particularly
the learning rate and its accompanying schedule. Given these developments, how
far away is the dream of neural network training algorithms that completely
obviate the need for painful tuning?
  In this paper, we evaluate the potential of learning-rate-free methods as
components of hyperparameter-free methods. We freeze their (non-learning rate)
hyperparameters to default values, and score their performance using the
recently-proposed AlgoPerf: Training Algorithms benchmark. We found that
literature-supplied default settings performed poorly on the benchmark, so we
performed a search for hyperparameter configurations that performed well across
all workloads simultaneously. The best AlgoPerf-calibrated learning-rate-free
methods had much improved performance but still lagged slightly behind a
similarly calibrated NadamW baseline in overall benchmark score. Our results
suggest that there is still much room for improvement for learning-rate-free
methods, and that testing against a strong, workload-agnostic baseline is
important to improve hyperparameter reduction techniques.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown great ability for node classification
on graphs. However, the success of GNNs relies on abundant labeled data, while
obtaining high-quality labels is costly and challenging, especially for newly
emerging domains. Hence, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), which trains a
classifier on the labeled source graph and adapts it to the unlabeled target
graph, is attracting increasing attention. Various approaches have been
proposed to alleviate the distribution shift between the source and target
graphs to facilitate the classifier adaptation. However, most of them simply
adopt existing UDA techniques developed for independent and identically
distributed data to gain domain-invariant node embeddings for graphs, which do
not fully consider the graph structure and message-passing mechanism of GNNs
during the adaptation and will fail when label distribution shift exists among
domains. In this paper, we proposed a novel framework that adopts link
prediction to connect nodes between source and target graphs, which can
facilitate message-passing between the source and target graphs and augment the
target nodes to have ``in-distribution'' neighborhoods with the source domain.
This strategy modified the target graph on the input level to reduce its
deviation from the source domain in the embedding space and is insensitive to
disproportional label distributions across domains. To prevent the loss of
discriminative information in the target graph, we further design a novel
identity-preserving learning objective, which guides the learning of the edge
insertion module together with reconstruction and adaptation losses.
Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our framework.

Abstract: Neural Algorithmic Reasoning (NAR) trains neural networks to simulate

representation between primal and dual variables, we establish an alignment
between primal-dual algorithms and Graph Neural Networks. Furthermore, we
incorporate optimal solutions from small instances to greatly enhance the
model's reasoning capabilities. Our empirical results demonstrate that our
model not only simulates but also outperforms approximation algorithms for
multiple tasks, exhibiting robust generalization to larger and
out-of-distribution graphs. Moreover, we highlight the framework's practical
utility by integrating it with commercial solvers and applying it to real-world
datasets.

Abstract: We develop practical and theoretically grounded membership inference attacks
(MIAs) against both independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data and
graph-structured data. Building on the Bayesian decision-theoretic framework of
Sablayrolles et al., we derive the Bayes-optimal membership inference rule for
node-level MIAs against graph neural networks, addressing key open questions
about optimal query strategies in the graph setting. We introduce BASE and
G-BASE, computationally efficient approximations of the Bayes-optimal attack.
G-BASE achieves superior performance compared to previously proposed
classifier-based node-level MIA attacks. BASE, which is also applicable to
non-graph data, matches or exceeds the performance of prior state-of-the-art
MIAs, such as LiRA and RMIA, at a significantly lower computational cost.
Finally, we show that BASE and RMIA are equivalent under a specific
hyperparameter setting, providing a principled, Bayes-optimal justification for
the RMIA attack.

Abstract: We present a formal and constructive framework establishing the equivalence
between nondeterministic finite automata (NFAs) and standard feedforward ReLU
neural networks. By encoding automaton states as binary vectors and transitions
as sparse linear layers, we show that ReLU activations simulate
nondeterministic branching, subset construction, and $\epsilon$-closures in a
mathematically precise manner. Our core theoretical results prove that a
three-layer ReLU network of width $\mathcal{O}(n)$ can exactly recognize any
regular language accepted by an $n$-state NFA-without recurrence, memory, or
approximation. Furthermore, we show that gradient descent over
structure-preserving networks preserves symbolic semantics and acceptance
behavior. Extensive experiments across multiple validation tasks-including
parallel path tracking, symbolic subset construction, $\epsilon$-closure
convergence, acceptance classification, structural training invariants, and
functional equivalence-achieve perfect or near-perfect empirical alignment with
ground-truth automata. This work provides the first provably complete symbolic
simulation of NFAs within standard deep learning architectures, uniting
automata theory with neural computation through ReLU dynamics.

Abstract: Building on recent advances in scientific machine learning and generative
modeling for computational fluid dynamics, we propose a conditional score-based
diffusion model designed for multi-scenarios fluid flow prediction. Our model
integrates an energy constraint rooted in the statistical properties of
turbulent flows, improving prediction quality with minimal training, while
enabling efficient sampling at low cost. The method features a simple and
general architecture that requires no problem-specific design, supports
plug-and-play enhancements, and enables fast and flexible solution generation.
It also demonstrates an efficient conditioning mechanism that simplifies
training across different scenarios without demanding a redesign of existing
models. We further explore various stochastic differential equation
formulations to demonstrate how thoughtful design choices enhance performance.
We validate the proposed methodology through extensive experiments on complex
fluid dynamics datasets encompassing a variety of flow regimes and
configurations. Results demonstrate that our model consistently achieves
stable, robust, and physically faithful predictions, even under challenging
turbulent conditions. With properly tuned parameters, it achieves accurate
results across multiple scenarios while preserving key physical and statistical
properties. We present a comprehensive analysis of stochastic differential
equation impact and discuss our approach across diverse fluid mechanics tasks.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) algorithms deployed in real-world environments are
often faced with the challenge of adapting models to concept drift, where the
task data distributions are shifting over time. The problem becomes even more
difficult when model performance must be maintained under adherence to strict
resource constraints. Existing solutions often depend on drift-detection
methods that produce high computational overhead for resource-constrained
environments, and fail to provide strict guarantees on resource usage or
theoretical performance assurances. To address these shortcomings, we propose
RCCDA: a dynamic model update policy that optimizes ML training dynamics while
ensuring strict compliance to predefined resource constraints, utilizing only
past loss information and a tunable drift threshold. In developing our policy,
we analytically characterize the evolution of model loss under concept drift
with arbitrary training update decisions. Integrating these results into a
Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty framework produces a lightweight policy based on a
measurable accumulated loss threshold that provably limits update frequency and
cost. Experimental results on three domain generalization datasets demonstrate
that our policy outperforms baseline methods in inference accuracy while
adhering to strict resource constraints under several schedules of concept
drift, making our solution uniquely suited for real-time ML deployments.

Conclusion: FedDEA在高度异构任务场景下表现出鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Federated Multi-Task Learning (FMTL) enables multiple clients performing
heterogeneous tasks without exchanging their local data, offering broad
potential for privacy preserving multi-task collaboration. However, most
existing methods focus on building personalized models for each client and
unable to support the aggregation of multiple heterogeneous tasks into a
unified model. As a result, in real-world scenarios where task objectives,
label spaces, and optimization paths vary significantly, conventional FMTL
methods struggle to achieve effective joint training. To address this
challenge, we propose FedDEA (Federated Decoupled Aggregation), an
update-structure-aware aggregation method specifically designed for multi-task
model integration. Our method dynamically identifies task-relevant dimensions
based on the response strength of local updates and enhances their optimization
effectiveness through rescaling. This mechanism effectively suppresses
cross-task interference and enables task-level decoupled aggregation within a
unified global model. FedDEA does not rely on task labels or architectural
modifications, making it broadly applicable and deployment-friendly.
Experimental results demonstrate that it can be easily integrated into various
mainstream federated optimization algorithms and consistently delivers
significant overall performance improvements on widely used NYUD-V2 and
PASCAL-Context. These results validate the robustness and generalization
capabilities of FedDEA under highly heterogeneous task settings.

Abstract: Few-shot image classification remains challenging due to the scarcity of
labeled training examples. Augmenting them with synthetic data has emerged as a
promising way to alleviate this issue, but models trained on synthetic samples
often face performance degradation due to the inherent gap between real and
synthetic distributions. To address this limitation, we develop a theoretical
framework that quantifies the impact of such distribution discrepancies on
supervised learning, specifically in the context of image classification. More
importantly, our framework suggests practical ways to generate good synthetic
samples and to train a predictor with high generalization ability. Building
upon this framework, we propose a novel theoretical-based algorithm that
integrates prototype learning to optimize both data partitioning and model
training, effectively bridging the gap between real few-shot data and synthetic
data. Extensive experiments results show that our approach demonstrates
superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, outperforming them

Abstract: Variational inference often struggles with the posterior geometry exhibited

translation term and input from the model's prior. Guided by this theoretical
insight, we introduce the Model-Informed Flow (MIF) architecture, which adds
the necessary translation mechanism, prior information, and hierarchical
ordering. Empirically, MIF delivers tighter posterior approximations and
matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance across a suite of hierarchical

Abstract: Data attribution methods, which quantify the influence of individual training
data points on a machine learning model, have gained increasing popularity in
data-centric applications in modern AI. Despite a recent surge of new methods
developed in this space, the impact of hyperparameter tuning in these methods
remains under-explored. In this work, we present the first large-scale
empirical study to understand the hyperparameter sensitivity of common data
attribution methods. Our results show that most methods are indeed sensitive to
certain key hyperparameters. However, unlike typical machine learning
algorithms -- whose hyperparameters can be tuned using computationally-cheap
validation metrics -- evaluating data attribution performance often requires
retraining models on subsets of training data, making such metrics
prohibitively costly for hyperparameter tuning. This poses a critical open
challenge for the practical application of data attribution methods. To address
this challenge, we advocate for better theoretical understandings of
hyperparameter behavior to inform efficient tuning strategies. As a case study,
we provide a theoretical analysis of the regularization term that is critical
in many variants of influence function methods. Building on this analysis, we
propose a lightweight procedure for selecting the regularization value without
model retraining, and validate its effectiveness across a range of standard
data attribution benchmarks. Overall, our study identifies a fundamental yet
overlooked challenge in the practical application of data attribution, and
highlights the importance of careful discussion on hyperparameter selection in
future method development.

metric-preserving diffeomorphisms. The resulting algorithms, which we call
Cartan networks, show promising results on various benchmark data sets and open

Conclusion: LightSAM通过自适应优化器实现了参数无关性，提升了SAM的实用性和适用范围。

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) optimizer enhances the generalization
ability of the machine learning model by exploring the flat minima landscape
through weight perturbations. Despite its empirical success, SAM introduces an
additional hyper-parameter, the perturbation radius, which causes the
sensitivity of SAM to it. Moreover, it has been proved that the perturbation
radius and learning rate of SAM are constrained by problem-dependent parameters
to guarantee convergence. These limitations indicate the requirement of
parameter-tuning in practical applications. In this paper, we propose the
algorithm LightSAM which sets the perturbation radius and learning rate of SAM
adaptively, thus extending the application scope of SAM. LightSAM employs three
popular adaptive optimizers, including AdaGrad-Norm, AdaGrad and Adam, to
replace the SGD optimizer for weight perturbation and model updating, reducing
sensitivity to parameters. Theoretical results show that under weak
assumptions, LightSAM could converge ideally with any choices of perturbation
radius and learning rate, thus achieving parameter-agnostic. We conduct
preliminary experiments on several deep learning tasks, which together with the
theoretical findings validate the the effectiveness of LightSAM.

Abstract: The Lipschitz constant of a neural network is connected to several important
properties of the network such as its robustness and generalization. It is thus
useful in many settings to estimate the Lipschitz constant of a model. Prior
work has focused mainly on estimating the Lipschitz constant of multi-layer
perceptrons and convolutional neural networks. Here we focus on data modeled as
sets or multisets of vectors and on neural networks that can handle such data.
These models typically apply some permutation invariant aggregation function,
such as the sum, mean or max operator, to the input multisets to produce a
single vector for each input sample. In this paper, we investigate whether
these aggregation functions are Lipschitz continuous with respect to three
distance functions for unordered multisets, and we compute their Lipschitz
constants. In the general case, we find that each aggregation function is
Lipschitz continuous with respect to only one of the three distance functions.
Then, we build on these results to derive upper bounds on the Lipschitz
constant of neural networks that can process multisets of vectors, while we
also study their stability to perturbations and generalization under
distribution shifts. To empirically verify our theoretical analysis, we conduct
a series of experiments on datasets from different domains.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) has emerged as an imperative machine learning tool
to solve multiple learning tasks simultaneously and has been successfully
applied to healthcare, marketing, and biomedical fields. However, in order to
borrow information across different tasks effectively, it is essential to
utilize both homogeneous and heterogeneous information. Among the extensive
literature on MTL, various forms of heterogeneity are presented in MTL
problems, such as block-wise, distribution, and posterior heterogeneity.
Existing methods, however, struggle to tackle these forms of heterogeneity
simultaneously in a unified framework. In this paper, we propose a two-step
learning strategy for MTL which addresses the aforementioned heterogeneity.
First, we impute the missing blocks using shared representations extracted from
homogeneous source across different tasks. Next, we disentangle the mappings
between input features and responses into a shared component and a
task-specific component, respectively, thereby enabling information borrowing
through the shared component. Our numerical experiments and real-data analysis
from the ADNI database demonstrate the superior MTL performance of the proposed
method compared to other competing methods.

Abstract: An important characteristic of temporal graphs is how the directed arrow of
time influences their causal topology, i.e., which nodes can possibly influence
each other causally via time-respecting paths. The resulting patterns are often
neglected by temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs). To formally analyze the
expressive power of TGNNs, we lack a generalization of graph isomorphism to
temporal graphs that fully captures their causal topology. Addressing this gap,
we introduce the notion of consistent event graph isomorphism, which utilizes a
time-unfolded representation of time-respecting paths in temporal graphs. We
compare this definition with existing notions of temporal graph isomorphisms.
We illustrate and highlight the advantages of our approach and develop a
temporal generalization of the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm to heuristically
distinguish non-isomorphic temporal graphs. Building on this theoretical
foundation, we derive a novel message passing scheme for temporal graph neural
networks that operates on the event graph representation of temporal graphs. An
experimental evaluation shows that our approach performs well in a temporal
graph classification experiment.

Abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) have recently emerged as a promising and
efficient approach for learning the numerical solutions to partial differential
equations (PDEs) from data. However, standard FNO often fails to preserve key
conservation laws, such as mass conservation, momentum conservation, norm
conservation, etc., which are crucial for accurately modeling physical systems.
Existing methods for incorporating these conservation laws into Fourier neural
operators are achieved by designing related loss function or incorporating
post-processing method at the training time. None of them can both exactly and
adaptively correct the outputs to satisfy conservation laws, and our
experiments show that these methods can lead to inferior performance while
preserving conservation laws. In this work, we propose a novel adaptive
correction approach to ensure the conservation of fundamental quantities. Our
method introduces a learnable matrix to adaptively adjust the solution to
satisfy the conservation law during training. It ensures that the outputs
exactly satisfy the goal conservation law and allow for more flexibility and
adaptivity for the model to correct the outputs. We theoretically show that
applying our adaptive correction to an unconstrained FNO yields a solution with
data loss no worse than that of the best conservation-satisfying FNO. We
compare our approach with existing methods on a range of representative PDEs.
Experiment results show that our method consistently outperform other methods.

for 1,020+ chemicals, (2) a multi-stage training pipeline that fine tunes
domain specialized SLMs on synthetic datasets via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Retrieval-Augmented Instruction

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，BCE方法在点和概率预测中均优于现有方法，同时参数更少、训练更快。

Conclusion: BCE方法通过保留序数信息，显著提升了时间序列预测的性能和效率。

Abstract: Recent studies in time series forecasting have explored formulating
regression via classification task. By discretizing the continuous target space
into bins and predicting over a fixed set of classes, these approaches benefit
from stable training, robust uncertainty modeling, and compatibility with
modern deep learning architectures. However, most existing methods rely on
one-hot encoding that ignores the inherent ordinal structure of the underlying
values. As a result, they fail to provide information about the relative
distance between predicted and true values during training. In this paper, we
propose to address this limitation by introducing binary cumulative encoding
(BCE), that represents scalar targets into monotonic binary vectors. This
encoding implicitly preserves order and magnitude information, allowing the
model to learn distance-aware representations while still operating within a
classification framework. We propose a convolutional neural network
architecture specifically designed for BCE, incorporating residual and dilated
convolutions to enable fast and expressive temporal modeling. Through extensive
experiments on benchmark forecasting datasets, we show that our approach
outperforms widely used methods in both point and probabilistic forecasting,
while requiring fewer parameters and enabling faster training.

Abstract: Gaussian sketching, which consists of pre-multiplying the data with a random
Gaussian matrix, is a widely used technique for multiple problems in data
science and machine learning, with applications spanning computationally
efficient optimization, coded computing, and federated learning. This operation
also provides differential privacy guarantees due to its inherent randomness.
In this work, we revisit this operation through the lens of Renyi Differential
Privacy (RDP), providing a refined privacy analysis that yields significantly
tighter bounds than prior results. We then demonstrate how this improved
analysis leads to performance improvement in different linear regression
settings, establishing theoretical utility guarantees. Empirically, our methods
improve performance across multiple datasets and, in several cases, reduce
runtime.

Conclusion: 通过显式考虑约束紧度，NCO方法的适应性和性能得到显著提升。

Abstract: Recent neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) methods have shown promising
problem-solving ability without requiring domain-specific expertise. Most
existing NCO methods use training and testing data with a fixed constraint
value and lack research on the effect of constraint tightness on the
performance of NCO methods. This paper takes the capacity-constrained vehicle
routing problem (CVRP) as an example to empirically analyze the NCO performance
under different tightness degrees of the capacity constraint. Our analysis
reveals that existing NCO methods overfit the capacity constraint, and they can
only perform satisfactorily on a small range of the constraint values but
poorly on other values. To tackle this drawback of existing NCO methods, we
develop an efficient training scheme that explicitly considers varying degrees
of constraint tightness and proposes a multi-expert module to learn a generally
adaptable solving strategy. Experimental results show that the proposed method
can effectively overcome the overfitting issue, demonstrating superior
performances on the CVRP and CVRP with time windows (CVRPTW) with various
constraint tightness degrees.

Conclusion: 该方法推广了两种著名的图核，并可在线性时间内计算。

Abstract: We investigate the distance function learned by message passing neural
networks (MPNNs) in specific tasks, aiming to capture the functional distance
between prediction targets that MPNNs implicitly learn. This contrasts with
previous work, which links MPNN distances on arbitrary tasks to structural
distances on graphs that ignore task-specific information. To address this gap,
we distill the distance between MPNN embeddings into an interpretable graph
distance. Our method uses optimal transport on the Weisfeiler Leman Labeling
Tree (WILT), where the edge weights reveal subgraphs that strongly influence
the distance between embeddings. This approach generalizes two well-known graph
kernels and can be computed in linear time. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that MPNNs define the relative position of embeddings by focusing
on a small set of subgraphs that are known to be functionally important in the
domain.

Abstract: Learning distributions over permutations is a fundamental problem in machine
learning, with applications in ranking, combinatorial optimization, structured
prediction, and data association. Existing methods rely on mixtures of
parametric families or neural networks with expensive variational inference
procedures. In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages
alternative representations for permutations, including Lehmer codes,
Fisher-Yates draws, and Insertion-Vectors. These representations form a
bijection with the symmetric group, allowing for unconstrained learning using
conventional deep learning techniques, and can represent any probability
distribution over permutations. Our approach enables a trade-off between
expressivity of the model family and computational requirements. In the least
expressive and most computationally efficient case, our method subsumes
previous families of well established probabilistic models over permutations,
including Mallow's and the Repeated Insertion Model. Experiments indicate our
method significantly outperforms current approaches on the jigsaw puzzle
benchmark, a common task for permutation learning. However, we argue this
benchmark is limited in its ability to assess learning probability
distributions, as the target is a delta distribution (i.e., a single correct
solution exists). We therefore propose two additional benchmarks: learning
cyclic permutations and re-ranking movies based on user preference. We show
that our method learns non-trivial distributions even in the least expressive
mode, while traditional models fail to even generate valid permutations in this
setting.

Abstract: Real world data often lie on low-dimensional Riemannian manifolds embedded in
high-dimensional spaces. This motivates learning degenerate normalizing flows
that map between the ambient space and a low-dimensional latent space. However,
if the manifold has a non-trivial topology, it can never be correctly learned
using a single flow. Instead multiple flows must be `glued together'. In this
paper, we first propose the general training scheme for learning such a
collection of flows, and secondly we develop the first numerical algorithms for
computing geodesics on such manifolds. Empirically, we demonstrate that this
leads to highly significant improvements in topology estimation.

Abstract: Despite the success in learning semantically meaningful, unsupervised
disentangled representations, variational autoencoders (VAEs) and their
variants face a fundamental theoretical challenge: substantial evidence
indicates that unsupervised disentanglement is unattainable without implicit
inductive bias, yet such bias remains elusive. In this work, we focus on
exploring the implicit inductive bias that drive disentanglement in VAEs with
factorization priors. By analyzing the total correlation in \b{eta}-TCVAE, we
uncover a crucial implicit inductive bias called disentangling granularity,
which leads to the discovery of an interesting "V"-shaped optimal Evidence
Lower Bound (ELBO) trajectory within the parameter space. This finding is
validated through over 100K experiments using factorized VAEs and our newly
proposed model, \b{eta}-STCVAE. Notably, experimental results reveal that
conventional factorized VAEs, constrained by fixed disentangling granularity,
inherently tend to disentangle low-complexity feature. Whereas, appropriately
tuning disentangling granularity, as enabled by \b{eta}-STCVAE, broadens the
range of disentangled representations, allowing for the disentanglement of
high-complexity features. Our findings unveil that disentangling granularity as
an implicit inductive bias in factorized VAEs influence both disentanglement
performance and the inference of the ELBO, offering fresh insights into the
interpretability and inherent biases of VAEs.

Abstract: Canonical algorithms for multi-armed bandits typically assume a stationary
reward environment where the size of the action space (number of arms) is
small. More recently developed methods typically relax only one of these
assumptions: existing non-stationary bandit policies are designed for a small
number of arms, while Lipschitz, linear, and Gaussian process bandit policies
are designed to handle a large (or infinite) number of arms in stationary
reward environments under constraints on the reward function. In this
manuscript, we propose a novel policy to learn reward environments over a
continuous space using Gaussian interpolation. We show that our method
efficiently learns continuous Lipschitz reward functions with
$\mathcal{O}^*(\sqrt{T})$ cumulative regret. Furthermore, our method naturally
extends to non-stationary problems with a simple modification. We finally
demonstrate that our method is computationally favorable (100-10000x faster)
and experimentally outperforms sliding Gaussian process policies on datasets
with non-stationarity and an extremely large number of arms.

loss function explicitly designed for repository-level retrieval. On SWE-bench

substantially improves retrieval recall by at least 15 percentage points over
existing models, and ablate the design choices to show their importance in

Abstract: Memristor-based hardware offers new possibilities for energy-efficient

Current hardware prototypes cannot fit large neural networks, and related

Conclusion: SMRFL有效提升了联邦学习模型对扰动的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a promising paradigm for realizing edge
intelligence, allowing collaborative learning among distributed edge devices by
sharing models instead of raw data. However, the shared models are often
assumed to be ideal, which would be inevitably violated in practice due to
various perturbations, leading to significant performance degradation. To
overcome this challenge, we propose a novel method, termed Sharpness-Aware
Minimization-based Robust Federated Learning (SMRFL), which aims to improve
model robustness against perturbations by exploring the geometrical property of
the model landscape. Specifically, SMRFL solves a min-max optimization problem
that promotes model convergence towards a flat minimum by minimizing the
maximum loss within a neighborhood of the model parameters. In this way, model
sensitivity to perturbations is reduced, and robustness is enhanced since
models in the neighborhood of the flat minimum also enjoy low loss values. The
theoretical result proves that SMRFL can converge at the same rate as FL
without perturbations. Extensive experimental results show that SMRFL
significantly enhances robustness against perturbations compared to three
baseline methods on two real-world datasets under three perturbation scenarios.

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of differentially private empirical risk

\frac{|S_{\mathrm{out}}|}{\gamma n}\right)$ where $n$ is the number of data
points, $S_{\mathrm{out}}$ is an arbitrary subset of data one can remove and
$\gamma$ is the margin of linear separation of the remaining data points (after
$S_{\mathrm{out}}$ is removed). Here, $\tilde{O}(\cdot)$ hides only logarithmic
terms. In the agnostic case, we improve the existing results when the number of
outliers is small. Our algorithm is highly adaptive because it does not require
knowing the margin parameter $\gamma$ or outlier subset $S_{\mathrm{out}}$. We
also derive a utility bound for the advanced private hyperparameter tuning
algorithm.

The proposition states that a lossy compression process is equivalent to {\it

originated from the observed behaviour in newly proposed {\it Dual Tomographic
Compression} (DTC) compress-train framework. This is akin to tomographic
reconstruction of layer weight matrices via building compressed sensed

to previous and next layers in a dual fashion, that triggers neuronal-level
pruning. This novel model compress-train scheme appear in iterative fashion and

this dual-tomography producing state-of-the-art performance with efficient
compression during training, accelerating and supporting lottery ticket
hypothesis. However, random compress-train iterations having similar
performance demonstrated the connection between randomness and compression from

Motivation: 传统反欺骗研究忽视情感多样性，导致对高质量情感合成语音的鲁棒性不足。

Method: 引入EmoSpoof-TTS数据集，提出GEM（基于情感识别门控网络的集成模型）。

Result: 现有模型在情感语音上表现不佳，GEM显著提升防御效果。

Conclusion: 需关注情感反欺骗范式，GEM为有效解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional anti-spoofing focuses on models and datasets built on synthetic
speech with mostly neutral state, neglecting diverse emotional variations. As a
result, their robustness against high-quality, emotionally expressive synthetic
speech is uncertain. We address this by introducing EmoSpoof-TTS, a corpus of
emotional text-to-speech samples. Our analysis shows existing anti-spoofing
models struggle with emotional synthetic speech, exposing risks of
emotion-targeted attacks. Even trained on emotional data, the models
underperform due to limited focus on emotional aspect and show performance
disparities across emotions. This highlights the need for emotion-focused
anti-spoofing paradigm in both dataset and methodology. We propose GEM, a gated
ensemble of emotion-specialized models with a speech emotion recognition gating
network. GEM performs effectively across all emotions and neutral state,
improving defenses against spoofing attacks. We release the EmoSpoof-TTS

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer low-latency and energy-efficient
decision making through neuromorphic hardware, making them compelling for
Reinforcement Learning (RL) in resource-constrained edge devices. Recent
studies in this field directly replace Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) by
SNNs in existing RL frameworks, overlooking whether the RL algorithm is
suitable for SNNs. However, most RL algorithms in continuous control are
designed tailored to ANNs, including the target network soft updates mechanism,
which conflict with the discrete, non-differentiable dynamics of SNN spikes. We
identify that this mismatch destabilizes SNN training in continuous control
tasks. To bridge this gap between discrete SNN and continuous control, we
propose a novel proxy target framework. The continuous and differentiable
dynamics of the proxy target enable smooth updates, bypassing the
incompatibility of SNN spikes, stabilizing the RL algorithms. Since the proxy
network operates only during training, the SNN retains its energy efficiency
during deployment without inference overhead. Extensive experiments on
continuous control benchmarks demonstrate that compared to vanilla SNNs, the
proxy target framework enables SNNs to achieve up to 32% higher performance
across different spiking neurons. Notably, we are the first to surpass ANN
performance in continuous control with simple Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire (LIF)
neurons. This work motivates a new class of SNN-friendly RL algorithms tailored
to SNN's characteristics, paving the way for neuromorphic agents that combine
high performance with low power consumption.

Abstract: Protein dynamics play a crucial role in protein biological functions and
properties, and their traditional study typically relies on time-consuming
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations conducted in silico. Recent advances in
generative modeling, particularly denoising diffusion models, have enabled
efficient accurate protein structure prediction and conformation sampling by
learning distributions over crystallographic structures. However, effectively
integrating physical supervision into these data-driven approaches remains
challenging, as standard energy-based objectives often lead to intractable
optimization. In this paper, we introduce Energy-based Alignment (EBA), a
method that aligns generative models with feedback from physical models,
efficiently calibrating them to appropriately balance conformational states
based on their energy differences. Experimental results on the MD ensemble
benchmark demonstrate that EBA achieves state-of-the-art performance in
generating high-quality protein ensembles. By improving the physical
plausibility of generated structures, our approach enhances model predictions
and holds promise for applications in structural biology and drug discovery.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) has become an essential machine learning tool for
addressing multiple learning tasks simultaneously and has been effectively
applied across fields such as healthcare, marketing, and biomedical research.
However, to enable efficient information sharing across tasks, it is crucial to
leverage both shared and heterogeneous information. Despite extensive research
on MTL, various forms of heterogeneity, including distribution and posterior
heterogeneity, present significant challenges. Existing methods often fail to
address these forms of heterogeneity within a unified framework. In this paper,
we propose a dual-encoder framework to construct a heterogeneous latent factor
space for each task, incorporating a task-shared encoder to capture common
information across tasks and a task-specific encoder to preserve unique task
characteristics. Additionally, we explore the intrinsic similarity structure of
the coefficients corresponding to learned latent factors, allowing for adaptive
integration across tasks to manage posterior heterogeneity. We introduce a
unified algorithm that alternately learns the task-specific and task-shared
encoders and coefficients. In theory, we investigate the excess risk bound for
the proposed MTL method using local Rademacher complexity and apply it to a new
but related task. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that the proposed
method outperforms existing data integration methods across various settings.
Furthermore, the proposed method achieves superior predictive performance for
time to tumor doubling across five distinct cancer types in PDX data.

Abstract: Data fusion techniques integrate information from heterogeneous data sources
to improve learning, generalization, and decision making across data sciences.
In causal inference, these methods leverage rich observational data to improve
causal effect estimation, while maintaining the trustworthiness of randomized
controlled trials. Existing approaches often relax the strong no unobserved
confounding assumption by instead assuming exchangeability of counterfactual
outcomes across data sources. However, when both assumptions simultaneously
fail - a common scenario in practice - current methods cannot identify or
estimate causal effects. We address this limitation by proposing a novel
partial identification framework that enables researchers to answer key
questions such as: Is the causal effect positive or negative? and How severe
must assumption violations be to overturn this conclusion? Our approach
introduces interpretable sensitivity parameters that quantify assumption
violations and derives corresponding causal effect bounds. We develop doubly
robust estimators for these bounds and operationalize breakdown frontier
analysis to understand how causal conclusions change as assumption violations
increase. We apply our framework to the Project STAR study, which investigates
the effect of classroom size on students' third-grade standardized test
performance. Our analysis reveals that the Project STAR results are robust to
simultaneous violations of key assumptions, both on average and across various
subgroups of interest. This strengthens confidence in the study's conclusions
despite potential unmeasured biases in the data.

Abstract: Bayesian models based on Gaussian processes (GPs) offer a flexible framework
to predict spatially distributed variables with uncertainty. But the use of
nonstationary priors, often necessary for capturing complex spatial patterns,
makes sampling from the predictive posterior distribution (PPD) computationally
intractable. In this paper, we propose a two-step approach based on diffusion
generative models (DGMs) to mimic PPDs associated with non-stationary GP
priors: we replace the GP prior by a DGM surrogate, and leverage recent
advances on training-free guidance algorithms for DGMs to sample from the
desired posterior distribution. We apply our approach to a rich non-stationary
GP prior from which exact posterior sampling is untractable and validate that
the issuing distributions are close to their GP counterpart using several
statistical metrics. We also demonstrate how one can fine-tune the trained DGMs
to target specific parts of the GP prior. Finally we apply the proposed
approach to solve inverse problems arising in environmental sciences, thus
yielding state-of-the-art predictions.

Abstract: Modern deep neural networks exhibit strong generalization even in highly
overparameterized regimes. Significant progress has been made to understand
this phenomenon in the context of supervised learning, but for unsupervised
tasks such as denoising, several open questions remain. While some recent works
have successfully characterized the test error of the linear denoising problem,
they are limited to linear models (one-layer network). In this work, we focus
on two-layer linear denoising autoencoders trained under gradient flow,
incorporating two key ingredients of modern deep learning architectures: A
low-dimensional bottleneck layer that effectively enforces a rank constraint on
the learned solution, as well as the possibility of a skip connection that
bypasses the bottleneck. We derive closed-form expressions for all critical
points of this model under product regularization, and in particular describe
its global minimizer under the minimum-norm principle. From there, we derive
the test risk formula in the overparameterized regime, both for models with and
without skip connections. Our analysis reveals two interesting phenomena:
Firstly, the bottleneck layer introduces an additional complexity measure akin
to the classical bias-variance trade-off -- increasing the bottleneck width
reduces bias but introduces variance, and vice versa. Secondly, skip connection
can mitigate the variance in denoising autoencoders -- especially when the
model is mildly overparameterized. We further analyze the impact of skip
connections in denoising autoencoder using random matrix theory and support our
claims with numerical evidence.

Abstract: Diffusion models trained on finite datasets with $N$ samples from a target
distribution exhibit a transition from memorisation, where the model reproduces
training examples, to generalisation, where it produces novel samples that
reflect the underlying data distribution. Understanding this transition is key
to characterising the sample efficiency and reliability of generative models,
but our theoretical understanding of this transition is incomplete. Here, we
analytically study the memorisation-to-generalisation transition in a simple
model using linear denoisers, which allow explicit computation of test errors,
sampling distributions, and Kullback-Leibler divergences between samples and
target distribution. Using these measures, we predict that this transition
occurs roughly when $N \asymp d$, the dimension of the inputs. When $N$ is
smaller than the dimension of the inputs $d$, so that only a fraction of
relevant directions of variation are present in the training data, we
demonstrate how both regularization and early stopping help to prevent
overfitting. For $N > d$, we find that the sampling distributions of linear
diffusion models approach their optimum (measured by the Kullback-Leibler
divergence) linearly with $d/N$, independent of the specifics of the data
distribution. Our work clarifies how sample complexity governs generalisation
in a simple model of diffusion-based generative models and provides insight
into the training dynamics of linear denoisers.

Abstract: For three decades statistical mechanics has been providing a framework to
analyse neural networks. However, the theoretically tractable models, e.g.,
perceptrons, random features models and kernel machines, or multi-index models
and committee machines with few neurons, remained simple compared to those used
in applications. In this paper we help reducing the gap between practical
networks and their theoretical understanding through a statistical physics
analysis of the supervised learning of a two-layer fully connected network with
generic weight distribution and activation function, whose hidden layer is
large but remains proportional to the inputs dimension. This makes it more
realistic than infinitely wide networks where no feature learning occurs, but
also more expressive than narrow ones or with fixed inner weights. We focus on
the Bayes-optimal learning in the teacher-student scenario, i.e., with a
dataset generated by another network with the same architecture. We operate
around interpolation, where the number of trainable parameters and of data are
comparable and feature learning emerges. Our analysis uncovers a rich
phenomenology with various learning transitions as the number of data
increases. In particular, the more strongly the features (i.e., hidden neurons
of the target) contribute to the observed responses, the less data is needed to
learn them. Moreover, when the data is scarce, the model only learns non-linear
combinations of the teacher weights, rather than "specialising" by aligning its
weights with the teacher's. Specialisation occurs only when enough data becomes
available, but it can be hard to find for practical training algorithms,
possibly due to statistical-to-computational~gaps.

Abstract: On-device learning at the edge enables low-latency, private personalization
with improved long-term robustness and reduced maintenance costs. Yet,
achieving scalable, low-power end-to-end on-chip learning, especially from
real-world sequential data with a limited number of examples, is an open
challenge. Indeed, accelerators supporting error backpropagation optimize for
learning performance at the expense of inference efficiency, while simplified
learning algorithms often fail to reach acceptable accuracy targets. In this
work, we present Chameleon, leveraging three key contributions to solve these
challenges. (i) A unified learning and inference architecture supports few-shot
learning (FSL), continual learning (CL) and inference at only 0.5% area
overhead to the inference logic. (ii) Long temporal dependencies are
efficiently captured with temporal convolutional networks (TCNs), enabling the
first demonstration of end-to-end on-chip FSL and CL on sequential data and
inference on 16-kHz raw audio. (iii) A dual-mode, matrix-multiplication-free
compute array allows either matching the power consumption of state-of-the-art
inference-only keyword spotting (KWS) accelerators or enabling $4.3\times$
higher peak GOPS. Fabricated in 40-nm CMOS, Chameleon sets new accuracy records

Abstract: Drug repositioning aims to identify potential new indications for existing
drugs to reduce the time and financial costs associated with developing new
drugs. Most existing deep learning-based drug repositioning methods
predominantly utilize graph-based representations. However, graph-based drug
repositioning methods struggle to perform effective inference in cold-start
scenarios involving novel drugs because of the lack of association information
with the diseases. Unlike traditional graph-based approaches, we propose a
bidirectional behavior learning strategy for drug repositioning, known as
BiBLDR. This innovative framework redefines drug repositioning as a behavior
sequential learning task to capture drug-disease interaction patterns. First,
we construct bidirectional behavioral sequences based on drug and disease
sides. The consideration of bidirectional information ensures a more meticulous
and rigorous characterization of the behavioral sequences. Subsequently, we
propose a two-stage strategy for drug repositioning. In the first stage, we
construct prototype spaces to characterize the representational attributes of
drugs and diseases. In the second stage, these refined prototypes and
bidirectional behavior sequence data are leveraged to predict potential
drug-disease associations. Based on this learning approach, the model can more
robustly and precisely capture the interactive relationships between drug and
disease features from bidirectional behavioral sequences. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark
datasets. Meanwhile, BiBLDR demonstrates significantly superior performance
compared to previous methods in cold-start scenarios. Our code is published in

builds upon and extends the $\varepsilon$-prediction framework by Cohen-Addad,
d'Orsi, Gupta, Lee, and Panigrahi (NeurIPS 2024). We consider an edge-based
version of this model, where each edge provides two bits of information,
corresponding to predictions about whether each of its endpoints belong to an
optimal solution. Even with weak predictions where each bit is only
$\varepsilon$-correlated with the true solution, this information allows us to
break approximation barriers in the standard setting. We develop algorithms
with improved approximation ratios for MaxCut, Vertex Cover, Set Cover, and
Maximum Independent Set problems (among others). Across these problems, our
algorithms share a unifying theme, where we separately satisfy constraints
related to high degree vertices (using predictions) and low-degree vertices
(without using predictions) and carefully combine the answers.

Abstract: Although many previous studies have carried out multimodal learning with
real-time MRI data that captures the audio-visual kinematics of the vocal tract
during speech, these studies have been limited by their reliance on
multi-speaker corpora. This prevents such models from learning a detailed
relationship between acoustics and articulation due to considerable
cross-speaker variability. In this study, we develop unimodal audio and video
models as well as multimodal models for phoneme recognition using a long-form
single-speaker MRI corpus, with the goal of disentangling and interpreting the
contributions of each modality. Audio and multimodal models show similar
performance on different phonetic manner classes but diverge on places of
articulation. Interpretation of the models' latent space shows similar encoding
of the phonetic space across audio and multimodal models, while the models'
attention weights highlight differences in acoustic and articulatory timing for
certain phonemes.

Abstract: Length of stay (LOS) prediction in acute stroke is critical for improving
care planning. Existing machine learning models have shown suboptimal
predictive performance, limited generalisability, and have overlooked
system-level factors. We aimed to enhance model efficiency, performance, and
interpretability by refining predictors and developing an interpretable
multi-level stacking ensemble model. Data were accessed from the biennial
Stroke Foundation Acute Audit (2015, 2017, 2019, 2021) in Australia. Models
were developed for ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke separately. The outcome
was prolonged LOS (the LOS above the 75th percentile). Candidate predictors
(ischaemic: n=89; haemorrhagic: n=83) were categorised into patient, clinical,
and system domains. Feature selection with correlation-based approaches was
used to refine key predictors. The evaluation of models included discrimination
(AUC), calibration curves, and interpretability (SHAP plots). In ischaemic
stroke (N=12,575), prolonged LOS was >=9 days, compared to >=11 days in
haemorrhagic stroke (N=1,970). The ensemble model achieved superior performance
[AUC: 0.824 (95% CI: 0.801-0.846)] and statistically outperformed logistic
regression [AUC: 0.805 (95% CI: 0.782-0.829); P=0.0004] for ischaemic. However,
the model [AUC: 0.843 (95% CI: 0.790-0.895)] did not statistically outperform
logistic regression [AUC: 0.828 (95% CI: 0.774-0.882); P=0.136] for
haemorrhagic. SHAP analysis identified shared predictors for both types of
stroke: rehabilitation assessment, urinary incontinence, stroke unit care,
inability to walk independently, physiotherapy, and stroke care coordinators
involvement. An explainable ensemble model effectively predicted the prolonged
LOS in ischaemic stroke. Further validation in larger cohorts is needed for
haemorrhagic stroke.

Abstract: Analog/Mixed-Signal (AMS) circuits play a critical role in the integrated
circuit (IC) industry. However, automating Analog/Mixed-Signal (AMS) circuit
design has remained a longstanding challenge due to its difficulty and
complexity. Recent advances in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer
promising potential for supporting AMS circuit analysis and design. However,
current research typically evaluates MLLMs on isolated tasks within the domain,
lacking a comprehensive benchmark that systematically assesses model
capabilities across diverse AMS-related challenges. To address this gap, we
introduce AMSbench, a benchmark suite designed to evaluate MLLM performance
across critical tasks including circuit schematic perception, circuit analysis,
and circuit design. AMSbench comprises approximately 8000 test questions
spanning multiple difficulty levels and assesses eight prominent models,
encompassing both open-source and proprietary solutions such as Qwen 2.5-VL and
Gemini 2.5 Pro. Our evaluation highlights significant limitations in current
MLLMs, particularly in complex multi-modal reasoning and sophisticated circuit
design tasks. These results underscore the necessity of advancing MLLMs'
understanding and effective application of circuit-specific knowledge, thereby
narrowing the existing performance gap relative to human expertise and moving
toward fully automated AMS circuit design workflows. Our data is released at

Abstract: Gene selection in high-dimensional genomic data is essential for
understanding disease mechanisms and improving therapeutic outcomes.
Traditional feature selection methods effectively identify predictive genes but
often ignore complex biological pathways and regulatory networks, leading to
unstable and biologically irrelevant signatures. Prior approaches, such as
Lasso-based methods and statistical filtering, either focus solely on
individual gene-outcome associations or fail to capture pathway-level
interactions, presenting a key challenge: how to integrate biological pathway
knowledge while maintaining statistical rigor in gene selection? To address
this gap, we propose a novel two-stage framework that integrates statistical
selection with biological pathway knowledge using multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL). First, we introduce a pathway-guided pre-filtering strategy
that leverages multiple statistical methods alongside KEGG pathway information
for initial dimensionality reduction. Next, for refined selection, we model
genes as collaborative agents in a MARL framework, where each agent optimizes
both predictive power and biological relevance. Our framework incorporates
pathway knowledge through Graph Neural Network-based state representations, a
reward mechanism combining prediction performance with gene centrality and
pathway coverage, and collaborative learning strategies using shared memory and
a centralized critic component. Extensive experiments on multiple gene
expression datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves both
prediction accuracy and biological interpretability compared to traditional
methods.

Conclusion: 结合动态分析和深度学习的方法在恶意软件分类中表现优异。

Abstract: Malware detection and classification remains a topic of concern for
cybersecurity, since it is becoming common for attackers to use advanced
obfuscation on their malware to stay undetected. Conventional static analysis
is not effective against polymorphic and metamorphic malware as these change
their appearance without modifying their behavior, thus defying the analysis by
code structure alone. This makes it important to use dynamic detection that
monitors malware behavior at runtime. In this paper, we present a dynamic
malware categorization framework that extracts API argument calls at the
runtime execution of Windows Portable Executable (PE) files. Extracting and
encoding the dynamic features of API names, argument return values, and other
relative features, we convert raw behavioral data to temporal patterns. To
enhance feature portrayal, the generated patterns are subsequently converted
into grayscale pictures using a magma colormap. These improved photos are used
to teach a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model discriminative features,
which allows for reliable and accurate malware classification. Results from
experiments indicate that our method, with an average accuracy of 98.36% is
effective in classifying different classes of malware and benign by integrating
dynamic analysis and deep learning. It not only achieves high classification
accuracy but also demonstrates significant resilience against typical evasion
strategies.

method using intrinsic measures for unsupervised learning, including the
silhouette coefficient, Calinski-Harabasz index, and Davies-Bouldin index, and
extend it to anomaly detection by identifying points whose assignment causes a

Abstract: Automated evaluation of movement quality holds significant potential for

generates realistic IMU data using musculoskeletal simulations integrated with
systematic modifications of movement trajectories. Crucially, our approach
ensures biomechanical plausibility and allows for automatic, reliable labeling
by combining inverse kinematic parameters with a knowledge-based evaluation
strategy. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that augmented variants closely
resembles real-world data, significantly improving the classification accuracy
and generalization capability of neural network models. Additionally, we
highlight the benefits of augmented data for patient-specific fine-tuning
scenarios, particularly when only limited subject-specific training examples

augmentation method in overcoming common challenges faced by deep learning
applications in physiotherapeutic exercise evaluation.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework consisting of a class of algebraic structures

defining per-axis composition operators subject to non-commutativity and a
global interchange law. These structures, defined recursively from a base case
of vector-matrix pairs, model directional composition in multiple dimensions
while preserving structural coherence through commutative linear operators.
  We show that the framework that unifies several well-known linear transforms
in signal processing and data analysis. In this framework, data indices are
embedded into a composite structure that decomposes into simpler components. We
show that classic transforms such as the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), the
Walsh transform, and the Hadamard transform are special cases of our algebraic
structure. The framework provides a systematic way to derive these transforms
by appropriately choosing vector and matrix pairs. By subsuming classical
transforms within a common structure, the framework also enables the
development of learnable transformations tailored to specific data modalities

Abstract: In this paper, we propose HLSAD, a novel method for detecting anomalies in

techniques have been extensively studied, they often fail to capture changes in
higher-order interactions that are crucial for identifying complex structural
anomalies. These higher-order interactions can arise either directly from the
underlying data itself or through graph lifting techniques. Our approach
leverages the spectral properties of Hodge Laplacians of simplicial complexes
to effectively model multi-way interactions among data points. By incorporating
higher-dimensional simplicial structures into our method, our method enhances
both detection accuracy and computational efficiency. Through comprehensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our
approach outperforms existing graph methods in detecting both events and change
points.

Abstract: Complex piezoelectric systems are foundational in industrial applications.
Their performance, however, is challenged by the nonlinear voltage-displacement
hysteretic relationships. Efficient characterization methods are, therefore,
essential for reliable design, monitoring, and maintenance. Recently proposed
neural operator methods serve as surrogates for system characterization but
face two pressing issues: interpretability and generalizability.
State-of-the-art (SOTA) neural operators are black-boxes, providing little
insight into the learned operator. Additionally, generalizing them to novel
voltages and predicting displacement profiles beyond the training domain is
challenging, limiting their practical use. To address these limitations, this
paper proposes a neuro-symbolic operator (NSO) framework that derives the
analytical operators governing hysteretic relationships. NSO first learns a
Fourier neural operator mapping voltage fields to displacement profiles,
followed by a library-based sparse model discovery method, generating white-box
parsimonious models governing the underlying hysteresis. These models enable
accurate and interpretable prediction of displacement profiles across varying
and out-of-distribution voltage fields, facilitating generalizability. The
potential of NSO is demonstrated by accurately predicting voltage-displacement
hysteresis, including butterfly-shaped relationships. Moreover, NSO predicts
displacement profiles even for noisy and low-fidelity voltage data, emphasizing
its robustness. The results highlight the advantages of NSO compared to SOTA
neural operators and model discovery methods on several evaluation metrics.
Consequently, NSO contributes to characterizing complex piezoelectric systems
while improving the interpretability and generalizability of neural operators,
essential for design, monitoring, maintenance, and other real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Despite well-documented consequences of the U.S. government's 1930s housing

precise financial effects due to the inaccessibility of historical property
appraisal records. Many counties still store these records in physical formats,
making large-scale quantitative analysis difficult. We present an approach
scholars can use to digitize historical housing assessment data, applying it to
build and release a dataset for one county. Starting from publicly available
scanned documents, we manually annotated property cards for over 12,000
properties to train and validate our methods. We use OCR to label data for an
additional 50,000 properties, based on our two-stage approach combining
classical computer vision techniques with deep learning-based OCR. For cases
where OCR cannot be applied, such as when scanned documents are not available,
we show how a regression model based on building feature data can estimate the
historical values, and test the generalizability of this model to other
counties. With these cost-effective tools, scholars, community activists, and
policy makers can better analyze and understand the historical impacts of
redlining.

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is fundamental to solving complex
decision-making problems. The proliferation of MILP instance generation
methods, driven by machine learning's demand for diverse optimization datasets
and the limitations of static benchmarks, has significantly outpaced
standardized evaluation techniques. Consequently, assessing the fidelity and
utility of synthetic MILP instances remains a critical, multifaceted challenge.
This paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark framework designed for the
systematic and objective evaluation of MILP instance generation methods. Our
framework provides a unified and extensible methodology, assessing instance
quality across crucial dimensions: mathematical validity, structural
similarity, computational hardness, and utility in downstream machine learning
tasks. A key innovation is its in-depth analysis of solver-internal features --
particularly by comparing distributions of key solver outputs including root
node gap, heuristic success rates, and cut plane usage -- leveraging the
solver's dynamic solution behavior as an `expert assessment' to reveal nuanced
computational resemblances. By offering a structured approach with clearly
defined solver-independent and solver-dependent metrics, our benchmark aims to
facilitate robust comparisons among diverse generation techniques, spur the
development of higher-quality instance generators, and ultimately enhance the
reliability of research reliant on synthetic MILP data. The framework's
effectiveness in systematically comparing the fidelity of instance sets is

general approach to enhance data processing and classification across HQCNNs,
and a customized strategy that dynamically generates samples tailored to the
HQCNN's performance on specific data categories, improving its ability to learn
from complex datasets. Simulation experiments on the MNIST dataset demonstrate
that QGAN outperforms traditional data augmentation methods and classical GANs.
Compared to baseline DCGAN, QGAN achieves comparable performance with half the
parameters, balancing efficiency and effectiveness. This suggests that QGANs
can simplify models and generate high-quality data, enhancing HQCNN accuracy

Abstract: This paper introduces an unsupervised framework for detecting audio patterns
in musical samples (loops) through anomaly detection techniques, addressing
challenges in music information retrieval (MIR). Existing methods are often
constrained by reliance on handcrafted features, domain-specific limitations,
or dependence on iterative user interaction. We address these limitations
through an architecture combining deep feature extraction with unsupervised
anomaly detection. Our approach leverages a pre-trained Hierarchical
Token-semantic Audio Transformer (HTS-AT), paired with a Feature Fusion
Mechanism (FFM), to generate representations from variable-length audio loops.
These embeddings are processed using one-class Deep Support Vector Data
Description (Deep SVDD), which learns normative audio patterns by mapping them
to a compact latent hypersphere. Evaluations on curated bass and guitar
datasets compare standard and residual autoencoder variants against baselines
like Isolation Forest (IF) and and principle component analysis (PCA) methods.
Results show our Deep SVDD models, especially the residual autoencoder variant,
deliver improved anomaly separation, particularly for larger variations. This
research contributes a flexible, fully unsupervised solution for processing
diverse audio samples, overcoming previous structural and input limitations
while enabling effective pattern identification through distance-based latent
space scoring.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the A2 Copula Spatial Bayesian Neural Network
(A2-SBNN), a predictive spatial model designed to map coordinates to continuous
fields while capturing both typical spatial patterns and extreme dependencies.
By embedding the dual-tail novel Archimedean copula viz. A2 directly into the
network's weight initialization, A2-SBNN naturally models complex spatial
relationships, including rare co-movements in the data. The model is trained
through a calibration-driven process combining Wasserstein loss, moment
matching, and correlation penalties to refine predictions and manage
uncertainty. Simulation results show that A2-SBNN consistently delivers high
accuracy across a wide range of dependency strengths, offering a new, effective
solution for spatial data modeling beyond traditional Gaussian-based
approaches.

Abstract: We have developed an algorithm that constructs a model of a reconfigurable
optical interferometer, independent of specific architectural constraints. The
programming of unitary transformations on the interferometer's optical modes
relies on either an analytical method for deriving the unitary matrix from a
set of phase shifts or an optimization routine when such decomposition is not
available. Our algorithm employs a supervised learning approach, aligning the
interferometer model with a training set derived from the device being studied.
A straightforward optimization procedure leverages this trained model to
determine the phase shifts of the interferometer with a specific architecture,
obtaining the required unitary transformation. This approach enables the
effective tuning of interferometers without requiring a precise analytical
solution, paving the way for the exploration of new interferometric circuit
architectures.

Abstract: Given finite-dimensional random vectors $Y$, $X$, and $Z$ that form a Markov
chain in that order (i.e., $Y \to X \to Z$), we derive upper bounds on the
excess minimum risk using generalized information divergence measures. Here,
$Y$ is a target vector to be estimated from an observed feature vector $X$ or
its stochastically degraded version $Z$. The excess minimum risk is defined as
the difference between the minimum expected loss in estimating $Y$ from $X$ and
from $Z$. We present a family of bounds that generalize the mutual information
based bound of Gy\"orfi et al. (2023), using the R\'enyi and
$\alpha$-Jensen-Shannon divergences, as well as Sibson's mutual information.
Our bounds are similar to those developed by Modak et al. (2021) and Aminian et
al. (2024) for the generalization error of learning algorithms. However, unlike
these works, our bounds do not require the sub-Gaussian parameter to be
constant and therefore apply to a broader class of joint distributions over
$Y$, $X$, and $Z$. We also provide numerical examples under both constant and
non-constant sub-Gaussianity assumptions, illustrating that our generalized
divergence based bounds can be tighter than the one based on mutual information
for certain regimes of the parameter $\alpha$.

Abstract: We consider a standard distributed optimization problem in which networked
nodes collaboratively minimize the sum of their locally known convex costs. For
this setting, we address for the first time the fundamental problem of design
and analysis of distributed methods to solve the above problem when inter-node
communication is subject to \emph{heavy-tailed} noise. Heavy-tailed noise is
highly relevant and frequently arises in densely deployed wireless sensor and
Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Specifically, we design a distributed
gradient-type method that features a carefully balanced mixed time-scale
time-varying consensus and gradient contribution step sizes and a bounded
nonlinear operator on the consensus update to limit the effect of heavy-tailed
noise. Assuming heterogeneous strongly convex local costs with mutually
different minimizers that are arbitrarily far apart, we show that the proposed
method converges to a neighborhood of the network-wide problem solution in the
mean squared error (MSE) sense, and we also characterize the corresponding
convergence rate. We further show that the asymptotic MSE can be made
arbitrarily small through consensus step-size tuning, possibly at the cost of
slowing down the transient error decay. Numerical experiments corroborate our
findings and demonstrate the resilience of the proposed method to heavy-tailed
(and infinite variance) communication noise. They also show that existing
distributed methods, designed for finite-communication-noise-variance settings,
fail in the presence of infinite variance noise.

Abstract: Kernel method-based intensity estimators, formulated within reproducing
kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs), and classical kernel intensity estimators (KIEs)
have been among the most easy-to-implement and feasible methods for estimating
the intensity functions of inhomogeneous Poisson processes. While both
approaches share the term "kernel", they are founded on distinct theoretical
principles, each with its own strengths and limitations. In this paper, we
propose a novel regularized kernel method for Poisson processes based on the
least squares loss and show that the resulting intensity estimator involves a
specialized variant of the representer theorem: it has the dual coefficient of
unity and coincides with classical KIEs. This result provides new theoretical
insights into the connection between classical KIEs and kernel method-based
intensity estimators, while enabling us to develop an efficient KIE by
leveraging advanced techniques from RKHS theory. We refer to the proposed model
as the kernel method-based kernel intensity estimator (K$^2$IE). Through
experiments on synthetic datasets, we show that K$^2$IE achieves comparable
predictive performance while significantly surpassing the state-of-the-art
kernel method-based estimator in computational efficiency.

Motivation: 传统压缩感知方法（如LASSO）在支持选择和信号估计中缺乏显式错误控制，导致信号恢复不可靠。本文旨在通过统计Knockoff滤波器实现FDR控制，提升信号恢复的准确性和可靠性。

Method: 提出Knockoff-guided压缩感知框架，分离并控制支持恢复过程，利用Knockoff滤波器实现FDR控制，确保在有限样本下的理论保证。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Knockoff-guided compressive sensing framework,
referred to as \TheName{}, which enhances signal recovery by leveraging precise
false discovery rate (FDR) control during the support identification phase.
Unlike LASSO, which jointly performs support selection and signal estimation
without explicit error control, our method guarantees FDR control in finite
samples, enabling more reliable identification of the true signal support. By
separating and controlling the support recovery process through statistical
Knockoff filters, our framework achieves more accurate signal reconstruction,
especially in challenging scenarios where traditional methods fail. We
establish theoretical guarantees demonstrating how FDR control directly ensures
recovery performance under weaker conditions than traditional $\ell_1$-based
compressive sensing methods, while maintaining accurate signal reconstruction.
Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed Knockoff-based
method consistently outperforms LASSO-based and other state-of-the-art
compressive sensing techniques. In simulation studies, our method improves
F1-score by up to 3.9x over baseline methods, attributed to principled false
discovery rate (FDR) control and enhanced support recovery. The method also
consistently yields lower reconstruction and relative errors. We further
validate the framework on real-world datasets, where it achieves top downstream
predictive performance across both regression and classification tasks, often
narrowing or even surpassing the performance gap relative to uncompressed
signals. These results establish \TheName{} as a robust and practical
alternative to existing approaches, offering both theoretical guarantees and
strong empirical performance through statistically grounded support selection.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, highlighted the critical need
for accurate prediction of disease severity to optimize healthcare resource

metadata from South American patients. Methods: We retrieved 9,570 spike
protein sequences from the GISAID database, of which 3,467 met inclusion
criteria after standardization. The dataset included 2,313 severe and 1,154
mild cases. A feature engineering pipeline extracted features from sequences,
while demographic and clinical variables were one-hot encoded. A hybrid
CNN-LSTM architecture was trained, combining CNN layers for local pattern
extraction and an LSTM layer for long-term dependency modeling. Results: The
model achieved an F1 score of 82.92%, ROC-AUC of 0.9084, precision of 83.56%,
and recall of 82.85%, demonstrating robust classification performance. Training
stabilized at 85% accuracy with minimal overfitting. The most prevalent
lineages (P.1, AY.99.2) and clades (GR, GK) aligned with regional
epidemiological trends, suggesting potential associations between viral
genetics and clinical outcomes. Conclusion: The CNN-LSTM hybrid model

Abstract: The Optimal Reactive Power Dispatch (ORPD) problem plays a crucial role in
power system operations, ensuring voltage stability and minimizing power
losses. Recent advances in machine learning, particularly within the ``learning
to optimize'' framework, have enabled fast and efficient approximations of ORPD
solutions, typically by training models on precomputed optimization results.
While these approaches have demonstrated promising performance on synthetic
datasets, their effectiveness under real-world grid conditions remains largely
unexplored. This paper makes two key contributions. First, we introduce a
publicly available power system dataset that includes both the structural
characteristics of Uruguay's electrical grid and nearly two years of real-world
operational data, encompassing actual demand and generation profiles. Given
Uruguay's high penetration of renewable energy, the ORPD problem has become the
primary optimization challenge in its power network. Second, we assess the
impact of real-world data on learning-based ORPD solutions, revealing a
significant increase in prediction errors when transitioning from synthetic to
actual demand and generation inputs. Our results highlight the limitations of
existing models in learning under the complex statistical properties of real
grid conditions and emphasize the need for more expressive architectures. By
providing this dataset, we aim to facilitate further research into robust
learning-based optimization techniques for power system management.

Abstract: Penalties are fraught and game-changing moments in soccer games that teams
explicitly prepare for. Consequently, there has been substantial interest in
analyzing them in order to provide advice to practitioners. From a data science
perspective, such analyses suffer from a significant limitation: they make the
unrealistic simplifying assumption that goalkeepers and takers select their
action -- where to dive and where to the place the kick -- independently of
each other. In reality, the choices that some goalkeepers make depend on the
taker's movements and vice-versa. This adds substantial complexity to the
problem because not all players have the same action capacities, that is, only
some players are capable of basing their decisions on their opponent's
movements. However, the small sample sizes on the player level mean that one
may have limited insights into a specific opponent's capacities. We address
these challenges by developing a player-agnostic simulation framework that can
evaluate the efficacy of different goalkeeper strategies. It considers a rich
set of choices and incorporates information about a goalkeeper's skills. Our
work is grounded in a large dataset of penalties that were annotated by penalty
experts and include aspects of both kicker and goalkeeper strategies. We show
how our framework can be used to optimize goalkeeper policies in real-world
situations.

Abstract: Fund allocation has been an increasingly important problem in the financial
domain. In reality, we aim to allocate the funds to buy certain assets within a
certain future period. Naive solutions such as prediction-only or
Predict-then-Optimize approaches suffer from goal mismatch. Additionally, the
introduction of the SOTA time series forecasting model inevitably introduces
additional uncertainty in the predicted result. To solve both problems
mentioned above, we introduce a Risk-aware Time-Series Predict-and-Allocate

Such a framework contains three features: (i) end-to-end training with
objective alignment measurement, (ii) adaptive forecasting uncertainty
calibration, and (iii) agnostic towards forecasting models. The evaluation of
RTS-PnO is conducted over both online and offline experiments. For offline
experiments, eight datasets from three categories of financial applications are

competitive baselines. The online experiment is conducted on the Cross-Border

Abstract: Lung sound classification is vital for early diagnosis of respiratory

even among patients with the same symptoms, requiring a learning approach that
considers individual differences. We propose a Patient-Aware Feature Alignment
(PAFA) framework with two novel losses, Patient Cohesion-Separation Loss (PCSL)
and Global Patient Alignment Loss (GPAL). PCSL clusters features of the same
patient while separating those from other patients to capture patient
variability, whereas GPAL draws each patient's centroid toward a global center,
preventing feature space fragmentation. Our method achieves outstanding results
on the ICBHI dataset with a score of 64.84\% for four-class and 72.08\% for
two-class classification. These findings highlight PAFA's ability to capture
individualized patterns and demonstrate performance gains in distinct patient
clusters, offering broader applications for patient-centered healthcare.

Abstract: With the increasing brightness of Light sources, including the
Diffraction-Limited brightness upgrade of APS and the high-repetition-rate
upgrade of LCLS, the proposed experiments therein are becoming increasingly

be within a fraction of a micron in diameter, with pointing stability of a few
nanoradians, at the end of a kilometer-long electron accelerator, a
hundred-meter-long undulator section, and tens of meters long X-ray optics.
This enhancement of brightness will increase the data production rate to rival
the largest data generators in the world. Without real-time active feedback
control and an optimized pipeline to transform measurements to scientific
information and insights, researchers will drown in a deluge of mostly useless
data, and fail to extract the highly sophisticated insights that the recent

the Strait of Georgia, our model, CATFISH, achieves a state-of-the-art 96.63 %
percent test accuracy across varying source-sensor distances, surpassing the
previous benchmark by over 12 percentage points. We present the model, justify
our architectural choices, analyze the learned Gabor filters, and perform
ablation studies on sensor data fusion and attention-based pooling.

Abstract: The growth and characterization of materials using empirical optimization
typically requires a significant amount of expert time, experience, and
resources. Several complementary characterization methods are routinely
performed to determine the quality and properties of a grown sample. Machine
learning (ML) can support the conventional approaches by using historical data
to guide and provide speed and efficiency to the growth and characterization of
materials. Specifically, ML can provide quantitative information from
characterization data that is typically obtained from a different modality. In
this study, we have investigated the feasibility of projecting the quantitative
metric from microscopy measurements, such as atomic force microscopy (AFM),
using data obtained from spectroscopy measurements, like Raman spectroscopy.
Generative models were also trained to generate the full and specific features
of the Raman and photoluminescence spectra from each other and the AFM images
of the thin film MoS$_2$. The results are promising and have provided a
foundational guide for the use of ML for the cross-modal characterization of
materials for their accelerated, efficient, and cost-effective discovery.

Abstract: We perform an information-theoretic mode decomposition for separated wakes
around a wing. The current data-driven approach based on a neural network
referred to as deep sigmoidal flow enables the extraction of an informative
component from a given flow field snapshot with respect to a target variable at
a future time stamp, thereby capturing the causality as a time-varying modal
structure. We consider three examples of separated flows around a NACA0012
airfoil, namely, 1. laminar periodic wake at post-stall angles of attack, 2.
strong vortex-airfoil interactions, and 3. a turbulent wake in a
spanwise-periodic domain. The present approach reveals informative vortical
structures associated with a time-varying lift response. For the periodic
shedding cases, the informative structures vary in time corresponding to the
fluctuation level from their mean values. With the second example of
vortex-airfoil interactions, how the effect of vortex gust on a wing emerges in
the lift response over time is identified in an interpretable manner.
Furthermore, for the case of turbulent wake, the present model highlights
structures near the wing and vortex cores as informative components based
solely on the information metric without any prior knowledge of aerodynamics
and length scales. This study provides causality-based insights into a range of
unsteady aerodynamic problems.

Abstract: Developing a general-purpose wearable real-time fall-detection system is
still a challenging task, especially for healthy and strong subjects, such as
industrial workers that work in harsh environments. In this work, we present a
hybrid approach for fall detection and prevention, which uses the dynamic model
of an inverted pendulum to generate simulations of falling that are then fed to
a deep learning framework. The output is a signal to activate a fall mitigation
mechanism when the subject is at risk of harm. The advantage of this approach
is that abstracted models can be used to efficiently generate training data for
thousands of different subjects with different falling initial conditions,
something that is practically impossible with real experiments. This approach
is suitable for a specific type of fall, where the subjects fall without
changing their initial configuration significantly, and it is the first step
toward a general-purpose wearable device, with the aim of reducing
fall-associated injuries in industrial environments, which can improve the
safety of workers.

Abstract: We study the multi-armed bandit problem with adversarially chosen delays in
the Best-of-Both-Worlds (BoBW) framework, which aims to achieve near-optimal
performance in both stochastic and adversarial environments. While prior work
has made progress toward this goal, existing algorithms suffer from significant
gaps to the known lower bounds, especially in the stochastic settings. Our main
contribution is a new algorithm that, up to logarithmic factors, matches the
known lower bounds in each setting individually.
  In the adversarial case, our algorithm achieves regret of
$\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{KT} + \sqrt{D})$, which is optimal up to logarithmic
terms, where $T$ is the number of rounds, $K$ is the number of arms, and $D$ is
the cumulative delay. In the stochastic case, we provide a regret bound which
scale as $\sum_{i:\Delta_i>0}\left(\log T/\Delta_i\right) + \frac{1}{K}\sum
\Delta_i \sigma_{max}$, where $\Delta_i$ is the sub-optimality gap of arm $i$
and $\sigma_{\max}$ is the maximum number of missing observations.
  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first BoBW algorithm to
simultaneously match the lower bounds in both stochastic and adversarial
regimes in delayed environment. Moreover, even beyond the BoBW setting, our
stochastic regret bound is the first to match the known lower bound under
adversarial delays, improving the second term over the best known result by a
factor of $K$.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Despite their central role in the success of foundational models and
large-scale language modeling, the theoretical foundations governing the
operation of Transformers remain only partially understood. Contemporary
research has largely focused on their representational capacity for language
comprehension and their prowess in in-context learning, frequently under
idealized assumptions such as linearized attention mechanisms. Initially
conceived to model sequence-to-sequence transformations, a fundamental and
unresolved question is whether Transformers can robustly perform functional
regression over sequences of input tokens. This question assumes heightened
importance given the inherently non-Euclidean geometry underlying real-world
data distributions. In this work, we establish that Transformers equipped with
softmax-based nonlinear attention are uniformly consistent when tasked with
executing Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, provided both the inputs and
outputs are embedded in hyperbolic space. We derive deterministic upper bounds
on the empirical error which, in the asymptotic regime, decay at a provable
rate of $\mathcal{O}(t^{-1/2d})$, where $t$ denotes the number of input tokens
and $d$ the embedding dimensionality. Notably, our analysis subsumes the
Euclidean setting as a special case, recovering analogous convergence
guarantees parameterized by the intrinsic dimensionality of the data manifold.
These theoretical insights are corroborated through empirical evaluations on
real-world datasets involving both continuous and categorical response
variables.
