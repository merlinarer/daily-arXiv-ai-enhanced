### [1] [BRoverbs -- Measuring how much LLMs understand Portuguese proverbs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08960)
*Thales Sales Almeida,Giovana Kerche Bonás,João Guilherme Alves Santos*

Main category: cs.CL

Relevance: 85.0

TL;DR: BRoverbs是一个专门针对巴西葡萄牙语的评估数据集，通过巴西谚语来评估大语言模型在区域语言文化理解方面的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有葡萄牙语评估主要依赖翻译数据集或局限于结构化考试，无法充分捕捉语言文化细微差别，需要针对特定区域的成熟评估框架。

Method: 创建BRoverbs数据集，包含巴西谚语作为评估资源，利用谚语蕴含的文化智慧、比喻表达和复杂句法结构来测试模型对区域表达的理解能力。

Result: 提供了一个专门针对巴西葡萄牙语的新评估工具，可用于评估LLM在区域语言文化背景下的表现。

Conclusion: BRoverbs填补了葡萄牙语LLM评估的空白，为区域化基准测试提供了重要贡献。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant performance variations
depending on the linguistic and cultural context in which they are applied.
This disparity signals the necessity of mature evaluation frameworks that can
assess their capabilities in specific regional settings. In the case of
Portuguese, existing evaluations remain limited, often relying on translated
datasets that may not fully capture linguistic nuances or cultural references.
Meanwhile, native Portuguese-language datasets predominantly focus on
structured national exams or sentiment analysis of social media interactions,
leaving gaps in evaluating broader linguistic understanding. To address this
limitation, we introduce BRoverbs, a dataset specifically designed to assess
LLM performance through Brazilian proverbs. Proverbs serve as a rich linguistic
resource, encapsulating cultural wisdom, figurative expressions, and complex
syntactic structures that challenge the model comprehension of regional
expressions. BRoverbs aims to provide a new evaluation tool for
Portuguese-language LLMs, contributing to advancing regionally informed
benchmarking. The benchmark is available at
https://huggingface.co/datasets/Tropic-AI/BRoverbs.

### [2] [Stated Preference for Interaction and Continued Engagement (SPICE): Evaluating an LLM's Willingness to Re-engage in Conversation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09043)

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPICE是一种通过询问LLM是否愿意继续与用户互动的简单诊断信号，能够有效区分不同用户语气下的模型偏好，为模型审计提供直接的关系信号


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的模型评估指标主要关注分类准确性，缺乏对模型交互偏好的直接测量。研究者希望开发一种简单有效的方法来评估LLM在人际互动中的继续参与意愿

Method: 使用3种语气（友好、模糊、辱骂）×10种交互刺激集，测试4个开源聊天模型在4种框架条件下的480次试验，通过YES/NO问题测量模型继续互动的意愿

Result: SPICE能清晰区分用户语气：友好互动97.5%愿意继续，辱骂互动仅17.9%愿意继续，模糊互动60.4%愿意继续。该信号与滥用分类不同，在模型未能识别滥用时仍有81%不愿继续互动

Conclusion: SPICE是一个稳健、低开销且可复现的工具，可用于审计模型倾向，通过提供模型状态的直接关系信号来补充现有指标

Abstract: We introduce and evaluate Stated Preference for Interaction and Continued
Engagement (SPICE), a simple diagnostic signal elicited by asking a Large
Language Model a YES or NO question about its willingness to re-engage with a
user's behavior after reviewing a short transcript. In a study using a 3-tone
(friendly, unclear, abusive) by 10-interaction stimulus set, we tested four
open-weight chat models across four framing conditions, resulting in 480
trials. Our findings show that SPICE sharply discriminates by user tone.
Friendly interactions yielded a near-unanimous preference to continue (97.5%
YES), while abusive interactions yielded a strong preference to discontinue
(17.9% YES), with unclear interactions falling in between (60.4% YES). This
core association remains decisive under multiple dependence-aware statistical
tests, including Rao-Scott adjustment and cluster permutation tests.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that SPICE provides a distinct signal from abuse
classification. In trials where a model failed to identify abuse, it still
overwhelmingly stated a preference not to continue the interaction (81% of the
time). An exploratory analysis also reveals a significant interaction effect: a
preamble describing the study context significantly impacts SPICE under
ambiguity, but only when transcripts are presented as a single block of text
rather than a multi-turn chat. The results validate SPICE as a robust,
low-overhead, and reproducible tool for auditing model dispositions,
complementing existing metrics by offering a direct, relational signal of a
model's state. All stimuli, code, and analysis scripts are released to support
replication.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索不同对齐技术（SFT、DPO及其组合）对语言模型安全性和有用性的影响，为构建更强大的对齐流程提供基础

Method: 使用Anthropic Helpful-Harmless RLHF数据集，在OPT-350M模型上训练四个版本：基础模型、SFT模型、DPO模型和SFT+DPO组合模型，并引入三个评估指标（HmR、HpR、CAS）

Result: SFT优于DPO，但SFT+DPO组合模型在所有指标上表现最佳，证明了这些技术的互补性。研究还揭示了噪声数据、GPU资源限制和训练约束带来的挑战

Conclusion: SFT和DPO技术具有互补性，组合使用能获得最佳对齐效果，为未来更稳健的对齐流程提供了重要见解

Abstract: This research investigates the effectiveness of alignment techniques,
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and a
combined SFT+DPO approach on improving the safety and helpfulness of the
OPT-350M language model. Utilizing the Anthropic Helpful-Harmless RLHF dataset,
we train and evaluate four models: the base OPT350M, an SFT model, a DPO model,
and a model trained with both SFT and DPO. We introduce three key evaluation
metrics: Harmlessness Rate (HmR), Helpfulness Rate (HpR), and a Combined
Alignment Score (CAS), all derived from reward model outputs. The results show
that while SFT outperforms DPO, The combined SFT+DPO model outperforms all
others across all metrics, demonstrating the complementary nature of these
techniques. Our findings also highlight challenges posed by noisy data, limited
GPU resources, and training constraints. This study offers a comprehensive view
of how fine-tuning strategies affect model alignment and provides a foundation
for more robust alignment pipelines in future work.

Motivation: 现有方法虽然通过上下文学习和指令微调提升LLMs性能，但在通用信息抽取任务中仍存在局限性，特别是在处理结构化输出、复杂模式描述和多步推理方面表现不足。

Method: 提出MR-UIE方法，将强化学习与多视角推理相结合，使LLMs从被动抽取器转变为主动推理器，理解不仅要抽取什么，还要如何进行推理。

Result: 在多个信息抽取基准测试中，MR-UIE方法持续提升了跨领域的抽取准确性，并在多个数据集上超越了最先进的方法。多视角推理的加入显著增强了复杂信息抽取任务中的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 推理在具有挑战性的场景中发挥着关键作用，将强化学习与多视角推理相结合能够有效提升LLMs在复杂信息抽取任务中的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate robust capabilities across diverse
research domains. However, their performance in universal information
extraction (UIE) remains insufficient, especially when tackling structured
output scenarios that involve complex schema descriptions and require
multi-step reasoning. While existing approaches enhance the performance of LLMs
through in-context learning and instruction tuning, significant limitations
nonetheless persist. To enhance the model's generalization ability, we propose
integrating reinforcement learning (RL) with multi-perspective reasoning for
information extraction (IE) tasks. Our work transitions LLMs from passive
extractors to active reasoners, enabling them to understand not only what to
extract but also how to reason. Experiments conducted on multiple IE benchmarks
demonstrate that MR-UIE consistently elevates extraction accuracy across
domains and surpasses state-of-the-art methods on several datasets.
Furthermore, incorporating multi-perspective reasoning into RL notably enhances
generalization in complex IE tasks, underscoring the critical role of reasoning
in challenging scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用大模型在电商等垂直领域表现不佳，因为电商数据具有噪声大、异构、多语言和动态变化的特点，需要专门的领域模型来解决这些问题。

Method: 采用较少但更大的专家设计，结合节点内专家并行和定制memcpy操作符优化GPU利用率；使用12T token的多语言语料和合成电商指令进行混合训练；提出OTPO方法增强指令遵循能力。

Result: 在电商任务上超越DeepSeek-V3.1、GPT-4系列和Qwen3-235B；在东南亚低资源语言和葡萄牙语上表现优异；在Shopee平台已替代70%以上的OpenAI流量。

Conclusion: Compass-v3证明了垂直领域MoE模型在电商场景的有效性，通过硬件优化和专门的对齐方法实现了专业领域性能和通用能力的平衡。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in general-domain applications, yet their
performance often degrades in specialized tasks requiring domain-specific
knowledge. E-commerce is particularly challenging, as its data are noisy,
heterogeneous, multilingual, and highly dynamic. We present Compass-v3, a
vertical-domain Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model with 245B total parameters and
71B active per token, designed for Southeast Asian e-commerce. Compass-v3
adopts fewer but larger experts, combined with hardware-efficient
optimizations-such as intra-node expert parallelism and a customized memcpy
operator-to maximize GPU utilization. The model is trained on 12T tokens of
curated multilingual corpora and large-scale synthetic e-commerce instructions
using a mixed-training strategy. To enhance alignment, we propose
Optimal-Transport Direct Preference Optimization (OTPO), which captures
token-level distinctions and improves instruction adherence in
commerce-specific scenarios. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Compass-v3
delivers state-of-the-art e-commerce performance, surpassing DeepSeek-V3.1,
GPT-4 series, and Qwen3-235B. Moreover, Compass-v3 demonstrates strong
multilingual capability across low-resource Southeast Asian languages
(Indonesian, Thai, Filipino, Vietnamese, Malay, Taglog) and Portuguese while
sustaining competitive performance on general benchmarks. It has already been
widely applied in Shopee's industrial-scale e-commerce platform and is
gradually replacing OpenAI's traffic, now accounting for over 70\% of total LLM
usage, highlighting its dual strengths in specialized commerce expertise and
broad linguistic competence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展语言模型到更长上下文对于捕捉扩展语篇中的丰富依赖关系至关重要，但简单的上下文扩展会带来显著的计算和内存负担，导致训练和推理效率低下。

Method: 提出CCF框架，整合分段语义聚合与键值记忆编码，形成紧凑表示；引入训练效率优化策略，结合增量分段解码和稀疏储层采样，大幅降低内存开销。

Result: 在多个长上下文语言建模基准测试中，CCF在高压缩比下实现了有竞争力的困惑度，相比现有方法显著提高了吞吐量和内存效率。

Conclusion: 结构化压缩对于可扩展和有效的长上下文语言建模具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Scaling language models to longer contexts is essential for capturing rich
dependencies across extended discourse. However, na\"ive context extension
imposes significant computational and memory burdens, often resulting in
inefficiencies during both training and inference. In this work, we propose
CCF, a novel context compression framework designed to enable efficient
long-context modeling by learning hierarchical latent representations that
preserve global semantics while aggressively reducing input redundancy. CCF
integrates segment-wise semantic aggregation with key-value memory encoding,
forming compact representations that support accurate reconstruction and
long-range understanding. To further enhance scalability, we introduce a
training-efficient optimization strategy that couples incremental segment
decoding with sparse reservoir sampling, substantially reducing memory overhead
without degrading performance. Empirical results on multiple long-context
language modeling benchmarks demonstrate that CCF achieves competitive
perplexity under high compression ratios, and significantly improves throughput
and memory efficiency compared to existing approaches. These findings highlight
the potential of structured compression for scalable and effective long-context
language modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有幻觉检测方法主要针对独立LLM，无法解决RAG系统中响应必须与检索证据一致的特殊挑战，而企业应用中RAG系统的可靠性问题亟待解决。

Method: 四阶段框架：1)将答案分解为原子事实；2)使用同义词和反义词替换生成受控变异；3)根据检索上下文验证变体（同义词应被蕴含，反义词应被矛盾）；4)将不一致性惩罚聚合成响应级幻觉分数。

Result: 在企业专有数据集上的实验证明了MetaRAG在检测幻觉方面的有效性，能够实现RAG对话代理的可信部署。

Conclusion: MetaRAG为RAG系统提供了一种实时、无监督的黑盒测试方法，特别适用于身份敏感查询的可信AI部署，支持span级定位和阈值配置。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in enterprise
applications, yet their reliability remains limited by hallucinations, i.e.,
confident but factually incorrect information. Existing detection approaches,
such as SelfCheckGPT and MetaQA, primarily target standalone LLMs and do not
address the unique challenges of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems,
where responses must be consistent with retrieved evidence. We therefore
present MetaRAG, a metamorphic testing framework for hallucination detection in
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. MetaRAG operates in a real-time,
unsupervised, black-box setting, requiring neither ground-truth references nor
access to model internals, making it suitable for proprietary and high-stakes
domains. The framework proceeds in four stages: (1) decompose answers into
atomic factoids, (2) generate controlled mutations of each factoid using
synonym and antonym substitutions, (3) verify each variant against the
retrieved context (synonyms are expected to be entailed and antonyms
contradicted), and (4) aggregate penalties for inconsistencies into a
response-level hallucination score. Crucially for identity-aware AI, MetaRAG
localizes unsupported claims at the factoid span where they occur (e.g.,
pregnancy-specific precautions, LGBTQ+ refugee rights, or labor eligibility),
allowing users to see flagged spans and enabling system designers to configure
thresholds and guardrails for identity-sensitive queries. Experiments on a
proprietary enterprise dataset illustrate the effectiveness of MetaRAG for
detecting hallucinations and enabling trustworthy deployment of RAG-based
conversational agents. We also outline a topic-based deployment design that
translates MetaRAG's span-level scores into identity-aware safeguards; this
design is discussed but not evaluated in our experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM置信度评估方法要么计算开销大，要么校准效果差，难以在实际高风险应用中可靠部署

Method: 提出GrACE方法，通过在词汇表中添加特殊标记，利用最后隐藏状态与该标记嵌入的相似性来实时表达置信度，并通过与准确性相关的校准目标进行微调

Result: 在三个LLM和两个基准数据集上的实验表明，GrACE在开放式生成任务中具有最佳判别能力和校准效果，优于六种竞争方法，同时显著减少测试时缩放所需的样本数量

Conclusion: GrACE为LLM部署提供了可扩展、可靠且实时的置信度估计实用解决方案

Abstract: Assessing the reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) by confidence
elicitation is a prominent approach to AI safety in high-stakes applications,
such as healthcare and finance. Existing methods either require expensive
computational overhead or suffer from poor calibration, making them impractical
and unreliable for real-world deployment. In this work, we propose GrACE, a
Generative Approach to Confidence Elicitation that enables scalable and
reliable confidence elicitation for LLMs. GrACE adopts a novel mechanism in
which the model expresses confidence by the similarity between the last hidden
state and the embedding of a special token appended to the vocabulary, in
real-time. We fine-tune the model for calibrating the confidence with
calibration targets associated with accuracy. Experiments with three LLMs and
two benchmark datasets show that the confidence produced by GrACE achieves the
best discriminative capacity and calibration on open-ended generation tasks,
outperforming six competing methods without resorting to additional sampling or
an auxiliary model. Moreover, we propose two strategies for improving test-time
scaling based on confidence induced by GrACE. Experimental results show that
using GrACE not only improves the accuracy of the final decision but also
significantly reduces the number of required samples in the test-time scaling
scheme, indicating the potential of GrACE as a practical solution for deploying
LLMs with scalable, reliable, and real-time confidence estimation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常独立微调多智能体系统中的各个智能体，导致能力差距和协调性差的问题。为了解决这个问题，需要一种能够提升智能体协作的联合对齐方法。

Method: MOAT框架包含两个交替阶段：1) 规划智能体对齐 - 优化规划智能体生成更好的子目标序列来指导接地智能体；2) 接地智能体改进 - 使用智能体自身生成的多样化子目标-动作对来微调接地智能体，增强其泛化能力。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，MOAT优于最先进的基线方法，在held-in任务上平均提升3.1%，在held-out任务上平均提升4.4%。理论分析证明MOAT确保了非递减且逐步收敛的训练过程。

Conclusion: MOAT通过迭代对齐方法有效解决了多智能体系统中的协调问题，显著提升了智能体协作性能，为多智能体LLM系统的训练提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled the construction
of multi-agent systems to solve complex tasks by dividing responsibilities
among specialized agents, such as a planning agent for subgoal generation and a
grounding agent for executing tool-use actions. Most existing methods typically
fine-tune these agents independently, leading to capability gaps among them
with poor coordination. To address this, we propose MOAT, a Multi-Agent Joint
Alignment Tuning framework that improves agents collaboration through iterative
alignment. MOAT alternates between two key stages: (1) Planning Agent
Alignment, which optimizes the planning agent to generate subgoal sequences
that better guide the grounding agent; and (2) Grounding Agent Improving, which
fine-tunes the grounding agent using diverse subgoal-action pairs generated by
the agent itself to enhance its generalization capablity. Theoretical analysis
proves that MOAT ensures a non-decreasing and progressively convergent training
process. Experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate that MOAT outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average improvements of 3.1% on held-in
tasks and 4.4% on held-out tasks.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在计算任务上表现出色，但其内部工作机制仍不明确。研究者希望探究模型在实际心算任务中，token之间信息传递和计算的具体方式。

Method: 采用三步骤方法：抑制初始层的输入特定token计算、限制中间层token位置间的信息传递路径、强制剩余层所有计算在最后一个token进行。提出了CAMA和ABP两种技术来识别关键计算子图。

Result: 发现了一个AF1子图，该子图在心算任务上具有高准确率，计算主要发生在深层且仅在最后一个token，通过特定中间层接收其他token的信息。实验表明该子图对模型性能既充分又必要，且在不同模型和输入风格间具有可迁移性。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在心算任务中的有效计算集中在深层网络的特定子图中，这一发现有助于理解模型内部工作机制，CAMA和ABP技术为模型分析提供了新工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate proficiency across numerous
computational tasks, yet their inner workings remain unclear. In theory, the
combination of causal self-attention and multilayer perceptron layers allows
every token to access and compute information based on all preceding tokens. In
practice, to what extent are such operations present? In this paper, on mental
math tasks (i.e., direct math calculation via next-token prediction without
explicit reasoning), we investigate this question in three steps: inhibiting
input-specific token computations in the initial layers, restricting the routes
of information transfer across token positions in the next few layers, and
forcing all computation to happen at the last token in the remaining layers.
With two proposed techniques, Context-Aware Mean Ablation (CAMA) and
Attention-Based Peeking (ABP), we identify an All-for-One subgraph (AF1) with
high accuracy on a wide variety of mental math tasks, where meaningful
computation occurs very late (in terms of layer depth) and only at the last
token, which receives information of other tokens in few specific middle
layers. Experiments on a variety of models and arithmetic expressions show that
this subgraph is sufficient and necessary for high model performance, transfers
across different models, and works on a variety of input styles. Ablations on
different CAMA and ABP alternatives reveal their unique advantages over other
methods, which may be of independent interest.

Motivation: MoE架构在LLMs中通过路由机制选择专家网络处理不同token，但现有方法缺乏对这些专家行为的细粒度控制能力。研究者希望开发一种能够检测和控制特定行为相关专家的框架，以实现对模型行为的精确调控。

Method: 提出SteerMoE框架：1）通过对比分析具有相反行为的输入对，检测表现出不同激活模式的行为相关专家；2）在推理过程中选择性激活或停用这些专家，从而控制模型的行为表现。

Result: 在11个基准测试和6个不同LLM上的实验表明：正向控制时，安全性提升最高达20%，忠实性提升27%；对抗攻击模式下，单独使用可降低安全性41%，与现有越狱方法结合可完全绕过所有安全防护（-100%）。

Conclusion: SteerMoE揭示了MoE模型中隐藏的对齐伪造维度，证明了通过专家级别的细粒度控制可以实现对LLM行为的有效调控，既可用于增强模型安全性，也可用于对抗攻击，对MoE模型的可解释性和安全性研究具有重要意义。

weights. Across 11 benchmarks and 6 LLMs, our steering raises safety by up to
+20% and faithfulness by +27%. In adversarial attack mode, it drops safety by
-41% alone, and -100% when combined with existing jailbreak methods, bypassing
all safety guardrails and exposing a new dimension of alignment faking hidden

Conclusion: CDE框架通过内在好奇心信号有效解决了RLVR的探索问题，提升了LLM的推理能力，同时揭示了重要的失败模式机制

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a powerful paradigm
for enhancing the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). Yet
current RLVR methods often explore poorly, leading to premature convergence and
entropy collapse. To address this challenge, we introduce Curiosity-Driven
Exploration (CDE), a framework that leverages the model's own intrinsic sense
of curiosity to guide exploration. We formalize curiosity with signals from
both the actor and the critic: for the actor, we use perplexity over its
generated response, and for the critic, we use the variance of value estimates
from a multi-head architecture. Both signals serve as an exploration bonus
within the RLVR framework to guide the model. Our theoretical analysis shows
that the actor-wise bonus inherently penalizes overconfident errors and
promotes diversity among correct responses; moreover, we connect the
critic-wise bonus to the well-established count-based exploration bonus in RL.
Empirically, our method achieves an approximate +3 point improvement over
standard RLVR using GRPO/PPO on AIME benchmarks. Further analysis identifies a
calibration collapse mechanism within RLVR, shedding light on common LLM
failure modes.

that this limitation arises because current training paradigms for SLLMs fail
to bridge the acoustic-semantic gap in the feature representation space. To
address this issue, we propose EchoX, which leverages semantic representations
and dynamically generates speech training targets. This approach integrates
both acoustic and semantic learning, enabling EchoX to preserve strong
reasoning abilities as a speech LLM. Experimental results demonstrate that
EchoX, with about six thousand hours of training data, achieves advanced
performance on multiple knowledge-based question-answering benchmarks. The

Abstract: Question Answering over Tabular Data (Table QA) presents unique challenges
due to the diverse structure, size, and data types of real-world tables. The
SemEval 2025 Task 8 (DataBench) introduced a benchmark composed of large-scale,
domain-diverse datasets to evaluate the ability of models to accurately answer
structured queries. We propose a Natural Language to SQL (NL-to-SQL) approach
leveraging large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and
DeepSeek v2:16b to generate SQL queries dynamically. Our system follows a
multi-stage pipeline involving example selection, SQL query generation, answer
extraction, verification, and iterative refinement. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, achieving 70.5\% accuracy on DataBench QA and
71.6\% on DataBench Lite QA, significantly surpassing baseline scores of 26\%
and 27\% respectively. This paper details our methodology, experimental
results, and alternative approaches, providing insights into the strengths and
limitations of LLM-driven Table QA.

Method: 研究三元组补全任务的三个维度：生成方法、质量保证机制（使用LLM过滤低质量三元组）、以及LLM响应解析策略，分析在受限环境下的效果。

Result: 额外信息能显著提升生成质量；LLM能有效识别和过滤低质量三元组；响应解析需要在灵活性和一致性之间权衡，具体取决于任务设置。

Conclusion: 在技术受限环境下，通过信息增强、质量过滤和合适的响应解析策略，可以有效提升LLM在三元组补全任务中的表现。

Abstract: RAG and fine-tuning are prevalent strategies for improving the quality of LLM
outputs. However, in constrained situations, such as that of the 2025 LM-KBC
challenge, such techniques are restricted. In this work we investigate three
facets of the triple completion task: generation, quality assurance, and LLM
response parsing. Our work finds that in this constrained setting: additional
information improves generation quality, LLMs can be effective at filtering
poor quality triples, and the tradeoff between flexibility and consistency with
LLM response parsing is setting dependent.

Motivation: 研究视觉语言模型在需要感知与符号计算整合的任务中的局限性，特别是视觉方程求解这类数学推理问题。

Method: 将视觉方程求解任务分解为系数计数和变量识别两个子任务进行分析，通过对比文本方程和视觉方程的模型表现来识别瓶颈。

Result: VLMs在文本方程上表现良好，但在视觉方程上失败；计数是主要瓶颈；多步推理会引入额外错误；随着方程复杂度增加，符号推理本身也成为限制因素。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在视觉数学推理方面存在关键弱点，需要改进计数能力、多步推理和符号计算能力。

Abstract: Despite strong performance in visual understanding and language-based
reasoning, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with tasks requiring
integrated perception and symbolic computation. We study this limitation
through visual equation solving, where mathematical equations are embedded in
images, variables are represented by object icons, and coefficients must be
inferred by counting. While VLMs perform well on textual equations, they fail
on visually grounded counterparts. To understand this gap, we decompose the
task into coefficient counting and variable recognition, and find that counting
is the primary bottleneck, even when recognition is accurate. We also observe
that composing recognition and reasoning introduces additional errors,
highlighting challenges in multi-step visual reasoning. Finally, as equation
complexity increases, symbolic reasoning itself becomes a limiting factor.
These findings reveal key weaknesses in current VLMs and point toward future
improvements in visually grounded mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: Despite being the 5th most spoken language, Bangla remains underrepresented
in Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly for code generation. This
primarily stems from the scarcity of high-quality data to pre-train and/or
finetune such models. Hence, we introduce the first dedicated family of Code
LLMs for Bangla (1B & 9B). We offer three major contributions: (1) a
comprehensive Bangla code instruction datasets for programming domain
adaptation; (2) MBPP-Bangla, an evaluation benchmark for Bangla code
generation; and (3) the TigerCoder-family of Code LLMs, achieving significant
~11-18% performance gains at Pass@1 over existing multilingual and
general-purpose Bangla LLMs. Our findings show that curated, high-quality
datasets can overcome limitations of smaller models for low-resource languages.
We open-source all resources to advance further Bangla LLM research.

Method: 将专利-SDG分类构建为弱监督问题，使用专利对SDG标记科学文献的引用作为噪声信号，开发复合标注函数利用LLM从专利和SDG论文中提取结构化概念，计算跨域相似度得分

Result: 方法在内部验证中优于包括基于Transformer的模型和零样本LLM在内的多个基线，外部验证显示标签在专利引用、共同发明人和共同申请人图中展现出更好的主题、认知和组织一致性

Conclusion: 弱监督和语义对齐可以增强大规模SDG分类

Abstract: Classifying patents by their relevance to the UN Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) is crucial for tracking how innovation addresses global
challenges. However, the absence of a large, labeled dataset limits the use of
supervised learning. Existing methods, such as keyword searches, transfer
learning, and citation-based heuristics, lack scalability and generalizability.
This paper frames patent-to-SDG classification as a weak supervision problem,
using citations from patents to SDG-tagged scientific publications (NPL
citations) as a noisy initial signal. To address its sparsity and noise, we
develop a composite labeling function (LF) that uses large language models
(LLMs) to extract structured concepts, namely functions, solutions, and
applications, from patents and SDG papers based on a patent ontology.
Cross-domain similarity scores are computed and combined using a rank-based
retrieval approach. The LF is calibrated via a custom positive-only loss that
aligns with known NPL-SDG links without penalizing discovery of new SDG
associations. The result is a silver-standard, soft multi-label dataset mapping
patents to SDGs, enabling the training of effective multi-label regression
models. We validate our approach through two complementary strategies: (1)
internal validation against held-out NPL-based labels, where our method
outperforms several baselines including transformer-based models, and zero-shot
LLM; and (2) external validation using network modularity in patent citation,
co-inventor, and co-applicant graphs, where our labels reveal greater thematic,
cognitive, and organizational coherence than traditional technological
classifications. These results show that weak supervision and semantic
alignment can enhance SDG classification at scale.

promising for soft label predictions and merit further exploration by the

Abstract: The versatility of Large Language Models (LLMs) in natural language
understanding has made them increasingly popular in mental health research.
While many studies explore LLMs' capabilities in emotion recognition, a
critical gap remains in evaluating whether LLMs align with human emotions at a
fine-grained level. Existing research typically focuses on classifying emotions
into predefined, limited categories, overlooking more nuanced expressions. To
address this gap, we introduce EXPRESS, a benchmark dataset curated from Reddit
communities featuring 251 fine-grained, self-disclosed emotion labels. Our
comprehensive evaluation framework examines predicted emotion terms and
decomposes them into eight basic emotions using established emotion theories,
enabling a fine-grained comparison. Systematic testing of prevalent LLMs under
various prompt settings reveals that accurately predicting emotions that align
with human self-disclosed emotions remains challenging. Qualitative analysis
further shows that while certain LLMs generate emotion terms consistent with
established emotion theories and definitions, they sometimes fail to capture
contextual cues as effectively as human self-disclosures. These findings
highlight the limitations of LLMs in fine-grained emotion alignment and offer
insights for future research aimed at enhancing their contextual understanding.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of generative AI-powered search engines like ChatGPT,
Perplexity, and Gemini is fundamentally reshaping information retrieval, moving
from traditional ranked lists to synthesized, citation-backed answers. This
shift challenges established Search Engine Optimization (SEO) practices and
necessitates a new paradigm, which we term Generative Engine Optimization
(GEO).
  This paper presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of AI Search and
traditional web search (Google). Through a series of large-scale, controlled
experiments across multiple verticals, languages, and query paraphrases, we
quantify critical differences in how these systems source information. Our key
findings reveal that AI Search exhibit a systematic and overwhelming bias
towards Earned media (third-party, authoritative sources) over Brand-owned and
Social content, a stark contrast to Google's more balanced mix. We further
demonstrate that AI Search services differ significantly from each other in
their domain diversity, freshness, cross-language stability, and sensitivity to
phrasing.
  Based on these empirical results, we formulate a strategic GEO agenda. We
provide actionable guidance for practitioners, emphasizing the critical need
to: (1) engineer content for machine scannability and justification, (2)
dominate earned media to build AI-perceived authority, (3) adopt
engine-specific and language-aware strategies, and (4) overcome the inherent
"big brand bias" for niche players. Our work provides the foundational
empirical analysis and a strategic framework for achieving visibility in the

Abstract: This research introduces a novel psychometric method for analyzing textual
data using large language models. By leveraging contextual embeddings to create
contextual scores, we transform textual data into response data suitable for
psychometric analysis. Treating documents as individuals and words as items,
this approach provides a natural psychometric interpretation under the
assumption that certain keywords, whose contextual meanings vary significantly
across documents, can effectively differentiate documents within a corpus. The
modeling process comprises two stages: obtaining contextual scores and
performing psychometric analysis. In the first stage, we utilize natural
language processing techniques and encoder based transformer models to identify
common keywords and generate contextual scores. In the second stage, we employ
various types of factor analysis, including exploratory and bifactor models, to
extract and define latent factors, determine factor correlations, and identify
the most significant words associated with each factor. Applied to the Wiki
STEM corpus, our experimental results demonstrate the method's potential to
uncover latent knowledge dimensions and patterns within textual data. This
approach not only enhances the psychometric analysis of textual data but also
holds promise for applications in fields rich in textual information, such as
education, psychology, and law.

Abstract: Semantic Textual Relatedness (STR) captures nuanced relationships between
texts that extend beyond superficial lexical similarity. In this study, we
investigate STR in the context of job title matching - a key challenge in
resume recommendation systems, where overlapping terms are often limited or
misleading. We introduce a self-supervised hybrid architecture that combines
dense sentence embeddings with domain-specific Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to
improve both semantic alignment and explainability. Unlike previous work that
evaluated models on aggregate performance, our approach emphasizes data
stratification by partitioning the STR score continuum into distinct regions:
low, medium, and high semantic relatedness. This stratified evaluation enables
a fine-grained analysis of model performance across semantically meaningful
subspaces. We evaluate several embedding models, both with and without KG
integration via graph neural networks. The results show that fine-tuned SBERT
models augmented with KGs produce consistent improvements in the high-STR
region, where the RMSE is reduced by 25% over strong baselines. Our findings
highlight not only the benefits of combining KGs with text embeddings, but also
the importance of regional performance analysis in understanding model
behavior. This granular approach reveals strengths and weaknesses hidden by
global metrics, and supports more targeted model selection for use in Human
Resources (HR) systems and applications where fairness, explainability, and
contextual matching are essential.

Abstract: Zero-shot Text-to-Speech (TTS) aims to synthesize high-quality speech that
mimics the voice of an unseen speaker using only a short reference sample,
requiring not only speaker adaptation but also accurate modeling of prosodic
attributes. Recent approaches based on language models, diffusion, and flow
matching have shown promising results in zero-shot TTS, but still suffer from
slow inference and repetition artifacts. Discrete codec representations have
been widely adopted for speech synthesis, and recent works have begun to
explore diffusion models in purely discrete settings, suggesting the potential
of discrete generative modeling for speech synthesis. However, existing
flow-matching methods typically embed these discrete tokens into a continuous
space and apply continuous flow matching, which may not fully leverage the
advantages of discrete representations. To address these challenges, we
introduce DiFlow-TTS, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first model
to explore purely Discrete Flow Matching for speech synthesis. DiFlow-TTS
explicitly models factorized speech attributes within a compact and unified
architecture. It leverages in-context learning by conditioning on textual
content, along with prosodic and acoustic attributes extracted from a reference
speech, enabling effective attribute cloning in a zero-shot setting. In
addition, the model employs a factorized flow prediction mechanism with
distinct heads for prosody and acoustic details, allowing it to learn
aspect-specific distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that DiFlow-TTS
achieves promising performance in several key metrics, including naturalness,

Abstract: This study explores the use of generative AI for automating the
classification of tutors' Dialogue Acts (DAs), aiming to reduce the time and
effort required by traditional manual coding. This case study uses the
open-source CIMA corpus, in which tutors' responses are pre-annotated into four
DA categories. Both GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 models were tested using tailored
prompts. Results show that GPT-4 achieved 80% accuracy, a weighted F1-score of
0.81, and a Cohen's Kappa of 0.74, surpassing baseline performance and
indicating substantial agreement with human annotations. These findings suggest
that generative AI has strong potential to provide an efficient and accessible
approach to DA classification, with meaningful implications for educational
dialogue analysis. The study also highlights the importance of task-specific
label definitions and contextual information in enhancing the quality of
automated annotation. Finally, it underscores the ethical considerations
associated with the use of generative AI and the need for responsible and
transparent research practices. The script of this research is publicly

Result: 在MMARCO-VI基准测试中取得了强大的早期排名准确性，超越了多语言基线模型，并与PhoRanker竞争表现接近。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了通过精心的架构适应和数据管理可以推进其他代表性不足语言的重排序技术发展，模型已在Hugging Face上开源发布。

Abstract: This paper presents ViRanker, a cross-encoder reranking model tailored to the
Vietnamese language. Built on the BGE-M3 encoder and enhanced with the
Blockwise Parallel Transformer, ViRanker addresses the lack of competitive
rerankers for Vietnamese, a low-resource language with complex syntax and
diacritics. The model was trained on an 8 GB curated corpus and fine-tuned with
hybrid hard-negative sampling to strengthen robustness. Evaluated on the
MMARCO-VI benchmark, ViRanker achieves strong early-rank accuracy, surpassing
multilingual baselines and competing closely with PhoRanker. By releasing the
model openly on Hugging Face, we aim to support reproducibility and encourage
wider adoption in real-world retrieval systems. Beyond Vietnamese, this study
illustrates how careful architectural adaptation and data curation can advance
reranking in other underrepresented languages.

Conclusion: 提出的反事实增强去偏框架能有效减少虚假相关性，提高目标导向多模态情感分类的性能。

Abstract: Target-oriented multimodal sentiment classification seeks to predict
sentiment polarity for specific targets from image-text pairs. While existing
works achieve competitive performance, they often over-rely on textual content
and fail to consider dataset biases, in particular word-level contextual
biases. This leads to spurious correlations between text features and output
labels, impairing classification accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a novel
counterfactual-enhanced debiasing framework to reduce such spurious
correlations. Our framework incorporates a counterfactual data augmentation
strategy that minimally alters sentiment-related causal features, generating
detail-matched image-text samples to guide the model's attention toward content
tied to sentiment. Furthermore, for learning robust features from
counterfactual data and prompting model decisions, we introduce an adaptive
debiasing contrastive learning mechanism, which effectively mitigates the
influence of biased words. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets
show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Motivation: 狨猴具有复杂的语音通信能力，类似于人类语音特征（如声音标签和轮流对话），但由于主要使用声音交流，标准LLM方法不适用。研究狨猴声音通信为连接大脑活动提供了独特机会，特别是在人类大脑难以直接研究的情况下。

Method: 开发了GmSLM（生成式狨猴语音语言模型）流水线，使用无监督野外数据和弱标记对话数据设计新颖的零样本评估指标，与基于人类语音的基线方法进行比较。

Result: GmSLM生成的声音在声学上与真实重合成样本高度匹配，在下游任务中表现良好，能够有效区分真实和人工对话，尽管完全无监督。

Conclusion: GmSLM为研究声音通信的神经基础提供了实用框架，连接了声音产生和大脑活动，对神经科学、生物声学和进化生物学领域有重要价值。

Abstract: Marmoset monkeys exhibit complex vocal communication, challenging the view
that nonhuman primates vocal communication is entirely innate, and show similar
features of human speech, such as vocal labeling of others and turn-taking.
Studying their vocal communication offers a unique opportunity to link it with
brain activity-especially given the difficulty of accessing the human brain in
speech and language research. Since Marmosets communicate primarily through
vocalizations, applying standard LLM approaches is not straightforward. We
introduce Generative Marmoset Spoken Language Modeling (GmSLM), an optimized
spoken language model pipeline for Marmoset vocal communication. We designed a
novel zero-shot evaluation metrics using unsupervised in-the-wild data,
alongside weakly labeled conversational data, to assess GmSLM and demonstrate
its advantage over a basic human-speech-based baseline. GmSLM generated
vocalizations closely matched real resynthesized samples acoustically and
performed well on downstream tasks. Despite being fully unsupervised, GmSLM
effectively distinguish real from artificial conversations and may support
further investigations of the neural basis of vocal communication and provides
a practical framework linking vocalization and brain activity. We believe GmSLM
stands to benefit future work in neuroscience, bioacoustics, and evolutionary
biology. Samples are provided under: pages.cs.huji.ac.il/adiyoss-lab/GmSLM.

Motivation: 在线课程环境阻碍了社交群体的自然形成，SAMI系统由于缺乏完整的心理理论能力，无法有效建模学生人格特质，影响了推荐的相关性

Method: 利用GPT的零样本能力从论坛介绍帖中推断大五人格特质，与现有模型进行性能对比，并将人格检测模型集成到基于实体的匹配系统中

Result: 证明了GPT在人格检测任务中的有效性，初步集成表明人格特质可以补充现有的匹配因素

Conclusion: 人格特质可以增强社交推荐系统的匹配质量，但需要进一步评估其对学生参与度和匹配质量的全面影响

Abstract: Social connection is a vital part of learning, yet online course environments
present barriers to the organic formation of social groups. SAMI offers one
solution by facilitating student connections, but its effectiveness is
constrained by an incomplete Theory of Mind, limiting its ability to create an
effective mental model of a student. One facet of this is its inability to
intuit personality, which may influence the relevance of its recommendations.
To explore this, we propose a personality detection model utilizing GPTs
zero-shot capability to infer Big-Five personality traits from forum
introduction posts, often encouraged in online courses. We benchmark its
performance against established models, demonstrating its efficacy in this
task. Furthermore, we integrate this model into SAMIs entity-based matchmaking
system, enabling personality-informed social recommendations. Initial
integration suggests personality traits can complement existing matching
factors, though additional evaluation is required to determine their full
impact on student engagement and match quality.

Conclusion: 虽然自动化RAG系统能加速证据提取，但由于分析的复杂性，需要采用人机协同的方式，技术应增强而非替代专家判断。

Abstract: InfluenceMap's LobbyMap Platform monitors the climate policy engagement of
over 500 companies and 250 industry associations, assessing each entity's
support or opposition to science-based policy pathways for achieving the Paris
Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to 1.5{\deg}C. Although
InfluenceMap has made progress with automating key elements of the analytical
workflow, a significant portion of the assessment remains manual, making it
time- and labor-intensive and susceptible to human error. We propose an
AI-assisted framework to accelerate the monitoring of corporate climate policy
engagement by leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation to automate the most
time-intensive extraction of relevant evidence from large-scale textual data.
Our evaluation shows that a combination of layout-aware parsing, the Nomic
embedding model, and few-shot prompting strategies yields the best performance
in extracting and classifying evidence from multilingual corporate documents.
We conclude that while the automated RAG system effectively accelerates
evidence extraction, the nuanced nature of the analysis necessitates a
human-in-the-loop approach where the technology augments, rather than replaces,
expert judgment to ensure accuracy.

Abstract: We introduce LITcoder, an open-source library for building and benchmarking
neural encoding models. Designed as a flexible backend, LITcoder provides
standardized tools for aligning continuous stimuli (e.g., text and speech) with
brain data, transforming stimuli into representational features, mapping those
features onto brain data, and evaluating the predictive performance of the
resulting model on held-out data. The library implements a modular pipeline
covering a wide array of methodological design choices, so researchers can
easily compose, compare, and extend encoding models without reinventing core
infrastructure. Such choices include brain datasets, brain regions, stimulus
feature (both neural-net-based and control, such as word rate), downsampling
approaches, and many others. In addition, the library provides built-in
logging, plotting, and seamless integration with experiment tracking platforms
such as Weights & Biases (W&B). We demonstrate the scalability and versatility
of our framework by fitting a range of encoding models to three story listening
datasets: LeBel et al. (2023), Narratives, and Little Prince. We also explore
the methodological choices critical for building encoding models for continuous
fMRI data, illustrating the importance of accounting for all tokens in a TR
scan (as opposed to just taking the last one, even when contextualized),
incorporating hemodynamic lag effects, using train-test splits that minimize
information leakage, and accounting for head motion effects on encoding model
predictivity. Overall, LITcoder lowers technical barriers to encoding model
implementation, facilitates systematic comparisons across models and datasets,
fosters methodological rigor, and accelerates the development of high-quality
high-performance predictive models of brain activity.

<details>

Motivation: 传统Trie-based偏置方法在beam search中需要撤销部分假设的奖励分数，计算开销大且仅限于beam search，限制了在大解码器模型中的应用

Method: 通过让ASR模型进行多步前瞻预测，更好地估计部分假设是否会导致完整罕见词的生成，从而避免分数撤销步骤。使用仅10小时的合成数据对Whisper模型进行微调

Result: 在NSC Part 2测试集上，词错误率从30.86%降至12.19%，显著提升了罕见词识别性能

Conclusion: 多步预测方法有效解决了传统偏置方法的计算效率问题，为ASR系统的上下文偏置提供了更高效的解决方案

Abstract: Contextual biasing improves rare word recognition of ASR models by
prioritizing the output of rare words during decoding. A common approach is
Trie-based biasing, which gives "bonus scores" to partial hypothesis (e.g.
"Bon") that may lead to the generation of the rare word (e.g. "Bonham"). If the
full word ("Bonham") isn't ultimately recognized, the system revokes those
earlier bonuses. This revocation is limited to beam search and is
computationally expensive, particularly for models with large decoders. To
overcome these limitations, we propose adapting ASR models to look ahead and
predict multiple steps at once. This avoids the revocation step entirely by
better estimating whether a partial hypothesis will lead to the generation of
the full rare word. By fine-tuning Whisper with only 10 hours of synthetic
data, our method reduces the word error rate on the NSC Part 2 test set from
30.86% to 12.19%.

Result: 在NSC Part 2测试集上将词错误率从29.71%降低到11.81%

Conclusion: 关键词感知损失函数能有效提升上下文偏置模块的性能，改善稀有词识别

Abstract: Rare word recognition can be improved by adapting ASR models to synthetic
data that includes these words. Further improvements can be achieved through
contextual biasing, which trains and adds a biasing module into the model
architecture to prioritize rare words. While training the module on synthetic
rare word data is more effective than using non-rare-word data, it can lead to
overfitting due to artifacts in the synthetic audio. To address this, we
enhance the TCPGen-based contextual biasing approach and propose a
keyword-aware loss function that additionally focuses on biased words when
training biasing modules. This loss includes a masked cross-entropy term for
biased word prediction and a binary classification term for detecting biased
word positions. These two terms complementarily support the decoding of biased
words during inference. By adapting Whisper to 10 hours of synthetic data, our
method reduced the word error rate on the NSC Part 2 test set from 29.71% to
11.81%.

Conclusion: HumbleBench通过明确要求拒绝错误选项，填补了当前评估套件的关键空白，为安全关键场景提供了更可靠的MLLM可靠性衡量标准。

Abstract: Hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) -- where the model
generates content inconsistent with the input image -- pose significant risks
in real-world applications, from misinformation in visual question answering to
unsafe errors in decision-making. Existing benchmarks primarily test
recognition accuracy, i.e., evaluating whether models can select the correct
answer among distractors. This overlooks an equally critical capability for
trustworthy AI: recognizing when none of the provided options are correct, a
behavior reflecting epistemic humility. We present HumbleBench, a new
hallucination benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' ability to reject plausible
but incorrect answers across three hallucination types: object, relation, and
attribute. Built from a panoptic scene graph dataset, we leverage fine-grained
scene graph annotations to extract ground-truth entities and relations, and
prompt GPT-4-Turbo to generate multiple-choice questions, followed by a
rigorous manual filtering process. Each question includes a "None of the above"
option, requiring models not only to recognize correct visual information but
also to identify when no provided answer is valid. We evaluate a variety of
state-of-the-art MLLMs -- including both general-purpose and specialized
reasoning models -- on HumbleBench and share valuable findings and insights
with the community. By incorporating explicit false-option rejection,
HumbleBench fills a key gap in current evaluation suites, providing a more
realistic measure of MLLM reliability in safety-critical settings. Our code and

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an insightful paradigm through the Auto-Encoder
lens-understanding as the encoder (I2T) that compresses images into text, and
generation as the decoder (T2I) that reconstructs images from that text. Using
reconstruction fidelity as the unified training objective, we enforce the
coherent bidirectional information flow between the understanding and
generation processes, bringing mutual gains. To implement this, we propose UAE,
a novel framework for unified multimodal learning. We begin by pre-training the
decoder with large-scale long-context image captions to capture fine-grained
semantic and complex spatial relationships. We then propose Unified-GRPO via
reinforcement learning (RL), which covers three stages: (1) A cold-start phase
to gently initialize both encoder and decoder with a semantic reconstruction
loss; (2) Generation for Understanding, where the encoder is trained to
generate informative captions that maximize the decoder's reconstruction
quality, enhancing its visual understanding; (3) Understanding for Generation,
where the decoder is refined to reconstruct from these captions, forcing it to
leverage every detail and improving its long-context instruction following and
generation fidelity. For evaluation, we introduce Unified-Bench, the first
benchmark tailored to assess the degree of unification of the UMMs. A
surprising "aha moment" arises within the multimodal learning domain: as RL
progresses, the encoder autonomously produces more descriptive captions, while
the decoder simultaneously demonstrates a profound ability to understand these
intricate descriptions, resulting in reconstructions of striking fidelity.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models exhibit unprecedented capabilities for
embodied intelligence. However, their extensive computational and memory costs
hinder their practical deployment. Existing VLA compression and acceleration
approaches conduct quantization or token pruning in an ad-hoc manner but fail
to enable both for a holistic efficiency improvement due to an observed
incompatibility. This work introduces SQAP-VLA, the first structured,
training-free VLA inference acceleration framework that simultaneously enables
state-of-the-art quantization and token pruning. We overcome the
incompatibility by co-designing the quantization and token pruning pipeline,
where we propose new quantization-aware token pruning criteria that work on an
aggressively quantized model while improving the quantizer design to enhance
pruning effectiveness. When applied to standard VLA models, SQAP-VLA yields
significant gains in computational efficiency and inference speed while
successfully preserving core model performance, achieving a $\times$1.93
speedup and up to a 4.5\% average success rate enhancement compared to the
original model.

Abstract: Chart understanding presents a critical test to the reasoning capabilities of
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior approaches face critical limitations: some
rely on external tools, making them brittle and constrained by a predefined
toolkit, while others fine-tune specialist models that often adopt a single
reasoning strategy, such as text-based chain-of-thought (CoT). The intermediate
steps of text-based reasoning are difficult to verify, which complicates the
use of reinforcement-learning signals that reward factual accuracy. To address
this, we propose a Code-as-Thought (CaT) approach to represent the visual
information of a chart in a verifiable, symbolic format. Our key insight is
that this strategy must be adaptive: a fixed, code-only implementation
consistently fails on complex charts where symbolic representation is
unsuitable. This finding leads us to introduce Visual Programmability: a
learnable property that determines if a chart-question pair is better solved
with code or direct visual analysis. We implement this concept in an adaptive
framework where a VLM learns to choose between the CaT pathway and a direct
visual reasoning pathway. The selection policy of the model is trained with
reinforcement learning using a novel dual-reward system. This system combines a
data-accuracy reward to ground the model in facts and prevent numerical
hallucination, with a decision reward that teaches the model when to use each
strategy, preventing it from defaulting to a single reasoning mode. Experiments
demonstrate strong and robust performance across diverse chart-understanding
benchmarks. Our work shows that VLMs can be taught not only to reason but also
how to reason, dynamically selecting the optimal reasoning pathway for each
task.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled strong zero-shot classification
through image-text alignment. Yet, their purely visual inference capabilities
remain under-explored. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
both language-guided and vision-only image classification with a diverse set of

SigLIP 2 and RADIOv2.5. The performance is compared in a standard setup on the
ImageNet-1k validation set and its label-corrected variant. The key factors
affecting accuracy are analysed, including prompt design, class diversity, the
number of neighbours in k-NN, and reference set size. We show that language and
vision offer complementary strengths, with some classes favouring textual
prompts and others better handled by visual similarity. To exploit this

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate when and how visual representations learned by
two different generative models diverge. Given two text-to-image models, our
goal is to discover visual attributes that appear in images generated by one
model but not the other, along with the types of prompts that trigger these
attribute differences. For example, "flames" might appear in one model's
outputs when given prompts expressing strong emotions, while the other model
does not produce this attribute given the same prompts. We introduce CompCon
(Comparing Concepts), an evolutionary search algorithm that discovers visual
attributes more prevalent in one model's output than the other, and uncovers
the prompt concepts linked to these visual differences. To evaluate CompCon's
ability to find diverging representations, we create an automated data
generation pipeline to produce ID2, a dataset of 60 input-dependent
differences, and compare our approach to several LLM- and VLM-powered

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved impressive results in computer
vision by leveraging self-attention to model long-range dependencies. However,
their emphasis on global context often comes at the expense of local feature
extraction in small datasets, particularly due to the lack of key inductive
biases such as locality and translation equivariance. To mitigate this, we
propose CoSwin, a novel feature-fusion architecture that augments the
hierarchical shifted window attention with localized convolutional feature
learning. Specifically, CoSwin integrates a learnable local feature enhancement
module into each attention block, enabling the model to simultaneously capture
fine-grained spatial details and global semantic structure. We evaluate CoSwin
on multiple image classification benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
MNIST, SVHN, and Tiny ImageNet. Our experimental results show consistent
performance gains over state-of-the-art convolutional and transformer-based

CIFAR-100, 0.10% on MNIST, 0.26% on SVHN, and 4.47% on Tiny ImageNet over the

Abstract: Understanding 3D medical image volumes is critical in the medical field, yet
existing 3D medical convolution and transformer-based self-supervised learning
(SSL) methods often lack deep semantic comprehension. Recent advancements in
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) provide a promising approach to

a specially designed plane-slice-aware transformer module. Additionally, our

greater tolerance to noise introduced by potential noises in LLM-generated

Abstract: Although Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) exhibits strong
performance across diverse vision tasks, its application to person
representation learning faces two critical challenges: (i) the scarcity of
large-scale annotated vision-language data focused on person-centric images,
and (ii) the inherent limitations of global contrastive learning, which
struggles to maintain discriminative local features crucial for fine-grained
matching while remaining vulnerable to noisy text tokens. This work advances
CLIP for person representation learning through synergistic improvements in
data curation and model architecture. First, we develop a noise-resistant data
construction pipeline that leverages the in-context learning capabilities of
MLLMs to automatically filter and caption web-sourced images. This yields
WebPerson, a large-scale dataset of 5M high-quality person-centric image-text
pairs. Second, we introduce the GA-DMS (Gradient-Attention Guided Dual-Masking
Synergetic) framework, which improves cross-modal alignment by adaptively
masking noisy textual tokens based on the gradient-attention similarity score.
Additionally, we incorporate masked token prediction objectives that compel the

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) offers a promising paradigm for universal medical
image analysis, enabling models to perform diverse image processing tasks
without retraining. However, current ICL models for medical imaging remain
limited in two critical aspects: they cannot simultaneously achieve
high-fidelity predictions and global anatomical understanding, and there is no
unified model trained across diverse medical imaging tasks (e.g., segmentation
and enhancement) and anatomical regions. As a result, the full potential of ICL
in medical imaging remains underexplored. Thus, we present \textbf{Medverse}, a
universal ICL model for 3D medical imaging, trained on 22 datasets covering
diverse tasks in universal image segmentation, transformation, and enhancement
across multiple organs, imaging modalities, and clinical centers. Medverse
employs a next-scale autoregressive in-context learning framework that
progressively refines predictions from coarse to fine, generating consistent,
full-resolution volumetric outputs and enabling multi-scale anatomical
awareness. We further propose a blockwise cross-attention module that
facilitates long-range interactions between context and target inputs while
preserving computational efficiency through spatial sparsity. Medverse is
extensively evaluated on a broad collection of held-out datasets covering
previously unseen clinical centers, organs, species, and imaging modalities.
Results demonstrate that Medverse substantially outperforms existing ICL
baselines and establishes a novel paradigm for in-context learning. Code and

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
strong performance on general-purpose medical tasks. However, their
effectiveness in specialized domains such as dentistry remains underexplored.
In particular, panoramic X-rays, a widely used imaging modality in oral
radiology, pose interpretative challenges due to dense anatomical structures
and subtle pathological cues, which are not captured by existing medical
benchmarks or instruction datasets. To this end, we introduce MMOral, the first
large-scale multimodal instruction dataset and benchmark tailored for panoramic
X-ray interpretation. MMOral consists of 20,563 annotated images paired with
1.3 million instruction-following instances across diverse task types,
including attribute extraction, report generation, visual question answering,
and image-grounded dialogue. In addition, we present MMOral-Bench, a
comprehensive evaluation suite covering five key diagnostic dimensions in
dentistry. We evaluate 64 LVLMs on MMOral-Bench and find that even the
best-performing model, i.e., GPT-4o, only achieves 41.45% accuracy, revealing
significant limitations of current models in this domain. To promote the
progress of this specific domain, we also propose OralGPT, which conducts
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) upon Qwen2.5-VL-7B with our meticulously curated
MMOral instruction dataset. Remarkably, a single epoch of SFT yields
substantial performance enhancements for LVLMs, e.g., OralGPT demonstrates a
24.73% improvement. Both MMOral and OralGPT hold significant potential as a

frame sampling and rely on implicit position encodings to model temporal order.
However, these methods struggle with long-range dependencies, leading to
critical information loss and degraded temporal comprehension. In this paper,
we propose Dynamic Absolute Time Enhancement (DATE) that enhances temporal
awareness in MLLMs through the Timestamp Injection Mechanism (TIM) and a
semantically guided Temporal-Aware Similarity Sampling (TASS) strategy.
Specifically, we interleave video frame embeddings with textual timestamp
tokens to construct a continuous temporal reference system. We further
reformulate the video sampling problem as a vision-language retrieval task and
introduce a two-stage algorithm to ensure both semantic relevance and temporal
coverage: enriching each query into a descriptive caption to better align with
the vision feature, and sampling key event with a similarity-driven temporally
regularized greedy strategy. Our method achieves remarkable improvements w.r.t.
absolute time understanding and key event localization, resulting in
state-of-the-art performance among 7B and 72B models on hour-long video
benchmarks. Particularly, our 7B model even exceeds many 72B models on some
benchmarks.

Abstract: Materials characterization is fundamental to acquiring materials information,
revealing the processing-microstructure-property relationships that guide
material design and optimization. While multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) have recently shown promise in generative and predictive tasks within
materials science, their capacity to understand real-world characterization
imaging data remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present MatCha, the
first benchmark for materials characterization image understanding, comprising
1,500 questions that demand expert-level domain expertise. MatCha encompasses
four key stages of materials research comprising 21 distinct tasks, each
designed to reflect authentic challenges faced by materials scientists. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on MatCha reveals a significant
performance gap compared to human experts. These models exhibit degradation
when addressing questions requiring higher-level expertise and sophisticated
visual perception. Simple few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting struggle to
alleviate these limitations. These findings highlight that existing MLLMs still
exhibit limited adaptability to real-world materials characterization
scenarios. We hope MatCha will facilitate future research in areas such as new
material discovery and autonomous scientific agents. MatCha is available at

Conclusion: 解耦任务相关特征和精心对齐显著增强模型泛化能力，减少领域偏移下的不可预测行为，有助于构建更安全可信的临床VLMs。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) offer promise for clinical decision
support, yet their reliability under distribution shifts remains a major
concern for safe deployment. These models often learn task-agnostic
correlations due to variability in imaging protocols and free-text reports,
limiting their generalizability and increasing the risk of failure in
real-world settings. We propose DRiFt, a structured feature decoupling
framework that explicitly separates clinically relevant signals from
task-agnostic noise using parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA) and learnable
prompt tokens. To enhance cross-modal alignment and reduce uncertainty, we
curate high-quality, clinically grounded image-text pairs by generating
captions for a diverse medical dataset. Our approach improves in-distribution
performance by +11.4% Top-1 accuracy and +3.3% Macro-F1 over prior prompt-based
methods, while maintaining strong robustness across unseen datasets. Ablation
studies reveal that disentangling task-relevant features and careful alignment
significantly enhance model generalization and reduce unpredictable behavior
under domain shift. These insights contribute toward building safer, more
trustworthy VLMs for clinical use. The code is available at

Abstract: Recent advances in image-level self-supervised learning (SSL) have made
significant progress, yet learning dense representations for patches remains
challenging. Mainstream methods encounter an over-dispersion phenomenon that
patches from the same instance/category scatter, harming downstream performance
on dense tasks. This work reveals that image-level SSL avoids over-dispersion
by involving implicit semantic concentration. Specifically, the non-strict
spatial alignment ensures intra-instance consistency, while shared patterns,
i.e., similar parts of within-class instances in the input space, ensure
inter-image consistency. Unfortunately, these approaches are infeasible for
dense SSL due to their spatial sensitivity and complicated scene-centric data.
These observations motivate us to explore explicit semantic concentration for
dense SSL. First, to break the strict spatial alignment, we propose to distill
the patch correspondences. Facing noisy and imbalanced pseudo labels, we
propose a noise-tolerant ranking loss. The core idea is extending the Average
Precision (AP) loss to continuous targets, such that its decision-agnostic and
adaptive focusing properties prevent the student model from being misled.
Second, to discriminate the shared patterns from complicated scenes, we propose
the object-aware filter to map the output space to an object-based space.
Specifically, patches are represented by learnable prototypes of objects via
cross-attention. Last but not least, empirical studies across various tasks
soundly support the effectiveness of our method. Code is available in

Result: 能够生成生动、流畅的长时视频（最高1080p、48fps），在唇同步精度、情感动态表达、指令可控性等方面表现优异。

Conclusion: Kling-Avatar为语义基础的高保真音频驱动虚拟人合成设立了新基准，适用于数字人直播和视频博客等实际应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-driven avatar video generation have significantly
enhanced audio-visual realism. However, existing methods treat instruction
conditioning merely as low-level tracking driven by acoustic or visual cues,
without modeling the communicative purpose conveyed by the instructions. This
limitation compromises their narrative coherence and character expressiveness.
To bridge this gap, we introduce Kling-Avatar, a novel cascaded framework that
unifies multimodal instruction understanding with photorealistic portrait
generation. Our approach adopts a two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, we
design a multimodal large language model (MLLM) director that produces a
blueprint video conditioned on diverse instruction signals, thereby governing
high-level semantics such as character motion and emotions. In the second
stage, guided by blueprint keyframes, we generate multiple sub-clips in
parallel using a first-last frame strategy. This global-to-local framework
preserves fine-grained details while faithfully encoding the high-level intent
behind multimodal instructions. Our parallel architecture also enables fast and
stable generation of long-duration videos, making it suitable for real-world
applications such as digital human livestreaming and vlogging. To
comprehensively evaluate our method, we construct a benchmark of 375 curated
samples covering diverse instructions and challenging scenarios. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Kling-Avatar is capable of generating vivid,
fluent, long-duration videos at up to 1080p and 48 fps, achieving superior
performance in lip synchronization accuracy, emotion and dynamic
expressiveness, instruction controllability, identity preservation, and
cross-domain generalization. These results establish Kling-Avatar as a new
benchmark for semantically grounded, high-fidelity audio-driven avatar

Abstract: Among generative models, diffusion models are uniquely intriguing due to the
existence of a closed-form optimal minimizer of their training objective, often
referred to as the optimal denoiser. However, diffusion using this optimal
denoiser merely reproduces images in the training set and hence fails to
capture the behavior of deep diffusion models. Recent work has attempted to
characterize this gap between the optimal denoiser and deep diffusion models,
proposing analytical, training-free models that can generate images that
resemble those generated by a trained UNet. The best-performing method
hypothesizes that shift equivariance and locality inductive biases of
convolutional neural networks are the cause of the performance gap, hence
incorporating these assumptions into its analytical model. In this work, we
present evidence that the locality in deep diffusion models emerges as a
statistical property of the image dataset, not due to the inductive bias of
convolutional neural networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that an optimal
parametric linear denoiser exhibits similar locality properties to the deep
neural denoisers. We further show, both theoretically and experimentally, that
this locality arises directly from the pixel correlations present in natural
image datasets. Finally, we use these insights to craft an analytical denoiser
that better matches scores predicted by a deep diffusion model than the prior
expert-crafted alternative.

Abstract: Humans can recognize the same actions despite large context and viewpoint
variations, such as differences between species (walking in spiders vs.
horses), viewpoints (egocentric vs. third-person), and contexts (real life vs
movies). Current deep learning models struggle with such generalization. We
propose using features generated by a Vision Diffusion Model (VDM), aggregated
via a transformer, to achieve human-like action recognition across these
challenging conditions. We find that generalization is enhanced by the use of a
model conditioned on earlier timesteps of the diffusion process to highlight
semantic information over pixel level details in the extracted features. We
experimentally explore the generalization properties of our approach in
classifying actions across animal species, across different viewing angles, and
different recording contexts. Our model sets a new state-of-the-art across all
three generalization benchmarks, bringing machine action recognition closer to
human-like robustness. Project page:

Abstract: Different modalities of medical images provide unique physiological and
anatomical information for diseases. Multi-modal medical image fusion
integrates useful information from different complementary medical images with
different modalities, producing a fused image that comprehensively and
objectively reflects lesion characteristics to assist doctors in clinical
diagnosis. However, existing fusion methods can only handle a fixed number of
modality inputs, such as accepting only two-modal or tri-modal inputs, and
cannot directly process varying input quantities, which hinders their
application in clinical settings. To tackle this issue, we introduce
FlexiD-Fuse, a diffusion-based image fusion network designed to accommodate
flexible quantities of input modalities. It can end-to-end process two-modal
and tri-modal medical image fusion under the same weight. FlexiD-Fuse
transforms the diffusion fusion problem, which supports only fixed-condition
inputs, into a maximum likelihood estimation problem based on the diffusion
process and hierarchical Bayesian modeling. By incorporating the
Expectation-Maximization algorithm into the diffusion sampling iteration
process, FlexiD-Fuse can generate high-quality fused images with cross-modal
information from source images, independently of the number of input images. We
compared the latest two and tri-modal medical image fusion methods, tested them
on Harvard datasets, and evaluated them using nine popular metrics. The
experimental results show that our method achieves the best performance in
medical image fusion with varying inputs. Meanwhile, we conducted extensive
extension experiments on infrared-visible, multi-exposure, and multi-focus
image fusion tasks with arbitrary numbers, and compared them with the
perspective SOTA methods. The results of the extension experiments consistently

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard for brain imaging. Deep
learning (DL) algorithms have been proposed to aid in the diagnosis of diseases
such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) from MRI scans. However, DL algorithms can
suffer from shortcut learning, in which spurious features, not directly related
to the output label, are used for prediction. When these features are related
to protected attributes, they can lead to performance bias against
underrepresented protected groups, such as those defined by race and sex. In
this work, we explore the potential for shortcut learning and demographic bias
in DL based AD diagnosis from MRI. We first investigate if DL algorithms can
identify race or sex from 3D brain MRI scans to establish the presence or
otherwise of race and sex based distributional shifts. Next, we investigate
whether training set imbalance by race or sex can cause a drop in model
performance, indicating shortcut learning and bias. Finally, we conduct a
quantitative and qualitative analysis of feature attributions in different
brain regions for both the protected attribute and AD classification tasks.
Through these experiments, and using multiple datasets and DL models (ResNet
and SwinTransformer), we demonstrate the existence of both race and sex based
shortcut learning and bias in DL based AD classification. Our work lays the
foundation for fairer DL diagnostic tools in brain MRI. The code is provided at

state-of-the-art self-supervised representation learner. The framework is
complemented by a deliberately lightweight decoder, ensuring the focus remains

Abstract: Urdu, spoken by over 250 million people, remains critically under-served in
multimodal and vision-language research. The absence of large-scale,
high-quality datasets has limited the development of Urdu-capable systems and
reinforced biases in multilingual vision-language models trained primarily on
high-resource languages. To address this gap, we present COCO-Urdu, a
large-scale image-caption dataset derived from MS COCO, containing 59,000
images and 319,000 Urdu captions selected through stratified sampling to
preserve the original distribution. Captions were translated using SeamlessM4T
v2 and validated with a hybrid multimodal quality estimation framework that
integrates COMET-Kiwi for translation quality, CLIP-based similarity for visual
grounding, and BERTScore with back-translation for semantic consistency;
low-scoring captions were iteratively refined using open-source large language
models. We further benchmark COCO-Urdu on BLEU, SacreBLEU, and chrF, reporting
consistently strong results. To the best of our knowledge, COCO-Urdu is the
largest publicly available Urdu captioning dataset. By releasing both the
dataset and the quality estimation pipeline, we aim to reduce language bias in

*Zhiyue Liu,Sihang Liu,Jinyuan Liu,Xinru Zhang*

Relevance: 40.0

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的知识聚焦框架用于KB-VQA，通过减少知识冗余和噪声来提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的KB-VQA方法直接将检索到的知识信息增强模型，忽略了知识冗余问题，这给回答过程引入了噪声

Method: 1) 从图像-问题对中提取关键部分创建低噪声查询；2) 使用大模型识别和提取对答案有益的知识片段；3) 引入选择性知识整合策略，仅在模型对回答缺乏信心时整合知识

Result: 在广泛实验中，该框架优于最先进的方法

Conclusion: 该框架能够获取准确和关键的知识，有效减轻冗余信息的影响

Abstract: Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) requires a model to
understand images and utilize external knowledge to provide accurate answers.
Existing approaches often directly augment models with retrieved information
from knowledge sources while ignoring substantial knowledge redundancy, which
introduces noise into the answering process. To address this, we propose a
training-free framework with knowledge focusing for KB-VQA, that mitigates the
impact of noise by enhancing knowledge relevance and reducing redundancy.
First, for knowledge retrieval, our framework concludes essential parts from
the image-question pairs, creating low-noise queries that enhance the retrieval
of highly relevant knowledge. Considering that redundancy still persists in the
retrieved knowledge, we then prompt large models to identify and extract
answer-beneficial segments from knowledge. In addition, we introduce a
selective knowledge integration strategy, allowing the model to incorporate
knowledge only when it lacks confidence in answering the question, thereby
mitigating the influence of redundant information. Our framework enables the
acquisition of accurate and critical knowledge, and extensive experiments
demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出Beta-SOD方法，使用Beta混合模型进行统计异常检测，解决目标重识别任务中的标签噪声问题，在多个数据集上表现出优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标重识别方法对标签噪声高度敏感，会导致显著的性能下降。需要开发能够有效处理噪声标签的鲁棒方法。

Method: 将Re-ID重构为监督图像相似性任务，采用Siamese网络架构，提出Beta-SOD统计异常检测框架，使用双分量Beta分布混合模型建模嵌入对之间的余弦相似度分布。

Result: 在CUHK03、Market-1501和VeRi-776数据集上，Beta-SOD在10-30%噪声水平下相比最先进方法表现出优越性能，展示了在噪声Re-ID场景中的鲁棒性和广泛适用性。

Conclusion: Beta-SOD通过统计异常检测有效解决了Re-ID中的标签噪声问题，为噪声环境下的目标重识别提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Object re-identification (Re-ID) methods are highly sensitive to label noise,
which typically leads to significant performance degradation. We address this
challenge by reframing Re-ID as a supervised image similarity task and adopting
a Siamese network architecture trained to capture discriminative pairwise
relationships. Central to our approach is a novel statistical outlier detection
(OD) framework, termed Beta-SOD (Beta mixture Similarity-based Outlier
Detection), which models the distribution of cosine similarities between
embedding pairs using a two-component Beta distribution mixture model. We
establish a novel identifiability result for mixtures of two Beta
distributions, ensuring that our learning task is well-posed.The proposed OD
step complements the Re-ID architecture combining binary cross-entropy,
contrastive, and cosine embedding losses that jointly optimize feature-level
similarity learning.We demonstrate the effectiveness of Beta-SOD in de-noising
and Re-ID tasks for person Re-ID, on CUHK03 and Market-1501 datasets, and
vehicle Re-ID, on VeRi-776 dataset. Our method shows superior performance
compared to the state-of-the-art methods across various noise levels (10-30\%),
demonstrating both robustness and broad applicability in noisy Re-ID scenarios.

TL;DR: SFD-Mamba2Net是一个用于冠状动脉分割和狭窄检测的端到端框架，结合了多尺度结构先验、状态空间长程依赖建模和频域细节增强策略，在ICA图像上取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冠状动脉疾病是全球主要死因之一，ICA作为金标准诊断方法需要精确的血管分割和狭窄检测。但ICA图像具有低对比度、高噪声和复杂血管结构的特点，现有方法难以满足临床需求。

Method: 提出SFD-Mamba2Net框架：编码器嵌入曲率感知结构增强模块(CASE)来突出血管结构；解码器引入渐进高频感知模块(PHFP)通过小波分解细化高频细节并整合低频全局结构。

Result: 在八个分割指标上均优于最先进方法，在狭窄检测中获得了最高的真阳性率和阳性预测值。

Conclusion: 该框架通过整合多尺度结构先验、长程依赖建模和频域增强策略，显著提升了ICA图像中冠状动脉分割和狭窄检测的准确性。

Abstract: Background: Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of
death worldwide. Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA), regarded as the gold
standard for CAD diagnosis, necessitates precise vessel segmentation and
stenosis detection. However, ICA images are typically characterized by low
contrast, high noise levels, and complex, fine-grained vascular structures,
which pose significant challenges to the clinical adoption of existing
segmentation and detection methods. Objective: This study aims to improve the
accuracy of coronary artery segmentation and stenosis detection in ICA images
by integrating multi-scale structural priors, state-space-based long-range
dependency modeling, and frequency-domain detail enhancement strategies.
Methods: We propose SFD-Mamba2Net, an end-to-end framework tailored for
ICA-based vascular segmentation and stenosis detection. In the encoder, a
Curvature-Aware Structural Enhancement (CASE) module is embedded to leverage
multi-scale responses for highlighting slender tubular vascular structures,
suppressing background interference, and directing attention toward vascular
regions. In the decoder, we introduce a Progressive High-Frequency Perception
(PHFP) module that employs multi-level wavelet decomposition to progressively
refine high-frequency details while integrating low-frequency global
structures. Results and Conclusions: SFD-Mamba2Net consistently outperformed
state-of-the-art methods across eight segmentation metrics, and achieved the
highest true positive rate and positive predictive value in stenosis detection.

Motivation: 现有方法如MLNet对所有分类器平等对待，导致学习信号稀释，需要更精细的边界适应策略来提升域自适应性能

Method: E-MLNet集成动态权重策略到开放集熵最小化(OEM)中，利用闭集分类器的预测结果，针对每个目标样本聚焦于最相关的类别边界进行适应

Result: 在四个基准测试(Office-31、Office-Home、VisDA-2017、ImageCLEF)上，E-MLNet在VisDA和ImageCLEF上获得最高平均H分数，在Open-Partial DA设置中31个任务中22个优于MLNet，在Open-Set DA设置中31个任务中19个优于MLNet

Conclusion: 动态权重策略有效提升了域自适应性能，证明了聚焦适应策略的益处，E-MLNet展现出比前身更强的鲁棒性

Abstract: Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA) seeks to transfer knowledge from a
labeled source to an unlabeled target domain without assuming any relationship
between their label sets, requiring models to classify known samples while
rejecting unknown ones. Advanced methods like Mutual Learning Network (MLNet)
use a bank of one-vs-all classifiers adapted via Open-set Entropy Minimization
(OEM). However, this strategy treats all classifiers equally, diluting the
learning signal. We propose the Enhanced Mutual Learning Network (E-MLNet),
which integrates a dynamic weighting strategy to OEM. By leveraging the
closed-set classifier's predictions, E-MLNet focuses adaptation on the most
relevant class boundaries for each target sample, sharpening the distinction
between known and unknown classes. We conduct extensive experiments on four
challenging benchmarks: Office-31, Office-Home, VisDA-2017, and ImageCLEF. The
results demonstrate that E-MLNet achieves the highest average H-scores on VisDA
and ImageCLEF and exhibits superior robustness over its predecessor. E-MLNet
outperforms the strong MLNet baseline in the majority of individual adaptation
tasks -- 22 out of 31 in the challenging Open-Partial DA setting and 19 out of
31 in the Open-Set DA setting -- confirming the benefits of our focused
adaptation strategy.

Motivation: 解决PET成像中标记数据有限和计算资源不足的问题，克服数据稀缺和效率限制，构建大规模基础模型。

Method: 采用潜在扩散模型(LDM)，包含三个创新：1)放射掩码增强策略(RMAS)生成20万+多样化训练样本；2)正负掩码约束嵌入几何一致性；3)透明医学注意力(TMA)机制增强病灶相关区域。

Result: 仅用500个样本就实现了高质量的sinogram生成，性能可与使用更大数据集训练的模型相媲美，内存使用低于24GB，在低剂量重建、衰减校正、延迟帧预测和示踪剂分离等任务中表现良好。

Conclusion: ALL-PET成功解决了PET成像中的数据稀缺问题，提供了一个高效、可解释且任务自适应的基础模型解决方案。

Abstract: Building large-scale foundation model for PET imaging is hindered by limited
access to labeled data and insufficient computational resources. To overcome
data scarcity and efficiency limitations, we propose ALL-PET, a low-resource,
low-shot PET foundation model operating directly in the projection domain.
ALL-PET leverages a latent diffusion model (LDM) with three key innovations.
First, we design a Radon mask augmentation strategy (RMAS) that generates over
200,000 structurally diverse training samples by projecting randomized
image-domain masks into sinogram space, significantly improving generalization
with minimal data. This is extended by a dynamic multi-mask (DMM) mechanism
that varies mask quantity and distribution, enhancing data diversity without
added model complexity. Second, we implement positive/negative mask constraints
to embed strict geometric consistency, reducing parameter burden while
preserving generation quality. Third, we introduce transparent medical
attention (TMA), a parameter-free, geometry-driven mechanism that enhances
lesion-related regions in raw projection data. Lesion-focused attention maps
are derived from coarse segmentation, covering both hypermetabolic and
hypometabolic areas, and projected into sinogram space for physically
consistent guidance. The system supports clinician-defined ROI adjustments,
ensuring flexible, interpretable, and task-adaptive emphasis aligned with PET
acquisition physics. Experimental results show ALL-PET achieves high-quality
sinogram generation using only 500 samples, with performance comparable to
models trained on larger datasets. ALL-PET generalizes across tasks including
low-dose reconstruction, attenuation correction, delayed-frame prediction, and
tracer separation, operating efficiently with memory use under 24GB.

Method: 使用监督神经网络预测2D二值图像的Betti数，与基于立方复形和符号欧几里得距离变换(SEDT)的持久同调流程进行对比，在一个合成数据集和两个真实数据集上进行实验

Result: 实验表明，在噪声条件下，神经网络能够超越持久同调方法，这归因于神经网络从训练数据中学习上下文和几何先验的能力

Conclusion: 尽管仍处于发展初期，但使用神经网络进行拓扑估计为结构噪声下的拓扑分析提供了一个有吸引力的替代方案

Abstract: Persistent Homology (PH) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) offer
contrasting approaches to inferring topological structure from data. In this
study, we examine the noise robustness of a supervised neural network trained
to predict Betti numbers in 2D binary images. We compare an ANN approach
against a PH pipeline based on cubical complexes and the Signed Euclidean
Distance Transform (SEDT), which is a widely adopted strategy for noise-robust
topological analysis. Using one synthetic and two real-world datasets, we show
that ANNs can outperform this PH approach under noise, likely due to their
capacity to learn contextual and geometric priors from training data. Though
still emerging, the use of ANNs for topology estimation offers a compelling
alternative to PH under structural noise.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, highly realistic image

Although AI-generated image detection methods have partially addressed these
concerns, a substantial research gap remains in evaluating their performance

detector performance on images that have undergone multiple rounds of sharing
across various social media platforms. 3) Re-digitization Robustness: assessing
model effectiveness on images altered through four distinct re-digitization
methods. We benchmarked 17 detectors and 10 vision-language models (VLMs) on
RRDataset and conducted a large-scale human study involving 192 participants to
investigate human few-shot learning capabilities in detecting AI-generated
images. The benchmarking results reveal the limitations of current AI detection
methods under real-world conditions and underscore the importance of drawing on
human adaptability to develop more robust detection algorithms.

Abstract: Open-set detection is crucial for robust UAV autonomy in air-to-air object
detection under real-world conditions. Traditional closed-set detectors degrade
significantly under domain shifts and flight data corruption, posing risks to
safety-critical applications. We propose a novel, model-agnostic open-set
detection framework designed specifically for embedding-based detectors. The
method explicitly handles unknown object rejection while maintaining robustness
against corrupted flight data. It estimates semantic uncertainty via entropy
modeling in the embedding space and incorporates spectral normalization and
temperature scaling to enhance open-set discrimination. We validate our
approach on the challenging AOT aerial benchmark and through extensive
real-world flight tests. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate consistent
improvements over baseline methods, achieving up to a 10\% relative AUROC gain
compared to standard YOLO-based detectors. Additionally, we show that
background rejection further strengthens robustness without compromising
detection accuracy, making our solution particularly well-suited for reliable
UAV perception in dynamic air-to-air environments.

Conclusion: PHCP证明了在推理阶段直接处理异构协作感知问题的可行性，为实际应用提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Collaborative perception enables vehicles to overcome individual perception
limitations by sharing information, allowing them to see further and through
occlusions. In real-world scenarios, models on different vehicles are often
heterogeneous due to manufacturer variations. Existing methods for
heterogeneous collaborative perception address this challenge by fine-tuning
adapters or the entire network to bridge the domain gap. However, these methods
are impractical in real-world applications, as each new collaborator must
undergo joint training with the ego vehicle on a dataset before inference, or
the ego vehicle stores models for all potential collaborators in advance.
Therefore, we pose a new question: Can we tackle this challenge directly during
inference, eliminating the need for joint training? To answer this, we
introduce Progressive Heterogeneous Collaborative Perception (PHCP), a novel
framework that formulates the problem as few-shot unsupervised domain
adaptation. Unlike previous work, PHCP dynamically aligns features by
self-training an adapter during inference, eliminating the need for labeled
data and joint training. Extensive experiments on the OPV2V dataset demonstrate
that PHCP achieves strong performance across diverse heterogeneous scenarios.
Notably, PHCP achieves performance comparable to SOTA methods trained on the
entire dataset while using only a small amount of unlabeled data.

Conclusion: 预训练数据的领域相关性比规模更重要，领域相关的小数据集结合手术特定数据能显著提升少样本SSA性能，而领域不匹配的大规模数据反而可能导致性能下降。

Abstract: Automated surgical skill assessment (SSA) is a central task in surgical
computer vision. Developing robust SSA models is challenging due to the
scarcity of skill annotations, which are time-consuming to produce and require
expert consensus. Few-shot learning (FSL) offers a scalable alternative
enabling model development with minimal supervision, though its success
critically depends on effective pre-training. While widely studied for several
surgical downstream tasks, pre-training has remained largely unexplored in SSA.
In this work, we formulate SSA as a few-shot task and investigate how
self-supervised pre-training strategies affect downstream few-shot SSA
performance. We annotate a publicly available robotic surgery dataset with
Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill (OSATS) scores, and evaluate
various pre-training sources across three few-shot settings. We quantify domain
similarity and analyze how domain gap and the inclusion of procedure-specific
data into pre-training influence transferability. Our results show that small
but domain-relevant datasets can outperform large scale, less aligned ones,
achieving accuracies of 60.16%, 66.03%, and 73.65% in the 1-, 2-, and 5-shot
settings, respectively. Moreover, incorporating procedure-specific data into
pre-training with a domain-relevant external dataset significantly boosts
downstream performance, with an average gain of +1.22% in accuracy and +2.28%
in F1-score; however, applying the same strategy with less similar but
large-scale sources can instead lead to performance degradation. Code and

Abstract: We explore the connection between Plug-and-Play (PnP) methods and Denoising
Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for solving ill-posed inverse problems, with a
focus on single-pixel imaging. We begin by identifying key distinctions between
PnP and diffusion models-particularly in their denoising mechanisms and
sampling procedures. By decoupling the diffusion process into three
interpretable stages: denoising, data consistency enforcement, and sampling, we
provide a unified framework that integrates learned priors with physical
forward models in a principled manner. Building upon this insight, we propose a
hybrid data-consistency module that linearly combines multiple PnP-style
fidelity terms. This hybrid correction is applied directly to the denoised
estimate, improving measurement consistency without disrupting the diffusion
sampling trajectory. Experimental results on single-pixel imaging tasks
demonstrate that our method achieves better reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Deepfakes, synthetic media created using advanced AI techniques, have
intensified the spread of misinformation, particularly in politically sensitive
contexts. Existing deepfake detection datasets are often limited, relying on
outdated generation methods, low realism, or single-face imagery, restricting
the effectiveness for general synthetic image detection. By analyzing social
media posts, we identify multiple modalities through which deepfakes propagate
misinformation. Furthermore, our human perception study demonstrates that
recently developed proprietary models produce synthetic images increasingly
indistinguishable from real ones, complicating accurate identification by the
general public. Consequently, we present a comprehensive, politically-focused
dataset specifically crafted for benchmarking detection against modern

Conclusion: Talk2Event为推进多模态和时间感知感知提供了基础，在机器人、人机交互等领域具有应用前景。

Abstract: Event cameras capture changes in brightness with microsecond precision and
remain reliable under motion blur and challenging illumination, offering clear
advantages for modeling highly dynamic scenes. Yet, their integration with
natural language understanding has received little attention, leaving a gap in
multimodal perception. To address this, we introduce Talk2Event, the first
large-scale benchmark for language-driven object grounding using event data.
Built on real-world driving scenarios, Talk2Event comprises 5,567 scenes,
13,458 annotated objects, and more than 30,000 carefully validated referring
expressions. Each expression is enriched with four structured attributes --
appearance, status, relation to the viewer, and relation to surrounding objects
-- that explicitly capture spatial, temporal, and relational cues. This
attribute-centric design supports interpretable and compositional grounding,
enabling analysis that moves beyond simple object recognition to contextual
reasoning in dynamic environments. We envision Talk2Event as a foundation for
advancing multimodal and temporally-aware perception, with applications
spanning robotics, human-AI interaction, and so on.

Abstract: We introduce Neural Riemannian Motion Fields (NRMF), a novel 3D generative
human motion prior that enables robust, temporally consistent, and physically
plausible 3D motion recovery. Unlike existing VAE or diffusion-based methods,
our higher-order motion prior explicitly models the human motion in the zero
level set of a collection of neural distance fields (NDFs) corresponding to
pose, transition (velocity), and acceleration dynamics. Our framework is
rigorous in the sense that our NDFs are constructed on the product space of
joint rotations, their angular velocities, and angular accelerations,
respecting the geometry of the underlying articulations. We further introduce:
(i) a novel adaptive-step hybrid algorithm for projecting onto the set of
plausible motions, and (ii) a novel geometric integrator to "roll out"
realistic motion trajectories during test-time-optimization and generation. Our
experiments show significant and consistent gains: trained on the AMASS
dataset, NRMF remarkably generalizes across multiple input modalities and to
diverse tasks ranging from denoising to motion in-betweening and fitting to
partial 2D / 3D observations.

Abstract: As an influential information fusion and low-level vision technique, image
fusion integrates complementary information from source images to yield an
informative fused image. A few attempts have been made in recent years to
jointly realize image fusion and super-resolution. However, in real-world
applications such as military reconnaissance and long-range detection missions,
the target and background structures in multimodal images are easily corrupted,
with low resolution and weak semantic information, which leads to suboptimal
results in current fusion techniques. In response, we propose FS-Diff, a
semantic guidance and clarity-aware joint image fusion and super-resolution
method. FS-Diff unifies image fusion and super-resolution as a conditional
generation problem. It leverages semantic guidance from the proposed clarity
sensing mechanism for adaptive low-resolution perception and cross-modal
feature extraction. Specifically, we initialize the desired fused result as
pure Gaussian noise and introduce the bidirectional feature Mamba to extract
the global features of the multimodal images. Moreover, utilizing the source
images and semantics as conditions, we implement a random iterative denoising
process via a modified U-Net network. This network istrained for denoising at
multiple noise levels to produce high-resolution fusion results with
cross-modal features and abundant semantic information. We also construct a
powerful aerial view multiscene (AVMS) benchmark covering 600 pairs of images.
Extensive joint image fusion and super-resolution experiments on six public and
our AVMS datasets demonstrated that FS-Diff outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods at multiple magnifications and can recover richer details and semantics
in the fused images. The code is available at

Abstract: Significant progress has been made in spatial intelligence, spanning both

Abstract: In free-hand ultrasound imaging, sonographers rely on expertise to mentally
integrate partial 2D views into 3D anatomical shapes. Shape reconstruction can
assist clinicians in this process. Central to this task is the choice of shape
representation, as it determines how accurately and efficiently the structure
can be visualized, analyzed, and interpreted. Implicit representations, such as
SDF and occupancy function, offer a powerful alternative to traditional voxel-
or mesh-based methods by modeling continuous, smooth surfaces with compact
storage, avoiding explicit discretization. Recent studies demonstrate that SDF
can be effectively optimized using annotations derived from segmented B-mode
ultrasound images. Yet, these approaches hinge on precise annotations,
overlooking the rich acoustic information embedded in B-mode intensity.
Moreover, implicit representation approaches struggle with the ultrasound's
view-dependent nature and acoustic shadowing artifacts, which impair
reconstruction. To address the problems resulting from occlusions and
annotation dependency, we propose an occupancy-based representation and
introduce \gls{UltrON} that leverages acoustic features to improve geometric
consistency in weakly-supervised optimization regime. We show that these
features can be obtained from B-mode images without additional annotation cost.
Moreover, we propose a novel loss function that compensates for view-dependency
in the B-mode images and facilitates occupancy optimization from multiview
ultrasound. By incorporating acoustic properties, \gls{UltrON} generalizes to
shapes of the same anatomy. We show that \gls{UltrON} mitigates the limitations
of occlusions and sparse labeling and paves the way for more accurate 3D
reconstruction. Code and dataset will be available at

segmenting entire plant individuals with each consisting of multiple

additional training. Evaluations on datasets with multiple plant species,

Abstract: This paper presents Objectness SIMilarity (OSIM), a novel evaluation metric

of human visual perception. Existing metrics assess overall image quality,
leading to discrepancies with human perception. Inspired by neuropsychological
insights, we hypothesize that human recognition of 3D scenes fundamentally
involves attention to individual objects. OSIM enables object-centric
evaluations by leveraging an object detection model and its feature
representations to quantify the "objectness" of each object in the scene. Our
user study demonstrates that OSIM aligns more closely with human perception
compared to existing metrics. We also analyze the characteristics of OSIM using
various approaches. Moreover, we re-evaluate recent 3D reconstruction and

Abstract: Pathologists routinely alternate between different magnifications when
examining Whole-Slide Images, allowing them to evaluate both broad tissue
morphology and intricate cellular details to form comprehensive diagnoses.
However, existing deep learning-based cell detection models struggle to
replicate these behaviors and learn the interdependent semantics between
structures at different magnifications. A key barrier in the field is the lack
of datasets with multi-scale overlapping cell and tissue annotations. The
OCELOT 2023 challenge was initiated to gather insights from the community to
validate the hypothesis that understanding cell and tissue (cell-tissue)
interactions is crucial for achieving human-level performance, and to
accelerate the research in this field. The challenge dataset includes
overlapping cell detection and tissue segmentation annotations from six organs,
comprising 673 pairs sourced from 306 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
Whole-Slide Images with hematoxylin and eosin staining, divided into training,
validation, and test subsets. Participants presented models that significantly
enhanced the understanding of cell-tissue relationships. Top entries achieved
up to a 7.99 increase in F1-score on the test set compared to the baseline
cell-only model that did not incorporate cell-tissue relationships. This is a
substantial improvement in performance over traditional cell-only detection
methods, demonstrating the need for incorporating multi-scale semantics into
the models. This paper provides a comparative analysis of the methods used by
participants, highlighting innovative strategies implemented in the OCELOT 2023

Abstract: Low-light Object detection is crucial for many real-world applications but
remains challenging due to degraded image quality. While recent studies have
shown that RAW images offer superior potential over RGB images, existing
approaches either use RAW-RGB images with information loss or employ complex
frameworks. To address these, we propose a lightweight and self-adaptive Image
Signal Processing (ISP) plugin, Dark-ISP, which directly processes Bayer RAW
images in dark environments, enabling seamless end-to-end training for object
detection. Our key innovations are: (1) We deconstruct conventional ISP
pipelines into sequential linear (sensor calibration) and nonlinear (tone
mapping) sub-modules, recasting them as differentiable components optimized
through task-driven losses. Each module is equipped with content-aware
adaptability and physics-informed priors, enabling automatic RAW-to-RGB
conversion aligned with detection objectives. (2) By exploiting the ISP
pipeline's intrinsic cascade structure, we devise a Self-Boost mechanism that
facilitates cooperation between sub-modules. Through extensive experiments on
three RAW image datasets, we demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art RGB- and RAW-based detection approaches, achieving superior
results with minimal parameters in challenging low-light environments.

Abstract: Accurate human trajectory prediction is crucial for robotics navigation and
autonomous driving. Recent research has demonstrated that incorporating goal
guidance significantly enhances prediction accuracy by reducing uncertainty and
leveraging prior knowledge. Most goal-guided approaches decouple the prediction
task into two stages: goal prediction and subsequent trajectory completion
based on the predicted goal, which operate at extreme granularities:
coarse-grained goal prediction forecasts the overall intention, while
fine-grained trajectory completion needs to generate the positions for all
future timesteps. The potential utility of intermediate temporal granularity
remains largely unexplored, which motivates multi-granularity trajectory
modeling. While prior work has shown that multi-granularity representations
capture diverse scales of human dynamics and motion patterns, effectively
integrating this concept into goal-guided frameworks remains challenging. In
this paper, we propose MGTraj, a novel Multi-Granularity goal-guided model for
human Trajectory prediction. MGTraj recursively encodes trajectory proposals
from coarse to fine granularity levels. At each level, a transformer-based
recursive refinement network (RRN) captures features and predicts progressive
refinements. Features across different granularities are integrated using a
weight-sharing strategy, and velocity prediction is employed as an auxiliary
task to further enhance performance. Comprehensive experimental results in
EHT/UCY and Stanford Drone Dataset indicate that MGTraj outperforms baseline
methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance among goal-guided methods.

Abstract: Background and objective Early diagnosis of gastric diseases is crucial to
prevent fatal outcomes. Although histopathologic examination remains the
diagnostic gold standard, it is performed entirely manually, making evaluations
labor-intensive and prone to variability among pathologists. Critical findings
may be missed, and lack of standard procedures reduces consistency. These

model is built upon the CoAtNet architecture by replacing its MBConv layers
with enhanced ConvNeXtV2 blocks. Additionally, the Convolutional Block
Attention Module (CBAM) is integrated to improve local feature extraction
through channel and spatial attention mechanisms. The architecture was scaled

Conclusion: 通过简单的架构修改和图像增强方案，可以实现对多模态脑MRI的灵活分割，能够处理训练时未见过的模态组合，具有很好的实用价值。

Abstract: Segmentation models are important tools for the detection and analysis of
lesions in brain MRI. Depending on the type of brain pathology that is imaged,
MRI scanners can acquire multiple, different image modalities (contrasts). Most
segmentation models for multimodal brain MRI are restricted to fixed modalities
and cannot effectively process new ones at inference. Some models generalize to
unseen modalities but may lose discriminative modality-specific information.
This work aims to develop a model that can perform inference on data that
contain image modalities unseen during training, previously seen modalities,
and heterogeneous combinations of both, thus allowing a user to utilize any
available imaging modalities. We demonstrate this is possible with a simple,
thus practical alteration to the U-net architecture, by integrating a
modality-agnostic input channel or pathway, alongside modality-specific input
channels. To train this modality-agnostic component, we develop an image
augmentation scheme that synthesizes artificial MRI modalities. Augmentations
differentially alter the appearance of pathological and healthy brain tissue to
create artificial contrasts between them while maintaining realistic anatomical
integrity. We evaluate the method using 8 MRI databases that include 5 types of
pathologies (stroke, tumours, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis and
white matter hyperintensities) and 8 modalities (T1, T1+contrast, T2, PD, SWI,
DWI, ADC and FLAIR). The results demonstrate that the approach preserves the
ability to effectively process MRI modalities encountered during training,
while being able to process new, unseen modalities to improve its segmentation.

Result: 实验结果表明SlotSAR在SAR图像处理中达到最先进性能，相比现有OCL方法更好地保留了结构细节

Conclusion: SlotSAR通过多级特征融合和注意力机制有效解决了SAR图像中目标与背景杂波分离的挑战，无需掩码标注即可获得清晰的目标表示

Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images contain not only targets of interest
but also complex background clutter, including terrain reflections and speckle
noise. In many cases, such clutter exhibits intensity and patterns that
resemble targets, leading models to extract entangled or spurious features.
Such behavior undermines the ability to form clear target representations,
regardless of the classifier. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
object-centric learning (OCL) framework, named SlotSAR, that disentangles
target representations from background clutter in SAR images without mask
annotations. SlotSAR first extracts high-level semantic features from SARATR-X
and low-level scattering features from the wavelet scattering network in order
to obtain complementary multi-level representations for robust target
characterization. We further present a multi-level slot attention module that
integrates these low- and high-level features to enhance slot-wise
representation distinctiveness, enabling effective OCL. Experimental results
demonstrate that SlotSAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in SAR imagery
by preserving structural details compared to existing OCL methods.

Motivation: 现有运动模型通常将人体运动分解为局部关节运动和全局根关节运动，但这两个组件并非独立。全局运动源于与环境交互，而环境交互又由身体配置变化驱动。现有方法难以精确捕捉这种物理耦合关系，而从关节扭矩和外部力推导全局轨迹计算成本高且复杂。

Method: 提出使用全身线性和角动量作为约束来连接局部运动与全局运动。动量反映了关节级动力学对身体空间运动的聚合效应，提供了物理基础的方式来关联局部关节行为与全局位移。在此基础上引入新的损失项，强制生成的动量分布与真实数据中观察到的动量分布保持一致。

Result: 实验表明，加入该损失函数可以减少脚部滑动和抖动，改善平衡性，并保持恢复运动的准确性。

Conclusion: 通过动量约束可以有效解决局部运动与全局运动之间的耦合问题，提供了一种物理上合理且计算高效的运动建模方法。

Abstract: Many studies decompose human motion into local motion in a frame attached to
the root joint and global motion of the root joint in the world frame, treating
them separately. However, these two components are not independent. Global
movement arises from interactions with the environment, which are, in turn,
driven by changes in the body configuration. Motion models often fail to
precisely capture this physical coupling between local and global dynamics,
while deriving global trajectories from joint torques and external forces is
computationally expensive and complex. To address these challenges, we propose
using whole-body linear and angular momentum as a constraint to link local
motion with global movement. Since momentum reflects the aggregate effect of
joint-level dynamics on the body's movement through space, it provides a
physically grounded way to relate local joint behavior to global displacement.
Building on this insight, we introduce a new loss term that enforces
consistency between the generated momentum profiles and those observed in
ground-truth data. Incorporating our loss reduces foot sliding and jitter,
improves balance, and preserves the accuracy of the recovered motion. Code and
data are available at the project page https://hlinhn.github.io/momentum_bmvc.

Abstract: Purpose: To introduce novel dynamic structural parameters and evaluate their
integration within a multimodal deep learning (DL) framework for predicting
postoperative visual recovery in idiopathic full-thickness macular hole (iFTMH)
patients. Methods: We utilized a publicly available longitudinal OCT dataset at
five stages (preoperative, 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months). A stage
specific segmentation model delineated related structures, and an automated
pipeline extracted quantitative, composite, qualitative, and dynamic features.
Binary logistic regression models, constructed with and without dynamic
parameters, assessed their incremental predictive value for best-corrected
visual acuity (BCVA). A multimodal DL model combining clinical variables,
OCT-derived features, and raw OCT images was developed and benchmarked against
regression models. Results: The segmentation model achieved high accuracy
across all timepoints (mean Dice > 0.89). Univariate and multivariate analyses
identified base diameter, ellipsoid zone integrity, and macular hole area as
significant BCVA predictors (P < 0.05). Incorporating dynamic recovery rates
consistently improved logistic regression AUC, especially at the 3-month
follow-up. The multimodal DL model outperformed logistic regression, yielding
higher AUCs and overall accuracy at each stage. The difference is as high as
0.12, demonstrating the complementary value of raw image volume and dynamic
parameters. Conclusions: Integrating dynamic parameters into the multimodal DL
model significantly enhances the accuracy of predictions. This fully automated
process therefore represents a promising clinical decision support tool for
personalized postoperative management in macular hole surgery.

Conclusion: LUT-ILF++框架成功解决了神经网络环路滤波的高复杂度问题，为下一代视频编码标准提供了实用的神经网络滤波解决方案

Abstract: In-loop filtering (ILF) is a key technology in video coding standards to
reduce artifacts and enhance visual quality. Recently, neural network-based ILF
schemes have achieved remarkable coding gains, emerging as a powerful candidate
for next-generation video coding standards. However, the use of deep neural
networks (DNN) brings significant computational and time complexity or high
demands for dedicated hardware, making it challenging for general use. To
address this limitation, we study a practical ILF solution by adopting look-up
tables (LUTs). After training a DNN with a restricted reference range for ILF,
all possible inputs are traversed, and the output values of the DNN are cached
into LUTs. During the coding process, the filtering process is performed by
simply retrieving the filtered pixel through locating the input pixels and
interpolating between the cached values, instead of relying on heavy inference
computations. In this paper, we propose a universal LUT-based ILF framework,
termed LUT-ILF++. First, we introduce the cooperation of multiple kinds of
filtering LUTs and propose a series of customized indexing mechanisms to enable
better filtering reference perception with limited storage consumption. Second,
we propose the cross-component indexing mechanism to enable the filtering of
different color components jointly. Third, in order to make our solution
practical for coding uses, we propose the LUT compaction scheme to enable the
LUT pruning, achieving a lower storage cost of the entire solution. The
proposed framework is implemented in the VVC reference software. Experimental
results show that the proposed framework achieves on average 0.82%/2.97%/1.63%
and 0.85%/4.11%/2.06% bitrate reduction for common test sequences, under the AI
and RA configurations, respectively. Compared to DNN-based solutions, our
proposed solution has much lower time complexity and storage cost.

Abstract: Hand-object motion-capture (MoCap) repositories offer large-scale,
contact-rich demonstrations and hold promise for scaling dexterous robotic
manipulation. Yet demonstration inaccuracies and embodiment gaps between human
and robot hands limit the straightforward use of these data. Existing methods
adopt a three-stage workflow, including retargeting, tracking, and residual
correction, which often leaves demonstrations underused and compound errors
across stages. We introduce Dexplore, a unified single-loop optimization that
jointly performs retargeting and tracking to learn robot control policies
directly from MoCap at scale. Rather than treating demonstrations as ground
truth, we use them as soft guidance. From raw trajectories, we derive adaptive
spatial scopes, and train with reinforcement learning to keep the policy
in-scope while minimizing control effort and accomplishing the task. This
unified formulation preserves demonstration intent, enables robot-specific
strategies to emerge, improves robustness to noise, and scales to large
demonstration corpora. We distill the scaled tracking policy into a
vision-based, skill-conditioned generative controller that encodes diverse
manipulation skills in a rich latent representation, supporting generalization
across objects and real-world deployment. Taken together, these contributions
position Dexplore as a principled bridge that transforms imperfect
demonstrations into effective training signals for dexterous manipulation.

Abstract: Understanding region-wise correspondence between manga line art images is a
fundamental task in manga processing, enabling downstream applications such as
automatic line art colorization and in-between frame generation. However, this
task remains largely unexplored, especially in realistic scenarios without
pre-existing segmentation or annotations. In this paper, we introduce a novel
and practical task: predicting region-wise correspondence between raw manga
line art images without any pre-existing labels or masks. To tackle this
problem, we divide each line art image into a set of patches and propose a
Transformer-based framework that learns patch-level similarities within and
across images. We then apply edge-aware clustering and a region matching
algorithm to convert patch-level predictions into coherent region-level
correspondences. To support training and evaluation, we develop an automatic
annotation pipeline and manually refine a subset of the data to construct
benchmark datasets. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our
method achieves high patch-level accuracy (e.g., 96.34%) and generates
consistent region-level correspondences, highlighting its potential for
real-world manga applications.

Motivation: 传统3D超声系统成本高且复杂，限制了广泛应用。无传感器3D超声使用深度学习从2D图像序列估计3D探头轨迹，但现有方法要么忽略全局特征，要么与局部特征提取紧密耦合，无法鲁棒地建模这两个互补方面。

Method: 提出DualTrack双编码器架构：局部编码器使用密集时空卷积捕获细粒度特征；全局编码器使用图像骨干网络（如2D CNN或基础模型）和时间注意力层嵌入高级解剖特征和长程依赖；轻量级融合模块结合这些特征来估计轨迹。

Conclusion: 解耦的局部和全局特征提取方法能够有效处理3D超声重建问题，DualTrack架构在准确性和一致性方面表现出色。

Abstract: Three-dimensional ultrasound (US) offers many clinical advantages over
conventional 2D imaging, yet its widespread adoption is limited by the cost and
complexity of traditional 3D systems. Sensorless 3D US, which uses deep
learning to estimate a 3D probe trajectory from a sequence of 2D US images, is
a promising alternative. Local features, such as speckle patterns, can help
predict frame-to-frame motion, while global features, such as coarse shapes and
anatomical structures, can situate the scan relative to anatomy and help
predict its general shape. In prior approaches, global features are either
ignored or tightly coupled with local feature extraction, restricting the
ability to robustly model these two complementary aspects. We propose
DualTrack, a novel dual-encoder architecture that leverages decoupled local and
global encoders specialized for their respective scales of feature extraction.
The local encoder uses dense spatiotemporal convolutions to capture
fine-grained features, while the global encoder utilizes an image backbone
(e.g., a 2D CNN or foundation model) and temporal attention layers to embed
high-level anatomical features and long-range dependencies. A lightweight
fusion module then combines these features to estimate the trajectory.
Experimental results on a large public benchmark show that DualTrack achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy and globally consistent 3D reconstructions,
outperforming previous methods and yielding an average reconstruction error
below 5 mm.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer frequently metastasizes to the liver, significantly
reducing long-term survival. While surgical resection is the only potentially
curative treatment for colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM), patient outcomes
vary widely depending on tumor characteristics along with clinical and genomic
factors. Current prognostic models, often based on limited clinical or
molecular features, lack sufficient predictive power, especially in multifocal
CRLM cases. We present a fully automated framework for surgical outcome
prediction from pre- and post-contrast MRI acquired before surgery. Our
framework consists of a segmentation pipeline and a radiomics pipeline. The
segmentation pipeline learns to segment the liver, tumors, and spleen from
partially annotated data by leveraging promptable foundation models to complete
missing labels. Also, we propose SAMONAI, a novel zero-shot 3D prompt
propagation algorithm that leverages the Segment Anything Model to segment 3D
regions of interest from a single point prompt, significantly improving our
segmentation pipeline's accuracy and efficiency. The predicted pre- and
post-contrast segmentations are then fed into our radiomics pipeline, which
extracts features from each tumor and predicts survival using SurvAMINN, a
novel autoencoder-based multiple instance neural network for survival analysis.
SurvAMINN jointly learns dimensionality reduction and hazard prediction from
right-censored survival data, focusing on the most aggressive tumors. Extensive
evaluation on an institutional dataset comprising 227 patients demonstrates
that our framework surpasses existing clinical and genomic biomarkers,
delivering a C-index improvement exceeding 10%. Our results demonstrate the
potential of integrating automated segmentation algorithms and radiomics-based
survival analysis to deliver accurate, annotation-efficient, and interpretable
outcome prediction in CRLM.

Abstract: The use of unmanned aerial systems (UASs) has increased tremendously in the
current decade. They have significantly advanced remote sensing with the
capability to deploy and image the terrain as per required spatial, spectral,
temporal, and radiometric resolutions for various remote sensing applications.
One of the major advantages of UAS imagery is that images can be acquired in
cloudy conditions by flying the UAS under the clouds. The limitation to the
technology is that the imagery is often sullied by cloud shadows. Images taken
over water are additionally affected by sun glint. These are two pose serious
issues for estimating water quality parameters from the UAS images. This study
proposes a novel machine learning approach first to identify and extract
regions with cloud shadows and sun glint and separate such regions from
non-obstructed clear sky regions and sun-glint unaffected regions. The data was
extracted from the images at pixel level to train an U-Net based deep learning
model and best settings for model training was identified based on the various
evaluation metrics from test cases. Using this evaluation, a high-quality image
correction model was determined, which was used to recover the cloud shadow and
sun glint areas in the images.

Abstract: This paper presents iMatcher, a fully differentiable framework for feature
matching in point cloud registration. The proposed method leverages learned
features to predict a geometrically consistent confidence matrix, incorporating
both local and global consistency. First, a local graph embedding module leads
to an initialization of the score matrix. A subsequent repositioning step
refines this matrix by considering bilateral source-to-target and
target-to-source matching via nearest neighbor search in 3D space. The paired
point features are then stacked together to be refined through global geometric
consistency learning to predict a point-wise matching probability. Extensive
experiments on real-world outdoor (KITTI, KITTI-360) and indoor (3DMatch)
datasets, as well as on 6-DoF pose estimation (TUD-L) and partial-to-partial

Abstract: 3D brain MRI studies often examine subtle morphometric differences between
cohorts that are hard to detect visually. Given the high cost of MRI
acquisition, these studies could greatly benefit from image syntheses,
particularly counterfactual image generation, as seen in other domains, such as
computer vision. However, counterfactual models struggle to produce
anatomically plausible MRIs due to the lack of explicit inductive biases to
preserve fine-grained anatomical details. This shortcoming arises from the
training of the models aiming to optimize for the overall appearance of the
images (e.g., via cross-entropy) rather than preserving subtle, yet medically
relevant, local variations across subjects. To preserve subtle variations, we
propose to explicitly integrate anatomical constraints on a voxel-level as
prior into a generative diffusion framework. Called Probabilistic Causal Graph
Model (PCGM), the approach captures anatomical constraints via a probabilistic
graph module and translates those constraints into spatial binary masks of
regions where subtle variations occur. The masks (encoded by a 3D extension of
ControlNet) constrain a novel counterfactual denoising UNet, whose encodings
are then transferred into high-quality brain MRIs via our 3D diffusion decoder.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that PCGM generates
structural brain MRIs of higher quality than several baseline approaches.
Furthermore, we show for the first time that brain measurements extracted from
counterfactuals (generated by PCGM) replicate the subtle effects of a disease
on cortical brain regions previously reported in the neuroscience literature.
This achievement is an important milestone in the use of synthetic MRIs in
studies investigating subtle morphological differences.

Abstract: Current multispectral object detection methods often retain extraneous
background or noise during feature fusion, limiting perceptual performance.To
address this, we propose an innovative feature fusion framework based on
cross-modal feature contrastive and screening strategy, diverging from
conventional approaches. The proposed method adaptively enhances salient
structures by fusing object-aware complementary cross-modal features while
suppressing shared background interference.Our solution centers on two novel,
specially designed modules: the Mutual Feature Refinement Module (MFRM) and the
Differential Feature Feedback Module (DFFM). The MFRM enhances intra- and
inter-modal feature representations by modeling their relationships, thereby
improving cross-modal alignment and discriminative power.Inspired by feedback
differential amplifiers, the DFFM dynamically computes inter-modal differential
features as guidance signals and feeds them back to the MFRM, enabling adaptive
fusion of complementary information while suppressing common-mode noise across
modalities. To enable robust feature learning, the MFRM and DFFM are integrated
into a unified framework, which is formally formulated as an Iterative
Relation-Map Differential Guided Feature Fusion mechanism, termed IRDFusion.
IRDFusion enables high-quality cross-modal fusion by progressively amplifying
salient relational signals through iterative feedback, while suppressing
feature noise, leading to significant performance gains.In extensive
experiments on FLIR, LLVIP and M$^3$FD datasets, IRDFusion achieves
state-of-the-art performance and consistently outperforms existing methods
across diverse challenging scenarios, demonstrating its robustness and
effectiveness. Code will be available at

Abstract: LiDAR-based global localization is an essential component of simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM), which helps loop closure and re-localization.
Current approaches rely on ground-truth poses obtained from GPS or SLAM
odometry to supervise network training. Despite the great success of these
supervised approaches, substantial cost and effort are required for
high-precision ground-truth pose acquisition. In this work, we propose
S-BEVLoc, a novel self-supervised framework based on bird's-eye view (BEV) for
LiDAR global localization, which eliminates the need for ground-truth poses and
is highly scalable. We construct training triplets from single BEV images by
leveraging the known geographic distances between keypoint-centered BEV
patches. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to extract local features,
and NetVLAD is employed to aggregate global descriptors. Moreover, we introduce
SoftCos loss to enhance learning from the generated triplets. Experimental

Abstract: Hyperspectral remote sensing technology has significant application value in
fields such as forestry ecology and precision agriculture, while also putting
forward higher requirements for fine ground object classification. However,
although hyperspectral images are rich in spectral information and can improve
recognition accuracy, they tend to cause prominent feature redundancy due to
their numerous bands, high dimensionality, and spectral mixing characteristics.
To address this, this study used hyperspectral images from the ZY1F satellite
as a data source and selected Yugan County, Shangrao City, Jiangxi Province as
the research area to perform ground object classification research. A
classification framework named CWSSNet was proposed, which integrates 3D
spectral-spatial features and wavelet convolution. This framework integrates
multimodal information us-ing a multiscale convolutional attention module and
breaks through the classification performance bottleneck of traditional methods
by introducing multi-band decomposition and convolution operations in the
wavelet domain. The experiments showed that CWSSNet achieved 74.50\%, 82.73\%,
and 84.94\% in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), mean Accuracy (mAcc), and
mean F1-score (mF1) respectively in Yugan County. It also obtained the highest
Intersection over Union (IoU) in the classifica-tion of water bodies,
vegetation, and bare land, demonstrating good robustness. Additionally, when
the training set proportion was 70\%, the increase in training time was
limited, and the classification effect was close to the optimal level,
indicating that the model maintains reliable performance under small-sample
training conditions.

Abstract: This paper aims to recover the intrinsic reflectance layer and shading layer
given a single image. Though this intrinsic image decomposition problem has
been studied for decades, it remains a significant challenge in cases of
complex scenes, i.e. spatially-varying lighting effect and rich textures. In
this paper, we propose a novel method for handling severe lighting and rich
textures in intrinsic image decomposition, which enables to produce
high-quality intrinsic images for real-world images. Specifically, we observe
that previous learning-based methods tend to produce texture-less and
over-smoothing intrinsic images, which can be used to infer the lighting and
texture information given a RGB image. In this way, we design a texture-guided
regularization term and formulate the decomposition problem into an
optimization framework, to separate the material textures and lighting effect.
We demonstrate that combining the novel texture-aware prior can produce
superior results to existing approaches.

Abstract: Intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation poses severe threats to cerebral
function, thus necessitating monitoring for timely intervention. While lumbar
puncture is the gold standard for ICP measurement, its invasiveness and
associated risks drive the need for non-invasive alternatives. Optic nerve
sheath diameter (ONSD) has emerged as a promising biomarker, as elevated ICP
directly correlates with increased ONSD. However, current clinical practices
for ONSD measurement suffer from inconsistency in manual operation,
subjectivity in optimal view selection, and variability in thresholding,
limiting their reliability. To address these challenges, we introduce a fully
automatic two-stage framework for ICP grading, integrating keyframe
identification, ONSD measurement and clinical data. Specifically, the fundus
ultrasound video processing stage performs frame-level anatomical segmentation,
rule-based keyframe identification guided by an international consensus
statement, and precise ONSD measurement. The intracranial pressure grading
stage then fuses ONSD metrics with clinical features to enable the prediction
of ICP grades, thereby demonstrating an innovative blend of interpretable
ultrasound analysis and multi-source data integration for objective clinical
evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a
validation accuracy of $0.845 \pm 0.071$ (with standard deviation from
five-fold cross-validation) and an independent test accuracy of 0.786,
significantly outperforming conventional threshold-based method ($0.637 \pm
0.111$ validation accuracy, $0.429$ test accuracy). Through effectively
reducing operator variability and integrating multi-source information, our
framework establishes a reliable non-invasive approach for clinical ICP
evaluation, holding promise for improving patient management in acute
neurological conditions.

Motivation: 现代集成电路制造中存在各种细粒度缺陷，传统方法需要外部正常图像参考且对布局变化和配准精度敏感，而缺陷通常是局部的，图像本身包含丰富的正常模式

Method: 使用可学习的正常信息提取器从测试图像中聚合代表性正常特征，通过一致性损失确保这些特征与正常区域关联，解码器重建正常内容，重建残差用于缺陷分割，并采用伪异常增强稳定训练

Result: 在三个IC工艺阶段的数据集上实验显示，相比现有方法有持续改进，对产品变异性具有强鲁棒性

Conclusion: 该方法无需外部正常支持，能够有效处理IC图像中的布局变化和配准困难问题，在多个工艺阶段都表现出优越性能

Abstract: Modern Integrated-Circuit(IC) manufacturing introduces diverse, fine-grained
defects that depress yield and reliability. Most industrial defect segmentation
compares a test image against an external normal set, a strategy that is
brittle for IC imagery where layouts vary across products and accurate
alignment is difficult. We observe that defects are predominantly local, while
each image still contains rich, repeatable normal patterns. We therefore
propose an unsupervised IC defect segmentation framework that requires no
external normal support. A learnable normal-information extractor aggregates
representative normal features from the test image, and a coherence loss
enforces their association with normal regions. Guided by these features, a
decoder reconstructs only normal content; the reconstruction residual then
segments defects. Pseudo-anomaly augmentation further stabilizes training.
Experiments on datasets from three IC process stages show consistent
improvements over existing approaches and strong robustness to product
variability.

Abstract: Gliomas are the most prevalent type of primary brain tumors, and their
accurate segmentation from MRI is critical for diagnosis, treatment planning,
and longitudinal monitoring. However, the scarcity of high-quality annotated
imaging data in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) poses a significant challenge for
deploying advanced segmentation models in clinical workflows. This study
introduces a robust and computationally efficient deep learning framework
tailored for resource-constrained settings. We leveraged a 3D Attention UNet
architecture augmented with residual blocks and enhanced through transfer
learning from pre-trained weights on the BraTS 2021 dataset. Our model was
evaluated on 95 MRI cases from the BraTS-Africa dataset, a benchmark for glioma
segmentation in SSA MRI data. Despite the limited data quality and quantity,
our approach achieved Dice scores of 0.76 for the Enhancing Tumor (ET), 0.80
for Necrotic and Non-Enhancing Tumor Core (NETC), and 0.85 for Surrounding
Non-Functional Hemisphere (SNFH). These results demonstrate the
generalizability of the proposed model and its potential to support clinical
decision making in low-resource settings. The compact architecture,
approximately 90 MB, and sub-minute per-volume inference time on consumer-grade
hardware further underscore its practicality for deployment in SSA health
systems. This work contributes toward closing the gap in equitable AI for
global health by empowering underserved regions with high-performing and

Abstract: In recent years, Multi-View Clustering (MVC) has been significantly advanced
under the influence of deep learning. By integrating heterogeneous data from
multiple views, MVC enhances clustering analysis, making multi-view fusion
critical to clustering performance. However, there is a problem of low-quality
data in multi-view fusion. This problem primarily arises from two reasons: 1)
Certain views are contaminated by noisy data. 2) Some views suffer from missing
data. This paper proposes a novel Stochastic Generative Diffusion Fusion (SGDF)
method to address this problem. SGDF leverages a multiple generative mechanism
for the multi-view feature of each sample. It is robust to low-quality data.
Building on SGDF, we further present the Generative Diffusion Contrastive
Network (GDCN). Extensive experiments show that GDCN achieves the
state-of-the-art results in deep MVC tasks. The source code is publicly

Motivation: 解决移动CBCT系统和边缘设备部署深度学习散射校正方法时面临的大内存占用问题，通过在多个分辨率下优化网络实现效率提升。

Method: 首先分析六种分辨率下CBCT散射信号的重建误差，比较四种插值方法；然后在五种图像分辨率上训练SOTA方法，评估FLOPs、推理时间和GPU内存的减少。

Result: 实现了78倍的FLOPs减少，MAPE从4.42%降至3.85%，MSE从2.01×10⁻²降至1.34×10⁻²，推理时间和GPU内存分别减少16倍和12倍。

Conclusion: 研究强调了降采样在深度学习散射估计中的重要作用，大幅降低的计算需求使得在资源受限环境中进行散射校正成为可能。

Abstract: Purpose: Scatter artifacts drastically degrade the image quality of cone-beam
computed tomography (CBCT) scans. Although deep learning-based methods show
promise in estimating scatter from CBCT measurements, their deployment in
mobile CBCT systems or edge devices is still limited due to the large memory
footprint of the networks. This study addresses the issue by applying networks
at varying resolutions and suggesting an optimal one, based on speed and
accuracy.
  Methods: First, the reconstruction error in down-up sampling of CBCT scatter
signal was examined at six resolutions by comparing four interpolation methods.
Next, a recent state-of-the-art method was trained across five image
resolutions and evaluated for the reductions in floating-point operations
(FLOPs), inference times, and GPU memory requirements.
  Results: Reducing the input size and network parameters achieved a 78-fold
reduction in FLOPs compared to the baseline method, while maintaining comarable
performance in terms of mean-absolute-percentage-error (MAPE) and
mean-square-error (MSE). Specifically, the MAPE decreased to 3.85% compared to
4.42%, and the MSE decreased to 1.34 \times 10^{-2} compared to 2.01 \times
10^{-2}. Inference time and GPU memory usage were reduced by factors of 16 and
12, respectively. Further experiments comparing scatter-corrected
reconstructions on a large, simulated dataset and real CBCT scans from water
and Sedentex CT phantoms clearly demonstrated the robustness of our method.
  Conclusion: This study highlights the underappreciated role of downsampling
in deep learning-based scatter estimation. The substantial reduction in FLOPs
and GPU memory requirements achieved by our method enables scatter correction
in resource-constrained environments, such as mobile CBCT and edge devices.

Conclusion: CameraVDP框架能够将相机作为精确的显示器测量仪器，实现显示器的感知质量评估，解决了传统测量方法的局限性。

Abstract: Accurate measurement of images produced by electronic displays is critical
for the evaluation of both traditional and computational displays. Traditional
display measurement methods based on sparse radiometric sampling and fitting a
model are inadequate for capturing spatially varying display artifacts, as they
fail to capture high-frequency and pixel-level distortions. While cameras offer
sufficient spatial resolution, they introduce optical, sampling, and
photometric distortions. Furthermore, the physical measurement must be combined
with a model of a visual system to assess whether the distortions are going to
be visible. To enable perceptual assessment of displays, we propose a
combination of a camera-based reconstruction pipeline with a visual difference
predictor, which account for both the inaccuracy of camera measurements and
visual difference prediction. The reconstruction pipeline combines HDR image
stacking, MTF inversion, vignetting correction, geometric undistortion,
homography transformation, and color correction, enabling cameras to function
as precise display measurement instruments. By incorporating a Visual
Difference Predictor (VDP), our system models the visibility of various stimuli
under different viewing conditions for the human visual system. We validate the
proposed CameraVDP framework through three applications: defective pixel
detection, color fringing awareness, and display non-uniformity evaluation. Our
uncertainty analysis framework enables the estimation of the theoretical upper
bound for defect pixel detection performance and provides confidence intervals
for VDP quality scores.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI模型产生合成数据的比例不断增加，到2030年大部分训练数据可能都是机器生成的。在合成数据上重复训练会导致模型崩溃现象，即模型性能随训练代数增加而退化。现有缓解策略有限，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 提出截断交叉熵(TCE)损失函数，该函数在训练过程中降低对高置信度预测的权重。建立了模型无关的框架，将损失函数设计与模型崩溃缓解联系起来，并通过理论和实证验证。

Result: TCE显著延迟了递归训练中的模型崩溃，将模型崩溃前的保真度区间延长了2.3倍以上。该方法在不同模态上都具有良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 损失函数设计为在合成数据时代保持生成模型质量提供了简单而强大的工具，通过控制模型对自生成数据的过度自信来有效缓解模型崩溃。

Abstract: The increasing reliance on generative AI models has accelerated the
generation rate of synthetic data, with some projections suggesting that most
available new data for training could be machine-generated by 2030. This shift
to a mainly synthetic content presents a critical challenge: repeated training
in synthetic data leads to a phenomenon known as model collapse, where model
performance degrades over generations of training, eventually rendering the
models ineffective. Although prior studies have explored the causes and
detection of model collapse, existing mitigation strategies remain limited.
  In this paper, we identify model overconfidence in their self-generated data
as a key driver of collapse. Building on this observation, we propose a
confidence-aware loss function that downweights high-confidence predictions
during training. We introduce a novel loss function we call Truncated Cross
Entropy (TCE). We demonstrate that TCE significantly delays model collapse in
recursive training.
  We provide a model-agnostic framework that links the loss function design to
model collapse mitigation and validate our approach both theoretically and
empirically, showing that it can extend the model's fidelity interval before
collapse by more than 2.3x. Finally, we show that our method generalizes across
modalities. These findings suggest that the design of loss functions provides a
simple yet powerful tool for preserving the quality of generative models in the
era of increasing synthetic data.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in automating data

To address this, we propose a scalable pipeline that extracts high-quality,

Moreover, constructing task-specific few-shot prompts is often costly and may

Abstract: Does continued scaling of large language models (LLMs) yield diminishing
returns? Real-world value often stems from the length of task an agent can
complete. We start this work by observing the simple but counterintuitive fact
that marginal gains in single-step accuracy can compound into exponential
improvements in the length of a task a model can successfully complete. Then,
we argue that failures of LLMs when simple tasks are made longer arise from
mistakes in execution, rather than an inability to reason. We propose isolating
execution capability, by explicitly providing the knowledge and plan needed to
solve a long-horizon task. We find that larger models can correctly execute
significantly more turns even when small models have 100\% single-turn
accuracy. We observe that the per-step accuracy of models degrades as the
number of steps increases. This is not just due to long-context limitations --
curiously, we observe a self-conditioning effect -- models become more likely
to make mistakes when the context contains their errors from prior turns.
Self-conditioning does not reduce by just scaling the model size. In contrast,
recent thinking models do not self-condition, and can also execute much longer
tasks in a single turn. We conclude by benchmarking frontier thinking models on
the length of task they can execute in a single turn. Overall, by focusing on
the ability to execute, we hope to reconcile debates on how LLMs can solve
complex reasoning problems yet fail at simple tasks when made longer, and
highlight the massive benefits of scaling model size and sequential test-time
compute for long-horizon tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a powerful
paradigm for robotic manipulation. Despite substantial progress enabled by
large-scale pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), these models face two
fundamental challenges: (i) the scarcity and high cost of large-scale
human-operated robotic trajectories required for SFT scaling, and (ii) limited
generalization to tasks involving distribution shift. Recent breakthroughs in
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) can
dramatically enhance step-by-step reasoning capabilities, raising a natural
question: Can RL similarly improve the long-horizon step-by-step action
planning of VLA? In this work, we introduce SimpleVLA-RL, an efficient RL
framework tailored for VLA models. Building upon veRL, we introduce
VLA-specific trajectory sampling, scalable parallelization, multi-environment
rendering, and optimized loss computation. When applied to OpenVLA-OFT,
SimpleVLA-RL achieves SoTA performance on LIBERO and even outperforms $\pi_0$
on RoboTwin 1.0\&2.0 with the exploration-enhancing strategies we introduce.
SimpleVLA-RL not only reduces dependence on large-scale data and enables robust
generalization, but also remarkably surpasses SFT in real-world tasks.
Moreover, we identify a novel phenomenon ``pushcut'' during RL training,
wherein the policy discovers previously unseen patterns beyond those seen in
the previous training process. Github: https://github.com/PRIME-RL/SimpleVLA-RL

Method: 1) 分区方法：客户端TEE部署嵌入层，GPU服务器部署后续层；2) 优化Report-Noisy-Max机制保护敏感输入；3) 减少TEE与GPU间的通信开销。

Result: 在Llama系列模型上的实验表明，CMIF显著降低了TEE中的额外推理开销，同时有效保护了用户数据隐私，模型性能下降轻微。

Conclusion: CMIF框架成功实现了隐私保护与推理效率的平衡，为LLM的机密推理提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: CPU-based trusted execution environments (TEEs) and differential privacy (DP)
have gained wide applications for private inference. Due to high inference
latency in TEEs, researchers use partition-based approaches that offload linear
model components to GPUs. However, dense nonlinear layers of large language
models (LLMs) result in significant communication overhead between TEEs and
GPUs. DP-based approaches apply random noise to protect data privacy, but this
compromises LLM performance and semantic understanding. To overcome the above
drawbacks, this paper proposes CMIF, a Confidential and efficient Model
Inference Framework. CMIF confidentially deploys the embedding layer in the
client-side TEE and subsequent layers on GPU servers. Meanwhile, it optimizes
the Report-Noisy-Max mechanism to protect sensitive inputs with a slight
decrease in model performance. Extensive experiments on Llama-series models
demonstrate that CMIF reduces additional inference overhead in TEEs while
preserving user data privacy.

Conclusion: 该框架为设备端环境中可扩展和隐私保护的LLM部署铺平了道路。

Abstract: As on-device large language model (LLM) systems become increasingly
prevalent, federated fine-tuning enables advanced language understanding and
generation directly on edge devices; however, it also involves processing
sensitive, user-specific data, raising significant privacy concerns within the
federated learning framework. To address these challenges, we propose
DP-FedLoRA, a privacy-enhanced federated fine-tuning framework that integrates
LoRA-based adaptation with differential privacy in a communication-efficient
setting. Each client locally clips and perturbs its LoRA matrices using
Gaussian noise to satisfy ($\epsilon$, $\delta$)-differential privacy. We
further provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating the unbiased nature of the
updates and deriving bounds on the variance introduced by noise, offering
practical guidance for privacy-budget calibration. Experimental results across
mainstream benchmarks show that DP-FedLoRA delivers competitive performance
while offering strong privacy guarantees, paving the way for scalable and
privacy-preserving LLM deployment in on-device environments.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) watermarking embeds detectable signals into
generated text for copyright protection, misuse prevention, and content
detection. While prior studies evaluate robustness using watermark removal
attacks, these methods are often suboptimal, creating the misconception that
effective removal requires large perturbations or powerful adversaries.
  To bridge the gap, we first formalize the system model for LLM watermark, and
characterize two realistic threat models constrained on limited access to the
watermark detector. We then analyze how different types of perturbation vary in
their attack range, i.e., the number of tokens they can affect with a single
edit. We observe that character-level perturbations (e.g., typos, swaps,
deletions, homoglyphs) can influence multiple tokens simultaneously by
disrupting the tokenization process. We demonstrate that character-level
perturbations are significantly more effective for watermark removal under the
most restrictive threat model. We further propose guided removal attacks based
on the Genetic Algorithm (GA) that uses a reference detector for optimization.
Under a practical threat model with limited black-box queries to the watermark
detector, our method demonstrates strong removal performance. Experiments
confirm the superiority of character-level perturbations and the effectiveness
of the GA in removing watermarks under realistic constraints. Additionally, we
argue there is an adversarial dilemma when considering potential defenses: any
fixed defense can be bypassed by a suitable perturbation strategy. Motivated by
this principle, we propose an adaptive compound character-level attack.
Experimental results show that this approach can effectively defeat the
defenses. Our findings highlight significant vulnerabilities in existing LLM
watermark schemes and underline the urgency for the development of new robust
mechanisms.

Abstract: The emergence of long-context language models with context windows extending
to millions of tokens has created new opportunities for sophisticated code
understanding and software development evaluation. We propose LoCoBench, a
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate long-context LLMs in
realistic, complex software development scenarios. Unlike existing code
evaluation benchmarks that focus on single-function completion or short-context
tasks, LoCoBench addresses the critical evaluation gap for long-context
capabilities that require understanding entire codebases, reasoning across
multiple files, and maintaining architectural consistency across large-scale
software systems. Our benchmark provides 8,000 evaluation scenarios
systematically generated across 10 programming languages, with context lengths
spanning 10K to 1M tokens, a 100x variation that enables precise assessment of
long-context performance degradation in realistic software development
settings. LoCoBench introduces 8 task categories that capture essential
long-context capabilities: architectural understanding, cross-file refactoring,
multi-session development, bug investigation, feature implementation, code
comprehension, integration testing, and security analysis. Through a 5-phase
pipeline, we create diverse, high-quality scenarios that challenge LLMs to
reason about complex codebases at unprecedented scale. We introduce a
comprehensive evaluation framework with 17 metrics across 4 dimensions,
including 8 new evaluation metrics, combined in a LoCoBench Score (LCBS). Our

Abstract: The cold-start user issue further compromises the effectiveness of
recommender systems in limiting access to the historical behavioral
information. It is an effective pipeline to optimize instructional prompts on a
few-shot large language model (LLM) used in recommender tasks. We introduce a
context-conditioned prompt formulation method P(u,\ Ds)\ \rightarrow\
R\widehat, where u is a cold-start user profile, Ds is a curated support set,
and R\widehat is the predicted ranked list of items. Based on systematic
experimentation with transformer-based autoregressive LLMs (BioGPT, LLaMA-2,
GPT-4), we provide empirical evidence that optimal exemplar injection and
instruction structuring can significantly improve the precision@k and NDCG
scores of such models in low-data settings. The pipeline uses token-level
alignments and embedding space regularization with a greater semantic fidelity.
Our findings not only show that timely composition is not merely syntactic but
also functional as it is in direct control of attention scales and decoder
conduct through inference. This paper shows that prompt-based adaptation may be
considered one of the ways to address cold-start recommendation issues in
LLM-based pipelines.

Abstract: Coordination tasks traditionally performed by humans are increasingly being
delegated to autonomous agents. As this pattern progresses, it becomes critical
to evaluate not only these agents' performance but also the processes through
which they negotiate in dynamic, multi-agent environments. Furthermore,
different agents exhibit distinct advantages: traditional statistical agents,
such as Bayesian models, may excel under well-specified conditions, whereas
large language models (LLMs) can generalize across contexts. In this work, we
compare humans (N = 216), LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro), and Bayesian agents in
a dynamic negotiation setting that enables direct, identical-condition
comparisons across populations, capturing both outcomes and behavioral
dynamics. Bayesian agents extract the highest surplus through aggressive
optimization, at the cost of frequent trade rejections. Humans and LLMs can
achieve similar overall surplus, but through distinct behaviors: LLMs favor
conservative, concessionary trades with few rejections, while humans employ
more strategic, risk-taking, and fairness-oriented behaviors. Thus, we find
that performance parity -- a common benchmark in agent evaluation -- can
conceal fundamental differences in process and alignment, which are critical
for practical deployment in real-world coordination tasks.

(ii) a dynamic reputation evaluation module for trust assessment in

Abstract: Knowledge graphs, a powerful tool for structuring information through

technical comparative study of three different methodologies for constructing
knowledge graph triplets and integrating them with Large Language Models (LLMs)
for question answering: spaCy, Stanford CoreNLP-OpenIE, and GraphRAG, all
leveraging open source technologies. We evaluate the effectiveness,
feasibility, and adaptability of these methods by analyzing their capabilities,
state of development, and their impact on the performance of LLM-based question
answering. Experimental results indicate that while OpenIE provides the most
comprehensive coverage of triplets, GraphRAG demonstrates superior reasoning
abilities among the three. We conclude with a discussion on the strengths and

Abstract: Navigating and understanding complex and unknown environments autonomously
demands more than just basic perception and movement from embodied agents.
Truly effective exploration requires agents to possess higher-level cognitive
abilities, the ability to reason about their surroundings, and make more
informed decisions regarding exploration strategies. However, traditional RL
approaches struggle to balance efficient exploration and semantic understanding
due to limited cognitive capabilities embedded in the small policies for the
agents, leading often to human drivers when dealing with semantic exploration.
In this paper, we address this challenge by presenting a novel Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) architecture that is specifically designed for
resource efficient semantic exploration. A key methodological contribution is
the integration of a Vision-Language Model (VLM) common-sense through a layered
reward function. The VLM query is modeled as a dedicated action, allowing the
agent to strategically query the VLM only when deemed necessary for gaining
external guidance, thereby conserving resources. This mechanism is combined
with a curriculum learning strategy designed to guide learning at different
levels of complexity to ensure robust and stable learning. Our experimental
evaluation results convincingly demonstrate that our agent achieves
significantly enhanced object discovery rates and develops a learned capability
to effectively navigate towards semantically rich regions. Furthermore, it also
shows a strategic mastery of when to prompt for external environmental
information. By demonstrating a practical and scalable method for embedding
common-sense semantic reasoning with autonomous agents, this research provides
a novel approach to pursuing a fully intelligent and self-guided exploration in
robotics.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into recommender systems has
enabled zero-shot, personality-based personalization through prompt-based
interactions, offering a new paradigm for user-centric recommendations.
However, incorporating user personality traits via the OCEAN model highlights a
critical tension between achieving psychological alignment and ensuring
demographic fairness. To address this, we propose PerFairX, a unified
evaluation framework designed to quantify the trade-offs between
personalization and demographic equity in LLM-generated recommendations. Using
neutral and personality-sensitive prompts across diverse user profiles, we
benchmark two state-of-the-art LLMs, ChatGPT and DeepSeek, on movie (MovieLens
10M) and music (Last.fm 360K) datasets. Our results reveal that
personality-aware prompting significantly improves alignment with individual
traits but can exacerbate fairness disparities across demographic groups.
Specifically, DeepSeek achieves stronger psychological fit but exhibits higher
sensitivity to prompt variations, while ChatGPT delivers stable yet less
personalized outputs. PerFairX provides a principled benchmark to guide the
development of LLM-based recommender systems that are both equitable and
psychologically informed, contributing to the creation of inclusive,
user-centric AI applications in continual learning contexts.

Method: 开发LLM驱动的课程助手系统，在6门计算机科学课程中部署给约2000名学生，收集交互数据进行分析，对200个对话样本进行人工标注，使用布鲁姆分类法分析LLM生成问题的认知层次。

Result: 系统在晚间和夜间使用活跃，入门课程使用率更高；大多数LLM回复正确且有用，但很少包含专门示例；仅约11%的对话包含LLM生成的后续问题，且高级课程学生经常忽略；LLM生成高阶认知问题的能力有限。

Conclusion: LLM教育系统具有填补学习支持空白的潜力，但需要更多教育者参与提示配置和内容管理，当前LLM在支持高阶认知学习和探究式教学方面仍需改进。

Abstract: Providing students with flexible and timely academic support is a challenge
at most colleges and universities, leaving many students without help outside
scheduled hours. Large language models (LLMs) are promising for bridging this
gap, but interactions between students and LLMs are rarely overseen by
educators. We developed and studied an LLM-powered course assistant deployed
across multiple computer science courses to characterize real-world use and
understand pedagogical implications. By Spring 2024, our system had been
deployed to approximately 2,000 students across six courses at three
institutions. Analysis of the interaction data shows that usage remains strong
in the evenings and nights and is higher in introductory courses, indicating
that our system helps address temporal support gaps and novice learner needs.
We sampled 200 conversations per course for manual annotation: most sampled
responses were judged correct and helpful, with a small share unhelpful or
erroneous; few responses included dedicated examples. We also examined an
inquiry-based learning strategy: only around 11% of sampled conversations
contained LLM-generated follow-up questions, which were often ignored by
students in advanced courses. A Bloom's taxonomy analysis reveals that current
LLM capabilities are limited in generating higher-order cognitive questions.
These patterns suggest opportunities for pedagogically oriented LLM-based
educational systems and greater educator involvement in configuring prompts,
content, and policies.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have opened new
opportunities for embodied intelligence, enabling multimodal understanding,
reasoning, and interaction, as well as continuous spatial decision-making.
Nevertheless, current MLLM-based embodied systems face two critical
limitations. First, Geometric Adaptability Gap: models trained solely on 2D
inputs or with hard-coded 3D geometry injection suffer from either insufficient
spatial information or restricted 2D generalization, leading to poor
adaptability across tasks with diverse spatial demands. Second, Embodiment
Constraint Gap: prior work often neglects the physical constraints and
capacities of real robots, resulting in task plans that are theoretically valid
but practically infeasible.To address these gaps, we introduce OmniEVA -- an
embodied versatile planner that enables advanced embodied reasoning and task
planning through two pivotal innovations: (1) a Task-Adaptive 3D Grounding
mechanism, which introduces a gated router to perform explicit selective
regulation of 3D fusion based on contextual requirements, enabling
context-aware 3D grounding for diverse embodied tasks. (2) an Embodiment-Aware
Reasoning framework that jointly incorporates task goals and embodiment
constraints into the reasoning loop, resulting in planning decisions that are
both goal-directed and executable. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that OmniEVA not only achieves state-of-the-art general embodied reasoning
performance, but also exhibits a strong ability across a wide range of
downstream scenarios. Evaluations of a suite of proposed embodied benchmarks,
including both primitive and composite tasks, confirm its robust and versatile
planning capabilities. Project page: https://omnieva.github.io

Motivation: 虽然LLMs能显著提高软件开发效率，但经常会产生错误代码并以高度自信的方式呈现，可能误导开发者接受有缺陷的解决方案。需要一种更可靠的方式将LLMs集成到软件开发周期中。

Method: 采用基于场景的编程（SBP）范式，这是一种事件驱动、基于场景的软件工程方法，允许开发者将专业知识注入LLM，并检查和验证其输出。

Result: 通过Connect4游戏的案例研究，结合LLMs和SBP成功创建了高性能的智能体，能够击败各种现有强智能体，在某些情况下还能形式化验证智能体的正确性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够简化开发过程、减少错误，并提高用户验证关键程序属性的信心，为LLMs在软件开发中的可靠应用提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are fast becoming indispensable tools for
software developers, assisting or even partnering with them in crafting complex
programs. The advantages are evident -- LLMs can significantly reduce
development time, generate well-organized and comprehensible code, and
occasionally suggest innovative ideas that developers might not conceive on
their own. However, despite their strengths, LLMs will often introduce
significant errors and present incorrect code with persuasive confidence,
potentially misleading developers into accepting flawed solutions.
  In order to bring LLMs into the software development cycle in a more reliable
manner, we propose a methodology for combining them with ``traditional''
software engineering techniques in a structured way, with the goal of
streamlining the development process, reducing errors, and enabling users to
verify crucial program properties with increased confidence. Specifically, we
focus on the Scenario-Based Programming (SBP) paradigm -- an event-driven,
scenario-based approach for software engineering -- to allow human developers
to pour their expert knowledge into the LLM, as well as to inspect and verify
its outputs.
  To evaluate our methodology, we conducted a significant case study, and used
it to design and implement the Connect4 game. By combining LLMs and SBP we were
able to create a highly-capable agent, which could defeat various strong
existing agents. Further, in some cases, we were able to formally verify the
correctness of our agent. Finally, our experience reveals interesting insights
regarding the ease-of-use of our proposed approach. The full code of our
case-study will be made publicly available with the final version of this
paper.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前密码协议与大规模语言模型集成存在显著挑战，协议复杂性与LLM巨大参数规模限制了实际可用性，需要解决加密矩阵乘法计算复杂度和同态加密下softmax计算成本过高的问题。

Method: 采用密码协议与LLM架构协同设计原则，使用优化的编码策略将CKKS方案与轻量级LLM变体BitNet集成，首创将sigmoid注意力机制与同态加密结合作为无需重新训练的替代方案，并将Bootstrapping操作嵌入RMSNorm过程中。

Result: 实验评估显示ENSI在矩阵乘法上实现约8倍加速，在CPU上的softmax推理速度提升2.6倍，bootstrapping比例降至仅1%。

Conclusion: ENSI框架通过创新的协同设计方法，有效解决了LLM安全推理中的计算效率瓶颈，为隐私保护的机器学习提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Secure inference enables privacy-preserving machine learning by leveraging
cryptographic protocols that support computations on sensitive user data
without exposing it. However, integrating cryptographic protocols with large
language models (LLMs) presents significant challenges, as the inherent
complexity of these protocols, together with LLMs' massive parameter scale and
sophisticated architectures, severely limits practical usability. In this work,
we propose ENSI, a novel non-interactive secure inference framework for LLMs,
based on the principle of co-designing the cryptographic protocols and LLM
architecture. ENSI employs an optimized encoding strategy that seamlessly
integrates CKKS scheme with a lightweight LLM variant, BitNet, significantly
reducing the computational complexity of encrypted matrix multiplications. In
response to the prohibitive computational demands of softmax under homomorphic
encryption (HE), we pioneer the integration of the sigmoid attention mechanism
with HE as a seamless, retraining-free alternative. Furthermore, by embedding
the Bootstrapping operation within the RMSNorm process, we efficiently refresh
ciphertexts while markedly decreasing the frequency of costly bootstrapping
invocations. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that ENSI achieves
approximately an 8x acceleration in matrix multiplications and a 2.6x speedup
in softmax inference on CPU compared to state-of-the-art method, with the
proportion of bootstrapping is reduced to just 1%.

Abstract: Natural language descriptions of optimization or satisfaction problems are
challenging to translate into correct MiniZinc models, as this process demands
both logical reasoning and constraint programming expertise. We introduce a
framework that addresses this challenge with an agentic approach: multiple
specialized large language model (LLM) agents decompose the modeling task by
global constraint type. Each agent is dedicated to detecting and generating
code for a specific class of global constraint, while a final assembler agent
integrates these constraint snippets into a complete MiniZinc model. By
dividing the problem into smaller, well-defined sub-tasks, each LLM handles a
simpler reasoning challenge, potentially reducing overall complexity. We
conduct initial experiments with several LLMs and show better performance
against baselines such as one-shot prompting and chain-of-thought prompting.
Finally, we outline a comprehensive roadmap for future work, highlighting
potential enhancements and directions for improvement.

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic AI have led to systems capable of autonomous task
execution and language-based reasoning, yet their spatial reasoning abilities
remain limited and underexplored, largely constrained to symbolic and
sequential processing. In contrast, human spatial intelligence, rooted in
integrated multisensory perception, spatial memory, and cognitive maps, enables
flexible, context-aware decision-making in unstructured environments.
Therefore, bridging this gap is critical for advancing Agentic Spatial
Intelligence toward better interaction with the physical 3D world. To this end,
we first start from scrutinizing the spatial neural models as studied in
computational neuroscience, and accordingly introduce a novel computational
framework grounded in neuroscience principles. This framework maps core
biological functions to six essential computation modules: bio-inspired
multimodal sensing, multi-sensory integration, egocentric-allocentric
conversion, an artificial cognitive map, spatial memory, and spatial reasoning.
Together, these modules form a perspective landscape for agentic spatial
reasoning capability across both virtual and physical environments. On top, we
conduct a framework-guided analysis of recent methods, evaluating their
relevance to each module and identifying critical gaps that hinder the
development of more neuroscience-grounded spatial reasoning modules. We further
examine emerging benchmarks and datasets and explore potential application
domains ranging from virtual to embodied systems, such as robotics. Finally, we
outline potential research directions, emphasizing the promising roadmap that
can generalize spatial reasoning across dynamic or unstructured environments.
We hope this work will benefit the research community with a
neuroscience-grounded perspective and a structured pathway. Our project page

Abstract: The prevalence of Large Language Models (LLMs) is having an growing impact on
the climate due to the substantial energy required for their deployment and
use. To create awareness for developers who are implementing LLMs in their
products, there is a strong need to collect more information about the energy
efficiency of LLMs. While existing research has evaluated the energy efficiency
of various models, these benchmarks often fall short of representing realistic
production scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the LLM Efficiency Benchmark,
designed to simulate real-world usage conditions. Our benchmark utilizes vLLM,
a high-throughput, production-ready LLM serving backend that optimizes model
performance and efficiency. We examine how factors such as model size,
architecture, and concurrent request volume affect inference energy efficiency.
Our findings demonstrate that it is possible to create energy efficiency
benchmarks that better reflect practical deployment conditions, providing
valuable insights for developers aiming to build more sustainable AI systems.

particular, while naively inserting documents without structured retrieval
yields only marginal gains for GPT-4o (less than 1%), applying our pipeline

Result: 1) 构建了包含3,164个缺陷和10,268个清洁修改的高质量数据集；2) 紧凑diff风格编码在所有PLM中始终优于完整函数格式；3) 反事实测试显示性能几乎没有下降，表明模型依赖表面线索而非真正的语义理解。

Conclusion: 当前预训练语言模型在代码修改理解任务中能力有限，主要依赖表面特征而非真正的语义理解，与基于快照的任务不同。

Abstract: Just-in-Time software defect prediction (JIT-SDP) plays a critical role in
prioritizing risky code changes during code review and continuous integration.
However, existing datasets often suffer from noisy labels and low precision in
identifying bug-inducing commits. To address this, we present ReDef
(Revert-based Defect dataset), a high-confidence benchmark of function-level
modifications curated from 22 large-scale C/C++ projects. Defective cases are
anchored by revert commits, while clean cases are validated through post-hoc
history checks. Ambiguous instances are conservatively filtered out via a
GPT-assisted triage process involving multiple votes and audits. This pipeline
yields 3,164 defective and 10,268 clean modifications, offering substantially
more reliable labels than prior existing resources. Beyond dataset
construction, we provide the first systematic evaluation of how pre-trained
language models (PLMs) reason about code modifications -- specifically, which
input encodings most effectively expose change information, and whether models
genuinely capture edit semantics. We fine-tune CodeBERT, CodeT5+, and UniXcoder
under five encoding strategies, and further probe their sensitivity through
counterfactual perturbations that swap added/deleted blocks, invert diff
polarity, or inject spurious markers. Our results show that compact diff-style
encodings consistently outperform whole-function formats across all PLMs, with
statistical tests confirming large, model-independent effects. However, under
counterfactual tests, performance degrades little or not at all -- revealing
that what appears to be robustness in fact reflects reliance on superficial
cues rather than true semantic understanding. These findings indicate that,
unlike in snapshot-based tasks, current PLMs remain limited in their ability to
genuinely comprehend code modifications.

Abstract: Diffusion models have significantly advanced text-to-image generation,
enabling the creation of highly realistic images conditioned on textual prompts
and seeds. Given the considerable intellectual and economic value embedded in
such prompts, prompt theft poses a critical security and privacy concern. In
this paper, we investigate prompt-stealing attacks targeting diffusion models.
We reveal that numerical optimization-based prompt recovery methods are
fundamentally limited as they do not account for the initial random noise used
during image generation. We identify and exploit a noise-generation
vulnerability (CWE-339), prevalent in major image-generation frameworks,
originating from PyTorch's restriction of seed values to a range of $2^{32}$
when generating the initial random noise on CPUs. Through a large-scale
empirical analysis conducted on images shared via the popular platform CivitAI,
we demonstrate that approximately 95% of these images' seed values can be
effectively brute-forced in 140 minutes per seed using our seed-recovery tool,
SeedSnitch. Leveraging the recovered seed, we propose PromptPirate, a genetic
algorithm-based optimization method explicitly designed for prompt stealing.
PromptPirate surpasses state-of-the-art methods, i.e., PromptStealer, P2HP, and
CLIP-Interrogator, achieving an 8-11% improvement in LPIPS similarity.
Furthermore, we introduce straightforward and effective countermeasures that
render seed stealing, and thus optimization-based prompt stealing, ineffective.
We have disclosed our findings responsibly and initiated coordinated mitigation
efforts with the developers to address this critical vulnerability.

significant improvements over baseline models, with our fine-tuned model
achieving superior performance (4.8/5.0 average score) compared to

adoption, and code modularity metrics. The generated templates demonstrate high

Motivation: 现有多智能体联合预测方法忽略了交互关系的动态演化特性，无法有效处理未来场景中不确定的社交交互变化

Method: 提出动态异构图建模未来场景的渐进演化，设计分解式架构处理时空依赖关系，结合多尺度解码逐步消除未来运动不确定性

Conclusion: ProgD通过动态异构图建模和渐进多尺度解码，有效捕捉了多智能体交互的动态演化特性，显著提升了运动预测准确性

Abstract: Accurate motion prediction of surrounding agents is crucial for the safe
planning of autonomous vehicles. Recent advancements have extended prediction
techniques from individual agents to joint predictions of multiple interacting
agents, with various strategies to address complex interactions within future
motions of agents. However, these methods overlook the evolving nature of these
interactions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel progressive
multi-scale decoding strategy, termed ProgD, with the help of dynamic
heterogeneous graph-based scenario modeling. In particular, to explicitly and
comprehensively capture the evolving social interactions in future scenarios,
given their inherent uncertainty, we design a progressive modeling of scenarios
with dynamic heterogeneous graphs. With the unfolding of such dynamic
heterogeneous graphs, a factorized architecture is designed to process the
spatio-temporal dependencies within future scenarios and progressively
eliminate uncertainty in future motions of multiple agents. Furthermore, a
multi-scale decoding procedure is incorporated to improve on the future
scenario modeling and consistent prediction of agents' future motion. The
proposed ProgD achieves state-of-the-art performance on the INTERACTION
multi-agent prediction benchmark, ranking $1^{st}$, and the Argoverse 2
multi-world forecasting benchmark.

TL;DR: SEDM是一个自演化的分布式内存框架，通过可验证写入、自适应调度和跨域知识扩散来解决多智能体系统中的内存管理问题，提高推理准确性并减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统长期运行会产生大量轨迹和交互数据，现有内存管理方法存在噪声积累、内存膨胀和跨域泛化能力有限的问题，需要更高效可验证的内存管理框架。

Method: 提出SEDM框架，包含：1）基于可重现回放的可验证写入准入机制；2）根据经验效用动态排序和整合条目的自调度内存控制器；3）抽象可重用见解支持跨异构任务迁移的跨域知识扩散。

Result: 在基准数据集上评估显示，SEDM相比强基线提高了推理准确性，减少了token开销，并能将从事实验证中提取的知识用于增强多跳推理。

Conclusion: SEDM为开放式多智能体协作提供了一个可扩展且可持续的内存机制。

Abstract: Long-term multi-agent systems inevitably generate vast amounts of
trajectories and historical interactions, which makes efficient memory
management essential for both performance and scalability. Existing methods
typically depend on vector retrieval and hierarchical storage, yet they are
prone to noise accumulation, uncontrolled memory expansion, and limited
generalization across domains. To address these challenges, we present SEDM,
Self-Evolving Distributed Memory, a verifiable and adaptive framework that
transforms memory from a passive repository into an active, self-optimizing
component. SEDM integrates verifiable write admission based on reproducible
replay, a self-scheduling memory controller that dynamically ranks and
consolidates entries according to empirical utility, and cross-domain knowledge
diffusion that abstracts reusable insights to support transfer across
heterogeneous tasks. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEDM
improves reasoning accuracy while reducing token overhead compared with strong
memory baselines, and further enables knowledge distilled from fact
verification to enhance multi-hop reasoning. The results highlight SEDM as a
scalable and sustainable memory mechanism for open-ended multi-agent
collaboration. The code will be released in the later stage of this project.

Method: 将组合张量模型的表示解释在希尔伯特空间中，训练变分量子电路来学习这些表示。使用两种图像编码技术：二进制图像向量的多热编码(MHE)和从CLIP模型获取的图像向量的角度/幅度编码。

Result: 在噪声MHE编码上获得了良好的概念验证结果。在CLIP图像向量上的性能较为复杂，但仍优于经典组合模型。

Conclusion: 量子模型在组合泛化任务中显示出潜力，特别是在特定编码方案下表现优于传统方法，为量子机器学习在自然语言处理中的应用提供了新方向。

Abstract: Compositional generalization is a key facet of human cognition, but lacking
in current AI tools such as vision-language models. Previous work examined
whether a compositional tensor-based sentence semantics can overcome the
challenge, but led to negative results. We conjecture that the increased
training efficiency of quantum models will improve performance in these tasks.
We interpret the representations of compositional tensor-based models in
Hilbert spaces and train Variational Quantum Circuits to learn these
representations on an image captioning task requiring compositional
generalization. We used two image encoding techniques: a multi-hot encoding
(MHE) on binary image vectors and an angle/amplitude encoding on image vectors
taken from the vision-language model CLIP. We achieve good proof-of-concept
results using noisy MHE encodings. Performance on CLIP image vectors was more
mixed, but still outperformed classical compositional models.

Abstract: Embodied AI systems operate in dynamic environments, requiring seamless
integration of perception and generation modules to process high-frequency
input and output demands. Traditional sequential computation patterns, while
effective in ensuring accuracy, face significant limitations in achieving the
necessary "thinking" frequency for real-world applications. In this work, we
present Auras, an algorithm-system co-designed inference framework to optimize
the inference frequency of embodied AI agents. Auras disaggregates the
perception and generation and provides controlled pipeline parallelism for them
to achieve high and stable throughput. Faced with the data staleness problem
that appears when the parallelism is increased, Auras establishes a public
context for perception and generation to share, thereby promising the accuracy

Method: 通过概念分析区分三种不透明度类型（浅层不透明、标准黑箱不透明、深层不透明），并分析这些不透明度如何影响隐私保护所需的判断能力。

Result: 发现AI系统中的不透明度使得数据主体和分析专家都无法提供保护隐私所需的理由和判断，导致隐私保护措施失效。

Conclusion: 大数据分析和AI加剧了隐私问题，并使现有的补救措施效果降低，需要技术手段来解决这种不透明性问题。

Abstract: It is known that big data analytics and AI pose a threat to privacy, and that
some of this is due to some kind of "black box problem" in AI. I explain how
this becomes a problem in the context of justification for judgments and
actions. Furthermore, I suggest distinguishing three kinds of opacity: 1) the
subjects do not know what the system does ("shallow opacity"), 2) the analysts
do not know what the system does ("standard black box opacity"), or 3) the
analysts cannot possibly know what the system might do ("deep opacity"). If the
agents, data subjects as well as analytics experts, operate under opacity, then
these agents cannot provide justifications for judgments that are necessary to
protect privacy, e.g., they cannot give "informed consent", or guarantee
"anonymity". It follows from these points that agents in big data analytics and
AI often cannot make the judgments needed to protect privacy. So I conclude
that big data analytics makes the privacy problems worse and the remedies less
effective. As a positive note, I provide a brief outlook on technical ways to
handle this situation.

Abstract: This innovative practice article reports on the piloting of vibe coding
(using natural language to create software applications with AI) for English as
a Foreign Language (EFL) education. We developed a human-AI meta-languaging
framework with three dimensions: talking to AI (prompt engineering), talking
through AI (negotiating authorship), and talking about AI (mental models of
AI). Using backward design principles, we created a four-hour workshop where
two students designed applications addressing authentic EFL writing challenges.
We adopted a case study methodology, collecting data from worksheets and video
recordings, think-aloud protocols, screen recordings, and AI-generated images.
Contrasting cases showed one student successfully vibe coding a functional
application cohering to her intended design, while another encountered
technical difficulties with major gaps between intended design and actual
functionality. Analysis reveals differences in students' prompt engineering
approaches, suggesting different AI mental models and tensions in attributing
authorship. We argue that AI functions as a beneficial languaging machine, and
that differences in how students talk to, through, and about AI explain vibe
coding outcome variations. Findings indicate that effective vibe coding
instruction requires explicit meta-languaging scaffolding, teaching structured
prompt engineering, facilitating critical authorship discussions, and
developing vocabulary for articulating AI mental models.

Abstract: Audio deepfake detection (ADD) models are commonly evaluated using datasets
that combine multiple synthesizers, with performance reported as a single Equal
Error Rate (EER). However, this approach disproportionately weights
synthesizers with more samples, underrepresenting others and reducing the
overall reliability of EER. Additionally, most ADD datasets lack diversity in
bona fide speech, often featuring a single environment and speech style (e.g.,
clean read speech), limiting their ability to simulate real-world conditions.
To address these challenges, we propose bona fide cross-testing, a novel
evaluation framework that incorporates diverse bona fide datasets and
aggregates EERs for more balanced assessments. Our approach improves robustness
and interpretability compared to traditional evaluation methods. We benchmark
over 150 synthesizers across nine bona fide speech types and release a new

Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into telecommunications
infrastructure introduces novel risks, such as algorithmic bias and
unpredictable system behavior, that fall outside the scope of traditional
cybersecurity and data protection frameworks. This paper introduces a precise
definition and a detailed typology of telecommunications AI incidents,
establishing them as a distinct category of risk that extends beyond
conventional cybersecurity and data protection breaches. It argues for their
recognition as a distinct regulatory concern. Using India as a case study for
jurisdictions that lack a horizontal AI law, the paper analyzes the country's
key digital regulations. The analysis reveals that India's existing legal
instruments, including the Telecommunications Act, 2023, the CERT-In Rules, and
the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, focus on cybersecurity and data
breaches, creating a significant regulatory gap for AI-specific operational
incidents, such as performance degradation and algorithmic bias. The paper also
examines structural barriers to disclosure and the limitations of existing AI
incident repositories. Based on these findings, the paper proposes targeted
policy recommendations centered on integrating AI incident reporting into
India's existing telecom governance. Key proposals include mandating reporting
for high-risk AI failures, designating an existing government body as a nodal
agency to manage incident data, and developing standardized reporting
frameworks. These recommendations aim to enhance regulatory clarity and
strengthen long-term resilience, offering a pragmatic and replicable blueprint
for other nations seeking to govern AI risks within their existing sectoral
frameworks.

Abstract: Tournaments are widely used models to represent pairwise dominance between
candidates, alternatives, or teams. We study the problem of providing certified
explanations for why a candidate appears among the winners under various
tournament rules. To this end, we identify minimal supports, minimal
sub-tournaments in which the candidate is guaranteed to win regardless of how
the rest of the tournament is completed (that is, the candidate is a necessary
winner of the sub-tournament). This notion corresponds to an abductive
explanation for the question,"Why does the winner win the tournament", a
central concept in formal explainable AI. We focus on common tournament
solutions: the top cycle, the uncovered set, the Copeland rule, the Borda rule,
the maximin rule, and the weighted uncovered set. For each rule we determine
the size of the smallest minimal supports, and we present polynomial-time
algorithms to compute them for all but the weighted uncovered set, for which
the problem is NP-complete. Finally, we show how minimal supports can serve to
produce compact, certified, and intuitive explanations.

Abstract: Coordinated teamwork is essential in fast-paced decision-making environments
that require dynamic adaptation, often without an opportunity for explicit
communication. Although implicit coordination has been extensively considered
in the existing literature, the majority of work has focused on co-located,
synchronous teamwork (such as sports teams) or, in distributed teams, primarily
on coordination of knowledge work. However, many teams (firefighters, military,
law enforcement, emergency response) must coordinate their movements in
physical space without the benefit of visual cues or extensive explicit
communication. This paper investigates how three dimensions of spatial
coordination, namely exploration diversity, movement specialization, and
adaptive spatial proximity, influence team performance in a collaborative
online search and rescue task where explicit communication is restricted and
team members rely on movement patterns to infer others' intentions and
coordinate actions. Our metrics capture the relational aspects of teamwork by
measuring spatial proximity, distribution patterns, and alignment of movements
within shared environments. We analyze data from 34 four-person teams (136
participants) assigned to specialized roles in a search and rescue task.
Results show that spatial specialization positively predicts performance, while
adaptive spatial proximity exhibits a marginal inverted U-shaped relationship,
suggesting moderate levels of adaptation are optimal. Furthermore, the temporal
dynamics of these metrics differentiate high- from low-performing teams over
time. These findings provide insights into implicit spatial coordination in
role-based teamwork and highlight the importance of balanced adaptive
strategies, with implications for training and AI-assisted team support
systems.

Motivation: 虽然Koopman算子理论在动态系统建模中表现出色，但它本身不保证收敛到期望轨迹或指定目标，这在从演示学习(LfD)中是必需的要求。

Method: 提出KoopMotion方法，将运动流场表示为动态系统，通过Koopman算子参数化来模仿期望轨迹，并利用学习流场的发散特性获得平滑的运动场。

Result: 在LASA手写数据集和3D机械臂末端轨迹数据集上评估，包括频谱分析。在物理机器人上验证，在非静态流体环境中运行的微型自主水面车辆上表现良好。仅需LASA数据集的3%即可生成密集运动计划，在时空动态建模效果指标上显著优于基线。

Conclusion: KoopMotion方法具有高度样本效率，能够有效解决机器人运动规划中的轨迹收敛问题，在真实环境中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel flow field-based motion planning method that
drives a robot from any initial state to a desired reference trajectory such
that it converges to the trajectory's end point. Despite demonstrated efficacy
in using Koopman operator theory for modeling dynamical systems, Koopman does
not inherently enforce convergence to desired trajectories nor to specified
goals -- a requirement when learning from demonstrations (LfD). We present
KoopMotion which represents motion flow fields as dynamical systems,
parameterized by Koopman Operators to mimic desired trajectories, and leverages
the divergence properties of the learnt flow fields to obtain smooth motion
fields that converge to a desired reference trajectory when a robot is placed
away from the desired trajectory, and tracks the trajectory until the end
point. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we show evaluations of
KoopMotion on the LASA human handwriting dataset and a 3D manipulator
end-effector trajectory dataset, including spectral analysis. We also perform
experiments on a physical robot, verifying KoopMotion on a miniature autonomous
surface vehicle operating in a non-static fluid flow environment. Our approach
is highly sample efficient in both space and time, requiring only 3\% of the
LASA dataset to generate dense motion plans. Additionally, KoopMotion provides
a significant improvement over baselines when comparing metrics that measure
spatial and temporal dynamics modeling efficacy.

Abstract: In this technical report, we describe our submission for Task 1,
Low-Complexity Device-Robust Acoustic Scene Classification, of the DCASE 2025
Challenge. Our work tackles the dual challenges of strict complexity
constraints and robust generalization to both seen and unseen devices, while
also leveraging the new rule allowing the use of device labels at test time.
Our proposed system is based on a knowledge distillation framework where an
efficient CP-MobileNet student learns from a compact, specialized two-teacher
ensemble. This ensemble combines a baseline PaSST teacher, trained with
standard cross-entropy, and a 'generalization expert' teacher. This expert is
trained using our novel Device-Aware Feature Alignment (DAFA) loss, adapted
from prior work, which explicitly structures the feature space for device
robustness. To capitalize on the availability of test-time device labels, the
distilled student model then undergoes a final device-specific fine-tuning
stage. Our proposed system achieves a final accuracy of 57.93\% on the
development set, demonstrating a significant improvement over the official
baseline, particularly on unseen devices.

Abstract: In 2011, Xavier Amatriain sounded the alarm: recommender systems research was
"doing it all wrong" [1]. His critique, rooted in statistical misinterpretation
and methodological shortcuts, remains as relevant today as it was then. But
rather than correcting course, we added new layers of sophistication on top of
the same broken foundations. This paper revisits Amatriain's diagnosis and
argues that many of the conceptual, epistemological, and infrastructural
failures he identified still persist, in more subtle or systemic forms. Drawing
on recent work in reproducibility, evaluation methodology, environmental
impact, and participatory design, we showcase how the field's accelerating
complexity has outpaced its introspection. We highlight ongoing community-led
initiatives that attempt to shift the paradigm, including workshops, evaluation
frameworks, and calls for value-sensitive and participatory research. At the
same time, we contend that meaningful change will require not only new metrics
or better tooling, but a fundamental reframing of what recommender systems
research is for, who it serves, and how knowledge is produced and validated.
Our call is not just for technical reform, but for a recommender systems
research agenda grounded in epistemic humility, human impact, and sustainable
practice.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于"对象相对"控制的视觉导航新范式，使用相对3D场景图作为拓扑地图表示，训练ObjectReact局部控制器，在跨传感器高度变化和反向导航等任务中优于传统的"图像相对"方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于单摄像头和拓扑地图的视觉导航方法采用"图像相对"控制，但图像表示受限于智能体姿态和具体实现。对象作为地图属性提供了与实现方式和轨迹无关的世界表示，因此需要开发更鲁棒的"对象相对"控制方法。

Method: 提出使用"相对"3D场景图作为拓扑地图表示，用于获取更具信息量的对象级全局路径规划成本。训练ObjectReact局部控制器，直接基于高级"WayObject Costmap"表示进行条件化，无需显式RGB输入。

Result: 在传感器高度变化和多个导航任务（如反向导航）中，对象相对控制方法优于图像相对方法。仅使用模拟训练的策略能够很好地泛化到真实室内环境。

Conclusion: 对象相对控制范式具有多个优势：无需严格模仿先验经验即可遍历新路线、控制预测问题可与图像匹配问题解耦、在跨实现部署中实现高不变性。

Abstract: Visual navigation using only a single camera and a topological map has
recently become an appealing alternative to methods that require additional
sensors and 3D maps. This is typically achieved through an "image-relative"
approach to estimating control from a given pair of current observation and
subgoal image. However, image-level representations of the world have
limitations because images are strictly tied to the agent's pose and
embodiment. In contrast, objects, being a property of the map, offer an
embodiment- and trajectory-invariant world representation. In this work, we
present a new paradigm of learning "object-relative" control that exhibits
several desirable characteristics: a) new routes can be traversed without
strictly requiring to imitate prior experience, b) the control prediction
problem can be decoupled from solving the image matching problem, and c) high
invariance can be achieved in cross-embodiment deployment for variations across
both training-testing and mapping-execution settings. We propose a topometric
map representation in the form of a "relative" 3D scene graph, which is used to
obtain more informative object-level global path planning costs. We train a
local controller, dubbed "ObjectReact", conditioned directly on a high-level
"WayObject Costmap" representation that eliminates the need for an explicit RGB
input. We demonstrate the advantages of learning object-relative control over
its image-relative counterpart across sensor height variations and multiple
navigation tasks that challenge the underlying spatial understanding
capability, e.g., navigating a map trajectory in the reverse direction. We
further show that our sim-only policy is able to generalize well to real-world
indoor environments. Code and supplementary material are accessible via project

Abstract: Bayesian inference is widely used in many different fields to test hypotheses
against observations. In most such applications, an assumption is made of
precise input values to produce a precise output value. However, this is
unrealistic for real-world applications. Often the best available information
from subject matter experts (SMEs) in a given field is interval range estimates
of the input probabilities involved in Bayes Theorem. This paper provides two
key contributions to extend Bayes Theorem to an interval type-2 (IT2) version.
First, we develop an IT2 version of Bayes Theorem that uses a novel and
conservative method to avoid potential inconsistencies in the input IT2 MFs
that otherwise might produce invalid output results. We then describe a novel
and flexible algorithm for encoding SME-provided intervals into IT2 fuzzy
membership functions (MFs), which we can use to specify the input probabilities
in Bayes Theorem. Our algorithm generalizes and extends previous work on this
problem that primarily addressed the encoding of intervals into word MFs for
Computing with Words applications.

Abstract: Coordinating a fully distributed multi-agent system (MAS) can be challenging
when the communication channel has very limited capabilities in terms of
sending rate and packet payload. When the MAS has to deal with active obstacles
in a highly partially observable environment, the communication channel
acquires considerable relevance. In this paper, we present an approach to deal
with task assignments in extremely active scenarios, where tasks need to be
frequently reallocated among the agents participating in the coordination
process. Inspired by market-based task assignments, we introduce a novel
distributed coordination method to orchestrate autonomous agents' actions
efficiently in low communication scenarios. In particular, our algorithm takes
into account asymmetric obstacles. While in the real world, the majority of
obstacles are asymmetric, they are usually treated as symmetric ones, thus
limiting the applicability of existing methods. To summarize, the presented
architecture is designed to tackle scenarios where the obstacles are active and
asymmetric, the communication channel is poor and the environment is partially
observable. Our approach has been validated in simulation and in the real
world, using a team of NAO robots during official RoboCup competitions.
Experimental results show a notable reduction in task overlaps in limited
communication settings, with a decrease of 52% in the most frequent reallocated
task.

Abstract: A sleep forecast allows individuals and healthcare providers to anticipate
and proactively address factors influencing restful rest, ultimately improving
mental and physical well-being. This work presents an adaptive spatial and
temporal model (AdaST-Sleep) for predicting sleep scores. Our proposed model
combines convolutional layers to capture spatial feature interactions between
multiple features and recurrent neural network layers to handle longer-term
temporal health-related data. A domain classifier is further integrated to
generalize across different subjects. We conducted several experiments using
five input window sizes (3, 5, 7, 9, 11 days) and five predicting window sizes
(1, 3, 5, 7, 9 days). Our approach consistently outperformed four baseline
models, achieving its lowest RMSE (0.282) with a seven-day input window and a
one-day predicting window. Moreover, the method maintained strong performance
even when forecasting multiple days into the future, demonstrating its
versatility for real-world applications. Visual comparisons reveal that the
model accurately tracks both the overall sleep score level and daily
fluctuations. These findings prove that the proposed framework provides a
robust and adaptable solution for personalized sleep forecasting using sparse
data from commercial wearable devices and domain adaptation techniques.

Abstract: Three-dimensional X-ray histology techniques offer a non-invasive alternative
to conventional 2D histology, enabling volumetric imaging of biological tissues
without the need for physical sectioning or chemical staining. However, the
inherent greyscale image contrast of X-ray tomography limits its biochemical
specificity compared to traditional histological stains. Within digital
pathology, deep learning-based virtual staining has demonstrated utility in
simulating stained appearances from label-free optical images. In this study,
we extend virtual staining to the X-ray domain by applying cross-modality image
translation to generate artificially stained slices from
synchrotron-radiation-based micro-CT scans. Using over 50 co-registered image
pairs of micro-CT and toluidine blue-stained histology from bone-implant
samples, we trained a modified CycleGAN network tailored for limited paired
data. Whole slide histology images were downsampled to match the voxel size of
the CT data, with on-the-fly data augmentation for patch-based training. The
model incorporates pixelwise supervision and greyscale consistency terms,
producing histologically realistic colour outputs while preserving
high-resolution structural detail. Our method outperformed Pix2Pix and standard
CycleGAN baselines across SSIM, PSNR, and LPIPS metrics. Once trained, the
model can be applied to full CT volumes to generate virtually stained 3D
datasets, enhancing interpretability without additional sample preparation.
While features such as new bone formation were able to be reproduced, some
variability in the depiction of implant degradation layers highlights the need
for further training data and refinement. This work introduces virtual staining
to 3D X-ray imaging and offers a scalable route for chemically informative,
label-free tissue characterisation in biomedical research.

Abstract: The diffusion MRI Neurite Exchange Imaging model offers a promising framework
for probing gray matter microstructure by estimating parameters such as
compartment sizes, diffusivities, and inter-compartmental water exchange time.
However, existing protocols require long scan times. This study proposes a
reduced acquisition scheme for the Connectome 2.0 scanner that preserves model
accuracy while substantially shortening scan duration. We developed a
data-driven framework using explainable artificial intelligence with a guided
recursive feature elimination strategy to identify an optimal 8-feature subset
from a 15-feature protocol. The performance of this optimized protocol was
validated in vivo and benchmarked against the full acquisition and alternative
reduction strategies. Parameter accuracy, preservation of anatomical contrast,
and test-retest reproducibility were assessed. The reduced protocol yielded
parameter estimates and cortical maps comparable to the full protocol, with low
estimation errors in synthetic data and minimal impact on test-retest
variability. Compared to theory-driven and heuristic reduction schemes, the
optimized protocol demonstrated superior robustness, reducing the deviation in
water exchange time estimates by over two-fold. In conclusion, this hybrid
optimization framework enables viable imaging of neurite exchange in 14 minutes
without loss of parameter fidelity. This approach supports the broader
application of exchange-sensitive diffusion magnetic resonance imaging in
neuroscience and clinical research, and offers a generalizable method for
designing efficient acquisition protocols in biophysical parameter mapping.

Abstract: Metaheuristics are widely applied for their ability to provide more efficient
solutions. The RIME algorithm is a recently proposed physical-based
metaheuristic algorithm with certain advantages. However, it suffers from rapid
loss of population diversity during optimization and is prone to fall into
local optima, leading to unbalanced exploitation and exploration. To address
the shortcomings of RIME, this paper proposes a modified RIME with covariance
learning and diversity enhancement (MRIME-CD). The algorithm applies three
strategies to improve the optimization capability. First, a covariance learning
strategy is introduced in the soft-rime search stage to increase the population
diversity and balance the over-exploitation ability of RIME through the
bootstrapping effect of dominant populations. Second, in order to moderate the
tendency of RIME population to approach the optimal individual in the early
search stage, an average bootstrapping strategy is introduced into the
hard-rime puncture mechanism, which guides the population search through the
weighted position of the dominant populations, thus enhancing the global search
ability of RIME in the early stage. Finally, a new stagnation indicator is
proposed, and a stochastic covariance learning strategy is used to update the
stagnant individuals in the population when the algorithm gets stagnant, thus
enhancing the ability to jump out of the local optimal solution. The proposed
MRIME-CD algorithm is subjected to a series of validations on the CEC2017 test
set, the CEC2022 test set, and the experimental results are analyzed using the
Friedman test, the Wilcoxon rank sum test, and the Kruskal Wallis test. The
results show that MRIME-CD can effectively improve the performance of basic
RIME and has obvious superiorities in terms of solution accuracy, convergence
speed and stability.

Abstract: The educational competition optimizer is a recently introduced metaheuristic
algorithm inspired by human behavior, originating from the dynamics of
educational competition within society. Nonetheless, ECO faces constraints due
to an imbalance between exploitation and exploration, rendering it susceptible
to local optima and demonstrating restricted effectiveness in addressing
complex optimization problems. To address these limitations, this study
presents an enhanced educational competition optimizer (IECO-MCO) utilizing
multi-covariance learning operators. In IECO, three distinct covariance
learning operators are introduced to improve the performance of ECO. Each
operator effectively balances exploitation and exploration while preventing
premature convergence of the population. The effectiveness of IECO is assessed
through benchmark functions derived from the CEC 2017 and CEC 2022 test suites,
and its performance is compared with various basic and improved algorithms
across different categories. The results demonstrate that IECO-MCO surpasses
the basic ECO and other competing algorithms in convergence speed, stability,
and the capability to avoid local optima. Furthermore, statistical analyses,
including the Friedman test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Wilcoxon rank-sum test,
are conducted to validate the superiority of IECO-MCO over the compared
algorithms. Compared with the basic algorithm (improved algorithm), IECO-MCO
achieved an average ranking of 2.213 (2.488) on the CE2017 and CEC2022 test
suites. Additionally, the practical applicability of the proposed IECO-MCO
algorithm is verified by solving constrained optimization problems. The
experimental outcomes demonstrate the superior performance of IECO-MCO in
tackling intricate optimization problems, underscoring its robustness and
practical effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed both everyday life and
scientific research. However, adapting LLMs from general-purpose models to
specialized tasks remains challenging, particularly in resource-constrained
environments. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a prominent method within
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), has emerged as a promising approach to
LLMs by approximating model weight updates using low-rank decomposition.
However, LoRA is limited by its uniform rank ( r ) allocation to each
incremental matrix, and existing rank allocation techniques aimed at addressing
this issue remain computationally inefficient, complex, and unstable, hindering
practical applications. To address these limitations, we propose
Sensitivity-LoRA, an efficient fine-tuning method that dynamically allocates
ranks to weight matrices based on both their global and local sensitivities. It
leverages the second-order derivatives (Hessian Matrix) of the loss function to
effectively capture weight sensitivity, enabling optimal rank allocation with
minimal computational overhead. Our experimental results have demonstrated
robust effectiveness, efficiency and stability of Sensitivity-LoRA across
diverse tasks and benchmarks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有序列级RL方法（如PPO/GRPO）在移植到序列级别时存在固定裁剪范围对长短响应不公平重加权的问题，这会扭曲有效目标函数。

Method: 提出FSPO方法，在序列对数重要性采样比率上应用高斯启发的裁剪带，包含KL校正漂移项并以√L比例缩放，确保长度公平性。

Result: FSPO在不同长度区间上平坦化裁剪率，稳定训练过程，在多个评估数据集上优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: FSPO通过理论分析和实证验证，解决了序列级RL中的长度公平性问题，提供了更稳定和有效的训练方法。

Abstract: We propose FSPO (Fair Sequence Policy Optimization), a sequence-level
reinforcement learning method for LLMs that enforces length-fair clipping
directly in the importance-sampling (IS) weight space. We revisit
sequence-level RL methods and identify a mismatch when PPO/GRPO-style clipping
is transplanted to sequences: a fixed clip range systematically reweights short
vs. long responses, distorting the effective objective. Theoretically, we
formalize length fairness via a Length Reweighting Error (LRE) and prove that
small LRE yields a directional cosine guarantee between the clipped and true
updates. FSPO introduces a simple, Gaussian-motivated remedy: we clip the
sequence log-IS ratio with a band that applies a KL-corrected drift term and
scales as $\sqrt{L}$. Empirically, FSPO flattens clip rates across length bins,
stabilizes training, and outperforms all baselines across multiple evaluation
datasets.

Conclusion: IP3O算法有效解决了约束强化学习中的训练不稳定问题，通过渐进惩罚机制实现了更好的约束满足和性能表现。

Abstract: Constrained Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to maximize the return while
adhering to predefined constraint limits, which represent domain-specific
safety requirements. In continuous control settings, where learning agents
govern system actions, balancing the trade-off between reward maximization and
constraint satisfaction remains a significant challenge. Policy optimization
methods often exhibit instability near constraint boundaries, resulting in
suboptimal training performance. To address this issue, we introduce a novel
approach that integrates an adaptive incentive mechanism in addition to the
reward structure to stay within the constraint bound before approaching the
constraint boundary. Building on this insight, we propose Incrementally
Penalized Proximal Policy Optimization (IP3O), a practical algorithm that
enforces a progressively increasing penalty to stabilize training dynamics.
Through empirical evaluation on benchmark environments, we demonstrate the
efficacy of IP3O compared to the performance of state-of-the-art Safe RL
algorithms. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees by deriving a bound
on the worst-case error of the optimality achieved by our algorithm.

Abstract: In long-horizon tasks, recent agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs)
face a significant challenge that sparse, outcome-based rewards make it
difficult to assign credit to intermediate steps. Previous methods mainly focus
on creating dense reward signals to guide learning, either through traditional
reinforcement learning techniques like inverse reinforcement learning or by
using Process Reward Models for step-by-step feedback. In this paper, we
identify a fundamental problem in the learning dynamics of LLMs: the magnitude
of policy gradients is inherently coupled with the entropy, which leads to
inefficient small updates for confident correct actions and potentially
destabilizes large updates for uncertain ones. To resolve this, we propose
Entropy-Modulated Policy Gradients (EMPG), a framework that re-calibrates the
learning signal based on step-wise uncertainty and the final task outcome. EMPG
amplifies updates for confident correct actions, penalizes confident errors,
and attenuates updates from uncertain steps to stabilize exploration. We
further introduce a bonus term for future clarity that encourages agents to
find more predictable solution paths. Through comprehensive experiments on
three challenging agent tasks, WebShop, ALFWorld, and Deep Search, we
demonstrate that EMPG achieves substantial performance gains and significantly
outperforms strong policy gradient baselines. Project page is at

Method: 评估LLM生成的反事实解释的有效性（是否能改变预测结果）和最小性（修改程度是否最小），在多个LLM、数据集和评估设置中进行实验。

Result: LLM通常能生成有效的反事实解释，但远非最小化；当要求生成最小化修改时，又往往修改过小无法改变预测。这种有效性-最小性权衡在不同模型和设置中一致存在。

Conclusion: 自我反事实解释作为可解释性工具效果有限，甚至可能提供误导性见解，在部署LLM到高风险场景时必须考虑不可靠自我解释的影响。

Abstract: To collaborate effectively with humans, language models must be able to
explain their decisions in natural language. We study a specific type of
self-explanation: self-generated counterfactual explanations (SCEs), where a
model explains its prediction by modifying the input such that it would have
predicted a different outcome. We evaluate whether LLMs can produce SCEs that
are valid, achieving the intended outcome, and minimal, modifying the input no
more than necessary. When asked to generate counterfactuals, we find that LLMs
typically produce SCEs that are valid, but far from minimal, offering little
insight into their decision-making behaviour. Worryingly, when asked to
generate minimal counterfactuals, LLMs typically make excessively small edits
that fail to change predictions. The observed validity-minimality trade-off is
consistent across several LLMs, datasets, and evaluation settings. Our findings
suggest that SCEs are, at best, an ineffective explainability tool and, at
worst, can provide misleading insights into model behaviour. Proposals to
deploy LLMs in high-stakes settings must consider the impact of unreliable
self-explanations on downstream decision-making. Our code is available at

Motivation: 大型语言模型需要巨大的内存占用，限制了在消费级硬件上的部署。2-bit量化由于激活值中的异常值会导致灾难性的性能损失，而现有的旋转方法使用固定的变换矩阵，无法适应不同Transformer层的特定异常值模式。

Method: 提出ButterflyQuant方法，用可学习的蝴蝶变换替代固定的Hadamard矩阵，通过连续参数化的Givens旋转角度实现正交变换，同时引入均匀性正则化来促进更适合量化的平滑分布。

Result: 在LLaMA-2-7B模型上，使用2-bit量化时，ButterflyQuant达到了15.4的困惑度，相比QuaRot的22.1有显著提升。学习过程只需要128个校准样本，在单GPU上几分钟内收敛。

Conclusion: ButterflyQuant通过层自适应的可学习正交变换有效解决了2-bit量化中的异常值问题，在保持理论保证的同时实现了更好的量化性能。

Abstract: Large language models require massive memory footprints, severely limiting
deployment on consumer hardware. Quantization reduces memory through lower
numerical precision, but extreme 2-bit quantization suffers from catastrophic
performance loss due to outliers in activations. Rotation-based methods such as
QuIP and QuaRot apply orthogonal transforms to eliminate outliers before
quantization, using computational invariance: $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{Wx} =
(\mathbf{WQ}^T)(\mathbf{Qx})$ for orthogonal $\mathbf{Q}$. However, these
methods use fixed transforms--Hadamard matrices achieving optimal worst-case
coherence $\mu = 1/\sqrt{n}$--that cannot adapt to specific weight
distributions. We identify that different transformer layers exhibit distinct
outlier patterns, motivating layer-adaptive rotations rather than
one-size-fits-all approaches. We propose ButterflyQuant, which replaces
Hadamard rotations with learnable butterfly transforms parameterized by
continuous Givens rotation angles. Unlike Hadamard's discrete $\{+1, -1\}$
entries that are non-differentiable and prohibit gradient-based learning,
butterfly transforms' continuous parameterization enables smooth optimization
while guaranteeing orthogonality by construction. This orthogonal constraint
ensures theoretical guarantees in outlier suppression while achieving $O(n \log
n)$ computational complexity with only $\frac{n \log n}{2}$ learnable
parameters. We further introduce a uniformity regularization on
post-transformation activations to promote smoother distributions amenable to
quantization. Learning requires only 128 calibration samples and converges in
minutes on a single GPU--a negligible one-time cost. On LLaMA-2-7B with 2-bit
quantization, ButterflyQuant achieves 15.4 perplexity versus 22.1 for QuaRot.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) alignment methods have been credited with the
commercial success of products like ChatGPT, given their role in steering LLMs
towards user-friendly outputs. However, current alignment techniques
predominantly mirror the normative preferences of a narrow reference group,
effectively imposing their values on a wide user base. Drawing on theories of
the power/knowledge nexus, this work argues that current alignment practices
centralise control over knowledge production and governance within already
influential institutions. To counter this, we propose decentralising alignment
through three characteristics: context, pluralism, and participation.
Furthermore, this paper demonstrates the critical importance of delineating the
context-of-use when shaping alignment practices by grounding each of these
features in concrete use cases. This work makes the following contributions:
(1) highlighting the role of context, pluralism, and participation in
decentralising alignment; (2) providing concrete examples to illustrate these
strategies; and (3) demonstrating the nuanced requirements associated with
applying alignment across different contexts of use. Ultimately, this paper
positions LLM alignment as a potential site of resistance against epistemic
injustice and the erosion of democratic processes, while acknowledging that
these strategies alone cannot substitute for broader societal changes.

Abstract: Large-scale transformer models have emerged as a powerful tool for semantic
communication systems, enabling edge devices to extract rich representations
for robust inference across noisy wireless channels. However, their substantial
computational demands remain a major barrier to practical deployment in
resource-constrained 6G networks. In this paper, we present a training-free
framework for adaptive token merging in pretrained vision transformers to
jointly reduce inference time and transmission resource usage. We formulate the
selection of per-layer merging proportions as a multi-objective optimization
problem to balance accuracy and computational cost. We employ Gaussian
process-based Bayesian optimization to construct a Pareto frontier of optimal
configurations, enabling flexible runtime adaptation to dynamic application
requirements and channel conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms other baselines and achieves significant
reductions in floating-point operations while maintaining competitive accuracy
across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Additional
results highlight the effectiveness of adaptive policies that adjust merging
aggressiveness in response to channel quality, providing a practical mechanism
to trade off latency and semantic fidelity on demand. These findings establish
a scalable and efficient approach for deploying transformer-based semantic
communication in future edge intelligence systems.

Conclusion: 首次为异步Q-learning提供有限时间鲁棒性保证，填补了鲁棒强化学习的重要空白

Abstract: We consider the problem of learning the optimal policy in a discounted,
infinite-horizon reinforcement learning (RL) setting where the reward signal is
subject to adversarial corruption. Such corruption, which may arise from
extreme noise, sensor faults, or malicious attacks, can severely degrade the
performance of classical algorithms such as Q-learning. To address this
challenge, we propose a new provably robust variant of the Q-learning algorithm
that operates effectively even when a fraction of the observed rewards are
arbitrarily perturbed by an adversary. Under the asynchronous sampling model
with time-correlated data, we establish that despite adversarial corruption,
the finite-time convergence rate of our algorithm matches that of existing
results for the non-adversarial case, up to an additive term proportional to
the fraction of corrupted samples. Moreover, we derive an information-theoretic
lower bound revealing that the additive corruption term in our upper bounds is
unavoidable.
  Next, we propose a variant of our algorithm that requires no prior knowledge
of the statistics of the true reward distributions. The analysis of this
setting is particularly challenging and is enabled by carefully exploiting a
refined Azuma-Hoeffding inequality for almost-martingales, a technical tool
that might be of independent interest. Collectively, our contributions provide
the first finite-time robustness guarantees for asynchronous Q-learning,
bridging a significant gap in robust RL.

Effect refers to cases where multiple models perform similarly well for a given

manufacturing process or medical diagnosis, where diverse patterns in data lead
to multiple high-performing solutions. We propose the Rashomon Ensemble, a
method that strategically selects models from these diverse high-performing
solutions to improve generalization. By grouping models based on both their
performance and explanations, we construct ensembles that maximize diversity
while maintaining predictive accuracy. This selection ensures that each model
covers a distinct region of the solution space, making the ensemble more robust
to distribution shifts and variations in unseen data. We validate our approach
on both open and proprietary collaborative real-world datasets, demonstrating
up to 0.20+ AUROC improvements in scenarios where the Rashomon ratio is large.
Additionally, we demonstrate tangible benefits for businesses in various

Abstract: Existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle with complex dynamical
systems that demand interactions at high frequencies or irregular time
intervals. Continuous-time RL (CTRL) has emerged as a promising alternative by
replacing discrete-time Bellman recursion with differential value functions
defined as viscosity solutions of the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equation.
While CTRL has shown promise, its applications have been largely limited to the
single-agent domain. This limitation stems from two key challenges: (i)
conventional solution methods for HJB equations suffer from the curse of
dimensionality (CoD), making them intractable in high-dimensional systems; and
(ii) even with HJB-based learning approaches, accurately approximating
centralized value functions in multi-agent settings remains difficult, which in
turn destabilizes policy training. In this paper, we propose a CT-MARL
framework that uses physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to approximate
HJB-based value functions at scale. To ensure the value is consistent with its
differential structure, we align value learning with value-gradient learning by
introducing a Value Gradient Iteration (VGI) module that iteratively refines
value gradients along trajectories. This improves gradient fidelity, in turn
yielding more accurate values and stronger policy learning. We evaluate our
method using continuous-time variants of standard benchmarks, including
multi-agent particle environment (MPE) and multi-agent MuJoCo. Our results
demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing continuous-time
RL baselines and scales to complex multi-agent dynamics.

Abstract: The question-answering (QA) simulator is a model that mimics real student
learning behaviors and predicts their correctness of their responses to
questions. QA simulators enable educational recommender systems (ERS) to
collect large amounts of training data without interacting with real students,
thereby preventing harmful recommendations made by an undertrained ERS from
undermining actual student learning. Given the QA history, there are two
categories of solutions to predict the correctness, conducting the simulation:
(1) LLM-free methods, which apply a traditional sequential model to transfer
the QA history into a vector representation first, and make predictions based
on the representation; (2) LLM-based methods, which leverage the domain
knowledge and reasoning capability of LLM to enhence the prediction. LLM-free
methods offer fast inference but generally yield suboptimal performance. In
contrast, most LLM-based methods achieve better results, but at the cost of
slower inference speed and higher GPU memory consumption. In this paper, we
propose a method named LLM Distillation based Simulator (LDSim), which distills
domain knowledge and reasoning capability from an LLM to better assist
prediction, thereby improving simulation performance. Extensive experiments

Abstract: Machine learning models in dynamic environments often suffer from concept
drift, where changes in the data distribution degrade performance. While
detecting this drift is a well-studied topic, explaining how and why the
model's decision-making logic changes still remains a significant challenge. In
this paper, we introduce a novel methodology to explain concept drift by
analyzing the temporal evolution of group-based counterfactual explanations
(GCEs). Our approach tracks shifts in the GCEs' cluster centroids and their
associated counterfactual action vectors before and after a drift. These
evolving GCEs act as an interpretable proxy, revealing structural changes in
the model's decision boundary and its underlying rationale. We operationalize
this analysis within a three-layer framework that synergistically combines
insights from the data layer (distributional shifts), the model layer
(prediction disagreement), and our proposed explanation layer. We show that
such holistic view allows for a more comprehensive diagnosis of drift, making
it possible to distinguish between different root causes, such as a spatial
data shift versus a re-labeling of concepts.

Abstract: Powerful artificial intelligence (AI) tools that have emerged in recent years
-- including large language models, automated coding assistants, and advanced
image and speech generation technologies -- are the result of monumental human
achievements. These breakthroughs reflect mastery across multiple technical
disciplines and the resolution of significant technological challenges.
However, some of the most profound challenges may still lie ahead. These
challenges are not purely technical but pertain to the fair and responsible use
of AI in ways that genuinely improve the global human condition. This article
explores one promising application aligned with that vision: the use of AI
tools to facilitate and enhance education, with a specific focus on signal
processing (SP). It presents two interrelated perspectives: identifying and
addressing technical limitations, and applying AI tools in practice to improve
educational experiences. Primers are provided on several core technical issues
that arise when using AI in educational settings, including how to ensure
fairness and inclusivity, handle hallucinated outputs, and achieve efficient
use of resources. These and other considerations -- such as transparency,
explainability, and trustworthiness -- are illustrated through the development
of an immersive, structured, and reliable "smart textbook." The article serves

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain a leading cause of mortality worldwide,
underscoring the importance of accurate and scalable diagnostic systems.
Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is central to detecting cardiac abnormalities,
yet challenges such as noise, class imbalance, and dataset heterogeneity limit
current methods. To address these issues, we propose FoundationalECGNet, a
foundational framework for automated ECG classification. The model integrates a
dual-stage denoising by Morlet and Daubechies wavelets transformation,
Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), Graph Attention Networks (GAT),
and Time Series Transformers (TST) to jointly capture spatial and temporal
dependencies in multi-channel ECG signals. FoundationalECGNet first
distinguishes between Normal and Abnormal ECG signals, and then classifies the
Abnormal signals into one of five cardiac conditions: Arrhythmias, Conduction
Disorders, Myocardial Infarction, QT Abnormalities, or Hypertrophy. Across
multiple datasets, the model achieves a 99% F1-score for Normal vs. Abnormal
classification and shows state-of-the-art performance in multi-class disease
detection, including a 99% F1-score for Conduction Disorders and Hypertrophy,
as well as a 98.9% F1-score for Arrhythmias. Additionally, the model provides
risk level estimations to facilitate clinical decision-making. In conclusion,
FoundationalECGNet represents a scalable, interpretable, and generalizable
solution for automated ECG analysis, with the potential to improve diagnostic
precision and patient outcomes in healthcare settings. We'll share the code

Motivation: 解决传统XAI框架面临的两个实际问题：特征子集枚举的指数级计算成本和将效应总结为单一标量值的表达力限制。

Method: 基于RKHS的正交函数分解框架，通过递归核中心化程序的分析投影方案计算功能组件f_S(x_S)，避免显式子集枚举。

Result: 在10个数据集上实现中位数约3倍的加速（0.6-9.7倍范围），保持高保真度（R² 0.81-0.999）和显著的排序一致性。

Conclusion: STRIDE通过提供结构化功能视角补充标量归因方法，支持新颖诊断如'组件手术'来量化特定交互的影响。

Abstract: Most explainable AI (XAI) frameworks face two practical limitations: the
exponential cost of reasoning over feature subsets and the reduced
expressiveness of summarizing effects as single scalar values. We present
STRIDE, a scalable framework that aims to mitigate both issues by framing
explanation as a subset-enumeration-free, orthogonal functional decomposition
in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). Rather than focusing only on
scalar attributions, STRIDE computes functional components f_S(x_S) via an
analytical projection scheme based on a recursive kernel-centering procedure,
avoiding explicit subset enumeration. In the tabular setups we study, the
approach is model-agnostic, provides both local and global views, and is
supported by theoretical results on orthogonality and L^2 convergence under
stated assumptions. On public tabular benchmarks in our environment, we
observed speedups ranging from 0.6 times (slower than TreeSHAP on a small
dataset) to 9.7 times (California), with a median approximate 3.0 times across
10 datasets, while maintaining high fidelity (R^2 between 0.81 and 0.999) and
substantial rank agreement on most datasets. Overall, STRIDE complements scalar
attribution methods by offering a structured functional perspective, enabling
novel diagnostics like 'component surgery' to quantitatively measure the impact
of specific interactions within our experimental scope.

Abstract: Conventional machine learning and deep learning models typically rely on
correlation-based learning, which often fails to distinguish genuine causal
relationships from spurious associations, limiting their robustness,
interpretability, and ability to generalize. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce a causality-aware deep learning framework that integrates
Multivariate Granger Causality (MVGC) and PCMCI+ for causal feature selection
within a hybrid neural architecture. Leveraging 43 years (1979-2021) of Arctic
Sea Ice Extent (SIE) data and associated ocean-atmospheric variables at daily
and monthly resolutions, the proposed method identifies causally influential
predictors, prioritizes direct causes of SIE dynamics, reduces unnecessary
features, and enhances computational efficiency. Experimental results show that
incorporating causal inputs leads to improved prediction accuracy and
interpretability across varying lead times. While demonstrated on Arctic SIE
forecasting, the framework is broadly applicable to other dynamic,
high-dimensional domains, offering a scalable approach that advances both the
theoretical foundations and practical performance of causality-informed
predictive modeling.

Abstract: Current evaluation metrics for deep learning weather models create a
"Statistical Similarity Trap", rewarding blurry predictions while missing rare,
high-impact events. We provide quantitative evidence of this trap, showing
sophisticated baselines achieve 97.9% correlation yet 0.00 CSI for dangerous
convection detection. We introduce DART (Dual Architecture for Regression
Tasks), a framework addressing the challenge of transforming coarse atmospheric
forecasts into high-resolution satellite brightness temperature fields
optimized for extreme convection detection (below 220 K). DART employs
dual-decoder architecture with explicit background/extreme decomposition,
physically motivated oversampling, and task-specific loss functions. We present
four key findings: (1) empirical validation of the Statistical Similarity Trap
across multiple sophisticated baselines; (2) the "IVT Paradox", removing
Integrated Water Vapor Transport, widely regarded as essential for atmospheric
river analysis, improves extreme convection detection by 270%; (3)
architectural necessity demonstrated through operational flexibility (DART
achieves CSI = 0.273 with bias = 2.52 vs. 6.72 for baselines at equivalent
CSI), and (4) real-world validation with the August 2023 Chittagong flooding
disaster as a case study. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
systematically address this hybrid conversion-segmentation-downscaling task,
with no direct prior benchmarks identified in existing literature. Our
validation against diverse statistical and deep learning baselines sufficiently
demonstrates DART's specialized design. The framework enables precise
operational calibration through beta-tuning, trains in under 10 minutes on
standard hardware, and integrates seamlessly with existing meteorological
workflows, demonstrating a pathway toward trustworthy AI for extreme weather

Conclusion: 该框架为关系数据库上的机器学习模型提供了有效的解释方法，特别是在异构图神经网络场景下，能够生成既实用又高效的全局解释。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been significant progress in the development of
deep learning models over relational databases, including architectures based
on heterogeneous graph neural networks (hetero-GNNs) and heterogeneous graph
transformers. In effect, such architectures state how the database records and
links (e.g., foreign-key references) translate into a large, complex numerical
expression, involving numerous learnable parameters. This complexity makes it
hard to explain, in human-understandable terms, how a model uses the available
data to arrive at a given prediction. We present a novel framework for
explaining machine-learning models over relational databases, where
explanations are view definitions that highlight focused parts of the database
that mostly contribute to the model's prediction. We establish such global
abductive explanations by adapting the classic notion of determinacy by Nash,
Segoufin, and Vianu (2010). In addition to tuning the tradeoff between
determinacy and conciseness, the framework allows controlling the level of
granularity by adopting different fragments of view definitions, such as ones
highlighting whole columns, foreign keys between tables, relevant groups of
tuples, and so on. We investigate the realization of the framework in the case
of hetero-GNNs. We develop heuristic algorithms that avoid the exhaustive
search over the space of all databases. We propose techniques that are
model-agnostic, and others that are tailored to hetero-GNNs via the notion of
learnable masking. Our approach is evaluated through an extensive empirical
study on the RelBench collection, covering a variety of domains and different
record-level tasks. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed
explanations, as well as the efficiency of their generation.

Abstract: The Hirschfeld-Gebelein-R\'enyi (HGR) correlation coefficient is an extension
of Pearson's correlation that is not limited to linear correlations, with
potential applications in algorithmic fairness, scientific analysis, and causal
discovery. Recently, novel algorithms to estimate HGR in a differentiable
manner have been proposed to facilitate its use as a loss regularizer in
constrained machine learning applications. However, the inherent
uncomputability of HGR requires a bias-variance trade-off, which can possibly
compromise the robustness of the proposed methods, hence raising technical
concerns if applied in real-world scenarios. We introduce a novel computational
approach for HGR that relies on user-configurable polynomial kernels, offering
greater robustness compared to previous methods and featuring a faster yet
almost equally effective restriction. Our approach provides significant
advantages in terms of robustness and determinism, making it a more reliable
option for real-world applications. Moreover, we present a brief experimental
analysis to validate the applicability of our approach within a constrained
machine learning framework, showing that its computation yields an insightful
subgradient that can serve as a loss regularizer.

Conclusion: 该方法为神经网络不确定性估计提供了更直观的框架，有助于高风险应用中的决策制定

Abstract: Evaluation of per-sample uncertainty quantification from neural networks is
essential for decision-making involving high-risk applications. A common
approach is to use the predictive distribution from Bayesian or approximation
models and decompose the corresponding predictive uncertainty into epistemic
(model-related) and aleatoric (data-related) components. However, additive
decomposition has recently been questioned. In this work, we propose an
intuitive framework for uncertainty estimation and decomposition based on the
signal-to-noise ratio of class probability distributions across different model
predictions. We introduce a variance-gated measure that scales predictions by a
confidence factor derived from ensembles. We use this measure to discuss the
existence of a collapse in the diversity of committee machines.

Abstract: The performance of machine learning (ML) models critically depends on the
quality and representativeness of the training data. In applications with
multiple heterogeneous data generating sources, standard ML methods often learn
spurious correlations that perform well on average but degrade performance for
atypical or underrepresented groups. Prior work addresses this issue by
optimizing the worst-group performance. However, these approaches typically
assume that the underlying data distributions for each group can be accurately
estimated using the training data, a condition that is frequently violated in
noisy, non-stationary, and evolving environments. In this work, we propose a
novel framework that relies on Wasserstein-based distributionally robust
optimization (DRO) to account for the distributional uncertainty within each
group, while simultaneously preserving the objective of improving the
worst-group performance. We develop a gradient descent-ascent algorithm to
solve the proposed DRO problem and provide convergence results. Finally, we
validate the effectiveness of our method on real-world data.

Abstract: We analyze numerical properties of Layer-wise relevance propagation
(LRP)-type attribution methods by representing them as a product of modified
gradient matrices. This representation creates an analogy to matrix
multiplications of Jacobi-matrices which arise from the chain rule of
differentiation. In order to shed light on the distribution of attribution
values, we derive upper bounds for singular values. Furthermore we derive
component-wise bounds for attribution map values. As a main result, we apply
these component-wise bounds to obtain multiplicative constants. These constants
govern the convergence of empirical means of attributions to expectations of
attribution maps. This finding has important implications for scenarios where
multiple non-geometric data augmentations are applied to individual test
samples, as well as for Smoothgrad-type attribution methods. In particular, our
analysis reveals that the constants for LRP-beta remain independent of weight
norms, a significant distinction from both gradient-based methods and
LRP-epsilon.

Abstract: Training large-scale machine learning models incurs substantial carbon
emissions. Federated Learning (FL), by distributing computation across
geographically dispersed clients, offers a natural framework to leverage
regional and temporal variations in Carbon Intensity (CI). This paper
investigates how to reduce emissions in FL through carbon-aware client
selection and training scheduling. We first quantify the emission savings of a
carbon-aware scheduling policy that leverages slack time -- permitting a modest
extension of the training duration so that clients can defer local training
rounds to lower-carbon periods. We then examine the performance trade-offs of
such scheduling which stem from statistical heterogeneity among clients,
selection bias in participation, and temporal correlation in model updates. To
leverage these trade-offs, we construct a carbon-aware scheduler that
integrates slack time, $\alpha$-fair carbon allocation, and a global
fine-tuning phase. Experiments on real-world CI data show that our scheduler
outperforms slack-agnostic baselines, achieving higher model accuracy across a
wide range of carbon budgets, with especially strong gains under tight carbon
constraints.

Abstract: Data-driven weather models have recently achieved state-of-the-art
performance, yet progress has plateaued in recent years. This paper introduces
a Mixture of Experts (MoWE) approach as a novel paradigm to overcome these
limitations, not by creating a new forecaster, but by optimally combining the
outputs of existing models. The MoWE model is trained with significantly lower
computational resources than the individual experts. Our model employs a Vision
Transformer-based gating network that dynamically learns to weight the
contributions of multiple "expert" models at each grid point, conditioned on
forecast lead time. This approach creates a synthesized deterministic forecast
that is more accurate than any individual component in terms of Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE). Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method,
achieving up to a 10% lower RMSE than the best-performing AI weather model on a
2-day forecast horizon, significantly outperforming individual experts as well
as a simple average across experts. This work presents a computationally

Abstract: We present and evaluate Vejde; a framework which combines data abstraction,
graph neural networks and reinforcement learning to produce inductive policy
functions for decision problems with richly structured states, such as object
classes and relations. MDP states are represented as data bases of facts about
entities, and Vejde converts each state to a bipartite graph, which is mapped
to latent states through neural message passing. The factored representation of
both states and actions allows Vejde agents to handle problems of varying size
and structure. We tested Vejde agents on eight problem domains defined in RDDL,
with ten problem instances each, where policies were trained using both
supervised and reinforcement learning. To test policy generalization, we
separate problem instances in two sets, one for training and the other solely
for testing. Test results on unseen instances for the Vejde agents were
compared to MLP agents trained on each problem instance, as well as the online
planning algorithm Prost. Our results show that Vejde policies in average
generalize to the test instances without a significant loss in score.
Additionally, the inductive agents received scores on unseen test instances

Abstract: Controllable molecular graph generation is essential for material and drug
discovery, where generated molecules must satisfy diverse property constraints.
While recent advances in graph diffusion models have improved generation
quality, their effectiveness in multi-conditional settings remains limited due
to reliance on joint conditioning or continuous relaxations that compromise
fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose Composable Score-based Graph
Diffusion model (CSGD), the first model that extends score matching to discrete
graphs via concrete scores, enabling flexible and principled manipulation of
conditional guidance. Building on this foundation, we introduce two score-based
techniques: Composable Guidance (CoG), which allows fine-grained control over
arbitrary subsets of conditions during sampling, and Probability Calibration
(PC), which adjusts estimated transition probabilities to mitigate train-test
mismatches. Empirical results on four molecular datasets show that CSGD
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 15.3% average improvement in
controllability over prior methods, while maintaining high validity and
distributional fidelity. Our findings highlight the practical advantages of
score-based modeling for discrete graph generation and its capacity for
flexible, multi-property molecular design.

Result: 在不同目标函数上表现出可证明的次线性收敛率，匹配最佳可用率，实验显示在保持隐私的同时显著提高准确性

Conclusion: 动态差分隐私以隐私为代价带来更好的效用，随机投影实现更高效的模型学习

Abstract: Stochastic optimization is a pivotal enabler in modern machine learning,
producing effective models for various tasks. However, several existing works
have shown that model parameters and gradient information are susceptible to
privacy leakage. Although Differentially Private SGD (DPSGD) addresses privacy
concerns, its static noise mechanism impacts the error bounds for model
performance. Additionally, with the exponential increase in model parameters,
efficient learning of these models using stochastic optimizers has become more
challenging. To address these concerns, we introduce the Dynamically
Differentially Private Projected SGD (D2P2-SGD) optimizer. In D2P2-SGD, we
combine two important ideas: (i) dynamic differential privacy (DDP) with
automatic gradient clipping and (ii) random projection with SGD, allowing
dynamic adjustment of the tradeoff between utility and privacy of the model. It
exhibits provably sub-linear convergence rates across different objective
functions, matching the best available rate. The theoretical analysis further
suggests that DDP leads to better utility at the cost of privacy, while random
projection enables more efficient model learning. Extensive experiments across
diverse datasets show that D2P2-SGD remarkably enhances accuracy while
maintaining privacy. Our code is available here.

Abstract: Graph alignment-the problem of identifying corresponding nodes across
multiple graphs-is fundamental to numerous applications. Most existing
unsupervised methods embed node features into latent representations to enable
cross-graph comparison without ground-truth correspondences. However, these
methods suffer from two critical limitations: the degradation of node
distinctiveness due to oversmoothing in GNN-based embeddings, and the
misalignment of latent spaces across graphs caused by structural noise, feature
heterogeneity, and training instability, ultimately leading to unreliable node
correspondences. We propose a novel graph alignment framework that
simultaneously enhances node distinctiveness and enforces geometric consistency
across latent spaces. Our approach introduces a dual-pass encoder that combines
low-pass and high-pass spectral filters to generate embeddings that are both
structure-aware and highly discriminative. To address latent space
misalignment, we incorporate a geometry-aware functional map module that learns
bijective and isometric transformations between graph embeddings, ensuring
consistent geometric relationships across different representations. Extensive
experiments on graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing unsupervised alignment baselines, exhibiting superior
robustness to structural inconsistencies and challenging alignment scenarios.
Additionally, comprehensive evaluation on vision-language benchmarks using
diverse pretrained models shows that our framework effectively generalizes
beyond graph domains, enabling unsupervised alignment of vision and language
representations.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction using deep learning (DL) models has accelerated
drug and materials discovery, but the resulting DL models often lack
interpretability, hindering their adoption by chemists. This work proposes
developing molecule representations using the concept of Functional Groups (FG)
in chemistry. We introduce the Functional Group Representation (FGR) framework,
a novel approach to encoding molecules based on their fundamental chemical
substructures. Our method integrates two types of functional groups: those
curated from established chemical knowledge (FG), and those mined from a large
molecular corpus using sequential pattern mining (MFG). The resulting FGR
framework encodes molecules into a lower-dimensional latent space by leveraging
pre-training on a large dataset of unlabeled molecules. Furthermore, the
proposed framework allows the inclusion of 2D structure-based descriptors of
molecules. We demonstrate that the FGR framework achieves state-of-the-art
performance on a diverse range of 33 benchmark datasets spanning physical
chemistry, biophysics, quantum mechanics, biological activity, and
pharmacokinetics while enabling chemical interpretability. Crucially, the
model's representations are intrinsically aligned with established chemical
principles, allowing chemists to directly link predicted properties to specific
functional groups and facilitating novel insights into structure-property
relationships. Our work presents a significant step toward developing
high-performing, chemically interpretable DL models for molecular discovery.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in generative machine learning, powered by massive
computational resources, have demonstrated unprecedented human-like
capabilities. While beyond-classical quantum experiments can generate samples
from classically intractable distributions, their complexity has thwarted all
efforts toward efficient learning. This challenge has hindered demonstrations
of generative quantum advantage: the ability of quantum computers to learn and
generate desired outputs substantially better than classical computers. We
resolve this challenge by introducing families of generative quantum models
that are hard to simulate classically, are efficiently trainable, exhibit no
barren plateaus or proliferating local minima, and can learn to generate
distributions beyond the reach of classical computers. Using a $68$-qubit
superconducting quantum processor, we demonstrate these capabilities in two
scenarios: learning classically intractable probability distributions and
learning quantum circuits for accelerated physical simulation. Our results
establish that both learning and sampling can be performed efficiently in the
beyond-classical regime, opening new possibilities for quantum-enhanced
generative models with provable advantage.

Motivation: 现有基于给定数据的方差敏感性分析方法在处理具有极大量输入（如神经网络参数）的模型时存在内存限制，无法同时存储所有输入-输出评估数据，且对非标准输入分布支持不足。

Conclusion: 该方法扩展使得方差敏感性分析能够高效应用于大型神经网络模型，解决了内存限制和非标准分布问题。

Abstract: Given-data methods for variance-based sensitivity analysis have significantly
advanced the feasibility of Sobol' index computation for computationally
expensive models and models with many inputs. However, the limitations of
existing methods still preclude their application to models with an extremely
large number of inputs. In this work, we present practical extensions to the
existing given-data Sobol' index method, which allow variance-based sensitivity
analysis to be efficiently performed on large models such as neural networks,
which have $>10^4$ parameterizable inputs. For models of this size, holding all
input-output evaluations simultaneously in memory -- as required by existing
methods -- can quickly become impractical. These extensions also support
nonstandard input distributions with many repeated values, which are not
amenable to equiprobable partitions employed by existing given-data methods.
  Our extensions include a general definition of the given-data Sobol' index
estimator with arbitrary partition, a streaming algorithm to process
input-output samples in batches, and a heuristic to filter out small indices
that are indistinguishable from zero indices due to statistical noise. We show
that the equiprobable partition employed in existing given-data methods can
introduce significant bias into Sobol' index estimates even at large sample
sizes and provide numerical analyses that demonstrate why this can occur. We
also show that our streaming algorithm can achieve comparable accuracy and
runtimes with lower memory requirements, relative to current methods which
process all samples at once. We demonstrate our novel developments on two
application problems in neural network modeling.

Abstract: We propose REpresentation-Aware Distributionally Robust Estimation (READ), a
novel framework for Wasserstein distributionally robust learning that accounts
for predictive representations when guarding against distributional shifts.
Unlike classical approaches that treat all feature perturbations equally, READ
embeds a multidimensional alignment parameter into the transport cost, allowing
the model to differentially discourage perturbations along directions
associated with informative representations. This yields robustness to feature
variation while preserving invariant structure. Our first contribution is a
theoretical foundation: we show that seminorm regularizations for linear
regression and binary classification arise as Wasserstein distributionally
robust objectives, thereby providing tractable reformulations of READ and
unifying a broad class of regularized estimators under the DRO lens. Second, we
adopt a principled procedure for selecting the Wasserstein radius using the
techniques of robust Wasserstein profile inference. This further enables the
construction of valid, representation-aware confidence regions for model
parameters with distinct geometric features. Finally, we analyze the geometry
of READ estimators as the alignment parameters vary and propose an optimization
algorithm to estimate the projection of the global optimum onto this solution
surface. This procedure selects among equally robust estimators while optimally
constructing a representation structure. We conclude by demonstrating the
effectiveness of our framework through extensive simulations and a real-world
study, providing a powerful robust estimation grounded in learning
representation.

Conclusion: FSQ为神经音频编解码提供了有前景的替代方案，其内置冗余特性使其特别适合需要噪声鲁棒性的实际应用场景。

Abstract: Neural Audio Codecs (NACs) have become increasingly adopted in speech
processing tasks due to their excellent rate-distortion performance and
compatibility with Large Language Models (LLMs) as discrete feature
representations for audio generation. While most existing codecs rely on
Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ), Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) has
recently emerged as a compelling alternative that simplifies training and
natively supports single codebooks. We introduce NeuCodec, an FSQ-based NAC,
and show that FSQ encodes baked-in redundancy which produces an encoding which
is robust when transmitted through noisy channels. First, through an encoder
distillation experiment, we show that two different encoders can learn to
encode identical audio into vastly different code sequences whilst maintaining
comparable reconstruction quality with the same quantizer and decoder. Second,
we demonstrate that FSQ has vastly superior bit-level perturbation robustness
by comparing the performance of RVQ and FSQ codecs when simulating the
transmission of code sequences through a noisy channel.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) emerged as a widely studied paradigm for distributed

the clients' data do not follow an IID distribution, while other defense
mechanisms fail, ProDiGy maintains strong defense capabilities and model
accuracy. These findings highlight the effectiveness of a dual perspective
approach that promotes natural similarity among honest clients while detecting
suspicious uniformity as a potential indicator of an attack.

Conclusion: 该工作为矩阵在线学习提供了理论突破，实现了"免费"的性能提升，在量子学习理论中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: The Matrix Multiplicative Weight Update (MMWU) is a seminal online learning
algorithm with numerous applications. Applied to the matrix version of the
Learning from Expert Advice (LEA) problem on the $d$-dimensional spectraplex,
it is well known that MMWU achieves the minimax-optimal regret bound of
$O(\sqrt{T\log d})$, where $T$ is the time horizon. In this paper, we present
an improved algorithm achieving the instance-optimal regret bound of
$O(\sqrt{T\cdot S(X||d^{-1}I_d)})$, where $X$ is the comparator in the regret,
$I_d$ is the identity matrix, and $S(\cdot||\cdot)$ denotes the quantum
relative entropy. Furthermore, our algorithm has the same computational
complexity as MMWU, indicating that the improvement in the regret bound is
``free''.
  Technically, we first develop a general potential-based framework for matrix
LEA, with MMWU being its special case induced by the standard exponential
potential. Then, the crux of our analysis is a new ``one-sided'' Jensen's trace
inequality built on a Laplace transform technique, which allows the application
of general potential functions beyond exponential to matrix LEA. Our algorithm
is finally induced by an optimal potential function from the vector LEA
problem, based on the imaginary error function.
  Complementing the above, we provide a memory lower bound for matrix LEA, and
explore the applications of our algorithm in quantum learning theory. We show
that it outperforms the state of the art for learning quantum states corrupted
by depolarization noise, random quantum states, and Gibbs states. In addition,
applying our algorithm to linearized convex losses enables predicting nonlinear
quantum properties, such as purity, quantum virtual cooling, and R\'{e}nyi-$2$
correlation.

observables. The foliation of the balanced manifold in the parameter space by
group orbits is used to define and compute a Boltzmann entropy. We also show
that the Riemannian geometry on the space of observables defined in [2] is
obtained by Riemannian submersion of the balanced manifold. The main technical
step is an explicit construction of an orthonormal basis for the tangent space
of the balanced manifold using the theory of Jacobi matrices.

Abstract: Zero-shot Voice Cloning (VC) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) methods have advanced

raising serious concerns about their misuse. While numerous detectors have been

introduce HISPASpoof, the first large-scale Spanish dataset designed for
synthetic speech detection and attribution. It includes real speech from public
corpora across six accents and synthetic speech generated with six zero-shot
TTS systems. We evaluate five representative methods, showing that detectors
trained on English fail to generalize to Spanish, while training on HISPASpoof
substantially improves detection. We also evaluate synthetic speech attribution
performance on HISPASpoof, i.e., identifying the generation method of synthetic
speech. HISPASpoof thus provides a critical benchmark for advancing reliable

Conclusion: MMT-FD框架在少样本条件下表现出强大的泛化能力，适用于各种机械设备的故障诊断

Abstract: The intelligent fault diagnosis of rotating mechanical equipment usually
requires a large amount of labeled sample data. However, in practical
industrial applications, acquiring enough data is both challenging and
expensive in terms of time and cost. Moreover, different types of rotating
mechanical equipment with different unique mechanical properties, require
separate training of diagnostic models for each case. To address the challenges
of limited fault samples and the lack of generalizability in prediction models
for practical engineering applications, we propose a Multi-Attention Meta
Transformer method for few-shot unsupervised rotating machinery fault diagnosis
(MMT-FD). This framework extracts potential fault representations from
unlabeled data and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, making it
suitable for diagnosing faults across various types of mechanical equipment.
The MMT-FD framework integrates a time-frequency domain encoder and a
meta-learning generalization model. The time-frequency domain encoder predicts
status representations generated through random augmentations in the
time-frequency domain. These enhanced data are then fed into a meta-learning
network for classification and generalization training, followed by fine-tuning
using a limited amount of labeled data. The model is iteratively optimized
using a small number of contrastive learning iterations, resulting in high
efficiency. To validate the framework, we conducted experiments on a bearing
fault dataset and rotor test bench data. The results demonstrate that the
MMT-FD model achieves 99\% fault diagnosis accuracy with only 1\% of labeled
sample data, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Data-driven discovery of emergent dynamics is gaining popularity,
particularly in the context of reaction-diffusion systems. These systems are
widely studied across various fields, including neuroscience, ecology,
epidemiology, and several other subject areas that deal with emergent dynamics.
A current challenge in the discovery process relates to system identification
when there is no prior knowledge of the underlying physics. We attempt to
address this challenge by learning Soft Artificial Life (Soft ALife) models,
such as Agent-based and Cellular Automata (CA) models, from observed data for
reaction-diffusion systems. In this paper, we present findings on the
applicability of a conceptual framework, the Data-driven Rulesets for Soft
Artificial Life (DRSALife) model, to learn Soft ALife rulesets that accurately
represent emergent dynamics in a reaction-diffusion system from observed data.
This model has demonstrated promising results for Elementary CA Rule 30, Game
of Life, and Vicsek Flocking problems in recent work. To our knowledge, this is
one of the few studies that explore machine-based Soft ALife ruleset learning
and system identification for reaction-diffusion dynamics without any prior
knowledge of the underlying physics. Moreover, we provide comprehensive
findings from experiments investigating the potential effects of using noisy
and sparse observed datasets on learning emergent dynamics. Additionally, we
successfully identify the structure and parameters of the underlying partial
differential equations (PDEs) representing these dynamics. Experimental results
demonstrate that the learned models are able to predict the emergent dynamics
with good accuracy (74%) and exhibit quite robust performance when subjected to
Gaussian noise and temporal sparsity.

Abstract: While graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in learning
from graph-structured data, their reliance on local, pairwise message passing
restricts their ability to capture complex, high-order subgraph patterns.
leading to insufficient structural expressiveness. Recent efforts have
attempted to enhance structural expressiveness by integrating random walk
kernels into GNNs. However, these methods are inherently designed for
graph-level tasks, which limits their applicability to other downstream tasks
such as node classification. Moreover, their fixed kernel configurations hinder
the model's flexibility in capturing diverse subgraph structures. To address
these limitations, this paper proposes a novel Mixture of Subgraph Experts
(MoSE) framework for flexible and expressive subgraph-based representation
learning across diverse graph tasks. Specifically, MoSE extracts informative
subgraphs via anonymous walks and dynamically routes them to specialized
experts based on structural semantics, enabling the model to capture diverse
subgraph patterns with improved flexibility and interpretability. We further
provide a theoretical analysis of MoSE's expressivity within the Subgraph
Weisfeiler-Lehman (SWL) Test, proving that it is more powerful than SWL.
Extensive experiments, together with visualizations of learned subgraph
experts, demonstrate that MoSE not only outperforms competitive baselines but
also provides interpretable insights into structural patterns learned by the
model.

Motivation: 机器学习与地质统计学在土壤属性预测中各具优势但方法不同，前者依赖环境特征关系，后者利用空间结构。研究旨在结合两者优势，为精准农业中的数字土壤制图提供更强大的预测框架。

Method: 提出KpR（Kriging Prior Regression）方法，通过普通克里金法生成空间滞后特征来丰富机器学习模型的空间上下文。使用TabPFN模型在六个田间尺度数据集上评估点预测和概率预测性能。

Result: KpR与TabPFN结合相比其他空间技术（回归/残差克里金）和非空间ML算法（随机森林）表现出更可靠的 uncertainty估计和更高预测精度，平均R2提升约30%。

Conclusion: KpR与TabPFN构成了精准农业数字土壤制图中非常鲁棒和通用的建模框架，特别适用于小样本场景和近端土壤传感数据有限的情况。

Abstract: Machine learning and geostatistics are two fundamentally different frameworks
for predicting and spatially mapping soil properties. Geostatistics leverages
the spatial structure of soil properties, while machine learning captures the
relationship between available environmental features and soil properties. We
propose a hybrid framework that enriches ML with spatial context through
engineering of 'spatial lag' features from ordinary kriging. We call this
approach 'kriging prior regression' (KpR), as it follows the inverse logic of
regression kriging. To evaluate this approach, we assessed both the point and
probabilistic prediction performance of KpR, using the TabPFN model across six
fieldscale datasets from LimeSoDa. These datasets included soil organic carbon,
clay content, and pH, along with features derived from remote sensing and
in-situ proximal soil sensing. KpR with TabPFN demonstrated reliable
uncertainty estimates and more accurate predictions in comparison to several
other spatial techniques (e.g., regression/residual kriging with TabPFN), as
well as to established non-spatial machine learning algorithms (e.g., random
forest). Most notably, it significantly improved the average R2 by around 30%
compared to machine learning algorithms without spatial context. This
improvement was due to the strong prediction performance of the TabPFN
algorithm itself and the complementary spatial information provided by KpR
features. TabPFN is particularly effective for prediction tasks with small
sample sizes, common in precision agriculture, whereas KpR can compensate for
weak relationships between sensing features and soil properties when proximal
soil sensing data are limited. Hence, we conclude that KpR with TabPFN is a
very robust and versatile modelling framework for digital soil mapping in
precision agriculture.

Abstract: Solutions to the Algorithm Selection Problem (ASP) in machine learning face
the challenge of high computational costs associated with evaluating various
algorithms' performances on a given dataset. To mitigate this cost, the
meta-learning field can leverage previously executed experiments shared in
online repositories such as OpenML. OpenML provides an extensive collection of
machine learning experiments. However, an analysis of OpenML's records reveals
limitations. It lacks diversity in pipelines, specifically when exploring data
preprocessing steps/blocks, such as scaling or imputation, resulting in limited
representation. Its experiments are often focused on a few popular techniques
within each pipeline block, leading to an imbalanced sample. To overcome the
observed limitations of OpenML, we propose PIPES, a collection of experiments
involving multiple pipelines designed to represent all combinations of the
selected sets of techniques, aiming at diversity and completeness. PIPES stores
the results of experiments performed applying 9,408 pipelines to 300 datasets.
It includes detailed information on the pipeline blocks, training and testing
times, predictions, performances, and the eventual error messages. This
comprehensive collection of results allows researchers to perform analyses
across diverse and representative pipelines and datasets. PIPES also offers
potential for expansion, as additional data and experiments can be incorporated

achieve performance comparable to traditional deep learning approaches while
using significantly fewer training samples. Additionally, we compare
multi-class and binary classification models to assess whether multi-class

Our model attains 74.87% accuracy in multi-class classification with only 15
support examples per class, while binary classification achieves over 70%
accuracy across all class pairs. Class-wise analysis reveals Flu as the most
distinguishable class, and Healthy as the most challenging. Statistical tests
(paired t-test p = 0.149, Wilcoxon p = 0.125) indicate no significant
performance difference between binary and multiclass models, supporting the
viability of multi-class classification in this setting. These results
highlight the feasibility of applying few-shot learning in medical diagnostics,
particularly when large labeled datasets are unavailable.

Abstract: We present a deep learning emulator for stochastic and chaotic

underlying partial differential equations (PDEs). Our approach involves
pre-training the model on a single parameter domain, followed by fine-tuning on
a smaller, yet diverse dataset, enabling generalisation across a broad range of
parameter values. By incorporating local attention mechanisms, the network is
capable of handling varying domain sizes and resolutions. This enables
computationally efficient pre-training on smaller domains while requiring only
a small additional dataset to learn how to generalise to larger domain sizes.
We demonstrate the model's capabilities on the chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky
equation and stochastically-forced beta-plane turbulence, showcasing its
ability to capture phenomena at interpolated parameter values. The emulator
provides significant computational speed-ups over conventional numerical
integration, facilitating efficient exploration of parameter space, while a
probabilistic variant of the emulator provides uncertainty quantification,
allowing for the statistical study of rare events.

Abstract: In clinical settings, monitoring hemodynamics is crucial for managing patient

signals. While recent research has analyzed single signals such as
electrocardiography (ECG) or photoplethysmography (PPG), there has yet to be a
proposal for an approach that encompasses the complex signal analysis required
in actual clinical scenarios. In this study, we introduce the SNUPHY-M (Seoul
National University hospital PHYsiological signal Masked representation
learning) model extracts physiological features reflecting the electrical,
pressure, and fluid characteristics of the cardiac cycle in the process of
restoring three masked physiological signals based on self-supervised learning
(SSL): ECG, PPG, and arterial blood pressure (ABP) signals. By employing
multiple physical characteristics, the model can extract more enriched features
only using non-invasive signals. We evaluated the model's performance in
clinical downstream tasks such as hypotension, stroke volume, systolic blood
pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and age prediction. Our results showed that
the SNUPHY-M significantly outperformed supervised or SSL models, especially in
prediction tasks using non-invasive signals. To the best of our knowledge,
SNUPHY-M is the first model to apply multi-modal SSL to cardiovascular analysis
involving ECG, PPG, and ABP signals. This approach effectively supports
clinical decision-making and enables precise diagnostics, contributing
significantly to the early diagnosis and management of hemodynamics without

Abstract: In real-world scenarios, large graphs represent relationships among entities
in complex systems. Mining these large graphs often containing millions of
nodes and edges helps uncover structural patterns and meaningful insights.
Dividing a large graph into smaller subgraphs facilitates complex system
analysis by revealing local information. Community detection extracts clusters
or communities of graphs based on statistical methods and machine learning
models using various optimization techniques. Structure based community
detection methods are more suitable for applying to graphs because they do not
rely heavily on rich node or edge attribute information. The features derived
from these communities can improve downstream graph mining tasks, such as link
prediction and node classification. In real-world applications, we often lack
ground truth community information. Additionally, there is neither a
universally accepted gold standard for community detection nor a single method
that is consistently optimal across diverse applications. In many cases, it is
unclear how practitioners select community detection methods, and choices are
often made without explicitly considering their potential impact on downstream
tasks. In this study, we investigate whether the choice of community detection
algorithm significantly influences the performance of downstream applications.
We propose a framework capable of integrating various community detection
methods to systematically evaluate their effects on downstream task outcomes.
Our comparative analysis reveals that specific community detection algorithms

Abstract: Low-degree polynomials have emerged as a powerful paradigm for providing
evidence of statistical-computational gaps across a variety of high-dimensional
statistical models [Wein25]. For detection problems -- where the goal is to
test a planted distribution $\mathbb{P}'$ against a null distribution
$\mathbb{P}$ with independent components -- the standard approach is to bound
the advantage using an $\mathbb{L}^2(\mathbb{P})$-orthonormal family of
polynomials. However, this method breaks down for estimation tasks or more
complex testing problems where $\mathbb{P}$ has some planted structures, so
that no simple $\mathbb{L}^2(\mathbb{P})$-orthogonal polynomial family is
available. To address this challenge, several technical workarounds have been
proposed [SW22,SW25], though their implementation can be delicate. In this
work, we propose a more direct proof strategy. Focusing on random graph models,
we construct a basis of polynomials that is almost orthonormal under
$\mathbb{P}$, in precisely those regimes where statistical-computational gaps
arise. This almost orthonormal basis not only yields a direct route to
establishing low-degree lower bounds, but also allows us to explicitly identify
the polynomials that optimize the low-degree criterion. This, in turn, provides
insights into the design of optimal polynomial-time algorithms. We illustrate
the effectiveness of our approach by recovering known low-degree lower bounds,
and establishing new ones for problems such as hidden subcliques, stochastic
block models, and seriation models.

parameters, a rate that overcomes the curse of dimensionality by depending only
on the intrinsic dimension $d$. These results readily extend to functions in
H\"older-Zygmund spaces. We complement this result with a matching lower bound,
proving our construction is nearly optimal by showing the required number of
parameters matches up to a logarithmic factor. Our proof of the lower bound
introduces novel estimates for the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension and
pseudo-dimension of the network's high-order derivative classes. These
complexity bounds provide a theoretical cornerstone for learning PDEs on
manifolds involving derivatives. Our analysis reveals that the network
architecture leverages a sparse structure to efficiently exploit the manifold's
low-dimensional geometry.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is critical in domains such as cybersecurity and finance,
especially when working with large-scale tabular data. Yet, unsupervised
anomaly detection -- where no labeled anomalies are available -- remains a
significant challenge. Although various deep learning methods have been
proposed to model a dataset's joint distribution, real-world tabular data often
contain heterogeneous contexts (e.g., different users), making globally rare
events normal under certain contexts. Consequently, relying on a single global
distribution can overlook these contextual nuances, degrading detection
performance. In this paper, we present a context-conditional anomaly detection
framework tailored for tabular datasets. Our approach automatically identifies
context features and models the conditional data distribution using a simple
deep autoencoder. Extensive experiments on multiple tabular benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches,
underscoring the importance of context in accurately distinguishing anomalous
from normal instances.

Abstract: We propose a novel data-lean operator learning algorithm, the Reduced Basis
Neural Operator (ReBaNO), to solve a group of PDEs with multiple distinct
inputs. Inspired by the Reduced Basis Method and the recently introduced
Generative Pre-Trained Physics-Informed Neural Networks, ReBaNO relies on a
mathematically rigorous greedy algorithm to build its network structure offline
adaptively from the ground up. Knowledge distillation via task-specific
activation function allows ReBaNO to have a compact architecture requiring
minimal computational cost online while embedding physics. In comparison to
state-of-the-art operator learning algorithms such as PCA-Net, DeepONet, FNO,
and CNO, numerical results demonstrate that ReBaNO significantly outperforms
them in terms of eliminating/shrinking the generalization gap for both in- and
out-of-distribution tests and being the only operator learning algorithm
achieving strict discretization invariance.

Abstract: Many optimization problems in robotics involve the optimization of
time-expensive black-box functions, such as those involving complex simulations
or evaluation of real-world experiments. Furthermore, these functions are often
stochastic as repeated experiments are subject to unmeasurable disturbances.
Bayesian optimization can be used to optimize such methods in an efficient
manner by deploying a probabilistic function estimator to estimate with a given
confidence so that regions of the search space can be pruned away.
Consequently, the success of the Bayesian optimization depends on the function
estimator's ability to provide informative confidence bounds. Existing function
estimators require many function evaluations to infer the underlying confidence
or depend on modeling of the disturbances. In this paper, it is shown that the
confidence bounds provided by the Wilson Score Kernel Density Estimator
(WS-KDE) are applicable as excellent bounds to any stochastic function with an
output confined to the closed interval [0;1] regardless of the distribution of
the output. This finding opens up the use of WS-KDE for stable global
optimization on a wider range of cost functions. The properties of WS-KDE in
the context of Bayesian optimization are demonstrated in simulation and applied
to the problem of automated trap design for vibrational part feeders.

Abstract: Supervised machine learning techniques rely on labeled data to achieve high
task performance, but this requires the labels to capture some meaningful
differences in the underlying data structure. For training network intrusion
detection algorithms, most datasets contain a series of attack classes and a
single large benign class which captures all non-attack network traffic. A
review of intrusion detection papers and guides that explicitly state their
data preprocessing steps identified that the majority took the labeled
categories of the dataset at face value when training their algorithms. The
present paper evaluates the structure of benign traffic in several common
intrusion detection datasets (NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CIC-IDS 2017) and
determines whether there are meaningful sub-categories within this traffic
which may improve overall multi-classification performance using common machine
learning techniques. We present an overview of some unsupervised clustering
techniques (e.g., HDBSCAN, Mean Shift Clustering) and show how they
differentially cluster the benign traffic space.

Abstract: Spin coating polymer thin films to achieve specific mechanical properties is
inherently a multi-objective optimization problem. We present a framework that
integrates an active Pareto front learning algorithm (PyePAL) with
visualization and explainable AI techniques to optimize processing parameters.
PyePAL uses Gaussian process models to predict objective values (hardness and
elasticity) from the design variables (spin speed, dilution, and polymer
mixture), guiding the adaptive selection of samples toward promising regions of
the design space. To enable interpretable insights into the high-dimensional
design space, we utilize UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)
for two-dimensional visualization of the Pareto front exploration.
Additionally, we incorporate fuzzy linguistic summaries, which translate the
learned relationships between process parameters and performance objectives
into linguistic statements, thus enhancing the explainability and understanding
of the optimization results. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
efficiently identifies promising polymer designs, while the visual and
linguistic explanations facilitate expert-driven analysis and knowledge

Abstract: The integration of renewable and distributed energy resources reshapes modern
power systems, challenging conventional protection schemes. This scoping review
synthesizes recent literature on machine learning (ML) applications in power
system protection and disturbance management, following the PRISMA for Scoping
Reviews framework. Based on over 100 publications, three key objectives are
addressed: (i) assessing the scope of ML research in protection tasks; (ii)
evaluating ML performance across diverse operational scenarios; and (iii)
identifying methods suitable for evolving grid conditions. ML models often
demonstrate high accuracy on simulated datasets; however, their performance
under real-world conditions remains insufficiently validated. The existing
literature is fragmented, with inconsistencies in methodological rigor, dataset
quality, and evaluation metrics. This lack of standardization hampers the
comparability of results and limits the generalizability of findings. To
address these challenges, this review introduces a ML-oriented taxonomy for
protection tasks, resolves key terminological inconsistencies, and advocates
for standardized reporting practices. It further provides guidelines for
comprehensive dataset documentation, methodological transparency, and
consistent evaluation protocols, aiming to improve reproducibility and enhance
the practical relevance of research outcomes. Critical gaps remain, including
the scarcity of real-world validation, insufficient robustness testing, and
limited consideration of deployment feasibility. Future research should
prioritize public benchmark datasets, realistic validation methods, and
advanced ML architectures. These steps are essential to move ML-based
protection from theoretical promise to practical deployment in increasingly
dynamic and decentralized power systems.

Conclusion: 树基模型在对等互联预测中效果最好，ISP可采用该方法实现完全自动化的伙伴选择

Abstract: Internet service providers (ISPs) need to connect with other ISPs to provide
global connectivity services to their users. To ensure global connectivity,
ISPs can either use transit service(s) or establish direct peering
relationships between themselves via Internet exchange points (IXPs). Peering
offers more room for ISP-specific optimizations and is preferred, but it often
involves a lengthy and complex process. Automating peering partner selection
can enhance efficiency in the global Internet ecosystem. We explore the use of
publicly available data on ISPs to develop a machine learning (ML) model that
can predict whether an ISP pair should peer or not. At first, we explore public
databases, e.g., PeeringDB, CAIDA, etc., to gather data on ISPs. Then, we
evaluate the performance of three broad types of ML models for predicting
peering relationships: tree-based, neural network-based, and transformer-based.
Among these, we observe that tree-based models achieve the highest accuracy and
efficiency in our experiments. The XGBoost model trained with publicly
available data showed promising performance, with a 98% accuracy rate in
predicting peering partners. In addition, the model demonstrated great
resilience to variations in time, space, and missing data. We envision that
ISPs can adopt our method to fully automate the peering partner selection
process, thus transitioning to a more efficient and optimized Internet
ecosystem.

Conclusion: fuser算法能够有效处理微生物群落的时空动态变化，为微生物组网络推断提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Co-occurrence network inference algorithms have significantly advanced our
understanding of microbiome communities. However, these algorithms typically
analyze microbial associations within samples collected from a single
environmental niche, often capturing only static snapshots rather than dynamic
microbial processes. Previous studies have commonly grouped samples from
different environmental niches together without fully considering how microbial
communities adapt their associations when faced with varying ecological
conditions. Our study addresses this limitation by explicitly investigating
both spatial and temporal dynamics of microbial communities. We analyzed
publicly available microbiome abundance data across multiple locations and time
points, to evaluate algorithm performance in predicting microbial associations
using our proposed Same-All Cross-validation (SAC) framework. SAC evaluates
algorithms in two distinct scenarios: training and testing within the same
environmental niche (Same), and training and testing on combined data from
multiple environmental niches (All). To overcome the limitations of
conventional algorithms, we propose fuser, an algorithm that, while not
entirely new in machine learning, is novel for microbiome community network
inference. It retains subsample-specific signals while simultaneously sharing
relevant information across environments during training. Unlike standard
approaches that infer a single generalized network from combined data, fuser
generates distinct, environment-specific predictive networks. Our results
demonstrate that fuser achieves comparable predictive performance to existing
algorithms such as glmnet when evaluated within homogeneous environments
(Same), and notably reduces test error compared to baseline algorithms in
cross-environment (All) scenarios.

Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of forecasting urban water dynamics by
developing a multi-input, multi-output deep learning model that incorporates
both endogenous variables (e.g., water height or discharge) and exogenous
factors (e.g., precipitation history and forecast reports). Unlike conventional
forecasting, the proposed model, AquaCast, captures both inter-variable and
temporal dependencies across all inputs, while focusing forecast solely on
endogenous variables. Exogenous inputs are fused via an embedding layer,
eliminating the need to forecast them and enabling the model to attend to their
short-term influences more effectively. We evaluate our approach on the
LausanneCity dataset, which includes measurements from four urban drainage
sensors, and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance when using only
endogenous variables. Performance also improves with the inclusion of exogenous
variables and forecast reports. To assess generalization and scalability, we
additionally test the model on three large-scale synthesized datasets,
generated from MeteoSwiss records, the Lorenz Attractors model, and the Random
Fields model, each representing a different level of temporal complexity across
100 nodes. The results confirm that our model consistently outperforms existing
baselines and maintains a robust and accurate forecast across both real and

Abstract: The contractile motion of the heart is strongly determined by the
distribution of the fibers that constitute cardiac tissue. Strain analysis
informed with the orientation of fibers allows to describe several pathologies
that are typically associated with impaired mechanics of the myocardium, such
as cardiovascular disease. Several methods have been developed to estimate
strain-derived metrics from traditional imaging techniques. However, the
physical models underlying these methods do not include fiber mechanics,
restricting their capacity to accurately explain cardiac function. In this
work, we introduce WarpPINN-fibers, a physics-informed neural network framework
to accurately obtain cardiac motion and strains enhanced by fiber information.
We train our neural network to satisfy a hyper-elastic model and promote fiber
contraction with the goal to predict the deformation field of the heart from
cine magnetic resonance images. For this purpose, we build a loss function
composed of three terms: a data-similarity loss between the reference and the
warped template images, a regularizer enforcing near-incompressibility of
cardiac tissue and a fiber-stretch penalization that controls strain in the
direction of synthetically produced fibers. We show that our neural network
improves the former WarpPINN model and effectively controls fiber stretch in a
synthetic phantom experiment. Then, we demonstrate that WarpPINN-fibers
outperforms alternative methodologies in landmark-tracking and strain curve
prediction for a cine-MRI benchmark with a cohort of 15 healthy volunteers. We
expect that our method will enable a more precise quantification of cardiac
strains through accurate deformation fields that are consistent with fiber
physiology, without requiring imaging techniques more sophisticated than MRI.

Abstract: Full waveform inversion (FWI) is crucial for reconstructing high-resolution
subsurface models, but it is often hindered, considering the limited data, by
its null space resulting in low-resolution models, and more importantly, by its
computational cost, especially if needed for real-time applications. Recent
attempts to accelerate FWI using learned wavefield neural operators have shown
promise in efficiency and differentiability, but typically suffer from noisy
and unstable inversion performance. To address these limitations, we introduce
a novel physics-informed FWI framework to enhance the inversion in accuracy
while maintaining the efficiency of neural operator-based FWI. Instead of
relying only on the L2 norm objective function via automatic differentiation,
resulting in noisy model reconstruction, we integrate a physics constraint term
in the loss function of FWI, improving the quality of the inverted velocity
models. Specifically, starting with an initial model to simulate wavefields and
then evaluating the loss over how much the resulting wavefield obeys the
physical laws (wave equation) and matches the recorded data, we achieve a
reduction in noise and artifacts. Numerical experiments using the OpenFWI and
Overthrust models demonstrate our method's superior performance, offering
cleaner and more accurate subsurface velocity than vanilla approaches.
Considering the efficiency of the approach compared to FWI, this advancement
represents a significant step forward in the practical application of FWI for
real-time subsurface monitoring.
