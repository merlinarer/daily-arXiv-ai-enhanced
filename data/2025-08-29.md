### [1] [Can Compact Language Models Search Like Agents? Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization for Preserving Agentic RAG Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20324)
*Rikuto Kotoge,Mai Nishimura,Jiaxin Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

Relevance: 85.0

TL;DR: 提出了DGPO方法，通过教师演示的冷启动初始化和持续教师指导，解决小型语言模型在强化学习训练中奖励稀疏和不稳定的问题，使紧凑模型能够实现复杂的智能搜索行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 紧凑型语言模型（如0.5B参数）在强化学习训练中由于推理能力差而面临奖励稀疏和训练不稳定的问题，需要一种方法来使这些模型在计算资源受限的环境中实现智能RAG行为。

Method: Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization (DGPO)，包括从教师演示的冷启动初始化和在策略优化过程中的持续教师指导。还引入了Agentic RAG Capabilities (ARC)细粒度评估指标来分析推理、搜索协调和响应合成能力。

Result: DGPO使紧凑模型能够实现复杂的智能搜索行为，在某些情况下甚至超过了更大的教师模型性能。

Conclusion: DGPO使得在计算资源受限的环境中实现智能RAG成为可能，为小型语言模型的强化学习应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a post-training approach to elicit
agentic RAG behaviors such as search and planning from language models.
However, compact language models (e.g., 0.5B parameters) struggle due to poor
reasoning ability, resulting in sparse rewards and unstable training. To
overcome these difficulties, we propose Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization
(DGPO), which addresses the challenges through cold-start initialization from
teacher demonstrations and continuous teacher guidance during policy
optimization. To systematically evaluate our approach, we introduce Agentic RAG
Capabilities (ARC), a fine-grained metric analyzing reasoning, search
coordination, and response synthesis. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that DGPO enables compact models to achieve sophisticated agentic search
behaviors, even outperforming the larger teacher model in some cases. DGPO
makes agentic RAG feasible in computing resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: GUARD是一个将政府AI伦理指南转化为可操作测试问题的框架，通过自动生成违反指南的问题来评估LLM合规性，并引入越狱诊断来测试安全机制绕过漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决政府AI伦理指南过于高层级而缺乏具体测试方法的问题，需要将指南转化为可操作的测试问题来验证LLM的合规性和安全性。

Method: 1) 基于政府指南自动生成违反指南的测试问题 2) 集成越狱诊断(GUARD-JD)创建场景诱发不道德响应 3) 生成合规性报告

Result: 在7个LLM(Vicuna-13B、LongChat-7B等)上验证有效性，测试了三个政府指南的合规性，并能将越狱诊断扩展到视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: GUARD提供了将高层指南转化为具体测试的有效方法，能够系统评估LLM的合规性和安全机制 robustness。

Abstract: As Large Language Models become increasingly integral to various domains,
their potential to generate harmful responses has prompted significant societal
and regulatory concerns. In response, governments have issued ethics guidelines
to promote the development of trustworthy AI. However, these guidelines are
typically high-level demands for developers and testers, leaving a gap in
translating them into actionable testing questions to verify LLM compliance.
  To address this challenge, we introduce GUARD (\textbf{G}uideline
\textbf{U}pholding Test through \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{R}ole-play and
Jailbreak \textbf{D}iagnostics), a testing method designed to operationalize
guidelines into specific guideline-violating questions that assess LLM
adherence. To implement this, GUARD uses automated generation of
guideline-violating questions based on government-issued guidelines, thereby
testing whether responses comply with these guidelines. When responses directly
violate guidelines, GUARD reports inconsistencies. Furthermore, for responses
that do not directly violate guidelines, GUARD integrates the concept of
``jailbreaks'' to diagnostics, named GUARD-JD, which creates scenarios that
provoke unethical or guideline-violating responses, effectively identifying
potential scenarios that could bypass built-in safety mechanisms. Our method
finally culminates in a compliance report, delineating the extent of adherence
and highlighting any violations.
  We have empirically validated the effectiveness of GUARD on seven LLMs,
including Vicuna-13B, LongChat-7B, Llama2-7B, Llama-3-8B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4,
GPT-4o, and Claude-3.7, by testing compliance under three government-issued
guidelines and conducting jailbreak diagnostics. Additionally, GUARD-JD can
transfer jailbreak diagnostics to vision-language models, demonstrating its
usage in promoting reliable LLM-based applications.

TL;DR: JERR框架通过图推理增强LLM的长文本理解能力，包含摘要提取、图构建和关系推理三个核心组件，在ROUGE和F1指标上优于所有基线方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在长上下文处理中的内存限制、复杂任务处理困难、缺乏透明度和产生幻觉等问题

Method: 集成三个关键组件：1）策略性分块提取摘要；2）构建有向无环图消除冗余；3）使用蒙特卡洛树搜索进行复杂推理路径导航

Result: 在ROUGE和F1指标上一致优于所有基线方法，在LLM-Rater评估中获得最高分数

Conclusion: JERR为LLM处理扩展上下文和复杂推理任务提供了新颖解决方案，提高了可靠性和透明度

Abstract: Despite significant progress, large language models (LLMs) still struggle
with long contexts due to memory limitations and their inability to tackle
complex and long-context tasks. Additionally, LLMs often suffer from a lack of
transparency and are prone to producing hallucinations. To address these
challenges, we propose \textbf{JERR}, a novel framework designed to enhance
long-context comprehension via graph-based reasoning in LLMs. JERR integrates
three key components: synopsis extraction, graph construction, and relational
reasoning. First, synopsis is extracted by chunking text strategically,
allowing the model to summarize and understand information more efficiently.
Second, we build a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to resolve redundancy, ensuring
logical consistency and clarity. Finally, we incorporate Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to help the model navigate complex reasoning paths, ensuring more
accurate and interpretable outputs. This framework provides a novel solution
that enables LLMs to handle extended contexts and complex reasoning tasks with
improved reliability and transparency. Experimental results show that JERR
consistently outperforms all baselines on the ROUGE and F1 metrics, achieving
the highest scores on the LLM-Rater evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型的长链推理能力主要依赖昂贵的人工标注数据集进行后训练，缺乏可扩展的替代方案。NP难图问题天然需要深度推理、广泛探索和反思策略，是理想的长链推理训练资源

Method: 两阶段后训练框架：1）在拒绝采样的NP难图问题上进行长链推理监督微调（SFT）；2）使用细粒度奖励设计的强化学习（RL）来提升推理效率

Result: 旗舰模型Graph-R1-7B在数学、编程、STEM和逻辑推理任务上表现出强大的泛化能力，在NP难图问题上超越了QwQ-32B模型的准确性和推理效率

Conclusion: NP难图问题是大语言模型长链推理能力训练的有效且可扩展资源，为LLM后训练开辟了新方向

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (RLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
progress on complex reasoning tasks, largely enabled by their long
chain-of-thought (Long CoT) capabilities. However, developing these Long CoT
behaviors relies heavily on post-training with high-quality datasets, which are
typically costly and human-curated (e.g., mathematics and code), leaving
scalable alternatives unexplored. In this work, we introduce NP-hard (NPH)
graph problems as a novel synthetic training corpus, as they inherently require
deep reasoning, extensive exploration, and reflective strategies, which are
core characteristics of Long CoT reasoning. Building on this insight, we
develop a two-stage post-training framework: (i) Long CoT Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) on rejection-sampled NPH graph instances, which substantially
enhances reasoning depth, and (ii) Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a
fine-grained reward design, which sharpens reasoning efficiency. Our flagship
model, Graph-R1-7B, demonstrates strong generalization across mathematics,
coding, STEM, and logic, and surpasses QwQ-32B on NPH graph problems in both
accuracy and reasoning efficiency. These results position NPH graph problems as
an effective and scalable resource for advancing Long CoT reasoning in LLMs,
opening a new frontier for LLM post-training. Our implementation is available

### [5] [CAPE: Context-Aware Personality Evaluation Framework for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20385)

Main category: cs.CL

Relevance: 85.0

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个上下文感知的人格评估框架CAPE，通过引入对话历史来评估LLM的行为特质，发现上下文能提高响应一致性但也会导致人格偏移，不同模型对上下文敏感度不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM心理测量研究采用无上下文方法，忽略了真实应用中对话历史对响应的影响，需要开发上下文感知的评估框架来更准确地评估LLM行为特质。

Method: 提出CAPE框架，引入先前的对话交互作为上下文，设计新指标量化LLM响应一致性，在7个LLM上进行实验分析上下文对人格评估的影响。

Result: 对话历史通过上下文学习增强响应一致性，但会导致人格偏移（GPT-3.5-Turbo和GPT-4-Turbo偏移最大）；GPT模型对问题顺序稳健，而Gemini-1.5-Flash和Llama-8B敏感；GPT响应源于内在人格特质和先前交互，其他模型更依赖先前交互；在角色扮演代理中上下文依赖的人格偏移提高一致性并与人类判断更好对齐。

Conclusion: 上下文在LLM人格评估中起关键作用，CAPE框架提供了更真实的评估方法，揭示了不同模型对上下文的依赖程度和人格稳定性差异。

Abstract: Psychometric tests, traditionally used to assess humans, are now being
applied to Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate their behavioral traits.
However, existing studies follow a context-free approach, answering each
question in isolation to avoid contextual influence. We term this the Disney
World test, an artificial setting that ignores real-world applications, where
conversational history shapes responses. To bridge this gap, we propose the
first Context-Aware Personality Evaluation (CAPE) framework for LLMs,
incorporating prior conversational interactions. To thoroughly analyze the
influence of context, we introduce novel metrics to quantify the consistency of
LLM responses, a fundamental trait in human behavior.
  Our exhaustive experiments on 7 LLMs reveal that conversational history
enhances response consistency via in-context learning but also induces
personality shifts, with GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4-Turbo exhibiting extreme
deviations. While GPT models are robust to question ordering, Gemini-1.5-Flash
and Llama-8B display significant sensitivity. Moreover, GPT models response
stem from their intrinsic personality traits as well as prior interactions,
whereas Gemini-1.5-Flash and Llama--8B heavily depend on prior interactions.
Finally, applying our framework to Role Playing Agents (RPAs) shows
context-dependent personality shifts improve response consistency and better
align with human judgments. Our code and datasets are publicly available at:

### [6] [Measuring Reasoning Utility in LLMs via Conditional Entropy Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20395)
*Xu Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

Relevance: 85.0

TL;DR: 该论文研究了LLM推理过程中条件熵的变化模式与答案正确性的关系，发现熵值递减与正确答案强相关，而错误推理路径往往更长但效果不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM通过生成中间推理步骤来提高准确性，但缺乏对推理步骤效用性的系统研究。由于自回归生成的随机性，更多上下文并不保证答案置信度提升，需要预测推理步骤的有效性以实现早期停止或修剪无效步骤。

Method: 在MATH数据集上进行oracle研究，使用Qwen2.5-32B和GPT-4o生成推理链，然后用Qwen3-8B量化推理链对最终准确性的效用。通过条件熵（词汇表上的期望负对数似然）测量模型在每个推理步骤中对答案跨度Y的不确定性。

Result: 发现清晰模式：条件熵随步骤递减与正确答案强相关，而平坦或递增的熵往往导致错误答案。错误推理路径通常比正确路径更长，表明更长的推理不一定产生更好结果。

Conclusion: 这些发现为设计高效推理管道提供了基础，可早期检测和避免无效推理，提高LLM推理效率。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) often rely on generating
intermediate reasoning steps to enhance accuracy. However, little work has
examined how reasoning utility contributes to the final answer's correctness.
Due to the stochastic nature of autoregressive generation, generating more
context does not guarantee increased confidence in the answer. If we could
predict, during generation, whether a reasoning step will be useful, we could
stop early or prune ineffective steps, avoiding distractions in the final
decision.
  We present an oracle study on MATH dataset, using Qwen2.5-32B and GPT-4o to
generate reasoning chains, and then employing a separate model (Qwen3-8B) to
quantify the utility of these chains for final accuracy. Specifically, we
measure the model's uncertainty on the answer span Y at each reasoning step
using conditional entropy (expected negative log-likelihood over the
vocabulary) with context expanding step by step. Our results show a clear
pattern: conditional entropy that decreases over steps is strongly associated
with correct answers, whereas flat or increasing entropy often results in wrong
answers. We also corroborate that incorrect reasoning paths tend to be longer
than correct ones, suggesting that longer reasoning does not necessarily yield
better outcomes. These findings serve as a foundation to inspire future work on
designing efficient reasoning pipelines that detect and avoid unproductive
reasoning early.

Abstract: We introduce MCP-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating large language models
(LLMs) on realistic, multi-step tasks that demand tool use, cross-tool
coordination, precise parameter control, and planning/reasoning for solving
tasks. Built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), MCP-Bench connects LLMs to 28
representative live MCP servers spanning 250 tools across domains such as
finance, traveling, scientific computing, and academic search. Unlike prior
API-based benchmarks, each MCP server provides a set of complementary tools
designed to work together, enabling the construction of authentic, multi-step
tasks with rich input-output coupling. Tasks in MCP-Bench test agents' ability
to retrieve relevant tools from fuzzy instructions without explicit tool names,
plan multi-hop execution trajectories for complex objectives, ground responses
in intermediate tool outputs, and orchestrate cross-domain workflows -
capabilities not adequately evaluated by existing benchmarks that rely on
explicit tool specifications, shallow few-step workflows, and isolated domain
operations. We propose a multi-faceted evaluation framework covering tool-level
schema understanding and usage, trajectory-level planning, and task completion.
Experiments on 20 advanced LLMs reveal persistent challenges in MCP-Bench. Code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数学推理模型主要依赖长链思维(CoT)，缺乏自主探索、验证和优化中间步骤的认知能力。需要开发高效的智能体强化学习方法，在有限计算资源下实现高级推理能力。

Method: 采用三阶段训练方法：1）非推理SFT预训练；2）多阶段RL训练；3）GRPO-RoC算法处理代码环境噪声；4）高效RL基础设施支持高吞吐量代码执行。

Result: 仅用510步RL训练和64个MI300X GPU一周时间，在AIME24上达到80.6% pass@1，AIME25上69.8%，超越DeepSeek-R1(671B)，响应更短。在科学推理和工具使用任务上也表现优异。

Conclusion: 证明了智能体强化学习可以有效提升模型推理能力，在有限计算资源下实现前沿性能，为高效LLM训练提供了新范式。

Abstract: We introduce rStar2-Agent, a 14B math reasoning model trained with agentic
reinforcement learning to achieve frontier-level performance. Beyond current
long CoT, the model demonstrates advanced cognitive behaviors, such as thinking
carefully before using Python coding tools and reflecting on code execution
feedback to autonomously explore, verify, and refine intermediate steps in
complex problem-solving. This capability is enabled through three key
innovations that makes agentic RL effective at scale: (i) an efficient RL
infrastructure with a reliable Python code environment that supports
high-throughput execution and mitigates the high rollout costs, enabling
training on limited GPU resources (64 MI300X GPUs); (ii) GRPO-RoC, an agentic
RL algorithm with a Resample-on-Correct rollout strategy that addresses the
inherent environment noises from coding tools, allowing the model to reason
more effectively in a code environment; (iii) An efficient agent training
recipe that starts with non-reasoning SFT and progresses through multi-RL
stages, yielding advanced cognitive abilities with minimal compute cost. To
this end, rStar2-Agent boosts a pre-trained 14B model to state of the art in
only 510 RL steps within one week, achieving average pass@1 scores of 80.6% on
AIME24 and 69.8% on AIME25, surpassing DeepSeek-R1 (671B) with significantly
shorter responses. Beyond mathematics, rStar2-Agent-14B also demonstrates
strong generalization to alignment, scientific reasoning, and agentic tool-use
tasks. Code and training recipes are available at

Result: 实验结果显示GUARD在文本多样性和连贯性之间取得良好平衡，生成速度显著提升，人类和LLM评估者均验证其优异性能

Conclusion: GUARD为开放文本生成提供了一种高效的自适应解码方案，有效解决了现有方法的局限性

Abstract: Open-ended text generation faces a critical challenge: balancing coherence
with diversity in LLM outputs. While contrastive search-based decoding
strategies have emerged to address this trade-off, their practical utility is
often limited by hyperparameter dependence and high computational costs. We
introduce GUARD, a self-adaptive decoding method that effectively balances
these competing objectives through a novel "Glocal" uncertainty-driven
framework. GUARD combines global entropy estimates with local entropy
deviations to integrate both long-term and short-term uncertainty signals. We
demonstrate that our proposed global entropy formulation effectively mitigates
abrupt variations in uncertainty, such as sudden overconfidence or high entropy
spikes, and provides theoretical guarantees of unbiasedness and consistency. To
reduce computational overhead, we incorporate a simple yet effective
token-count-based penalty into GUARD. Experimental results demonstrate that
GUARD achieves a good balance between text diversity and coherence, while
exhibiting substantial improvements in generation speed. In a more nuanced
comparison study across different dimensions of text quality, both human and
LLM evaluators validated its remarkable performance. Our code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM安全对齐机制可以通过消除特定表示方向来绕过，需要一种能够增强而非削弱安全机制的方法。

Method: Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI)，一种无需微调的秩一权重修改方法，应用于所有残差流写入矩阵，通过少量有害和无害指令对计算安全方向。

Result: ROSI持续提高了安全拒绝率（通过Llama Guard 3评估），同时在MMLU、HellaSwag和Arc等标准基准测试中保持了模型实用性，还能重新对齐'未审查'模型。

Conclusion: 有针对性的、可解释的权重引导是改善LLM安全性的廉价而有效的机制，是对资源密集型微调范式的补充。

Abstract: Safety alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) often involves mediating
internal representations to refuse harmful requests. Recent research has
demonstrated that these safety mechanisms can be bypassed by ablating or
removing specific representational directions within the model. In this paper,
we propose the opposite approach: Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI), a white-box
method that amplifies a model's safety alignment by permanently steering its
activations toward the refusal-mediating subspace. ROSI operates as a simple,
fine-tuning-free rank-one weight modification applied to all residual stream
write matrices. The required safety direction can be computed from a small set
of harmful and harmless instruction pairs. We show that ROSI consistently
increases safety refusal rates - as evaluated by Llama Guard 3 - while
preserving the utility of the model on standard benchmarks such as MMLU,
HellaSwag, and Arc. Furthermore, we show that ROSI can also re-align
'uncensored' models by amplifying their own latent safety directions,
demonstrating its utility as an effective last-mile safety procedure. Our
results suggest that targeted, interpretable weight steering is a cheap and
potent mechanism to improve LLM safety, complementing more resource-intensive
fine-tuning paradigms.

Conclusion: GDLLM框架通过有效捕获全局特征，显著增强了少数关系类的性能并提高了整体学习能力

Abstract: In Natural Language Processing(NLP), Event Temporal Relation Extraction
(ETRE) is to recognize the temporal relations of two events. Prior studies have
noted the importance of language models for ETRE. However, the restricted
pre-trained knowledge of Small Language Models(SLMs) limits their capability to
handle minority class relations in imbalanced classification datasets. For
Large Language Models(LLMs), researchers adopt manually designed prompts or
instructions, which may introduce extra noise, leading to interference with the
model's judgment of the long-distance dependencies between events. To address
these issues, we propose GDLLM, a Global Distance-aware modeling approach based
on LLMs. We first present a distance-aware graph structure utilizing Graph
Attention Network(GAT) to assist the LLMs in capturing long-distance dependency
features. Additionally, we design a temporal feature learning paradigm based on
soft inference to augment the identification of relations with a short-distance
proximity band, which supplements the probabilistic information generated by
LLMs into the multi-head attention mechanism. Since the global feature can be
captured effectively, our framework substantially enhances the performance of
minority relation classes and improves the overall learning ability.
Experiments on two publicly available datasets, TB-Dense and MATRES,
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning and planning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) have enabled their potential as autonomous agents capable of tool
use in dynamic environments. However, in multi-turn conversational environments
like $\tau$-bench, these agents often struggle with consistent reasoning,
adherence to domain-specific policies, and extracting correct information over
a long horizon of tool-calls and conversation. To capture and mitigate these
failures, we conduct a comprehensive manual analysis of the common errors
occurring in the conversation trajectories. We then experiment with
reformulations of inputs to the tool-calling agent for improvement in agent
decision making. Finally, we propose the Input-Reformulation Multi-Agent (IRMA)
framework, which automatically reformulates user queries augmented with
relevant domain rules and tool suggestions for the tool-calling agent to focus
on. The results show that IRMA significantly outperforms ReAct, Function
Calling, and Self-Reflection by 16.1%, 12.7%, and 19.1%, respectively, in
overall pass^5 scores. These findings highlight the superior reliability and
consistency of IRMA compared to other methods in dynamic environments.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has become a powerful paradigm that enables LLMs to
perform a wide range of tasks without task-specific fine-tuning. However, the
effectiveness of ICL heavily depends on the quality of exemplar selection. In
particular, for structured prediction tasks such as semantic parsing, existing
ICL selection strategies often overlook structural alignment, leading to
suboptimal performance and poor generalization. To address this issue, we
propose a novel two-stage exemplar selection strategy that achieves a strong
balance between efficiency, generalizability, and performance. First, we
fine-tune a BERT-based retriever using structure-aware supervision, guiding it
to select exemplars that are both semantically relevant and structurally
aligned. Then, we enhance the retriever with a plug-in module, which amplifies
syntactically meaningful information in the hidden representations. This
plug-in is model-agnostic, requires minimal overhead, and can be seamlessly
integrated into existing pipelines. Experiments on four benchmarks spanning
three semantic parsing tasks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing baselines with multiple recent LLMs as inference-time
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主动对话研究主要集中在特定领域或任务导向场景，导致评估碎片化，限制了全面探索模型的主动对话能力。

Method: 提出ProactiveEval统一框架，将主动对话分解为目标规划和对话引导，建立跨领域评估指标，并支持自动生成多样化评估数据。

Result: DeepSeek-R1在目标规划任务上表现优异，Claude-3.7-Sonnet在对话引导任务上表现最佳。研究了推理能力对主动行为的影响。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLMs主动对话能力提供了系统评估方法，对模型未来发展具有重要指导意义。

Abstract: Proactive dialogue has emerged as a critical and challenging research problem
in advancing large language models (LLMs). Existing works predominantly focus
on domain-specific or task-oriented scenarios, which leads to fragmented
evaluations and limits the comprehensive exploration of models' proactive
conversation abilities. In this work, we propose ProactiveEval, a unified
framework designed for evaluating proactive dialogue capabilities of LLMs. This
framework decomposes proactive dialogue into target planning and dialogue
guidance, establishing evaluation metrics across various domains. Moreover, it
also enables the automatic generation of diverse and challenging evaluation
data. Based on the proposed framework, we develop 328 evaluation environments
spanning 6 distinct domains. Through experiments with 22 different types of
LLMs, we show that DeepSeek-R1 and Claude-3.7-Sonnet exhibit exceptional
performance on target planning and dialogue guidance tasks, respectively.
Finally, we investigate how reasoning capabilities influence proactive
behaviors and discuss their implications for future model development.

TL;DR: LETHE是一种通过知识稀释消除LLM后门攻击的新方法，结合内部模型融合和外部提示增强，在多个LLM上显著降低攻击成功率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门防御方法不够全面，无法应对模型编辑、多触发器和无触发器等高级攻击场景，需要开发更全面的防御机制

Method: 内部：使用轻量数据集训练干净模型并与后门模型融合，稀释后门影响；外部：在提示中加入良性相关证据，分散LLM对后门特征的注意力

Result: 在5个主流LLM的分类和生成任务上，LETHE优于8个SOTA防御基线，对高级后门攻击的攻击成功率降低达98%，同时保持模型效用

Conclusion: LETHE是高效、鲁棒且成本效益高的后门消除方法，能有效应对自适应后门攻击

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen significant advancements, achieving
superior performance in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.
However, they remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where models behave
normally for standard queries but generate harmful responses or unintended
output when specific triggers are activated. Existing backdoor defenses either
lack comprehensiveness, focusing on narrow trigger settings, detection-only
mechanisms, and limited domains, or fail to withstand advanced scenarios like
model-editing-based, multi-trigger, and triggerless attacks. In this paper, we
present LETHE, a novel method to eliminate backdoor behaviors from LLMs through
knowledge dilution using both internal and external mechanisms. Internally,
LETHE leverages a lightweight dataset to train a clean model, which is then
merged with the backdoored model to neutralize malicious behaviors by diluting
the backdoor impact within the model's parametric memory. Externally, LETHE
incorporates benign and semantically relevant evidence into the prompt to
distract LLM's attention from backdoor features. Experimental results on
classification and generation domains across 5 widely used LLMs demonstrate
that LETHE outperforms 8 state-of-the-art defense baselines against 8 backdoor
attacks. LETHE reduces the attack success rate of advanced backdoor attacks by
up to 98% while maintaining model utility. Furthermore, LETHE has proven to be
cost-efficient and robust against adaptive backdoor attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着向量嵌入在检索、推理、代码生成等任务中的广泛应用，现有研究普遍认为嵌入模型的局限性主要源于不现实的查询或可通过更大模型和更好数据解决。本文旨在验证理论限制是否会在现实简单查询中出现。

Method: 结合学习理论中的已知结果，证明嵌入维度限制了可返回的top-k文档子集数量；通过k=2的实证验证，即使使用自由参数化嵌入在测试集上直接优化；创建LIMIT数据集对模型进行压力测试。

Result: 理论分析显示嵌入维度严重制约了模型的表达能力；实证结果表明即使最优化的嵌入模型也无法处理简单的top-2检索任务；在LIMIT数据集上，最先进的嵌入模型表现失败。

Conclusion: 单向量范式下的嵌入模型存在根本性理论限制，无法处理某些简单的检索任务，需要开发新的方法体系来突破这一局限性。

Abstract: Vector embeddings have been tasked with an ever-increasing set of retrieval
tasks over the years, with a nascent rise in using them for reasoning,
instruction-following, coding, and more. These new benchmarks push embeddings
to work for any query and any notion of relevance that could be given. While
prior works have pointed out theoretical limitations of vector embeddings,
there is a common assumption that these difficulties are exclusively due to
unrealistic queries, and those that are not can be overcome with better
training data and larger models. In this work, we demonstrate that we may
encounter these theoretical limitations in realistic settings with extremely
simple queries. We connect known results in learning theory, showing that the
number of top-k subsets of documents capable of being returned as the result of
some query is limited by the dimension of the embedding. We empirically show
that this holds true even if we restrict to k=2, and directly optimize on the
test set with free parameterized embeddings. We then create a realistic dataset
called LIMIT that stress tests models based on these theoretical results, and
observe that even state-of-the-art models fail on this dataset despite the
simple nature of the task. Our work shows the limits of embedding models under
the existing single vector paradigm and calls for future research to develop
methods that can resolve this fundamental limitation.

Abstract: This study explores automatic generation (AIG) using language models to
create multiple choice questions (MCQs) for morphological assessment, aiming to
reduce the cost and inconsistency of manual test development. The study used a
two-fold approach. First, we compared a fine-tuned medium model (Gemma, 2B)
with a larger untuned one (GPT-3.5, 175B). Second, we evaluated seven
structured prompting strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot,
chain-of-thought, role-based, sequential, and combinations. Generated items
were assessed using automated metrics and expert scoring across five
dimensions. We also used GPT-4.1, trained on expert-rated samples, to simulate
human scoring at scale. Results show that structured prompting, especially
strategies combining chain-of-thought and sequential design, significantly
improved Gemma's outputs. Gemma generally produced more construct-aligned and
instructionally appropriate items than GPT-3.5's zero-shot responses, with
prompt design playing a key role in mid-size model performance. This study
demonstrates that structured prompting and efficient fine-tuning can enhance
midsized models for AIG under limited data conditions. We highlight the value
of combining automated metrics, expert judgment, and large-model simulation to
ensure alignment with assessment goals. The proposed workflow offers a
practical and scalable way to develop and validate language assessment items
for K-12.

Conclusion: 该研究为联邦学习在多领域非IID环境中的评估提供了重要基准，AdaFD框架能够有效处理语言领域多样性挑战。

Abstract: The widespread success of pre-trained language models has established a new
training paradigm, where a global PLM is fine-tuned using task-specific data
from local clients. The local data are highly different from each other and can
not capture the global distribution of the whole data in real world. To address
the challenges of non-IID data in real environments, privacy-preserving
federated distillation has been proposed and highly investigated. However,
previous experimental non-IID scenarios are primarily identified with the label
(output) diversity, without considering the diversity of language domains
(input) that is crucial in natural language processing. In this paper, we
introduce a comprehensive set of multi-domain non-IID scenarios and propose a
unified benchmarking framework that includes diverse data. The benchmark can be
used to evaluate the federated learning framework in a real environment. To
this end, we propose an Adaptive Federated Distillation (AdaFD) framework
designed to address multi-domain non-IID challenges in both homogeneous and
heterogeneous settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our models
capture the diversity of local clients and achieve better performance compared
to the existing works. The code for this paper is available at:

Abstract: Multi-hop question answering faces substantial challenges due to data
sparsity, which increases the likelihood of language models learning spurious
patterns. To address this issue, prior research has focused on diversifying
question generation through content planning and varied expression. However,
these approaches often emphasize generating simple questions and neglect the
integration of essential knowledge, such as relevant sentences within
documents. This paper introduces the Knowledge Composition Sampling (KCS), an
innovative framework designed to expand the diversity of generated multi-hop
questions by sampling varied knowledge compositions within a given context. KCS
models the knowledge composition selection as a sentence-level conditional
prediction task and utilizes a probabilistic contrastive loss to predict the
next most relevant piece of knowledge. During inference, we employ a stochastic
decoding strategy to effectively balance accuracy and diversity. Compared to
competitive baselines, our KCS improves the overall accuracy of knowledge
composition selection by 3.9%, and its application for data augmentation yields
improvements on HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihopQA datasets. Our code is available

Abstract: Large language models have significantly enhanced the capacities and
efficiency of text generation. On the one hand, they have improved the quality
of text-based steganography. On the other hand, they have also underscored the
importance of watermarking as a safeguard against malicious misuse. In this
study, we focus on tokenization inconsistency (TI) between Alice and Bob in
steganography and watermarking, where TI can undermine robustness. Our
investigation reveals that the problematic tokens responsible for TI exhibit
two key characteristics: infrequency and temporariness. Based on these
findings, we propose two tailored solutions for TI elimination: a stepwise
verification method for steganography and a post-hoc rollback method for
watermarking. Experiments show that (1) compared to traditional disambiguation
methods in steganography, directly addressing TI leads to improvements in
fluency, imperceptibility, and anti-steganalysis capacity; (2) for
watermarking, addressing TI enhances detectability and robustness against
attacks.

Abstract: Quantization is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) on
resource-constrained hardware, but its implications for multilingual tasks
remain underexplored. We conduct the first large-scale evaluation of
post-training quantization (PTQ) on machine translation across 55 languages
using five LLMs ranging from 1.7B to 70B parameters. Our analysis reveals that
while 4-bit quantization often preserves translation quality for high-resource
languages and large models, significant degradation occurs for low-resource and
typologically diverse languages, particularly in 2-bit settings. We compare
four quantization techniques (AWQ, BitsAndBytes, GGUF, and AutoRound), showing
that algorithm choice and model size jointly determine robustness. GGUF
variants provide the most consistent performance, even at 2-bit precision.
Additionally, we quantify the interactions between quantization, decoding
hyperparameters, and calibration languages, finding that language-matched
calibration offers benefits primarily in low-bit scenarios. Our findings offer
actionable insights for deploying multilingual LLMs for machine translation
under quantization constraints, especially in low-resource settings.

enhance explainability and guide model learning, achieving superior alignment
with evaluation outcomes compared to rule-based reinforcement learning methods.
Third, we introduce \textit{SpeechFeedback}, a synthetic preference dataset,

spanning 4 tasks and 16 dental subfields; and DentalCorpus, a large-scale,
high-quality corpus with 337.35 million tokens curated for dental domain
adaptation, supporting both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We evaluate 14 LLMs, covering
proprietary, open-source, and medical-specific models, and reveal significant
performance gaps across task types and languages. Further experiments with
Qwen-2.5-3B demonstrate that domain adaptation substantially improves model
performance, particularly on knowledge-intensive and terminology-focused tasks,

subgraphs to generate semantically rich query contexts. Comprising subgraph
extraction, completion, and contextual generation modules, KG-CQR operates as a
model-agnostic pipeline, ensuring scalability across LLMs of varying sizes
without additional training. Experimental results on RAGBench and MultiHop-RAG
datasets demonstrate KG-CQR's superior performance, achieving a 4-6%
improvement in mAP and a 2-3% improvement in Recall@25 over strong baseline
models. Furthermore, evaluations on challenging RAG tasks such as multi-hop

TL;DR: 本文介绍了ConspirED数据集，用于识别和分析阴谋论内容的认知特征，并评估大语言模型对阴谋论输入的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI生成的错误信息日益复杂，理解阴谋论内容的修辞模式对于开发干预措施（如针对性预辟谣）和评估AI漏洞至关重要。阴谋论侵蚀公众对科学和机构的信任，并通过吸收反证据来抵抗辟谣。

Method: 1) 创建ConspirED数据集，包含来自在线阴谋论文章的多句摘录，使用CONSPIR认知框架进行标注；2) 开发计算模型识别阴谋论特征并确定文本中的主导特征；3) 评估大语言/推理模型对阴谋论输入的鲁棒性。

Result: 研究发现大语言模型和推理模型都被阴谋论内容误导，产生的输出反映了输入的推理模式，即使在成功回避类似经过事实核查的错误信息时也是如此。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了AI系统在应对阴谋论内容时的脆弱性，为开发更有效的干预措施和提升模型鲁棒性提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Conspiracy theories erode public trust in science and institutions while
resisting debunking by evolving and absorbing counter-evidence. As AI-generated
misinformation becomes increasingly sophisticated, understanding rhetorical
patterns in conspiratorial content is important for developing interventions
such as targeted prebunking and assessing AI vulnerabilities. We introduce
ConspirED (CONSPIR Evaluation Dataset), which captures the cognitive traits of
conspiratorial ideation in multi-sentence excerpts (80--120 words) from online
conspiracy articles, annotated using the CONSPIR cognitive framework
(Lewandowsky and Cook, 2020). ConspirED is the first dataset of conspiratorial
content annotated for general cognitive traits. Using ConspirED, we (i) develop
computational models that identify conspiratorial traits and determine dominant
traits in text excerpts, and (ii) evaluate large language/reasoning model
(LLM/LRM) robustness to conspiratorial inputs. We find that both are misaligned
by conspiratorial content, producing output that mirrors input reasoning
patterns, even when successfully deflecting comparable fact-checked
misinformation.

Conclusion: SciTopic通过LLM增强的主题发现方法，能够帮助研究人员获得更深入、更快速的科学洞察

Abstract: Topic discovery in scientific literature provides valuable insights for
researchers to identify emerging trends and explore new avenues for
investigation, facilitating easier scientific information retrieval. Many
machine learning methods, particularly deep embedding techniques, have been
applied to discover research topics. However, most existing topic discovery
methods rely on word embedding to capture the semantics and lack a
comprehensive understanding of scientific publications, struggling with
complex, high-dimensional text relationships. Inspired by the exceptional
comprehension of textual information by large language models (LLMs), we
propose an advanced topic discovery method enhanced by LLMs to improve
scientific topic identification, namely SciTopic. Specifically, we first build
a textual encoder to capture the content from scientific publications,
including metadata, title, and abstract. Next, we construct a space
optimization module that integrates entropy-based sampling and triplet tasks
guided by LLMs, enhancing the focus on thematic relevance and contextual
intricacies between ambiguous instances. Then, we propose to fine-tune the
textual encoder based on the guidance from the LLMs by optimizing the
contrastive loss of the triplets, forcing the text encoder to better
discriminate instances of different topics. Finally, extensive experiments
conducted on three real-world datasets of scientific publications demonstrate
that SciTopic outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) scientific topic
discovery methods, enabling researchers to gain deeper and faster insights.

Conclusion: 生成式模型在工业级查询驱动文本摘要中具有显著优势，轻量化设计可实现高效部署

Abstract: In the dynamic landscape of large-scale web search, Query-Driven Text
Summarization (QDTS) aims to generate concise and informative summaries from
textual documents based on a given query, which is essential for improving user
engagement and facilitating rapid decision-making. Traditional extractive
summarization models, based primarily on ranking candidate summary segments,
have been the dominant approach in industrial applications. However, these
approaches suffer from two key limitations: 1) The multi-stage pipeline often
introduces cumulative information loss and architectural bottlenecks due to its
weakest component; 2) Traditional models lack sufficient semantic understanding
of both user queries and documents, particularly when dealing with complex
search intents. In this study, we propose a novel framework to pioneer the
application of generative models to address real-time QDTS in industrial web
search. Our approach integrates large model distillation, supervised
fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and lookahead decoding to
transform a lightweight model with only 0.1B parameters into a
domain-specialized QDTS expert. Evaluated on multiple industry-relevant
metrics, our model outperforms the production baseline and achieves a new state
of the art. Furthermore, it demonstrates excellent deployment efficiency,
requiring only 334 NVIDIA L20 GPUs to handle \textasciitilde50,000 queries per

Abstract: Developments in Graph-Language Models (GLMs) aim to integrate the structural
reasoning capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with the semantic
understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, we demonstrate that
current evaluation benchmarks for GLMs, which are primarily repurposed
node-level classification datasets, are insufficient to assess multimodal
reasoning. Our analysis reveals that strong performance on these benchmarks is
achievable using unimodal information alone, suggesting that they do not
necessitate graph-language integration. To address this evaluation gap, we
introduce the CLEGR(Compositional Language-Graph Reasoning) benchmark, designed
to evaluate multimodal reasoning at various complexity levels. Our benchmark
employs a synthetic graph generation pipeline paired with questions that
require joint reasoning over structure and textual semantics. We perform a
thorough evaluation of representative GLM architectures and find that
soft-prompted LLM baselines perform on par with GLMs that incorporate a full
GNN backbone. This result calls into question the architectural necessity of
incorporating graph structure into LLMs. We further show that GLMs exhibit
significant performance degradation in tasks that require structural reasoning.
These findings highlight limitations in the graph reasoning capabilities of
current GLMs and provide a foundation for advancing the community toward
explicit multimodal reasoning involving graph structure and language.

Conclusion: 通过语义分析和LLM后处理的结合，证明了在合理ε水平下实现平衡隐私化输出的可行性，强调了文本连贯性在隐私保护中的重要性

Abstract: Many works at the intersection of Differential Privacy (DP) in Natural
Language Processing aim to protect privacy by transforming texts under DP
guarantees. This can be performed in a variety of ways, from word perturbations
to full document rewriting, and most often under local DP. Here, an input text
must be made indistinguishable from any other potential text, within some bound
governed by the privacy parameter $\varepsilon$. Such a guarantee is quite
demanding, and recent works show that privatizing texts under local DP can only
be done reasonably under very high $\varepsilon$ values. Addressing this
challenge, we introduce DP-ST, which leverages semantic triples for
neighborhood-aware private document generation under local DP guarantees.
Through the evaluation of our method, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the
divide-and-conquer paradigm, particularly when limiting the DP notion (and
privacy guarantees) to that of a privatization neighborhood. When combined with
LLM post-processing, our method allows for coherent text generation even at
lower $\varepsilon$ values, while still balancing privacy and utility. These
findings highlight the importance of coherence in achieving balanced
privatization outputs at reasonable $\varepsilon$ levels.

Abstract: Implicit hate speech (IHS) is indirect language that conveys prejudice or
hatred through subtle cues, sarcasm or coded terminology. IHS is challenging to
detect as it does not include explicit derogatory or inflammatory words. To
address this challenge, task-specific pipelines can be complemented with
external knowledge or additional information such as context, emotions and
sentiment data. In this paper, we show that, by solely fine-tuning recent
general-purpose embedding models based on large language models (LLMs), such as
Stella, Jasper, NV-Embed and E5, we achieve state-of-the-art performance.
Experiments on multiple IHS datasets show up to 1.10 percentage points
improvements for in-dataset, and up to 20.35 percentage points improvements in
cross-dataset evaluation, in terms of F1-macro score.

Abstract: Synthetic therapy dialogues generated by large language models (LLMs) are
increasingly used in mental health NLP to simulate counseling scenarios, train
models, and supplement limited real-world data. However, it remains unclear
whether these synthetic conversations capture the nuanced emotional dynamics of
real therapy. In this work, we conduct the first comparative analysis of
emotional arcs between real and LLM-generated Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
dialogues. We adapt the Utterance Emotion Dynamics framework to analyze
fine-grained affective trajectories across valence, arousal, and dominance
dimensions. Our analysis spans both full dialogues and individual speaker roles
(counselor and client), using real sessions transcribed from public videos and
synthetic dialogues from the CACTUS dataset. We find that while synthetic
dialogues are fluent and structurally coherent, they diverge from real
conversations in key emotional properties: real sessions exhibit greater
emotional variability,more emotion-laden language, and more authentic patterns
of reactivity and regulation. Moreover, emotional arc similarity between real
and synthetic speakers is low, especially for clients. These findings
underscore the limitations of current LLM-generated therapy data and highlight
the importance of emotional fidelity in mental health applications. We
introduce RealCBT, a curated dataset of real CBT sessions, to support future
research in this space.

Conclusion: 多源检索与合成是RAG系统的重要挑战，需要专门的评估基准，检索质量和生成能力都至关重要，推理模型在此类任务中具有优势

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented systems are typically evaluated in settings where
information required to answer the query can be found within a single source or
the answer is short-form or factoid-based. However, many real-world
applications demand the ability to integrate and summarize information
scattered across multiple sources, where no single source is sufficient to
respond to the user's question. In such settings, the retrieval component of a
RAG pipeline must recognize a variety of relevance signals, and the generation
component must connect and synthesize information across multiple sources. We
present a scalable framework for constructing evaluation benchmarks that
challenge RAG systems to integrate information across distinct sources and
generate long-form responses. Using our framework, we build two new benchmarks
on Multi-Source Retrieval and Synthesis: MSRS-Story and MSRS-Meet, representing
narrative synthesis and summarization tasks, respectively, that require
retrieval from large collections. Our extensive experiments with various RAG
pipelines -- including sparse and dense retrievers combined with frontier LLMs
-- reveal that generation quality is highly dependent on retrieval
effectiveness, which varies greatly by task. While multi-source synthesis
proves challenging even in an oracle retrieval setting, we find that reasoning
models significantly outperform standard LLMs at this distinct step.

and comprises well-defined roles, activities, and techniques. The method was
validated through a real-world case study in an environmental testing
laboratory, where a RAG tool was implemented to answer operators queries using
data extracted from operational procedures. The system was deployed in under a
month by a team with no prior RAG experience and was later iteratively improved
based on user feedback. Results demonstrate that EASI-RAG supports fast
implementation, high user adoption, delivers accurate answers, and enhances the
reliability of underlying data. This work highlights the potential of RAG
deployment in industrial SMEs. Future works include the need for generalization

Abstract: According to the United States Internal Revenue Service, ''the average
American spends $\$270$ and 13 hours filing their taxes''. Even beyond the
U.S., tax filing requires complex reasoning, combining application of
overlapping rules with numerical calculations. Because errors can incur costly
penalties, any automated system must deliver high accuracy and auditability,
making modern large language models (LLMs) poorly suited for this task. We
propose an approach that integrates LLMs with a symbolic solver to calculate
tax obligations. We evaluate variants of this system on the challenging
StAtutory Reasoning Assessment (SARA) dataset, and include a novel method for
estimating the cost of deploying such a system based on real-world penalties
for tax errors. We further show how combining up-front translation of
plain-text rules into formal logic programs, combined with intelligently
retrieved exemplars for formal case representations, can dramatically improve
performance on this task and reduce costs to well below real-world averages.
Our results demonstrate the promise and economic feasibility of neuro-symbolic

Abstract: Recent advances in LLM watermarking methods such as SynthID-Text by Google
DeepMind offer promising solutions for tracing the provenance of AI-generated
text. However, our robustness assessment reveals that SynthID-Text is
vulnerable to meaning-preserving attacks, such as paraphrasing, copy-paste
modifications, and back-translation, which can significantly degrade watermark
detectability. To address these limitations, we propose SynGuard, a hybrid
framework that combines the semantic alignment strength of Semantic Information
Retrieval (SIR) with the probabilistic watermarking mechanism of SynthID-Text.
Our approach jointly embeds watermarks at both lexical and semantic levels,
enabling robust provenance tracking while preserving the original meaning.
Experimental results across multiple attack scenarios show that SynGuard
improves watermark recovery by an average of 11.1\% in F1 score compared to
SynthID-Text. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of semantic-aware

Abstract: Collaborative filtering drives many successful recommender systems but
struggles with fine-grained user-item interactions and explainability. As users
increasingly seek transparent recommendations, generating textual explanations
through language models has become a critical research area. Existing methods
employ either RNNs or Transformers. However, RNN-based approaches fail to
leverage the capabilities of pre-trained Transformer models, whereas
Transformer-based methods often suffer from suboptimal adaptation and neglect
aspect modeling, which is crucial for personalized explanations. We propose
ELIXIR (Efficient and LIghtweight model for eXplaIning Recommendations), a
multi-task model combining rating prediction with personalized review
generation. ELIXIR jointly learns global and aspect-specific representations of
users and items, optimizing overall rating, aspect-level ratings, and review
generation, with personalized attention to emphasize aspect importance. Based
on a T5-small (60M) model, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our aspect-based
architecture in guiding text generation in a personalized context, where
state-of-the-art approaches exploit much larger models but fail to match user
preferences as well. Experimental results on TripAdvisor and RateBeer

Abstract: Ontologies and taxonomies of research fields are critical for managing and
organising scientific knowledge, as they facilitate efficient classification,
dissemination and retrieval of information. However, the creation and
maintenance of such ontologies are expensive and time-consuming tasks, usually
requiring the coordinated effort of multiple domain experts. Consequently,
ontologies in this space often exhibit uneven coverage across different
disciplines, limited inter-domain connectivity, and infrequent updating cycles.
In this study, we investigate the capability of several large language models
to identify semantic relationships among research topics within three academic
domains: biomedicine, physics, and engineering. The models were evaluated under
three distinct conditions: zero-shot prompting, chain-of-thought prompting, and
fine-tuning on existing ontologies. Additionally, we assessed the cross-domain
transferability of fine-tuned models by measuring their performance when
trained in one domain and subsequently applied to a different one. To support
this analysis, we introduce PEM-Rel-8K, a novel dataset consisting of over
8,000 relationships extracted from the most widely adopted taxonomies in the
three disciplines considered in this study: MeSH, PhySH, and IEEE. Our
experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning LLMs on PEM-Rel-8K yields excellent

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然训练数据规模和质量的改进带来了显著进步，但在语音识别领域的影响仍未充分探索。需要研究如何通过数据质量筛选来开发更鲁棒的零样本语音识别模型。

Method: 1) 构建包含300万小时英语音频和1700万转录文本的OLMoASR-Pool数据集；2) 设计文本启发式过滤器去除低质量或错误转录数据；3) 筛选得到100万小时高质量音频-文本对(OLMoASR-Mix)；4) 训练不同规模的OLMoASR模型(39M-1.5B参数)

Result: 在所有模型规模上，OLMoASR在短语音和长语音识别基准测试中达到与OpenAI Whisper相当的平均性能。OLMoASR-medium.en在短语音和长语音识别上分别达到12.8%和11.0%的词错误率，与同等参数量的Whisper-medium.en的12.4%和10.5%相当。

Conclusion: 通过精心设计的数据质量过滤流程可以构建高质量语音识别数据集，训练出的模型在零样本语音识别任务上能够达到业界领先水平。数据集、模型和代码将公开以促进鲁棒语音处理研究。

Abstract: Improvements in training data scale and quality have led to significant
advances, yet its influence in speech recognition remains underexplored. In
this paper, we present a large-scale dataset, OLMoASR-Pool, and series of
models, OLMoASR, to study and develop robust zero-shot speech recognition
models. Beginning from OLMoASR-Pool, a collection of 3M hours of English audio
and 17M transcripts, we design text heuristic filters to remove low-quality or
mistranscribed data. Our curation pipeline produces a new dataset containing 1M
hours of high-quality audio-transcript pairs, which we call OLMoASR-Mix. We use
OLMoASR-Mix to train the OLMoASR-Mix suite of models, ranging from 39M
(tiny.en) to 1.5B (large.en) parameters. Across all model scales, OLMoASR
achieves comparable average performance to OpenAI's Whisper on short and
long-form speech recognition benchmarks. Notably, OLMoASR-medium.en attains a
12.8\% and 11.0\% word error rate (WER) that is on par with Whisper's largest
English-only model Whisper-medium.en's 12.4\% and 10.5\% WER for short and
long-form recognition respectively (at equivalent parameter count).
OLMoASR-Pool, OLMoASR models, and filtering, training and evaluation code will
be made publicly available to further research on robust speech processing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估广泛使用的FLORES+多语言机器翻译基准的适用性和可靠性，发现其在真正多语言评估方面的关键缺陷

Method: 通过人工评估分析四种语言（Asante Twi、日语、Jinghpaw和南阿塞拜疆语）的翻译质量，使用简单启发式方法测试评估协议的漏洞，并比较在不同数据集上训练的MT模型性能

Result: 发现许多翻译质量低于声称的90%标准，源文本存在领域特定性和文化偏见，简单复制命名实体可获得不错的BLEU分数，高质量自然数据训练的模型在FLORES+上表现差但在相关评估集上表现好

Conclusion: 需要构建使用领域通用、文化中立源文本且较少依赖命名实体的多语言MT基准，以更好地反映真实世界的翻译挑战

Abstract: Multilingual machine translation (MT) benchmarks play a central role in
evaluating the capabilities of modern MT systems. Among them, the FLORES+
benchmark is widely used, offering English-to-many translation data for over
200 languages, curated with strict quality control protocols. However, we study
data in four languages (Asante Twi, Japanese, Jinghpaw, and South Azerbaijani)
and uncover critical shortcomings in the benchmark's suitability for truly
multilingual evaluation. Human assessments reveal that many translations fall
below the claimed 90% quality standard, and the annotators report that source
sentences are often too domain-specific and culturally biased toward the
English-speaking world. We further demonstrate that simple heuristics, such as
copying named entities, can yield non-trivial BLEU scores, suggesting
vulnerabilities in the evaluation protocol. Notably, we show that MT models
trained on high-quality, naturalistic data perform poorly on FLORES+ while
achieving significant gains on our domain-relevant evaluation set. Based on
these findings, we advocate for multilingual MT benchmarks that use
domain-general and culturally neutral source texts rely less on named entities,
in order to better reflect real-world translation challenges.

Conclusion: 提出的NEC方法有效解决了传统方法在词形差异大时的局限性，显著改善了ASR系统的命名实体识别性能

Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition systems often fail to transcribe
domain-specific named entities, causing catastrophic failures in downstream
tasks. Numerous fast and lightweight named entity correction (NEC) models have
been proposed in recent years. These models, mainly leveraging phonetic-level
edit distance algorithms, have shown impressive performances. However, when the
forms of the wrongly-transcribed words(s) and the ground-truth entity are
significantly different, these methods often fail to locate the wrongly
transcribed words in hypothesis, thus limiting their usage. We propose a novel
NEC method that utilizes speech sound features to retrieve candidate entities.
With speech sound features and candidate entities, we inovatively design a
generative method to annotate entity errors in ASR transcripts and replace the
text with correct entities. This method is effective in scenarios of word form
difference. We test our method using open-source and self-constructed test
sets. The results demonstrate that our NEC method can bring significant
improvement to entity accuracy. We will open source our self-constructed test
set and training data.

Abstract: Sentential relation extraction (RE) is an important task in natural language
processing (NLP). In this paper we propose to do sentential RE with dynamic
routing in capsules. We first show that the proposed approach outperform state
of the art on common sentential relation extraction datasets Tacred, Tacredrev,
Retacred, and Conll04. We then investigate potential reasons for its good
performance on the mentioned datasets, and yet low performance on another
similar, yet larger sentential RE dataset, Wikidata. As such, we identify noise
in Wikidata labels as one of the reasons that can hinder performance.
Additionally, we show associativity of better performance with better
re-representation, a term from neuroscience referred to change of
representation in human brain to improve the match at comparison time. As
example, in the given analogous terms King:Queen::Man:Woman, at comparison
time, and as a result of re-representation, the similarity between related head
terms (King,Man), and tail terms (Queen,Woman) increases. As such, our
observation show that our proposed model can do re-representation better than
the vanilla model compared with. To that end, beside noise in the labels of the
distantly supervised RE datasets, we propose re-representation as a challenge
in sentential RE.

Result: 在三个临床任务上相比最佳现有方法：死亡率预测BACC/AUROC提升1.6%/0.8%，住院时长预测RMSE/MAE提升0.5%/2.2%，手术时长估计RMSE/MAE提升10.9%/11.0%。在不同损坏率下均表现优越。

Conclusion: 该框架是预测重症监护死亡率和资源利用的有效准确方法，展示了使用提示学习和Transformer编码器分析多模态EHR的成功。模型对结构化数据损坏，特别是高损坏水平，表现出强韧性。

Abstract: Background Predicting mortality and resource utilization from electronic
health records (EHRs) is challenging yet crucial for optimizing patient
outcomes and managing costs in intensive care unit (ICU). Existing approaches
predominantly focus on structured EHRs, often ignoring the valuable clinical
insights in free-text notes. Additionally, the potential of textual information
within structured data is not fully leveraged. This study aimed to introduce
and assess a deep learning framework using natural language processing
techniques that integrates multimodal EHRs to predict mortality and resource
utilization in critical care settings. Methods Utilizing two real-world EHR
datasets, we developed and evaluated our model on three clinical tasks with
leading existing methods. We also performed an ablation study on three key
components in our framework: medical prompts, free-texts, and pre-trained
sentence encoder. Furthermore, we assessed the model's robustness against the
corruption in structured EHRs. Results Our experiments on two real-world
datasets across three clinical tasks showed that our proposed model improved
performance metrics by 1.6\%/0.8\% on BACC/AUROC for mortality prediction,
0.5%/2.2% on RMSE/MAE for LOS prediction, 10.9%/11.0% on RMSE/MAE for surgical
duration estimation compared to the best existing methods. It consistently
demonstrated superior performance compared to other baselines across three
tasks at different corruption rates. Conclusions The proposed framework is an
effective and accurate deep learning approach for predicting mortality and
resource utilization in critical care. The study also highlights the success of
using prompt learning with a transformer encoder in analyzing multimodal EHRs.
Importantly, the model showed strong resilience to data corruption within
structured data, especially at high corruption levels.

Abstract: A unified theory of language combines a Bayesian cognitive linguistic model
of language processing, with the proposal that language evolved by sexual
selection for the display of intelligence. The theory accounts for the major
facts of language, including its speed and expressivity, and data on language
diversity, pragmatics, syntax and semantics. The computational element of the
theory is based on Construction Grammars. These give an account of the syntax
and semantics of the worlds languages, using constructions and unification. Two
novel elements are added to construction grammars: an account of language
pragmatics, and an account of fast, precise language learning. Constructions
are represented in the mind as graph like feature structures. People use slow
general inference to understand the first few examples they hear of any
construction. After that it is learned as a feature structure, and is rapidly
applied by unification. All aspects of language (phonology, syntax, semantics,
and pragmatics) are seamlessly computed by fast unification; there is no
boundary between semantics and pragmatics. This accounts for the major puzzles
of pragmatics, and for detailed pragmatic phenomena. Unification is Bayesian
maximum likelihood pattern matching. This gives evolutionary continuity between
language processing in the human brain, and Bayesian cognition in animal
brains. Language is the basis of our mind reading abilities, our cooperation,
self esteem and emotions; the foundations of human culture and society.

Abstract: The growing complexity of cyber-physical systems, particularly in automotive
applications, has increased the demand for efficient modeling and cross-domain
co-simulation techniques. While SystemC Transaction-Level Modeling (TLM)
enables effective hardware/software co-design, its limited interoperability
with models from other engineering domains poses integration challenges. This
paper presents a fully open-source methodology for integrating SystemC TLM
models into Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI)-based co-simulation workflows.
By encapsulating SystemC TLM components as FMI 3.0 Co Simulation Functional
Mock-up Units (FMUs), the proposed approach facilitates seamless, standardized
integration across heterogeneous simulation environments. We introduce a
lightweight open-source toolchain, address key technical challenges such as
time synchronization and data exchange, and demonstrate the feasibility and
effectiveness of the integration through representative case studies.

### [55] [How Multimodal LLMs Solve Image Tasks: A Lens on Visual Grounding, Task Reasoning, and Answer Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20279)
*Zhuoran Yu,Yong Jae Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

Relevance: 85.0

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个探测框架来系统分析多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在不同层次处理视觉和文本输入的方式，发现了层次化的处理结构：早期层进行视觉基础，中间层支持词汇整合和语义推理，最终层准备任务特定输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然多模态大语言模型在各种视觉语言任务上表现出色，但其内部处理机制仍未被充分探索。研究者希望系统分析MLLMs如何处理视觉和文本输入，揭示不同层次的功能角色。

Method: 使用线性分类器预测从每个层次提取的token嵌入中的细粒度视觉类别，通过三种提示变体（词汇变体、语义否定变体、输出格式变体）来评估探测器的性能，并在LLaVA-1.5、LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3和Qwen2-VL等模型上进行测试。

Result: 发现MLLMs存在一致的层次化结构：早期层执行视觉基础，中间层处理词汇整合和语义推理，最终层准备输出。这种结构在不同视觉标记化、指令调优数据和预训练语料变化下保持稳定，但具体层次分配会随基础LLM架构变化而显著调整。

Conclusion: 该研究为MLLMs的层次组织提供了统一视角，并提供了一个轻量级、模型无关的方法来分析多模态表示动态。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, yet their internal processing
dynamics remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce a probing framework
to systematically analyze how MLLMs process visual and textual inputs across
layers. We train linear classifiers to predict fine-grained visual categories
(e.g., dog breeds) from token embeddings extracted at each layer, using a
standardized anchor question. To uncover the functional roles of different
layers, we evaluate these probes under three types of controlled prompt
variations: (1) lexical variants that test sensitivity to surface-level
changes, (2) semantic negation variants that flip the expected answer by
modifying the visual concept in the prompt, and (3) output format variants that
preserve reasoning but alter the answer format. Applying our framework to
LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3, and Qwen2-VL, we identify a consistent
stage-wise structure in which early layers perform visual grounding, middle
layers support lexical integration and semantic reasoning, and final layers
prepare task-specific outputs. We further show that while the overall
stage-wise structure remains stable across variations in visual tokenization,
instruction tuning data, and pretraining corpus, the specific layer allocation
to each stage shifts notably with changes in the base LLM architecture. Our
findings provide a unified perspective on the layer-wise organization of MLLMs
and offer a lightweight, model-agnostic approach for analyzing multimodal
representation dynamics.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Visual-Language Models (LVLMs) have opened up new opportunities for integrating
visual and linguistic modalities. However, effectively aligning these
modalities remains challenging, often leading to hallucinations--where
generated outputs are not grounded in the visual input--and raising safety
concerns across various domains. Existing alignment methods, such as
instruction tuning and preference tuning, often rely on external datasets,
human annotations, or complex post-processing, which limit scalability and
increase costs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
generates the debiased self-judgment score, a self-evaluation metric created
internally by the model without relying on external resources. This enables the
model to autonomously improve alignment. Our method enhances both decoding
strategies and preference tuning processes, resulting in reduced
hallucinations, enhanced safety, and improved overall capability. Empirical
results show that our approach significantly outperforms traditional methods,
offering a more effective solution for aligning LVLMs.

Abstract: Foundation image-text models such as CLIP with zero-shot capabilities enable
a wide array of applications. MobileCLIP is a recent family of image-text
models at 3-15ms latency and 50-150M parameters with state-of-the-art zero-shot
accuracy. The main ingredients in MobileCLIP were its low-latency and light
architectures and a novel multi-modal reinforced training that made knowledge
distillation from multiple caption-generators and CLIP teachers efficient,
scalable, and reproducible. In this paper, we improve the multi-modal
reinforced training of MobileCLIP through: 1) better CLIP teacher ensembles
trained on the DFN dataset, 2) improved captioner teachers trained on the DFN
dataset and fine-tuned on a diverse selection of high-quality image-caption
datasets. We discover new insights through ablations such as the importance of
temperature tuning in contrastive knowledge distillation, the effectiveness of
caption-generator fine-tuning for caption diversity, and the additive
improvement from combining synthetic captions generated by multiple models. We
train a new family of models called MobileCLIP2 and achieve state-of-the-art
ImageNet-1k zero-shot accuracies at low latencies. In particular, we observe
2.2% improvement in ImageNet-1k accuracy for MobileCLIP2-B compared with
MobileCLIP-B architecture. Notably, MobileCLIP2-S4 matches the zero-shot
accuracy of SigLIP-SO400M/14 on ImageNet-1k while being 2$\times$ smaller and
improves on DFN ViT-L/14 at 2.5$\times$ lower latency. We release our
pretrained models (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip) and the data
generation code (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip-dr). The data
generation code makes it easy to create new reinforced datasets with arbitrary

Result: 在LLaVA-OneVision-7B上减少75%视觉token，预填充阶段加速3.9倍，同时保持99.5%的原始性能

Conclusion: MMG-Vid通过最大化有限token预算的利用率，在显著提高效率的同时保持强性能

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) excel in video understanding, but their
excessive visual tokens pose a significant computational challenge for
real-world applications. Current methods aim to enhance inference efficiency by
visual token pruning. However, they do not consider the dynamic characteristics
and temporal dependencies of video frames, as they perceive video understanding
as a multi-frame task. To address these challenges, we propose MMG-Vid, a novel
training-free visual token pruning framework that removes redundancy by
Maximizing Marginal Gains at both segment-level and token-level. Specifically,
we first divide the video into segments based on frame similarity, and then
dynamically allocate the token budget for each segment to maximize the marginal
gain of each segment. Subsequently, we propose a temporal-guided DPC algorithm
that jointly models inter-frame uniqueness and intra-frame diversity, thereby
maximizing the marginal gain of each token. By combining both stages, MMG-Vid
can maximize the utilization of the limited token budget, significantly
improving efficiency while maintaining strong performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MMG-Vid can maintain over 99.5% of the original
performance, while effectively reducing 75% visual tokens and accelerating the
prefilling stage by 3.9x on LLaVA-OneVision-7B. Code will be released soon.

Conclusion: OneReward框架证明了使用单一奖励模型可以有效提升多任务生成能力，为多任务强化学习提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce OneReward, a unified reinforcement learning
framework that enhances the model's generative capabilities across multiple
tasks under different evaluation criteria using only \textit{One Reward} model.
By employing a single vision-language model (VLM) as the generative reward
model, which can distinguish the winner and loser for a given task and a given
evaluation criterion, it can be effectively applied to multi-task generation
models, particularly in contexts with varied data and diverse task objectives.
We utilize OneReward for mask-guided image generation, which can be further
divided into several sub-tasks such as image fill, image extend, object
removal, and text rendering, involving a binary mask as the edit area. Although
these domain-specific tasks share same conditioning paradigm, they differ
significantly in underlying data distributions and evaluation metrics. Existing
methods often rely on task-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which limits
generalization and training efficiency. Building on OneReward, we develop
Seedream 3.0 Fill, a mask-guided generation model trained via multi-task
reinforcement learning directly on a pre-trained base model, eliminating the
need for task-specific SFT. Experimental results demonstrate that our unified
edit model consistently outperforms both commercial and open-source

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) emerge as a unified interface to
address a multitude of tasks, ranging from NLP to computer vision. Despite
showcasing state-of-the-art results in many benchmarks, a long-standing issue
is the tendency of MLLMs to hallucinate, that is to generate answers to the
user's query that are not reflected in the visual input. In this paper, we
address the problem of hallucinations as an alignment problem, seeking to steer
the MLLM so that it prefers generating content without hallucinations. In
contrast to recent approaches that require complicated pipelines to build
synthetic preference data for alignment training, often relying on proprietary
models, we capitalize on the well-known CHAIR metric, originally proposed to
gauge the degree of hallucinations in image captioning. Given a pair of
generated answers, we leverage CHAIR to distinguish winner and loser options
(i.e., non-hallucinated and hallucinated samples) and fine-tune off-the-shelf
MLLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The resulting method, which we
refer to as CHAIR-DPO, effectively diminishes the amount of hallucinated
answers on several hallucination benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
fine-tuning the MLLM with a CHAIR-based reward. Source code and trained models

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的自适应反馈框架，通过将输出级的补丁级对应关系反馈到中间注意力层，增强CLIP模型在开放词汇分割中的空间一致性和语义一致性。


<details>

Motivation: CLIP模型在视觉-文本对齐方面表现强劲，但在开放词汇分割中由于定位能力差而表现不佳。先前方法通过修改中间注意力来增强空间一致性，但由于后续操作（如投影）导致这种一致性无法持续传播到最终输出，且中间注意力缺乏与文本表示的直接交互。

Method: 训练免费、反馈驱动的自适应框架，将输出预测作为空间一致性先验，通过注意力隔离、基于置信度的稀疏适应剪枝和适应集成等关键模块，将输出一致性线索反馈到中间注意力层。

Result: 该方法作为即插即用模块，无缝集成到四种最先进方法中，使用三种骨干网络（ViT-B、ViT-L、ViT-H），在多种注意力类型上验证，在八个基准测试中一致提升性能。

Conclusion: 通过利用输出预测作为更强的空间一致性先验，有效增强了内部表示与最终预测之间的语义一致性，显著提升了CLIP在开放词汇分割任务中的表现。

Abstract: CLIP exhibits strong visual-textual alignment but struggle with
open-vocabulary segmentation due to poor localization. Prior methods enhance
spatial coherence by modifying intermediate attention. But, this coherence
isn't consistently propagated to the final output due to subsequent operations
such as projections. Additionally, intermediate attention lacks direct
interaction with text representations, such semantic discrepancy limits the
full potential of CLIP.
  In this work, we propose a training-free, feedback-driven self-adaptive
framework that adapts output-based patch-level correspondences back to the
intermediate attention. The output predictions, being the culmination of the
model's processing, encapsulate the most comprehensive visual and textual
semantics about each patch. Our approach enhances semantic consistency between
internal representations and final predictions by leveraging the model's
outputs as a stronger spatial coherence prior. We design key modules, including
attention isolation, confidence-based pruning for sparse adaptation, and
adaptation ensemble, to effectively feedback the output coherence cues. Our
method functions as a plug-in module, seamlessly integrating into four
state-of-the-art approaches with three backbones (ViT-B, ViT-L, ViT-H). We
further validate our framework across multiple attention types (Q-K, self-self,
and Proxy augmented with MAE, SAM, and DINO). Our approach consistently
improves their performance across eight benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent advancements highlight the importance of GRPO-based reinforcement
learning methods and benchmarking in enhancing text-to-image (T2I) generation.
However, current methods using pointwise reward models (RM) for scoring
generated images are susceptible to reward hacking. We reveal that this happens
when minimal score differences between images are amplified after
normalization, creating illusory advantages that drive the model to
over-optimize for trivial gains, ultimately destabilizing the image generation
process. To address this, we propose Pref-GRPO, a pairwise preference
reward-based GRPO method that shifts the optimization objective from score
maximization to preference fitting, ensuring more stable training. In
Pref-GRPO, images are pairwise compared within each group using preference RM,
and the win rate is used as the reward signal. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PREF-GRPO differentiates subtle image quality differences,
providing more stable advantages and mitigating reward hacking. Additionally,
existing T2I benchmarks are limited by coarse evaluation criteria, hindering
comprehensive model assessment. To solve this, we introduce UniGenBench, a
unified T2I benchmark comprising 600 prompts across 5 main themes and 20
subthemes. It evaluates semantic consistency through 10 primary and 27
sub-criteria, leveraging MLLM for benchmark construction and evaluation. Our
benchmarks uncover the strengths and weaknesses of both open and closed-source
T2I models and validate the effectiveness of Pref-GRPO.

Abstract: Existing Causal-Why Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models often struggle
with higher-order reasoning, relying on opaque, monolithic pipelines that
entangle video understanding, causal inference, and answer generation. These
black-box approaches offer limited interpretability and tend to depend on
shallow heuristics. We propose a novel, modular framework that explicitly
decouples causal reasoning from answer generation, introducing natural language
causal chains as interpretable intermediate representations. Inspired by human
cognitive models, these structured cause-effect sequences bridge low-level
video content with high-level causal reasoning, enabling transparent and
logically coherent inference. Our two-stage architecture comprises a Causal
Chain Extractor (CCE) that generates causal chains from video-question pairs,
and a Causal Chain-Driven Answerer (CCDA) that produces answers grounded in
these chains. To address the lack of annotated reasoning traces, we introduce a
scalable method for generating high-quality causal chains from existing
datasets using large language models. We also propose CauCo, a new evaluation
metric for causality-oriented captioning. Experiments on three large-scale
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms state-of-the-art
models, but also yields substantial gains in explainability, user trust, and
generalization -- positioning the CCE as a reusable causal reasoning engine

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) has been recently explored to enhance the
generalizability of Point Cloud Classification (PCC) models toward unseen
domains. Prior works are based on convolutional networks, Transformer or Mamba
architectures, either suffering from limited receptive fields or high
computational cost, or insufficient long-range dependency modeling. RWKV, as an
emerging architecture, possesses superior linear complexity, global receptive
fields, and long-range dependency. In this paper, we present the first work
that studies the generalizability of RWKV models in DG PCC. We find that
directly applying RWKV to DG PCC encounters two significant challenges: RWKV's
fixed direction token shift methods, like Q-Shift, introduce spatial
distortions when applied to unstructured point clouds, weakening local
geometric modeling and reducing robustness. In addition, the Bi-WKV attention
in RWKV amplifies slight cross-domain differences in key distributions through
exponential weighting, leading to attention shifts and degraded generalization.
To this end, we propose PointDGRWKV, the first RWKV-based framework tailored
for DG PCC. It introduces two key modules to enhance spatial modeling and
cross-domain robustness, while maintaining RWKV's linear efficiency. In
particular, we present Adaptive Geometric Token Shift to model local
neighborhood structures to improve geometric context awareness. In addition,
Cross-Domain key feature Distribution Alignment is designed to mitigate
attention drift by aligning key feature distributions across domains. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PointDGRWKV achieves
state-of-the-art performance on DG PCC.

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning -- the practice of asking ``what if'' by varying
inputs and observing changes in model behavior -- has become central to
interpretable and fair AI. This thesis develops frameworks that use
counterfactuals to explain, audit, and mitigate bias in vision classifiers and
generative models. By systematically altering semantically meaningful
attributes while holding others fixed, these methods uncover spurious
correlations, probe causal dependencies, and help build more robust systems.
  The first part addresses vision classifiers. CAVLI integrates attribution
(LIME) with concept-level analysis (TCAV) to quantify how strongly decisions
rely on human-interpretable concepts. With localized heatmaps and a Concept
Dependency Score, CAVLI shows when models depend on irrelevant cues like
backgrounds. Extending this, ASAC introduces adversarial counterfactuals that
perturb protected attributes while preserving semantics. Through curriculum
learning, ASAC fine-tunes biased models for improved fairness and accuracy
while avoiding stereotype-laden artifacts.
  The second part targets generative Text-to-Image (TTI) models. TIBET provides
a scalable pipeline for evaluating prompt-sensitive biases by varying
identity-related terms, enabling causal auditing of how race, gender, and age
affect image generation. To capture interactions, BiasConnect builds causal

Motivation: 当前视觉模型开发主要关注性能指标（如准确率、IoU、mAP），而可解释性方面关注较少。现有xAI方法多为样本级解释，缺乏对模型在大型数据集上整体行为的解释，这对于防止偏见判断和识别模型模式很重要

Method: 应用视觉语言模型构建pipeline，提供样本级和数据集级的视觉模型解释。该pipeline能够以最小工作量发现失败案例并获得对视觉模型的洞察

Abstract: The development of many vision models mainly focuses on improving their
performance using metrics such as accuracy, IoU, and mAP, with less attention
to explainability due to the complexity of applying xAI methods to provide a
meaningful explanation of trained models. Although many existing xAI methods
aim to explain vision models sample-by-sample, methods explaining the general
behavior of vision models, which can only be captured after running on a large
dataset, are still underexplored. Furthermore, understanding the behavior of
vision models on general images can be very important to prevent biased
judgments and help identify the model's trends and patterns. With the
application of Vision-Language Models, this paper proposes a pipeline to
explain vision models at both the sample and dataset levels. The proposed
pipeline can be used to discover failure cases and gain insights into vision
models with minimal effort, thereby integrating vision model development with
xAI analysis to advance image analysis.

Conclusion: 稀疏线性概念子空间能够有效解耦嵌入空间，为可控的图像检索和生成提供有力工具，适用于多种嵌入表示

Abstract: Vision-language co-embedding networks, such as CLIP, provide a latent
embedding space with semantic information that is useful for downstream tasks.
We hypothesize that the embedding space can be disentangled to separate the
information on the content of complex scenes by decomposing the embedding into
multiple concept-specific component vectors that lie in different subspaces. We
propose a supervised dictionary learning approach to estimate a linear
synthesis model consisting of sparse, non-negative combinations of groups of
vectors in the dictionary (atoms), whose group-wise activity matches the
multi-label information. Each concept-specific component is a non-negative
combination of atoms associated to a label. The group-structured dictionary is
optimized through a novel alternating optimization with guaranteed convergence.
Exploiting the text co-embeddings, we detail how semantically meaningful
descriptions can be found based on text embeddings of words best approximated
by a concept's group of atoms, and unsupervised dictionary learning can exploit
zero-shot classification of training set images using the text embeddings of
concept labels to provide instance-wise multi-labels. We show that the
disentangled embeddings provided by our sparse linear concept subspaces (SLiCS)
enable concept-filtered image retrieval (and conditional generation using
image-to-prompt) that is more precise. We also apply SLiCS to highly-compressed
autoencoder embeddings from TiTok and the latent embedding from self-supervised
DINOv2. Quantitative and qualitative results highlight the improved precision
of the concept-filtered image retrieval for all embeddings.

Motivation: 解决多任务密集预测中充分跨任务交互与计算效率之间的权衡问题，现有方法往往需要在交互完整性和计算效率之间做出妥协。

Method: 提出双向交互扫描（BI-Scan）机制构建任务特定的双向序列表示，结合任务优先和位置优先扫描模式；采用多尺度扫描（MS-Scan）机制实现多粒度场景建模。

Result: 在NYUD-V2和PASCAL-Context两个基准测试上表现出优于最先进竞争方法的性能。

Conclusion: BIM模型通过创新的扫描机制成功解决了多任务密集预测中的交互-效率权衡问题，为相关领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Sufficient cross-task interaction is crucial for success in multi-task dense
prediction. However, sufficient interaction often results in high computational
complexity, forcing existing methods to face the trade-off between interaction
completeness and computational efficiency. To address this limitation, this
work proposes a Bidirectional Interaction Mamba (BIM), which incorporates novel
scanning mechanisms to adapt the Mamba modeling approach for multi-task dense
prediction. On the one hand, we introduce a novel Bidirectional Interaction
Scan (BI-Scan) mechanism, which constructs task-specific representations as
bidirectional sequences during interaction. By integrating task-first and
position-first scanning modes within a unified linear complexity architecture,
BI-Scan efficiently preserves critical cross-task information. On the other
hand, we employ a Multi-Scale Scan~(MS-Scan) mechanism to achieve
multi-granularity scene modeling. This design not only meets the diverse
granularity requirements of various tasks but also enhances nuanced cross-task
feature interactions. Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks,
\emph{i.e.}, NYUD-V2 and PASCAL-Context, show the superiority of our BIM vs its
state-of-the-art competitors.

Motivation: 排版攻击通过向图像中注入文本来操纵多模态系统，导致目标错误分类、恶意内容生成和视觉语言模型越狱。需要研究CLIP模型在这种攻击下的行为并开发有效的防御方法。

Method: 定位CLIP视觉编码器中专门处理排版信息的注意力头，构建排版电路，然后通过选择性消融这些注意力头来防御排版攻击，无需微调。

Result: 该方法在ImageNet-100的排版变体上性能提升高达19.6%，标准ImageNet-100准确率下降不到1%，与需要微调的最先进防御方法竞争力相当。

Conclusion: 提出的训练免费方法有效提升了CLIP模型对排版攻击的鲁棒性，发布的dyslexic CLIP模型可作为安全关键应用的直接替代方案。

Abstract: Typographic attacks exploit multi-modal systems by injecting text into
images, leading to targeted misclassifications, malicious content generation
and even Vision-Language Model jailbreaks. In this work, we analyze how CLIP
vision encoders behave under typographic attacks, locating specialized
attention heads in the latter half of the model's layers that causally extract
and transmit typographic information to the cls token. Building on these
insights, we introduce a method to defend CLIP models against typographic
attacks by selectively ablating a typographic circuit, consisting of attention
heads. Without requiring finetuning, our method improves performance by up to
19.6% on a typographic variant of ImageNet-100, while reducing standard
ImageNet-100 accuracy by less than 1%. Notably, our training-free approach
remains competitive with current state-of-the-art typographic defenses that
rely on finetuning. To this end, we release a family of dyslexic CLIP models
which are significantly more robust against typographic attacks. These models
serve as suitable drop-in replacements for a broad range of safety-critical
applications, where the risks of text-based manipulation outweigh the utility
of text recognition.

Motivation: 探索CLIP在军事应用中的鲁棒性，特别是在遮挡和低信噪比环境下的表现，因为军事场景中标记数据稀缺且环境挑战性强。

Method: 使用包含18类军事车辆的自定义数据集，通过不同遮挡百分比评估CLIP变体的性能，采用归一化曲线下面积(NAUC)作为评估指标，比较Transformer和CNN架构，并进行线性探测和骨干网络微调实验。

Result: 1) Transformer-based CLIP优于CNN；2) 细粒度分散遮挡比大块连续遮挡影响更大；3) 线性探测模型在约35%遮挡时性能急剧下降；4) 微调骨干网络后性能下降点推迟到60%以上遮挡。

Conclusion: 需要在训练中加入遮挡特定的数据增强，并进一步研究补丁级敏感性和架构韧性，以提高CLIP在现实世界部署中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP enable zero-shot classification by
aligning images and text in a shared embedding space, offering advantages for
defense applications with scarce labeled data. However, CLIP's robustness in
challenging military environments, with partial occlusion and degraded
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), remains underexplored. We investigate CLIP
variants' robustness to occlusion using a custom dataset of 18 military vehicle
classes and evaluate using Normalized Area Under the Curve (NAUC) across
occlusion percentages. Four key insights emerge: (1) Transformer-based CLIP
models consistently outperform CNNs, (2) fine-grained, dispersed occlusions
degrade performance more than larger contiguous occlusions, (3) despite
improved accuracy, performance of linear-probed models sharply drops at around
35% occlusion, (4) by finetuning the model's backbone, this performance drop
occurs at more than 60% occlusion. These results underscore the importance of
occlusion-specific augmentations during training and the need for further
exploration into patch-level sensitivity and architectural resilience for
real-world deployment of CLIP.

Conclusion: 抽象概念理解是视频理解的重要开放挑战，利用基础模型和社区经验可以推动这一领域的发展，使AI更符合人类价值观。

Abstract: The automatic understanding of video content is advancing rapidly. Empowered
by deeper neural networks and large datasets, machines are increasingly capable
of understanding what is concretely visible in video frames, whether it be
objects, actions, events, or scenes. In comparison, humans retain a unique
ability to also look beyond concrete entities and recognize abstract concepts
like justice, freedom, and togetherness. Abstract concept recognition forms a
crucial open challenge in video understanding, where reasoning on multiple
semantic levels based on contextual information is key. In this paper, we argue
that the recent advances in foundation models make for an ideal setting to
address abstract concept understanding in videos. Automated understanding of
high-level abstract concepts is imperative as it enables models to be more
aligned with human reasoning and values. In this survey, we study different
tasks and datasets used to understand abstract concepts in video content. We
observe that, periodically and over a long period, researchers have attempted
to solve these tasks, making the best use of the tools available at their
disposal. We advocate that drawing on decades of community experience will help
us shed light on this important open grand challenge and avoid ``re-inventing
the wheel'' as we start revisiting it in the era of multi-modal foundation
models.

Motivation: 自然语言语义的一个基本方面是能够从已知部分的组合中形成新含义。虽然视觉语言模型（VLMs）取得了显著进展，但有证据表明它们在组合语义方面存在困难，例如无法正确绑定对象属性和关系。

Method: 评估三种模型（Diffusion Classifier、CLIP和ViLT）在零样本学习（ZSL）和广义零样本学习（GZSL）设置下绑定对象属性和关系的能力。分析CLIP嵌入以理解关系概念表示的问题。

Result: Diffusion Classifier和ViLT在概念绑定任务上表现良好，但所有模型在关系GZSL任务上都面临显著困难。CLIP嵌入分析表明，困难可能源于关系概念（如左右）的表示过于相似。

Conclusion: VLMs在关系推理方面面临广泛挑战，需要改进关系概念的表示学习。扩散分类器在某些组合任务上表现出优势，但关系推理仍是所有模型的瓶颈。

Abstract: A fundamental aspect of the semantics of natural language is that novel
meanings can be formed from the composition of previously known parts.
Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in recent years,
however, there is evidence that they are unable to perform this kind of
composition. For example, given an image of a red cube and a blue cylinder, a
VLM such as CLIP is likely to incorrectly label the image as a red cylinder or
a blue cube, indicating it represents the image as a `bag-of-words' and fails
to capture compositional semantics. Diffusion models have recently gained
significant attention for their impressive generative abilities, and zero-shot
classifiers based on diffusion models have been shown to perform competitively
with CLIP in certain compositional tasks. In this work we explore whether the
generative Diffusion Classifier has improved compositional generalisation
abilities compared to discriminative models. We assess three models --
Diffusion Classifier, CLIP, and ViLT -- on their ability to bind objects with
attributes and relations in both zero-shot learning (ZSL) and generalised
zero-shot learning (GZSL) settings. Our results show that the Diffusion
Classifier and ViLT perform well at concept binding tasks, but that all models
struggle significantly with the relational GZSL task, underscoring the broader
challenges VLMs face with relational reasoning. Analysis of CLIP embeddings
suggests that the difficulty may stem from overly similar representations of
relational concepts such as left and right. Code and dataset are available at:

Conclusion: POSE成功解决了大规模视频扩散模型的单步高效采样问题，在保持质量的同时显著提升生成效率。

Abstract: The field of video diffusion generation faces critical bottlenecks in
sampling efficiency, especially for large-scale models and long sequences.
Existing video acceleration methods adopt image-based techniques but suffer
from fundamental limitations: they neither model the temporal coherence of
video frames nor provide single-step distillation for large-scale video models.
To bridge this gap, we propose POSE (Phased One-Step Equilibrium), a
distillation framework that reduces the sampling steps of large-scale video
diffusion models, enabling the generation of high-quality videos in a single
step. POSE employs a carefully designed two-phase process to distill video
models:(i) stability priming: a warm-up mechanism to stabilize adversarial
distillation that adapts the high-quality trajectory of the one-step generator
from high to low signal-to-noise ratio regimes, optimizing the video quality of
single-step mappings near the endpoints of flow trajectories. (ii) unified
adversarial equilibrium: a flexible self-adversarial distillation mechanism
that promotes stable single-step adversarial training towards a Nash
equilibrium within the Gaussian noise space, generating realistic single-step
videos close to real videos. For conditional video generation, we propose (iii)
conditional adversarial consistency, a method to improve both semantic
consistency and frame consistency between conditional frames and generated
frames. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that POSE outperforms other
acceleration methods on VBench-I2V by average 7.15% in semantic alignment,
temporal conference and frame quality, reducing the latency of the pre-trained
model by 100$\times$, from 1000 seconds to 10 seconds, while maintaining
competitive performance.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models enable high-quality image generation but are
computationally expensive. While prior work optimizes per-inference efficiency,
we explore an orthogonal approach: reducing redundancy across correlated
prompts. Our method leverages the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion models,
where early denoising steps capture shared structures among similar prompts. We
propose a training-free approach that clusters prompts based on semantic
similarity and shares computation in early diffusion steps. Experiments show
that for models trained conditioned on image embeddings, our approach
significantly reduces compute cost while improving image quality. By leveraging
UnClip's text-to-image prior, we enhance diffusion step allocation for greater
efficiency. Our method seamlessly integrates with existing pipelines, scales
with prompt sets, and reduces the environmental and financial burden of
large-scale text-to-image generation. Project page:

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models built on pre-trained
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) require extensive post-training, resulting in
high computational overhead that limits scalability and deployment.We propose
CogVLA, a Cognition-Aligned Vision-Language-Action framework that leverages
instruction-driven routing and sparsification to improve both efficiency and
performance. CogVLA draws inspiration from human multimodal coordination and
introduces a 3-stage progressive architecture. 1) Encoder-FiLM based
Aggregation Routing (EFA-Routing) injects instruction information into the
vision encoder to selectively aggregate and compress dual-stream visual tokens,
forming a instruction-aware latent representation. 2) Building upon this
compact visual encoding, LLM-FiLM based Pruning Routing (LFP-Routing)
introduces action intent into the language model by pruning
instruction-irrelevant visually grounded tokens, thereby achieving token-level
sparsity. 3) To ensure that compressed perception inputs can still support
accurate and coherent action generation, we introduce V-L-A Coupled Attention
(CAtten), which combines causal vision-language attention with bidirectional
action parallel decoding. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and
real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that CogVLA achieves state-of-the-art

Abstract: Deepfake detection remains a formidable challenge due to the complex and
evolving nature of fake content in real-world scenarios. However, existing
academic benchmarks suffer from severe discrepancies from industrial practice,
typically featuring homogeneous training sources and low-quality testing
images, which hinder the practical deployments of current detectors. To
mitigate this gap, we introduce HydraFake, a dataset that simulates real-world
challenges with hierarchical generalization testing. Specifically, HydraFake
involves diversified deepfake techniques and in-the-wild forgeries, along with
rigorous training and evaluation protocol, covering unseen model architectures,
emerging forgery techniques and novel data domains. Building on this resource,
we propose Veritas, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) based deepfake
detector. Different from vanilla chain-of-thought (CoT), we introduce
pattern-aware reasoning that involves critical reasoning patterns such as
"planning" and "self-reflection" to emulate human forensic process. We further
propose a two-stage training pipeline to seamlessly internalize such deepfake
reasoning capacities into current MLLMs. Experiments on HydraFake dataset
reveal that although previous detectors show great generalization on
cross-model scenarios, they fall short on unseen forgeries and data domains.
Our Veritas achieves significant gains across different OOD scenarios, and is
capable of delivering transparent and faithful detection outputs.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence models have demonstrated significant success in
diagnosing skin diseases, including cancer, showing the potential to assist
clinicians in their analysis. However, the interpretability of model
predictions must be significantly improved before they can be used in practice.
To this end, we explore the combination of two promising approaches: Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) and quantitative attribute usage. MLLMs offer a
potential avenue for increased interpretability, providing reasoning for
diagnosis in natural language through an interactive format. Separately, a
number of quantitative attributes that are related to lesion appearance (e.g.,
lesion area) have recently been found predictive of malignancy with high
accuracy. Predictions grounded as a function of such concepts have the
potential for improved interpretability. We provide evidence that MLLM
embedding spaces can be grounded in such attributes, through fine-tuning to
predict their values from images. Concretely, we evaluate this grounding in the
embedding space through an attribute-specific content-based image retrieval
case study using the SLICE-3D dataset.

extensive comparative study including modality fusion, contrastive learning,
reconstruction networks, attention mechanisms, and large vision-language
models. Our results show that models trained on image- and multimodally-guided
data generalize better to "in the wild" content, due to preserved visual
context. However, overall performance remains limited, highlighting the
complexity of inferring intent and the need for specialized architectures.

Motivation: 3D领域数据稀缺限制了大规模模型的发展，而视频数据包含丰富的空间一致性和语义先验信息，可以作为替代监督信号来缓解3D生成中的泛化瓶颈。

Method: 构建Droplet3D-4M大规模多视角标注视频数据集，训练Droplet3D生成模型，支持图像和密集文本输入，利用视频中的空间一致性和语义信息进行3D生成。

Result: 实验验证了方法的有效性，能够生成空间一致且语义合理的3D内容，相比现有3D解决方案具有扩展到场景级应用的潜力。

Conclusion: 视频中的常识先验显著促进了3D创作，为解决3D数据稀缺问题提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Scaling laws have validated the success and promise of large-data-trained
models in creative generation across text, image, and video domains. However,
this paradigm faces data scarcity in the 3D domain, as there is far less of it
available on the internet compared to the aforementioned modalities.
Fortunately, there exist adequate videos that inherently contain commonsense
priors, offering an alternative supervisory signal to mitigate the
generalization bottleneck caused by limited native 3D data. On the one hand,
videos capturing multiple views of an object or scene provide a spatial
consistency prior for 3D generation. On the other hand, the rich semantic
information contained within the videos enables the generated content to be
more faithful to the text prompts and semantically plausible. This paper
explores how to apply the video modality in 3D asset generation, spanning
datasets to models. We introduce Droplet3D-4M, the first large-scale video
dataset with multi-view level annotations, and train Droplet3D, a generative
model supporting both image and dense text input. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its ability to
produce spatially consistent and semantically plausible content. Moreover, in
contrast to the prevailing 3D solutions, our approach exhibits the potential
for extension to scene-level applications. This indicates that the commonsense
priors from the videos significantly facilitate 3D creation. We have
open-sourced all resources including the dataset, code, technical framework,
and model weights: https://dropletx.github.io/.

Conclusion: Video-MTR通过多轮推理和双层奖励机制有效解决了长视频理解的挑战，无需外部视觉语言模型，实现了端到端训练的优化。

Abstract: Long-form video understanding, characterized by long-range temporal
dependencies and multiple events, remains a challenge. Existing methods often
rely on static reasoning or external visual-language models (VLMs), which face
issues like complexity and sub-optimal performance due to the lack of
end-to-end training. In this paper, we propose Video-MTR, a reinforced
multi-turn reasoning framework designed to enable iterative key video segment
selection and question comprehension. Unlike traditional video reasoning
pipeline, which generate predictions in a single turn, Video-MTR performs
reasoning in multiple turns, selecting video segments progressively based on
the evolving understanding of previously processed segments and the current
question. This iterative process allows for a more refined and contextually
aware analysis of the video. To ensure intermediate reasoning process, we
introduce a novel gated bi-level reward system, combining trajectory-level
rewards based on answer correctness and turn-level rewards emphasizing
frame-query relevance. This system optimizes both video segment selection and
question comprehension, eliminating the need for external VLMs and allowing
end-to-end training. Extensive experiments on benchmarks like VideoMME, MLVU,
and EgoSchema demonstrate that Video-MTR outperforms existing methods in both
accuracy and efficiency, advancing the state-of-the-art in long video
understanding.

Conclusion: DINOv3预训练具有强大的鲁棒性，结合参数高效微调技术，为异常有丝分裂分类提供了强有力的基线方法

Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are markers of abnormal cell division
associated with poor prognosis, yet their detection remains difficult due to
low prevalence, subtle morphology, and inter-observer variability. The MIDOG
2025 challenge introduces a benchmark for AMF classification across multiple
domains. In this work, we evaluate the recently published DINOv3-H+ vision
transformer, pretrained on natural images, which we fine-tuned using low-rank
adaptation (LoRA, 650k trainable parameters) and extensive augmentation.
Despite the domain gap, DINOv3 transfers effectively to histopathology,
achieving a balanced accuracy of 0.8871 on the preliminary test set. These
results highlight the robustness of DINOv3 pretraining and show that, when
combined with parameter-efficient fine-tuning, it provides a strong baseline

Motivation: 现有图像伪造定位方法严重依赖人工标注数据，难以跟上快速发展的多模态大模型图像操纵技术。需要利用多模态大模型的生成和感知能力来提升伪造检测效率。

Conclusion: 该方法成功将多模态大模型的生成和感知能力整合到图像取证框架中，为无需人工标注的高效伪造检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Driven by the new generation of multi-modal large models, such as Stable
Diffusion (SD), image manipulation technologies have advanced rapidly, posing
significant challenges to image forensics. However, existing image forgery
localization methods, which heavily rely on labor-intensive and costly
annotated data, are struggling to keep pace with these emerging image
manipulation technologies. To address these challenges, we are the first to
integrate both image generation and powerful perceptual capabilities of SD into
an image forensic framework, enabling more efficient and accurate forgery
localization. First, we theoretically show that the multi-modal architecture of
SD can be conditioned on forgery-related information, enabling the model to
inherently output forgery localization results. Then, building on this
foundation, we specifically leverage the multimodal framework of Stable
DiffusionV3 (SD3) to enhance forgery localization performance.We leverage the
multi-modal processing capabilities of SD3 in the latent space by treating
image forgery residuals -- high-frequency signals extracted using specific
highpass filters -- as an explicit modality. This modality is fused into the
latent space during training to enhance forgery localization performance.
Notably, our method fully preserves the latent features extracted by SD3,
thereby retaining the rich semantic information of the input image.
Experimental results show that our framework achieves up to 12% improvements in
performance on widely used benchmarking datasets compared to current
state-of-the-art image forgery localization models. Encouragingly, the model
demonstrates strong performance on forensic tasks involving real-world document
forgery images and natural scene forging images, even when such data were
entirely unseen during training.

adaptive temperature scheduling with mixed-sample augmentation to transfer
knowledge from a MobileNetV3 Large teacher model (5.7\,M parameters) to

Abstract: Rapid and reliable qualification of advanced materials remains a bottleneck
in industrial manufacturing, particularly for heterogeneous structures produced
via non-conventional additive manufacturing processes. This study introduces a
novel framework that links microstructure informatics with a range of expert
characterization knowledge using customized and hybrid vision-language
representations (VLRs). By integrating deep semantic segmentation with
pre-trained multi-modal models (CLIP and FLAVA), we encode both visual
microstructural data and textual expert assessments into shared
representations. To overcome limitations in general-purpose embeddings, we
develop a customized similarity-based representation that incorporates both
positive and negative references from expert-annotated images and their
associated textual descriptions. This allows zero-shot classification of
previously unseen microstructures through a net similarity scoring approach.
Validation on an additively manufactured metal matrix composite dataset
demonstrates the framework's ability to distinguish between acceptable and
defective samples across a range of characterization criteria. Comparative
analysis reveals that FLAVA model offers higher visual sensitivity, while the
CLIP model provides consistent alignment with the textual criteria. Z-score
normalization adjusts raw unimodal and cross-modal similarity scores based on
their local dataset-driven distributions, enabling more effective alignment and
classification in the hybrid vision-language framework. The proposed method
enhances traceability and interpretability in qualification pipelines by
enabling human-in-the-loop decision-making without task-specific model
retraining. By advancing semantic interoperability between raw data and expert
knowledge, this work contributes toward scalable and domain-adaptable
qualification strategies in engineering informatics.

Conclusion: MedFoundationHub提供了一个安全、易用的医疗VLM部署解决方案，但当前医疗VLMs在临床应用中仍存在显著局限性，需要进一步改进模型性能和术语一致性。

Abstract: Recent advances in medical vision-language models (VLMs) open up remarkable
opportunities for clinical applications such as automated report generation,
copilots for physicians, and uncertainty quantification. However, despite their
promise, medical VLMs introduce serious security concerns, most notably risks
of Protected Health Information (PHI) exposure, data leakage, and vulnerability
to cyberthreats - which are especially critical in hospital environments. Even
when adopted for research or non-clinical purposes, healthcare organizations
must exercise caution and implement safeguards. To address these challenges, we
present MedFoundationHub, a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit that: (1)
enables physicians to manually select and use different models without
programming expertise, (2) supports engineers in efficiently deploying medical
VLMs in a plug-and-play fashion, with seamless integration of Hugging Face
open-source models, and (3) ensures privacy-preserving inference through
Docker-orchestrated, operating system agnostic deployment. MedFoundationHub
requires only an offline local workstation equipped with a single NVIDIA A6000
GPU, making it both secure and accessible within the typical resources of
academic research labs. To evaluate current capabilities, we engaged
board-certified pathologists to deploy and assess five state-of-the-art VLMs
(Google-MedGemma3-4B, Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, and
LLaVA-1.5-7B/13B). Expert evaluation covered colon cases and renal cases,

recurring limitations, including off-target answers, vague reasoning, and
inconsistent pathology terminology.

Conclusion: AEVLP框架通过创新的损失函数和伪标签技术，有效解决了SPML中的噪声和准确性问题

Abstract: Multi-label learning is a challenging computer vision task that requires
assigning multiple categories to each image. However, fully annotating
large-scale datasets is often impractical due to high costs and effort,
motivating the study of learning from partially annotated data. In the extreme
case of Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPML), each image is provided
with only one positive label, while all other labels remain unannotated.
Traditional SPML methods that treat missing labels as unknown or negative tend
to yield inaccuracies and false negatives, and integrating various
pseudo-labeling strategies can introduce additional noise. To address these
challenges, we propose the Generalized Pseudo-Label Robust Loss (GPR Loss), a
novel loss function that effectively learns from diverse pseudo-labels while
mitigating noise. Complementing this, we introduce a simple yet effective
Dynamic Augmented Multi-focus Pseudo-labeling (DAMP) technique. Together, these
contributions form the Adaptive and Efficient Vision-Language Pseudo-Labeling
(AEVLP) framework. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our framework significantly advances multi-label classification, achieving
state-of-the-art results.

module that jointly leverages spatial textures and frequency artifacts through
a gated mechanism, enhancing sensitivity to subtle manipulations. A

Conclusion: 通过结合双模型权重选择和自知识蒸馏，该方法克服了传统方法在紧凑模型中保留关键信息的局限性。

Abstract: We propose a novel medical image classification method that integrates
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation (SKD). In
real-world medical settings, deploying large-scale models is often limited by
computational resource constraints, which pose significant challenges for their
practical implementation. Thus, developing lightweight models that achieve
comparable performance to large-scale models while maintaining computational
efficiency is crucial. To address this, we employ a dual-model weight selection
strategy that initializes two lightweight models with weights derived from a
large pretrained model, enabling effective knowledge transfer. Next, SKD is
applied to these selected models, allowing the use of a broad range of initial
weight configurations without imposing additional excessive computational cost,
followed by fine-tuning for the target classification tasks. By combining
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation, our method
overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches, which often fail to
retain critical information in compact models. Extensive experiments on
publicly available datasets-chest X-ray images, lung computed tomography scans,
and brain magnetic resonance imaging scans-demonstrate the superior performance
and robustness of our approach compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Corner cases are crucial for training and validating autonomous driving
systems, yet collecting them from the real world is often costly and hazardous.
Editing objects within captured sensor data offers an effective alternative for
generating diverse scenarios, commonly achieved through 3D Gaussian Splatting
or image generative models. However, these approaches often suffer from limited
visual fidelity or imprecise pose control. To address these issues, we propose
G^2Editor, a framework designed for photorealistic and precise object editing
in driving videos. Our method leverages a 3D Gaussian representation of the
edited object as a dense prior, injected into the denoising process to ensure
accurate pose control and spatial consistency. A scene-level 3D bounding box
layout is employed to reconstruct occluded areas of non-target objects.
Furthermore, to guide the appearance details of the edited object, we
incorporate hierarchical fine-grained features as additional conditions during
generation. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that G^2Editor
effectively supports object repositioning, insertion, and deletion within a
unified framework, outperforming existing methods in both pose controllability
and visual quality, while also benefiting downstream data-driven tasks.

Abstract: Audio is the primary modality for human communication and has driven the
success of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies. However, such
systems remain inherently inaccessible to individuals who are deaf or hard of
hearing. Visual alternatives such as sign language and lip reading offer
effective substitutes, and recent advances in Sign Language Translation (SLT)
and Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) have improved audio-less communication.
Yet, these modalities have largely been studied in isolation, and their
integration within a unified framework remains underexplored. In this paper, we
introduce the first unified framework capable of handling diverse combinations
of sign language, lip movements, and audio for spoken-language text generation.
We focus on three main objectives: (i) designing a unified, modality-agnostic
architecture capable of effectively processing heterogeneous inputs; (ii)
exploring the underexamined synergy among modalities, particularly the role of
lip movements as non-manual cues in sign language comprehension; and (iii)
achieving performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art models
specialized for individual tasks. Building on this framework, we achieve
performance on par with or better than task-specific state-of-the-art models
across SLT, VSR, ASR, and AVSR. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that
explicitly modeling lip movements as a separate modality significantly improves
SLT performance.

Conclusion: IAENet通过有效整合2D和3D专家模型，成功解决了3D异常检测中缺乏强大预训练骨干的问题，为工业质量检测提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Surface anomaly detection is pivotal for ensuring product quality in
industrial manufacturing. While 2D image-based methods have achieved remarkable
success, 3D point cloud-based detection remains underexplored despite its
richer geometric cues. We argue that the key bottleneck is the absence of
powerful pretrained foundation backbones in 3D comparable to those in 2D. To
bridge this gap, we propose Importance-Aware Ensemble Network (IAENet), an
ensemble framework that synergizes 2D pretrained expert with 3D expert models.
However, naively fusing predictions from disparate sources is non-trivial:
existing strategies can be affected by a poorly performing modality and thus
degrade overall accuracy. To address this challenge, We introduce an novel
Importance-Aware Fusion (IAF) module that dynamically assesses the contribution
of each source and reweights their anomaly scores. Furthermore, we devise
critical loss functions that explicitly guide the optimization of IAF, enabling
it to combine the collective knowledge of the source experts but also preserve
their unique strengths, thereby enhancing the overall performance of anomaly
detection. Extensive experiments on MVTec 3D-AD demonstrate that our IAENet
achieves a new state-of-the-art with a markedly lower false positive rate,
underscoring its practical value for industrial deployment.

Conclusion: DescriptiveEdit通过重新定义问题框架，有效解决了现有图像编辑方法的局限性，为语义图像编辑提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the progress in text-to-image generation, semantic image editing
remains a challenge. Inversion-based algorithms unavoidably introduce
reconstruction errors, while instruction-based models mainly suffer from
limited dataset quality and scale. To address these problems, we propose a
descriptive-prompt-based editing framework, named DescriptiveEdit. The core
idea is to re-frame `instruction-based image editing' as `reference-image-based
text-to-image generation', which preserves the generative power of well-trained
Text-to-Image models without architectural modifications or inversion.
Specifically, taking the reference image and a prompt as input, we introduce a
Cross-Attentive UNet, which newly adds attention bridges to inject reference
image features into the prompt-to-edit-image generation process. Owing to its
text-to-image nature, DescriptiveEdit overcomes limitations in instruction
dataset quality, integrates seamlessly with ControlNet, IP-Adapter, and other
extensions, and is more scalable. Experiments on the Emu Edit benchmark show it
improves editing accuracy and consistency.

<details>

Motivation: 解决持续测试时自适应中仅依赖目标域特征导致的混淆和学习偏差问题，以及现有方法中伪标签质量不可靠和误差累积的挑战

Method: 使用双分类器将目标数据特征解耦为语义相关特征和域相关特征，保持子特征与整体特征的一致性；设置自适应阈值计算样本置信度进行损失加权的自监督学习

Result: 在CIFAR10-C、CIFAR100-C和ImageNet-C等多个数据集上验证了方法的有效性，在持续测试时自适应场景中表现出稳定的性能

Conclusion: DCFS框架通过特征解耦和一致性约束，以及置信度感知的样本选择，有效减少了伪标签噪声并缓解了误差累积问题

Abstract: Continual test-time adaptation aims to continuously adapt a pre-trained model
to a stream of target domain data without accessing source data. Without access
to source domain data, the model focuses solely on the feature characteristics
of the target data. Relying exclusively on these features can lead to confusion
and introduce learning biases. Currently, many existing methods generate
pseudo-labels via model predictions. However, the quality of pseudo-labels
cannot be guaranteed and the problem of error accumulation must be solved. To
address these challenges, we propose DCFS, a novel CTTA framework that
introduces dual-path feature consistency and confidence-aware sample learning.
This framework disentangles the whole feature representation of the target data
into semantic-related feature and domain-related feature using dual classifiers
to learn distinct feature representations. By maintaining consistency between
the sub-features and the whole feature, the model can comprehensively capture
data features from multiple perspectives. Additionally, to ensure that the
whole feature information of the target domain samples is not overlooked, we
set a adaptive threshold and calculate a confidence score for each sample to
carry out loss weighted self-supervised learning, effectively reducing the
noise of pseudo-labels and alleviating the problem of error accumulation. The
efficacy of our proposed method is validated through extensive experimentation
across various datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, and ImageNet-C,
demonstrating consistent performance in continual test-time adaptation
scenarios.

Conclusion: 数据级融合方法能够有效利用LiDAR和RGB数据的互补性，显著提升无监督3D目标检测性能

Abstract: Existing LiDAR-based 3D object detectors typically rely on manually annotated
labels for training to achieve good performance. However, obtaining
high-quality 3D labels is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this
issue, recent works explore unsupervised 3D object detection by introducing RGB
images as an auxiliary modal to assist pseudo-box generation. However, these
methods simply integrate pseudo-boxes generated by LiDAR point clouds and RGB
images. Yet, such a label-level fusion strategy brings limited improvements to
the quality of pseudo-boxes, as it overlooks the complementary nature in terms
of LiDAR and RGB image data. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a
novel data-level fusion framework that integrates RGB images and LiDAR data at
an early stage. Specifically, we utilize vision foundation models for instance
segmentation and depth estimation on images and introduce a bi-directional
fusion method, where real points acquire category labels from the 2D space,
while 2D pixels are projected onto 3D to enhance real point density. To
mitigate noise from depth and segmentation estimations, we propose a local and
global filtering method, which applies local radius filtering to suppress depth
estimation errors and global statistical filtering to remove
segmentation-induced outliers. Furthermore, we propose a data-level fusion
based dynamic self-evolution strategy, which iteratively refines pseudo-boxes
under a dense representation, significantly improving localization accuracy.
Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the detector
trained by our method significantly outperforms that trained by previous
state-of-the-art methods with 28.4$\%$ mAP on the nuScenes validation
benchmark.

Abstract: Generating 3D human motions from text is a challenging yet valuable task. The
key aspects of this task are ensuring text-motion consistency and achieving
generation diversity. Although recent advancements have enabled the generation
of precise and high-quality human motions from text, achieving diversity in the
generated motions remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we aim to
overcome the above challenge by designing a simple yet effective text-to-motion
generation method, \textit{i.e.}, Diverse-T2M. Our method introduces
uncertainty into the generation process, enabling the generation of highly
diverse motions while preserving the semantic consistency of the text.
Specifically, we propose a novel perspective that utilizes noise signals as
carriers of diversity information in transformer-based methods, facilitating a
explicit modeling of uncertainty. Moreover, we construct a latent space where
text is projected into a continuous representation, instead of a rigid
one-to-one mapping, and integrate a latent space sampler to introduce
stochastic sampling into the generation process, thereby enhancing the
diversity and uncertainty of the outputs. Our results on text-to-motion
generation benchmark datasets~(HumanML3D and KIT-ML) demonstrate that our
method significantly enhances diversity while maintaining state-of-the-art
performance in text consistency.

Conclusion: SeqVLM推动了3D视觉定位向更大泛化能力和真实世界适用性的发展

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to localize objects in 3D scenes using
natural language descriptions. Although supervised methods achieve higher
accuracy in constrained settings, zero-shot 3DVG holds greater promise for
real-world applications since eliminating scene-specific training requirements.
However, existing zero-shot methods face challenges of spatial-limited
reasoning due to reliance on single-view localization, and contextual omissions
or detail degradation. To address these issues, we propose SeqVLM, a novel
zero-shot 3DVG framework that leverages multi-view real-world scene images with
spatial information for target object reasoning. Specifically, SeqVLM first
generates 3D instance proposals via a 3D semantic segmentation network and
refines them through semantic filtering, retaining only semantic-relevant
candidates. A proposal-guided multi-view projection strategy then projects
these candidate proposals onto real scene image sequences, preserving spatial
relationships and contextual details in the conversion process of 3D point
cloud to images. Furthermore, to mitigate VLM computational overload, we
implement a dynamic scheduling mechanism that iteratively processes
sequances-query prompts, leveraging VLM's cross-modal reasoning capabilities to
identify textually specified objects. Experiments on the ScanRefer and Nr3D
benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving Acc@0.25 scores
of 55.6% and 53.2%, surpassing previous zero-shot methods by 4.0% and 5.2%,
respectively, which advance 3DVG toward greater generalization and real-world
applicability. The code is available at https://github.com/JiawLin/SeqVLM.

Abstract: Deep learning based automated pathological diagnosis has markedly improved
diagnostic efficiency and reduced variability between observers, yet its
clinical adoption remains limited by opaque model decisions and a lack of

localizing lesion regions and producing expert style diagnostic narratives,
these models deliver the transparent and interpretable insights necessary for
dependable AI assisted pathology. Building on these advancements, we propose
PathMR, a cell-level Multimodal visual Reasoning framework for Pathological
image analysis. Given a pathological image and a textual query, PathMR
generates expert-level diagnostic explanations while simultaneously predicting
cell distribution patterns. To benchmark its performance, we evaluated our
approach on the publicly available PathGen dataset as well as on our newly

Abstract: Mitosis detection in histopathology images plays a key role in tumor
assessment. Although machine learning algorithms could be exploited for aiding
physicians in accurately performing such a task, these algorithms suffer from
significative performance drop when evaluated on images coming from domains
that are different from the training ones. In this work, we propose a
Mamba-based approach for mitosis detection under domain shift, inspired by the
promising performance demonstrated by Mamba in medical imaging segmentation
tasks. Specifically, our approach exploits a VM-UNet architecture for carrying
out the addressed task, as well as stain augmentation operations for further
improving model robustness against domain shift. Our approach has been
submitted to the track 1 of the MItosis DOmain Generalization (MIDOG)
challenge. Preliminary experiments, conducted on the MIDOG++ dataset, show
large room for improvement for the proposed method.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated considerable potential in the
realm of medical imaging. However, the development of high-performance AI
models typically necessitates training on large-scale, centralized datasets.
This approach is confronted with significant challenges due to strict patient
privacy regulations and legal restrictions on data sharing and utilization.
These limitations hinder the development of large-scale models in medical
domains and impede continuous updates and training with new data. Federated
Learning (FL), a privacy-preserving distributed training framework, offers a
new solution by enabling collaborative model development across fragmented
medical datasets. In this survey, we review FL's contributions at two stages of
the full-stack medical analysis pipeline. First, in upstream tasks such as CT
or MRI reconstruction, FL enables joint training of robust reconstruction
networks on diverse, multi-institutional datasets, alleviating data scarcity
while preserving confidentiality. Second, in downstream clinical tasks like
tumor diagnosis and segmentation, FL supports continuous model updating by
allowing local fine-tuning on new data without centralizing sensitive images.
We comprehensively analyze FL implementations across the medical imaging
pipeline, from physics-informed reconstruction networks to diagnostic AI
systems, highlighting innovations that improve communication efficiency, align
heterogeneous data, and ensure secure parameter aggregation. Meanwhile, this
paper provides an outlook on future research directions, aiming to serve as a
valuable reference for the field's development.

Motivation: 现有自动调制识别方案依赖大量标注数据或多阶段训练流程，限制了实际应用中的可扩展性和泛化能力，需要更高效的解决方案

Method: 使用ViT编码器、轻量卷积解码器和线性分类器的统一框架，通过重建分支将增强信号映射回原始信号，在预训练中结合重建损失和部分标签监督进行微调

Result: 在RML2018.01A数据集上，低标签情况下优于监督CNN和ViT基线，仅用15-20%标注数据即可达到ResNet级别准确率，在不同SNR水平下保持强劲性能

Conclusion: 该框架为自动调制识别提供了简单、通用且标签高效的解决方案

Abstract: Automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is critical for cognitive radio,
spectrum monitoring, and secure wireless communication. However, existing
solutions often rely on large labeled datasets or multi-stage training
pipelines, which limit scalability and generalization in practice. We propose a
unified Vision Transformer (ViT) framework that integrates supervised,
self-supervised, and reconstruction objectives. The model combines a ViT
encoder, a lightweight convolutional decoder, and a linear classifier; the
reconstruction branch maps augmented signals back to their originals, anchoring
the encoder to fine-grained I/Q structure. This strategy promotes robust,
discriminative feature learning during pretraining, while partial label
supervision in fine-tuning enables effective classification with limited
labels. On the RML2018.01A dataset, our approach outperforms supervised CNN and
ViT baselines in low-label regimes, approaches ResNet-level accuracy with only
15-20% labeled data, and maintains strong performance across varying SNR
levels. Overall, the framework provides a simple, generalizable, and
label-efficient solution for AMR.

Conclusion: InfinityHuman通过姿态引导的稳定性和手部奖励机制，有效解决了音频驱动动画中的长期一致性和手势真实性问题。

Abstract: Audio-driven human animation has attracted wide attention thanks to its
practical applications. However, critical challenges remain in generating
high-resolution, long-duration videos with consistent appearance and natural
hand motions. Existing methods extend videos using overlapping motion frames
but suffer from error accumulation, leading to identity drift, color shifts,
and scene instability. Additionally, hand movements are poorly modeled,
resulting in noticeable distortions and misalignment with the audio. In this
work, we propose InfinityHuman, a coarse-to-fine framework that first generates
audio-synchronized representations, then progressively refines them into
high-resolution, long-duration videos using a pose-guided refiner. Since pose
sequences are decoupled from appearance and resist temporal degradation, our
pose-guided refiner employs stable poses and the initial frame as a visual
anchor to reduce drift and improve lip synchronization. Moreover, to enhance
semantic accuracy and gesture realism, we introduce a hand-specific reward
mechanism trained with high-quality hand motion data. Experiments on the EMTD
and HDTF datasets show that InfinityHuman achieves state-of-the-art performance
in video quality, identity preservation, hand accuracy, and lip-sync. Ablation
studies further confirm the effectiveness of each module. Code will be made
public.

Motivation: 血管周围空间(PVS)是脑小血管疾病和神经退行性疾病的重要生物标志物，但手动分割耗时且可靠性有限，现有深度学习模型性能一般且泛化能力不足。

Method: 采用Transformer启发的3D编码器-解码器卷积网络MedNeXt-L-k5，分别在同质T2加权数据集(200例)和异质T1加权数据集(40例)上训练，使用5折交叉验证和留一站点交叉验证评估。

Result: T2加权图像上达到0.88±0.06 Dice分数(白质)，与人工标注可靠性相当；T1加权图像上性能显著下降(0.58±0.09)；跨站点验证时性能进一步降低；未超越nnU-Net性能。

Conclusion: MedNeXt-L-k5为PVS分割提供了有效解决方案，但Transformer的注意力机制对PVS分割并非必需，传统架构如nnU-Net仍具竞争力。

Abstract: Enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS) are increasingly recognized as biomarkers
of cerebral small vessel disease, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and
aging-related neurodegeneration. However, manual segmentation of PVS is
time-consuming and subject to moderate inter-rater reliability, while existing
automated deep learning models have moderate performance and typically fail to
generalize across diverse clinical and research MRI datasets. We adapted
MedNeXt-L-k5, a Transformer-inspired 3D encoder-decoder convolutional network,
for automated PVS segmentation. Two models were trained: one using a
homogeneous dataset of 200 T2-weighted (T2w) MRI scans from the Human
Connectome Project-Aging (HCP-Aging) dataset and another using 40 heterogeneous
T1-weighted (T1w) MRI volumes from seven studies across six scanners. Model
performance was evaluated using internal 5-fold cross validation (5FCV) and
leave-one-site-out cross validation (LOSOCV). MedNeXt-L-k5 models trained on
the T2w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved voxel-level Dice scores of
0.88+/-0.06 (white matter, WM), comparable to the reported inter-rater
reliability of that dataset, and the highest yet reported in the literature.
The same models trained on the T1w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved a
substantially lower Dice score of 0.58+/-0.09 (WM). Under LOSOCV, the model had
voxel-level Dice scores of 0.38+/-0.16 (WM) and 0.35+/-0.12 (BG), and
cluster-level Dice scores of 0.61+/-0.19 (WM) and 0.62+/-0.21 (BG).
MedNeXt-L-k5 provides an efficient solution for automated PVS segmentation
across diverse T1w and T2w MRI datasets. MedNeXt-L-k5 did not outperform the
nnU-Net, indicating that the attention-based mechanisms present in
transformer-inspired models to provide global context are not required for high
accuracy in PVS segmentation.

Abstract: Visual editing with diffusion models has made significant progress but often
struggles with complex scenarios that textual guidance alone could not
adequately describe, highlighting the need for additional non-text editing
prompts. In this work, we introduce a novel audio-guided visual editing
framework that can handle complex editing tasks with multiple text and audio
prompts without requiring additional training. Existing audio-guided visual
editing methods often necessitate training on specific datasets to align audio
with text, limiting their generalization to real-world situations. We leverage
a pre-trained multi-modal encoder with strong zero-shot capabilities and
integrate diverse audio into visual editing tasks, by alleviating the
discrepancy between the audio encoder space and the diffusion model's prompt
encoder space. Additionally, we propose a novel approach to handle complex
scenarios with multiple and multi-modal editing prompts through our separate
noise branching and adaptive patch selection. Our comprehensive experiments on
diverse editing tasks demonstrate that our framework excels in handling
complicated editing scenarios by incorporating rich information from audio,
where text-only approaches fail.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the brain, are characterized by
minimal power consumption and swift inference capabilities on neuromorphic
hardware, and have been widely applied to various visual perception tasks.
Current ANN-SNN conversion methods have achieved excellent results in
classification tasks with ultra-low time-steps, but their performance in visual
detection tasks remains suboptimal. In this paper, we propose a delay-spike
approach to mitigate the issue of residual membrane potential caused by
heterogeneous spiking patterns. Furthermore, we propose a novel
temporal-dependent Integrate-and-Fire (tdIF) neuron architecture for SNNs. This
enables Integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons to dynamically adjust their
accumulation and firing behaviors based on the temporal order of time-steps.
Our method enables spikes to exhibit distinct temporal properties, rather than
relying solely on frequency-based representations. Moreover, the tdIF neuron
maintains energy consumption on par with traditional IF neuron. We demonstrate
that our method achieves more precise feature representation with lower
time-steps, enabling high performance and ultra-low latency in visual detection
tasks. In this study, we conduct extensive evaluation of the tdIF method across
two critical vision tasks: object detection and lane line detection. The
results demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses current ANN-SNN
conversion approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance with ultra-low
latency (within 5 time-steps).

Abstract: LiDAR point clouds are fundamental to various applications, yet
high-precision scans incur substantial storage and transmission overhead.
Existing methods typically convert unordered points into hierarchical octree or
voxel structures for dense-to-sparse predictive coding. However, the extreme
sparsity of geometric details hinders efficient context modeling, thereby
limiting their compression performance and speed. To address this challenge, we
propose to generate compact features for efficient predictive coding. Our
framework comprises two lightweight modules. First, the Geometry
Re-Densification Module re-densifies encoded sparse geometry, extracts features
at denser scale, and then re-sparsifies the features for predictive coding.
This module avoids costly computation on highly sparse details while
maintaining a lightweight prediction head. Second, the Cross-scale Feature
Propagation Module leverages occupancy cues from multiple resolution levels to
guide hierarchical feature propagation. This design facilitates information
sharing across scales, thereby reducing redundant feature extraction and
providing enriched features for the Geometry Re-Densification Module. By
integrating these two modules, our method yields a compact feature
representation that provides efficient context modeling and accelerates the
coding process. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art
compression ratios and real-time performance, achieving 26 FPS for both
encoding and decoding at 12-bit quantization. Code is available at

Abstract: Accurate fetal brain segmentation is crucial for extracting biomarkers and
assessing neurodevelopment, especially in conditions such as corpus callosum
dysgenesis (CCD), which can induce drastic anatomical changes. However, the
rarity of CCD severely limits annotated data, hindering the generalization of
deep learning models. To address this, we propose a pathology-informed domain
randomization strategy that embeds prior knowledge of CCD manifestations into a
synthetic data generation pipeline. By simulating diverse brain alterations
from healthy data alone, our approach enables robust segmentation without
requiring pathological annotations.
  We validate our method on a cohort comprising 248 healthy fetuses, 26 with
CCD, and 47 with other brain pathologies, achieving substantial improvements on
CCD cases while maintaining performance on both healthy fetuses and those with
other pathologies. From the predicted segmentations, we derive clinically
relevant biomarkers, such as corpus callosum length (LCC) and volume, and show
their utility in distinguishing CCD subtypes. Our pathology-informed
augmentation reduces the LCC estimation error from 1.89 mm to 0.80 mm in
healthy cases and from 10.9 mm to 0.7 mm in CCD cases. Beyond these
quantitative gains, our approach yields segmentations with improved topological
consistency relative to available ground truth, enabling more reliable
shape-based analyses. Overall, this work demonstrates that incorporating
domain-specific anatomical priors into synthetic data pipelines can effectively
mitigate data scarcity and enhance analysis of rare but clinically significant
malformations.

Abstract: Accurate gross tumor volume segmentation on multi-modal medical data is
critical for radiotherapy planning in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and
glioblastoma. Recent advances in deep neural networks have brought promising
results in medical image segmentation, leading to an increasing demand for
labeled data. Since labeling medical images is time-consuming and
labor-intensive, active learning has emerged as a solution to reduce annotation
costs by selecting the most informative samples to label and adapting
high-performance models with as few labeled samples as possible. Previous
active domain adaptation (ADA) methods seek to minimize sample redundancy by
selecting samples that are farthest from the source domain. However, such
one-off selection can easily cause negative transfer, and access to source
medical data is often limited. Moreover, the query strategy for multi-modal
medical data remains unexplored. In this work, we propose an active and
sequential domain adaptation framework for dynamic multi-modal sample selection
in ADA. We derive a query strategy to prioritize labeling and training on the
most valuable samples based on their informativeness and representativeness.
Empirical validation on diverse gross tumor volume segmentation tasks

significantly outperforming state-of-the-art ADA methods. Code is available at

Abstract: Video object detection is a challenging task because videos often suffer from
image deterioration such as motion blur, occlusion, and deformable shapes,
making it significantly more difficult than detecting objects in still images.
Prior approaches have improved video object detection performance by employing
feature aggregation and complex post-processing techniques, though at the cost
of increased computational demands. To improve robustness to image degradation
without additional computational load during inference, we introduce a
straightforward yet effective Contrastive Learning through Auxiliary Branch
(CLAB) method. First, we implement a constrastive auxiliary branch using a
contrastive loss to enhance the feature representation capability of the video
object detector's backbone. Next, we propose a dynamic loss weighting strategy
that emphasizes auxiliary feature learning early in training while gradually
prioritizing the detection task as training converges. We validate our approach
through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies, demonstrating
consistent performance gains. Without bells and whistles, CLAB reaches a
performance of 84.0% mAP and 85.2% mAP with ResNet-101 and ResNeXt-101,

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) is a crucial task in computer vision with

Conclusion: FastFit通过创新的可缓存扩散架构成功解决了多参考虚拟试穿的效率和功能限制问题，为复杂多参考虚拟试穿研究提供了有效解决方案和高质量数据集支持。

Abstract: Despite its great potential, virtual try-on technology is hindered from
real-world application by two major challenges: the inability of current
methods to support multi-reference outfit compositions (including garments and
accessories), and their significant inefficiency caused by the redundant
re-computation of reference features in each denoising step. To address these
challenges, we propose FastFit, a high-speed multi-reference virtual try-on
framework based on a novel cacheable diffusion architecture. By employing a
Semi-Attention mechanism and substituting traditional timestep embeddings with
class embeddings for reference items, our model fully decouples reference
feature encoding from the denoising process with negligible parameter overhead.
This allows reference features to be computed only once and losslessly reused
across all steps, fundamentally breaking the efficiency bottleneck and
achieving an average 3.5x speedup over comparable methods. Furthermore, to
facilitate research on complex, multi-reference virtual try-on, we introduce
DressCode-MR, a new large-scale dataset. It comprises 28,179 sets of
high-quality, paired images covering five key categories (tops, bottoms,
dresses, shoes, and bags), constructed through a pipeline of expert models and
human feedback refinement. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD, DressCode,
and our DressCode-MR datasets show that FastFit surpasses state-of-the-art
methods on key fidelity metrics while offering its significant advantage in
inference efficiency.

Conclusion: UTA-Sign方法有效解决了低光照环境下交通标志感知的挑战，通过多模态融合提升了自动驾驶系统的环境理解能力

Abstract: The thermal camera excels at perceiving outdoor environments under low-light
conditions, making it ideal for applications such as nighttime autonomous
driving and unmanned navigation. However, thermal cameras encounter challenges
when capturing signage from objects made of similar materials, which can pose
safety risks for accurately understanding semantics in autonomous driving
systems. In contrast, the neuromorphic vision camera, also known as an event
camera, detects changes in light intensity asynchronously and has proven
effective in high-speed, low-light traffic environments. Recognizing the
complementary characteristics of these two modalities, this paper proposes
UTA-Sign, an unsupervised thermal-event video augmentation for traffic signage
in low-illumination environments, targeting elements such as license plates and
roadblock indicators. To address the signage blind spots of thermal imaging and
the non-uniform sampling of event cameras, we developed a dual-boosting
mechanism that fuses thermal frames and event signals for consistent signage
representation over time. The proposed method utilizes thermal frames to
provide accurate motion cues as temporal references for aligning the uneven
event signals. At the same time, event signals contribute subtle signage
content to the raw thermal frames, enhancing the overall understanding of the
environment. The proposed method is validated on datasets collected from
real-world scenarios, demonstrating superior quality in traffic signage
sketching and improved detection accuracy at the perceptual level.

Abstract: Deepfake technology, driven by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), poses
significant risks to privacy and societal security. Existing detection methods
are predominantly passive, focusing on post-event analysis without preventing
attacks. To address this, we propose an active defense method based on
low-frequency perceptual perturbations to disrupt face swapping manipulation,
reducing the performance and naturalness of generated content. Unlike prior
approaches that used low-frequency perturbations to impact classification
accuracy,our method directly targets the generative process of deepfake
techniques. We combine frequency and spatial domain features to strengthen
defenses. By introducing artifacts through low-frequency perturbations while
preserving high-frequency details, we ensure the output remains visually
plausible. Additionally, we design a complete architecture featuring an
encoder, a perturbation generator, and a decoder, leveraging discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to extract low-frequency components and generate perturbations
that disrupt facial manipulation models. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW
demonstrate significant reductions in face-swapping effectiveness, improved
defense success rates, and preservation of visual quality.

Abstract: In semiconductor manufacturing, defect detection and localization are
critical to ensuring product quality and yield. While X-ray imaging is a
reliable non-destructive testing method, it is memory-intensive and
time-consuming for large-scale scanning, Magnetic Field Imaging (MFI) offers a
more efficient means to localize regions of interest (ROI) for targeted X-ray
scanning. However, the limited availability of MFI datasets due to proprietary
concerns presents a significant bottleneck for training machine learning (ML)
models using MFI. To address this challenge, we consider an ML-driven approach
leveraging diffusion models with two physical constraints. We propose Physics
Informed Generative Models for Magnetic Field Images (PI-GenMFI) to generate
synthetic MFI samples by integrating specific physical information. We generate
MFI images for the most common defect types: power shorts. These synthetic
images will serve as training data for ML algorithms designed to localize
defect areas efficiently. To evaluate generated MFIs, we compare our model to
SOTA generative models from both variational autoencoder (VAE) and diffusion
methods. We present a domain expert evaluation to assess the generated samples.
In addition, we present qualitative and quantitative evaluation using various
metrics used for image generation and signal processing, showing promising
results to optimize the defect localization process.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了数据重建攻击的有效性，揭示了Split Inference范式中的严重隐私风险

Abstract: The growing complexity of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has led to the adoption
of Split Inference (SI), a collaborative paradigm that partitions computation
between edge devices and the cloud to reduce latency and protect user privacy.
However, recent advances in Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRAs) reveal that
intermediate features exchanged in SI can be exploited to recover sensitive
input data, posing significant privacy risks. Existing DRAs are typically
effective only on shallow models and fail to fully leverage semantic priors,
limiting their reconstruction quality and generalizability across datasets and
model architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN-based DRA framework
with Progressive Feature Optimization (PFO), which decomposes the generator
into hierarchical blocks and incrementally refines intermediate representations
to enhance the semantic fidelity of reconstructed images. To stabilize the
optimization and improve image realism, we introduce an L1-ball constraint
during reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
prior attacks by a large margin, especially in high-resolution scenarios,
out-of-distribution settings, and against deeper and more complex DNNs.

Abstract: Emotional talking head synthesis aims to generate talking portrait videos

emotional prompts are integrated through a text-guided decoupled emotive
module, enhancing the spatial knowledge to improve emotion comprehension. To
improve the relationship between audio and emotion, we introduce an emotive
audio attention module to capture the interplay between controlled emotion and
driving audio, generating emotion-aware features to guide more precise facial
motion synthesis. Additionally, we construct an emotional talking head dataset
with comprehensive emotive text descriptions to optimize the framework's
performance. Based on the proposed dataset, we propose an emotion-aware
sampling training strategy and a progressive functional training strategy that
further improve the model's ability to capture nuanced expressive features and
achieve accurate lip-synchronization. Overall, EmoCAST achieves
state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic, emotionally expressive,

Abstract: Identifying sitters in historical paintings is a key task for art historians,
offering insight into their lives and how they chose to be seen. However, the
process is often subjective and limited by the lack of data and stylistic
variations. Automated facial recognition is capable of handling challenging
conditions and can assist, but while traditional facial recognition models
perform well on photographs, they struggle with paintings due to domain shift
and high intra-class variation. Artistic factors such as style, skill, intent,
and influence from other works further complicate recognition. In this work, we
investigate the potential of foundation models to improve facial recognition in
artworks. By fine-tuning foundation models and integrating their embeddings
with those from conventional facial recognition networks, we demonstrate
notable improvements over current state-of-the-art methods. Our results show
that foundation models can bridge the gap where traditional methods are

Abstract: Preserving facial identity under extreme stylistic transformation remains a
major challenge in generative art. In graffiti, a high-contrast, abstract
medium, subtle distortions to the eyes, nose, or mouth can erase the subject's
recognizability, undermining both personal and cultural authenticity. We
present CraftGraffiti, an end-to-end text-guided graffiti generation framework
designed with facial feature preservation as a primary objective. Given an
input image and a style and pose descriptive prompt, CraftGraffiti first
applies graffiti style transfer via LoRA-fine-tuned pretrained diffusion
transformer, then enforces identity fidelity through a face-consistent
self-attention mechanism that augments attention layers with explicit identity
embeddings. Pose customization is achieved without keypoints, using CLIP-guided
prompt extension to enable dynamic re-posing while retaining facial coherence.
We formally justify and empirically validate the "style-first, identity-after"
paradigm, showing it reduces attribute drift compared to the reverse order.
Quantitative results demonstrate competitive facial feature consistency and
state-of-the-art aesthetic and human preference scores, while qualitative

Abstract: Neural Video Compression (NVC) has achieved remarkable performance in recent
years. However, precise rate control remains a challenge due to the inherent
limitations of learning-based codecs. To solve this issue, we propose a dynamic
video compression framework designed for variable bitrate scenarios. First, to
achieve variable bitrate implementation, we propose the Dynamic-Route
Autoencoder with variable coding routes, each occupying partial computational
complexity of the whole network and navigating to a distinct RD trade-off.
Second, to approach the target bitrate, the Rate Control Agent estimates the
bitrate of each route and adjusts the coding route of DRA at run time. To
encompass a broad spectrum of variable bitrates while preserving overall RD
performance, we employ the Joint-Routes Optimization strategy, achieving
collaborative training of various routes. Extensive experiments on the HEVC and
UVG datasets show that the proposed method achieves an average BD-Rate
reduction of 14.8% and BD-PSNR gain of 0.47dB over state-of-the-art methods
while maintaining an average bitrate error of 1.66%, achieving

Abstract: Accurate cardiac motion estimation from cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)
images is vital for assessing cardiac function and detecting its abnormalities.
Existing methods often struggle to capture heart motion accurately because they
rely on intensity-based image registration similarity losses that may overlook
cardiac anatomical regions. To address this, we propose CardioMorphNet, a
recurrent Bayesian deep learning framework for 3D cardiac shape-guided
deformable registration using short-axis (SAX) CMR images. It employs a
recurrent variational autoencoder to model spatio-temporal dependencies over
the cardiac cycle and two posterior models for bi-ventricular segmentation and
motion estimation. The derived loss function from the Bayesian formulation
guides the framework to focus on anatomical regions by recursively registering
segmentation maps without using intensity-based image registration similarity
loss, while leveraging sequential SAX volumes and spatio-temporal features. The
Bayesian modelling also enables computation of uncertainty maps for the
estimated motion fields. Validated on the UK Biobank dataset by comparing
warped mask shapes with ground truth masks, CardioMorphNet demonstrates
superior performance in cardiac motion estimation, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods. Uncertainty assessment shows that it also yields
lower uncertainty values for estimated motion fields in the cardiac region
compared with other probabilistic-based cardiac registration methods,
indicating higher confidence in its predictions.

Abstract: Point cloud registration is crucial for ensuring 3D alignment consistency of
multiple local point clouds in 3D reconstruction for remote sensing or digital
heritage. While various point cloud-based registration methods exist, both
non-learning and learning-based, they ignore point orientations and point
uncertainties, making the model susceptible to noisy input and aggressive
rotations of the input point cloud like orthogonal transformation; thus, it
necessitates extensive training point clouds with transformation augmentations.
To address these issues, we propose a novel surfel-based pose learning
regression approach. Our method can initialize surfels from Lidar point cloud
using virtual perspective camera parameters, and learns explicit

TL;DR: DVCTNet是一个用于牙科X光片龋齿检测的双视图协同训练网络，通过全局全景图像和局部牙齿图像的双视图融合，结合门控交叉注意力机制，显著提升了龋齿检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前龋齿检测方法由于对比度变化细微和病变形态多样而导致准确率不佳，受牙医临床工作流程启发，需要结合全局筛查和局部详细检查来提高检测性能。

Method: 使用自动牙齿检测建立全局和局部两个互补视图，分别预训练视觉基础模型，通过门控交叉注意力模块(GCV-Atten)动态融合双视图特征，并将融合特征整合到检测模型中进行最终检测。

Result: 在公开数据集和新构建的高精度数据集上均优于现有最先进方法，证明了该方法的临床适用性。

Conclusion: DVCTNet通过双视图协同训练和特征融合机制，有效提升了牙科X光片龋齿检测的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Accurate dental caries detection from panoramic X-rays plays a pivotal role
in preventing lesion progression. However, current detection methods often
yield suboptimal accuracy due to subtle contrast variations and diverse lesion
morphology of dental caries. In this work, inspired by the clinical workflow
where dentists systematically combine whole-image screening with detailed
tooth-level inspection, we present DVCTNet, a novel Dual-View Co-Training
network for accurate dental caries detection. Our DVCTNet starts with employing
automated tooth detection to establish two complementary views: a global view
from panoramic X-ray images and a local view from cropped tooth images. We then
pretrain two vision foundation models separately on the two views. The
global-view foundation model serves as the detection backbone, generating
region proposals and global features, while the local-view model extracts
detailed features from corresponding cropped tooth patches matched by the
region proposals. To effectively integrate information from both views, we
introduce a Gated Cross-View Attention (GCV-Atten) module that dynamically
fuses dual-view features, enhancing the detection pipeline by integrating the
fused features back into the detection model for final caries detection. To
rigorously evaluate our DVCTNet, we test it on a public dataset and further
validate its performance on a newly curated, high-precision dental caries
detection dataset, annotated using both intra-oral images and panoramic X-rays
for double verification. Experimental results demonstrate DVCTNet's superior
performance against existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on both datasets,
indicating the clinical applicability of our method. Our code and labeled
dataset are available at https://github.com/ShanghaiTech-IMPACT/DVCTNet.

TL;DR: FusionCounting是一个新颖的多任务学习框架，将人群计数集成到可见光和红外图像融合(VIF)过程中，通过动态损失加权和对抗训练提升融合质量和计数性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VIF方法主要关注图像质量优化，虽然近期研究开始结合下游任务提供语义指导，但语义分割需要大量标注，目标检测在拥挤场景中面临边界框重叠和遮挡问题。RGB-T人群计数虽受关注，但尚未与VIF集成。

Method: 提出多任务学习框架FusionCounting，将人群计数与VIF统一。采用动态损失函数加权策略加速收敛和平衡任务贡献，结合对抗训练增强模型鲁棒性和抗攻击能力。

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验表明，FusionCounting不仅提升了图像融合质量，还实现了优越的人群计数性能。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了VIF与下游任务集成的问题，特别适用于密集场景，为多模态图像处理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Most visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) methods focus primarily on
optimizing fused image quality. Recent studies have begun incorporating
downstream tasks, such as semantic segmentation and object detection, to
provide semantic guidance for VIF. However, semantic segmentation requires
extensive annotations, while object detection, despite reducing annotation
efforts compared with segmentation, faces challenges in highly crowded scenes
due to overlapping bounding boxes and occlusion. Moreover, although RGB-T crowd
counting has gained increasing attention in recent years, no studies have
integrated VIF and crowd counting into a unified framework. To address these
challenges, we propose FusionCounting, a novel multi-task learning framework
that integrates crowd counting into the VIF process. Crowd counting provides a
direct quantitative measure of population density with minimal annotation,
making it particularly suitable for dense scenes. Our framework leverages both
input images and population density information in a mutually beneficial
multi-task design. To accelerate convergence and balance tasks contributions,
we introduce a dynamic loss function weighting strategy. Furthermore, we
incorporate adversarial training to enhance the robustness of both VIF and
crowd counting, improving the model's stability and resilience to adversarial
attacks. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that
FusionCounting not only enhances image fusion quality but also achieves
superior crowd counting performance.

Abstract: Pacreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal forms
of cancer, with a five-year survival rate below 10% primarily due to late
detection. This research develops and validates a deep learning framework for
early PDAC detection through analysis of dual-modality imaging:
autofluorescence and second harmonic generation (SHG). We analyzed 40 unique
patient samples to create a specialized neural network capable of
distinguishing between normal, fibrotic, and cancerous tissue. Our methodology
evaluated six distinct deep learning architectures, comparing traditional
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with modern Vision Transformers (ViTs).
Through systematic experimentation, we identified and overcome significant
challenges in medical image analysis, including limited dataset size and class
imbalance. The final optimized framework, based on a modified ResNet
architecture with frozen pre-trained layers and class-weighted training,
achieved over 90% accuracy in cancer detection. This represents a significant
improvement over current manual analysis methods an demonstrates potential for
clinical deployment. This work establishes a robust pipeline for automated PDAC
detection that can augment pathologists' capabilities while providing a
foundation for future expansion to other cancer types. The developed
methodology also offers valuable insights for applying deep learning to
limited-size medical imaging datasets, a common challenge in clinical
applications.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle perception typically relies on modular pipelines that
decompose the task into detection, tracking, and prediction. While
interpretable, these pipelines suffer from error accumulation and limited

methods along task integration, tracking formulation, and representation flow.
We define three paradigms -Early, Late, and Full Unified Perception- and
systematically review existing methods, their architectures, training
strategies, datasets used, and open-source availability, while highlighting
future research directions. This work establishes the first comprehensive
framework for understanding and advancing unified perception, consolidates
fragmented efforts, and guides future research toward more robust,

Abstract: Images manipulated using image editing tools can mislead viewers and pose
significant risks to social security. However, accurately localizing the
manipulated regions within an image remains a challenging problem. One of the
main barriers in this area is the high cost of data acquisition and the severe
lack of high-quality annotated datasets. To address this challenge, we
introduce novel methods that mitigate data scarcity by leveraging readily
available web data. We utilize a large collection of manually forged images
from the web, as well as automatically generated annotations derived from a
simpler auxiliary task, constrained image manipulation localization.
Specifically, we introduce a new paradigm CAAAv2, which automatically and
accurately annotates manipulated regions at the pixel level. To further improve
annotation quality, we propose a novel metric, QES, which filters out
unreliable annotations. Through CAAA v2 and QES, we construct MIMLv2, a
large-scale, diverse, and high-quality dataset containing 246,212 manually
forged images with pixel-level mask annotations. This is over 120x larger than
existing handcrafted datasets like IMD20. Additionally, we introduce Object
Jitter, a technique that further enhances model training by generating
high-quality manipulation artifacts. Building on these advances, we develop a
new model, Web-IML, designed to effectively leverage web-scale supervision for
the image manipulation localization task. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach substantially alleviates the data scarcity problem and
significantly improves the performance of various models on multiple real-world
forgery benchmarks. With the proposed web supervision, Web-IML achieves a
striking performance gain of 31% and surpasses previous SOTA TruFor by 24.1
average IoU points. The dataset and code will be made publicly available at

Abstract: Simulating detector responses is a crucial part of understanding the inner
workings of particle collisions in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Such
simulations are currently performed with statistical Monte Carlo methods, which
are computationally expensive and put a significant strain on CERN's
computational grid. Therefore, recent proposals advocate for generative machine
learning methods to enable more efficient simulations. However, the
distribution of the data varies significantly across the simulations, which is
hard to capture with out-of-the-box methods. In this study, we present
ExpertSim - a deep learning simulation approach tailored for the Zero Degree
Calorimeter in the ALICE experiment. Our method utilizes a
Mixture-of-Generative-Experts architecture, where each expert specializes in
simulating a different subset of the data. This allows for a more precise and
efficient generation process, as each expert focuses on a specific aspect of
the calorimeter response. ExpertSim not only improves accuracy, but also
provides a significant speedup compared to the traditional Monte-Carlo methods,
offering a promising solution for high-efficiency detector simulations in
particle physics experiments at CERN. We make the code available at

Abstract: Labeled handwriting data is often scarce, limiting the effectiveness of
recognition systems that require diverse, style-consistent training samples.
Handwriting synthesis offers a promising solution by generating artificial data
to augment training. However, current methods face two major limitations.
First, most are built on conventional convolutional architectures, which
struggle to model long-range dependencies and complex stroke patterns. Second,
they largely ignore the crucial role of frequency information, which is
essential for capturing fine-grained stylistic and structural details in
handwriting. To address these challenges, we propose FW-GAN, a one-shot
handwriting synthesis framework that generates realistic, writer-consistent
text from a single example. Our generator integrates a phase-aware Wave-MLP to
better capture spatial relationships while preserving subtle stylistic cues. We
further introduce a frequency-guided discriminator that leverages
high-frequency components to enhance the authenticity detection of generated
samples. Additionally, we introduce a novel Frequency Distribution Loss that
aligns the frequency characteristics of synthetic and real handwriting, thereby
enhancing visual fidelity. Experiments on Vietnamese and English handwriting
datasets demonstrate that FW-GAN generates high-quality, style-consistent
handwriting, making it a valuable tool for augmenting data in low-resource
handwriting recognition (HTR) pipelines. Official implementation is available

approaches and provides the necessary resources to develop more robust methods

tedious per-sequence optimization, our feed-forward model directly predicts 3D
correspondences using a practical number of cameras (e.g., four), enabling
robust and accurate online tracking. Given known camera poses and either
sensor-based or estimated multi-view depth, our tracker fuses multi-view
features into a unified point cloud and applies k-nearest-neighbors correlation
alongside a transformer-based update to reliably estimate long-range 3D
correspondences, even under occlusion. We train on 5K synthetic multi-view
Kubric sequences and evaluate on two real-world benchmarks: Panoptic Studio and
DexYCB, achieving median trajectory errors of 3.1 cm and 2.0 cm, respectively.
Our method generalizes well to diverse camera setups of 1-8 views with varying

Abstract: Content watermarking is an important tool for the authentication and
copyright protection of digital media. However, it is unclear whether existing
watermarks are robust against adversarial attacks. We present the winning
solution to the NeurIPS 2024 Erasing the Invisible challenge, which
stress-tests watermark robustness under varying degrees of adversary knowledge.
The challenge consisted of two tracks: a black-box and beige-box track,
depending on whether the adversary knows which watermarking method was used by
the provider. For the beige-box track, we leverage an adaptive VAE-based
evasion attack, with a test-time optimization and color-contrast restoration in
CIELAB space to preserve the image's quality. For the black-box track, we first
cluster images based on their artifacts in the spatial or frequency-domain.
Then, we apply image-to-image diffusion models with controlled noise injection
and semantic priors from ChatGPT-generated captions to each cluster with
optimized parameter settings. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method
successfully achieves near-perfect watermark removal (95.7%) with negligible
impact on the residual image's quality. We hope that our attacks inspire the
development of more robust image watermarking methods.

Abstract: Reliable localization is critical for robot navigation, yet most existing
systems implicitly assume that all viewing directions at a location are equally
informative. In practice, localization becomes unreliable when the robot
observes unmapped, ambiguous, or uninformative regions. To address this, we
present ActLoc, an active viewpoint-aware planning framework for enhancing
localization accuracy for general robot navigation tasks. At its core, ActLoc
employs a largescale trained attention-based model for viewpoint selection. The
model encodes a metric map and the camera poses used during map construction,
and predicts localization accuracy across yaw and pitch directions at arbitrary
3D locations. These per-point accuracy distributions are incorporated into a
path planner, enabling the robot to actively select camera orientations that
maximize localization robustness while respecting task and motion constraints.
ActLoc achieves stateof-the-art results on single-viewpoint selection and
generalizes effectively to fulltrajectory planning. Its modular design makes it
readily applicable to diverse robot navigation and inspection tasks.

Motivation: 针对360度全景视频中球形畸变和空间音频整合的复杂性，以及缺乏全面的音频-视觉显著性预测数据集的问题，研究旨在探索如何利用音频-视觉线索有效预测360度视频中的视觉显著性。

Method: 构建了YT360-EyeTracking数据集（81个ODV视频），提出了基于视觉Transformer的SalViT360框架（具有球形几何感知的时空注意力层），以及SalViT360-AV模型（进一步整合了基于音频输入的Transformer适配器）。

Result: 在多个基准数据集（包括YT360-EyeTracking）上的实验结果表明，SalViT360和SalViT360-AV在预测360度场景中的观看者注意力方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 在模型架构中整合空间音频线索对于准确预测全景视频中的显著性至关重要。

Abstract: Omnidirectional videos (ODVs) are redefining viewer experiences in virtual
reality (VR) by offering an unprecedented full field-of-view (FOV). This study
extends the domain of saliency prediction to 360-degree environments,
addressing the complexities of spherical distortion and the integration of
spatial audio. Contextually, ODVs have transformed user experience by adding a
spatial audio dimension that aligns sound direction with the viewer's
perspective in spherical scenes. Motivated by the lack of comprehensive
datasets for 360-degree audio-visual saliency prediction, our study curates
YT360-EyeTracking, a new dataset of 81 ODVs, each observed under varying
audio-visual conditions. Our goal is to explore how to utilize audio-visual
cues to effectively predict visual saliency in 360-degree videos. Towards this
aim, we propose two novel saliency prediction models: SalViT360, a
vision-transformer-based framework for ODVs equipped with spherical
geometry-aware spatio-temporal attention layers, and SalViT360-AV, which
further incorporates transformer adapters conditioned on audio input. Our
results on a number of benchmark datasets, including our YT360-EyeTracking,
demonstrate that SalViT360 and SalViT360-AV significantly outperform existing
methods in predicting viewer attention in 360-degree scenes. Interpreting these
results, we suggest that integrating spatial audio cues in the model
architecture is crucial for accurate saliency prediction in omnidirectional
videos. Code and dataset will be available at

TL;DR: 本文探讨了在iPhone 15 Pro Max上使用LiDAR技术进行实时背景去除的方法，通过深度信息替代传统色度键和AI模型，在各类光照条件下都能稳定工作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统背景去除技术如色度键和AI模型对光照条件敏感，在低光环境下效果不佳。LiDAR的深度信息不受光照影响，可以提供更稳定的背景去除效果。

Method: 集成iPhone 15 Pro Max的LiDAR和彩色摄像头，使用SwiftUI和Swift框架开发用户界面和后端，采用Metal Shader Language实现60fps的实时图像增强处理。

Result: 系统能够在60fps下实时运行，深度图分辨率为320x240。LiDAR技术在各种光照条件下都能提供稳定的背景去除效果，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 如果移动设备LiDAR分辨率能够提升到与彩色图像匹配的水平，LiDAR技术有望成为视频和摄影应用中背景去除的主流方法。

Abstract: Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology in consumer-grade mobile
devices can be used as a replacement for traditional background removal and
compositing techniques. Unlike approaches such as chroma keying and trained AI
models, LiDAR's depth information is independent of subject lighting, and
performs equally well in low-light and well-lit environments. We integrate the
LiDAR and color cameras on the iPhone 15 Pro Max with GPU-based image
processing. We use Apple's SwiftUI and Swift frameworks for user interface and
backend development, and Metal Shader Language (MSL) for realtime image
enhancement at the standard iPhone streaming frame rate of 60 frames per
second. The only meaningful limitations of the technology are the streaming
bandwidth of the depth data, which currently reduces the depth map resolution
to 320x240, and any pre-existing limitations of the LiDAR IR laser to reflect
accurate depth from some materials. If the LiDAR resolution on a mobile device
like the iPhone can be improved to match the color image resolution, LiDAR
could feasibly become the preeminent method of background removal for video
applications and photography.

Motivation: 现有显著目标检测方法在复杂场景中容易丢失细节、模糊边缘，且单模态信息融合不足，需要提升检测精度和鲁棒性

Method: 设计动态不确定性图卷积模块(DUGC)传播层间不确定性，提出多模态协同融合策略(MCF)加权融合RGB、深度和边缘特征的注意力图，使用多尺度BCE和IoU损失优化检测性能

Result: 在大多数常见基准数据集上优于各种SOD方法，特别是在边缘清晰度和对复杂背景的鲁棒性方面表现突出

Conclusion: DUP-MCRNet通过不确定性传播和多模态协同推理有效提升了显著目标检测的性能，特别是在细节保持和边缘清晰度方面

Abstract: In view of the problems that existing salient object detection (SOD) methods
are prone to losing details, blurring edges, and insufficient fusion of
single-modal information in complex scenes, this paper proposes a dynamic
uncertainty propagation and multimodal collaborative reasoning network
(DUP-MCRNet). Firstly, a dynamic uncertainty graph convolution module (DUGC) is
designed to propagate uncertainty between layers through a sparse graph
constructed based on spatial semantic distance, and combined with channel
adaptive interaction, it effectively improves the detection accuracy of small
structures and edge regions. Secondly, a multimodal collaborative fusion
strategy (MCF) is proposed, which uses learnable modality gating weights to
weightedly fuse the attention maps of RGB, depth, and edge features. It can
dynamically adjust the importance of each modality according to different
scenes, effectively suppress redundant or interfering information, and
strengthen the semantic complementarity and consistency between
cross-modalities, thereby improving the ability to identify salient regions
under occlusion, weak texture or background interference. Finally, the
detection performance at the pixel level and region level is optimized through
multi-scale BCE and IoU loss, cross-scale consistency constraints, and
uncertainty-guided supervision mechanisms. Extensive experiments show that
DUP-MCRNet outperforms various SOD methods on most common benchmark datasets,
especially in terms of edge clarity and robustness to complex backgrounds. Our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/YukiBear426/DUP-MCRNet.

Conclusion: 多尺度BEV特征生成和特征金字塔网络的结合有效解决了多视角行人检测中的尺度变化问题，显著提升了检测精度

Abstract: Multi-View Pedestrian Detection (MVPD) aims to detect pedestrians in the form
of a bird's eye view (BEV) from multi-view images. In MVPD, end-to-end
trainable deep learning methods have progressed greatly. However, they often
struggle to detect pedestrians with consistently small or large scales in views
or with vastly different scales between views. This is because they do not
exploit multi-scale image features to generate the BEV feature and detect
pedestrians. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel MVPD method, called
Multi-Scale Multi-View Detection (MSMVD). MSMVD generates multi-scale BEV
features by projecting multi-scale image features extracted from individual
views into the BEV space, scale-by-scale. Each of these BEV features inherits
the properties of its corresponding scale image features from multiple views.
Therefore, these BEV features help the precise detection of pedestrians with
consistently small or large scales in views. Then, MSMVD combines information
at different scales of multiple views by processing the multi-scale BEV
features using a feature pyramid network. This improves the detection of
pedestrians with vastly different scales between views. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that exploiting multi-scale image features via multi-scale BEV
features greatly improves the detection performance, and MSMVD outperforms the
previous highest MODA by $4.5$ points on the GMVD dataset.

Method: 提出了双重不确定性优化（DUO）框架，包括：1）通过凸优化视角推导出新颖的无监督focal loss，实现标签无关的不确定性加权；2）设计语义感知的法向量场约束，保持几何一致性；3）建立语义和几何的双分支互补机制。

Conclusion: DUO是首个专门针对单目3D目标检测双重不确定性问题的测试时自适应框架，通过联合优化语义和几何不确定性显著提升了模型在域偏移下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) is pivotal for safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, yet its reliability deteriorates
significantly under real-world domain shifts caused by environmental or sensor
variations. To address these shifts, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods have
emerged, enabling models to adapt to target distributions during inference.
While prior TTA approaches recognize the positive correlation between low
uncertainty and high generalization ability, they fail to address the dual
uncertainty inherent to M3OD: semantic uncertainty (ambiguous class
predictions) and geometric uncertainty (unstable spatial localization). To
bridge this gap, we propose Dual Uncertainty Optimization (DUO), the first TTA
framework designed to jointly minimize both uncertainties for robust M3OD.
Through a convex optimization lens, we introduce an innovative convex structure
of the focal loss and further derive a novel unsupervised version, enabling
label-agnostic uncertainty weighting and balanced learning for high-uncertainty
objects. In parallel, we design a semantic-aware normal field constraint that
preserves geometric coherence in regions with clear semantic cues, reducing
uncertainty from the unstable 3D representation. This dual-branch mechanism
forms a complementary loop: enhanced spatial perception improves semantic
classification, and robust semantic predictions further refine spatial
understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DUO over
existing methods across various datasets and domain shift types.

Result: 在3DGS使用的参考数据集上，新的标定方法平均带来0.4 dB PSNR的提升

Conclusion: 虽然微调过程可能耗时，但对于参考场景（如Mip-NeRF 360）的标定，新视角质量的重要性最为关键

Abstract: The quality of the camera calibration is of major importance for evaluating
progresses in novel view synthesis, as a 1-pixel error on the calibration has a
significant impact on the reconstruction quality. While there is no ground
truth for real scenes, the quality of the calibration is assessed by the
quality of the novel view synthesis. This paper proposes to use a 3DGS model to
fine tune calibration by backpropagation of novel view color loss with respect
to the cameras parameters. The new calibration alone brings an average
improvement of 0.4 dB PSNR on the dataset used as reference by 3DGS. The fine
tuning may be long and its suitability depends on the criticity of training
time, but for calibration of reference scenes, such as Mip-NeRF 360, the stake
of novel view quality is the most important.

Abstract: Estimating Body Mass Index (BMI) from camera images with machine learning
models enables rapid weight assessment when traditional methods are unavailable
or impractical, such as in telehealth or emergency scenarios. Existing computer
vision approaches have been limited to datasets of up to 14,500 images. In this
study, we present a deep learning-based BMI estimation method trained on our
WayBED dataset, a large proprietary collection of 84,963 smartphone images from
25,353 individuals. We introduce an automatic filtering method that uses
posture clustering and person detection to curate the dataset by removing
low-quality images, such as those with atypical postures or incomplete views.
This process retained 71,322 high-quality images suitable for training. We
achieve a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 7.9% on our hold-out test
set (WayBED data) using full-body images, the lowest value in the published
literature to the best of our knowledge. Further, we achieve a MAPE of 13% on
the completely unseen~(during training) VisualBodyToBMI dataset, comparable
with state-of-the-art approaches trained on it, demonstrating robust
generalization. Lastly, we fine-tune our model on VisualBodyToBMI and achieve a
MAPE of 8.56%, the lowest reported value on this dataset so far. We deploy the
full pipeline, including image filtering and BMI estimation, on Android devices
using the CLAID framework. We release our complete code for model training,
filtering, and the CLAID package for mobile deployment as open-source

Abstract: Intraoperative ultrasound images are inherently challenging to interpret in
liver surgery due to the limited field of view and complex anatomical
structures. Bridging the gap between preoperative and intraoperative data is
crucial for effective surgical guidance. 3D IntraVascular UltraSound (IVUS)
offers a potential solution by enabling the reconstruction of the entire organ,
which facilitates registration between preoperative computed tomography (CT)
scans and intraoperative IVUS images. In this work, we propose an
optimization-based calibration method using a 3D-printed phantom for accurate
3D Intravascular Ultrasound volume reconstruction. Our approach ensures precise
alignment of tracked IVUS data with preoperative CT images, improving
intraoperative navigation. We validated our method using in vivo swine liver
images, achieving a calibration error from 0.88 to 1.80 mm and a registration
error from 3.40 to 5.71 mm between the 3D IVUS data and the corresponding CT
scan. Our method provides a reliable and accurate means of calibration and
volume reconstruction. It can be used to register intraoperative ultrasound
images with preoperative CT images in the context of liver surgery, and enhance
intraoperative guidance.

Abstract: Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have significantly boosted the
reconstruction of head avatars, enabling high-quality facial modeling by
representing an 3D avatar as a collection of 3D Gaussians. However, existing
methods predominantly rely on frontal-view images, leaving the back-head poorly
constructed. This leads to geometric inconsistencies, structural blurring, and
reduced realism in the rear regions, ultimately limiting the fidelity of
reconstructed avatars. To address this challenge, we propose AvatarBack, a
novel plug-and-play framework specifically designed to reconstruct complete and
consistent 3D Gaussian avatars by explicitly modeling the missing back-head
regions. AvatarBack integrates two core technical innovations,i.e., the
Subject-specific Generator (SSG) and the Adaptive Spatial Alignment Strategy
(ASA). The former leverages a generative prior to synthesize
identity-consistent, plausible back-view pseudo-images from sparse frontal
inputs, providing robust multi-view supervision. To achieve precise geometric
alignment between these synthetic views and the 3D Gaussian representation, the
later employs learnable transformation matrices optimized during training,
effectively resolving inherent pose and coordinate discrepancies. Extensive
experiments on NeRSemble and K-hairstyle datasets, evaluated using geometric,
photometric, and GPT-4o-based perceptual metrics, demonstrate that AvatarBack
significantly enhances back-head reconstruction quality while preserving
frontal fidelity. Moreover, the reconstructed avatars maintain consistent
visual realism under diverse motions and remain fully animatable.

Abstract: In the era of Industry 5.0, monitoring human activity is essential for
ensuring both ergonomic safety and overall well-being. While multi-camera
centralized setups improve pose estimation accuracy, they often suffer from
high computational costs and bandwidth requirements, limiting scalability and
real-time applicability. Distributing processing across edge devices can reduce
network bandwidth and computational load. On the other hand, the constrained
resources of edge devices lead to accuracy degradation, and the distribution of
computation leads to temporal and spatial inconsistencies. We address this
challenge by proposing COMETH (Convex Optimization for Multiview Estimation and
Tracking of Humans), a lightweight algorithm for real-time multi-view human
pose fusion that relies on three concepts: it integrates kinematic and
biomechanical constraints to increase the joint positioning accuracy; it
employs convex optimization-based inverse kinematics for spatial fusion; and it
implements a state observer to improve temporal consistency. We evaluate COMETH
on both public and industrial datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in localization, detection, and tracking accuracy. The proposed fusion
pipeline enables accurate and scalable human motion tracking, making it
well-suited for industrial and safety-critical applications. The code is

Result: 与手动非线性回归相比达到8.0%的平均绝对偏差，每扫描推理时间低于20秒，相比现有深度学习和半自动化流程（误差25-30%，处理时间60+秒）有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了高度准确、高效且可扩展的临床肺结节筛查和监测工具，对改善肺癌早期检测具有重要潜力。

Abstract: Early detection of lung cancer is crucial for effective treatment and relies
on accurate volumetric assessment of pulmonary nodules in CT scans. Traditional
methods, such as consolidation-to-tumor ratio (CTR) and spherical
approximation, are limited by inconsistent estimates due to variability in
nodule shape and density. We propose an advanced framework that combines a
multi-scale 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) with subtype-specific bias
correction for precise volume estimation. The model was trained and evaluated
on a dataset of 364 cases from Shanghai Chest Hospital. Our approach achieved a
mean absolute deviation of 8.0 percent compared to manual nonlinear regression,
with inference times under 20 seconds per scan. This method outperforms
existing deep learning and semi-automated pipelines, which typically have
errors of 25 to 30 percent and require over 60 seconds for processing. Our
results show a reduction in error by over 17 percentage points and a threefold
acceleration in processing speed. These advancements offer a highly accurate,
efficient, and scalable tool for clinical lung nodule screening and monitoring,
with promising potential for improving early lung cancer detection.

Abstract: Metastasis remains the major challenge in the clinical management of head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Reliable pre-treatment prediction of
metastatic risk is crucial for optimizing treatment strategies and prognosis.
This study develops a deep learning-based multimodal framework to predict
metastasis risk in HNSCC patients by integrating computed tomography (CT)
images, radiomics, and clinical data. 1497 HNSCC patients were included. Tumor
and organ masks were derived from pretreatment CT images. A 3D Swin Transformer
extracted deep features from tumor regions. Meanwhile, 1562 radiomics features
were obtained using PyRadiomics, followed by correlation filtering and random
forest selection, leaving 36 features. Clinical variables including age, sex,
smoking, and alcohol status were encoded and fused with imaging-derived
features. Multimodal features were fed into a fully connected network to
predict metastasis risk. Performance was evaluated using five-fold
cross-validation with area under the curve (AUC), accuracy (ACC), sensitivity
(SEN), and specificity (SPE). The proposed fusion model outperformed
single-modality models. The 3D deep learning module alone achieved an AUC of
0.715, and when combined with radiomics and clinical features, predictive
performance improved (AUC = 0.803, ACC = 0.752, SEN = 0.730, SPE = 0.758).
Stratified analysis showed generalizability across tumor subtypes. Ablation
studies indicated complementary information from different modalities.
Evaluation showed the 3D Swin Transformer provided more robust representation
learning than conventional networks. This multimodal fusion model demonstrated
high accuracy and robustness in predicting metastasis risk in HNSCC, offering a
comprehensive representation of tumor biology. The interpretable model has
potential as a clinical decision-support tool for personalized treatment
planning.

Abstract: Accelerated Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR) image reconstruction
remains a critical challenge due to the trade-off between scan time and image
quality, particularly when generalizing across diverse acquisition settings. We
propose GENRE-CMR, a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based architecture
employing a residual deep unrolled reconstruction framework to enhance
reconstruction fidelity and generalization. The architecture unrolls iterative
optimization into a cascade of convolutional subnetworks, enriched with
residual connections to enable progressive feature propagation from shallow to
deeper stages. To further improve performance, we integrate two loss functions:
(1) an Edge-Aware Region (EAR) loss, which guides the network to focus on
structurally informative regions and helps prevent common reconstruction
blurriness; and (2) a Statistical Distribution Alignment (SDA) loss, which
regularizes the feature space across diverse data distributions via a symmetric
KL divergence formulation. Extensive experiments confirm that GENRE-CMR
surpasses state-of-the-art methods on training and unseen data, achieving
0.9552 SSIM and 38.90 dB PSNR on unseen distributions across various
acceleration factors and sampling trajectories. Ablation studies confirm the
contribution of each proposed component to reconstruction quality and
generalization. Our framework presents a unified and robust solution for
high-quality CMR reconstruction, paving the way for clinically adaptable
deployment across heterogeneous acquisition protocols.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to more studies to enhance golfers'

established the relationship between swing posture and ball trajectory,
limiting their ability to provide golfers with the necessary insights for swing
improvement. In this paper, we propose a new dataset called CaddieSet, which

CaddieSet extracts joint information from a single swing video by segmenting it
into eight swing phases using a computer vision-based approach. Furthermore,
based on expert golf domain knowledge, we define 15 key metrics that influence
a golf swing, enabling the interpretation of swing outcomes through
swing-related features. Through experiments, we demonstrated the feasibility of
CaddieSet for predicting ball trajectories using various benchmarks. In
particular, we focus on interpretable models among several benchmarks and
verify that swing feedback using our joint features is quantitatively
consistent with established domain knowledge. This work is expected to offer
new insight into golf swing analysis for both academia and the sports industry.

Conclusion: IntentionReasoner通过意图推理和安全重写机制，为LLMs提供了有效的安全保障，在安全性和实用性之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has driven their
adoption across diverse domains, yet their ability to generate harmful content
poses significant safety challenges. While extensive research has focused on
mitigating harmful outputs, such efforts often come at the cost of excessively
rejecting harmless prompts. Striking a balance among safety, over-refusal, and
utility remains a critical challenge. In this work, we introduce
IntentionReasoner, a novel safeguard mechanism that leverages a dedicated guard
model to perform intent reasoning, multi-level safety classification, and query
rewriting to neutralize potentially harmful intent in edge-case queries.
Specifically, we first construct a comprehensive dataset comprising
approximately 163,000 queries, each annotated with intent reasoning, safety
labels, and rewritten versions. Supervised fine-tuning is then applied to equip
the guard model with foundational capabilities in format adherence, intent
analysis, and safe rewriting. Finally, we apply a tailored multi-reward
optimization strategy that integrates rule-based heuristics and reward model
signals within a reinforcement learning framework to further enhance
performance. Extensive experiments show that IntentionReasoner excels in
multiple safeguard benchmarks, generation quality evaluations, and jailbreak
attack scenarios, significantly enhancing safety while effectively reducing
over-refusal rates and improving the quality of responses.

Abstract: Recent studies have explored integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with
search engines to leverage both the LLMs' internal pre-trained knowledge and
external information. Specially, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a
promising paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning through multi-turn interactions
with search engines. However, existing RL-based search agents rely on a single
LLM to handle both search planning and question-answering (QA) tasks in an
end-to-end manner, which limits their ability to optimize both capabilities
simultaneously. In practice, sophisticated AI search systems often employ a
large, frozen LLM (e.g., GPT-4, DeepSeek-R1) to ensure high-quality QA. Thus, a
more effective and efficient approach is to utilize a small, trainable LLM
dedicated to search planning. In this paper, we propose
\textbf{AI-SearchPlanner}, a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to
enhance the performance of frozen QA models by focusing on search planning.
Specifically, our approach introduces three key innovations: 1) Decoupling the
Architecture of the Search Planner and Generator, 2) Dual-Reward Alignment for
Search Planning, and 3) Pareto Optimization of Planning Utility and Cost, to
achieve the objectives. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that AI SearchPlanner outperforms existing RL-based search agents

Conclusion: TCIA是可扩展的高效解决方案，能够使LLM适应现实世界任务聚焦的应用场景

Abstract: Diverse instruction data is vital for effective instruction tuning of large
language models, as it enables the model to generalize across different types
of inputs . Building such diversified instruction dataset is an essential step
in this process. Existing approaches often leverage large language models to
automatically explore and generate diverse instructions, ensuring both data
diversity and quality. However, they tend to overlook an important factor in
real-world applications: on-task relevance. In practice, only a few real-world
applications require a truly general-purpose model; most benefit from
task-specific knowledge tailored to their particular use case. Therefore, it is
vital to develop instruction augmentation methods that not only maintain
diversity but are also optimized for specific, real-world scenarios.
  We thus introduce Task Centric Instruction Augmentation (TCIA), a framework
that systematically expands instructions while preserving both diversity and
task alignment. By representing instructions in a discrete query-constraints
space, TCIA creates a rich set of task-relevant instructions and enables models
to generalize to these task-specific instructions without sacrificing overall
performance. Experiments show that TCIA improves open-source LLMs' performance
by an average of 8.7% across four real-world, task-specific applications, and
in some cases outperforming leading closed-source models. These improvements do
not compromise general instruction-following ability, making TCIA a scalable
and efficient solution for adapting LLMs to real-world, task-focused
applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) serve as an active and promising field of
generative artificial intelligence and have demonstrated abilities to perform
complex tasks in multiple domains, including mathematical and scientific
reasoning. In this work, we construct a novel agent framework for solving
representative problems in scientific computing. The proposed agent,
incorporating a "rewriting-resolution-review-revision" logical chain via three
reasoning LLMs (functioning as the Consultant, Reviewer, and Programmer,
respectively), is integrated in a collaborative and interactive manner. The
Consultant module endows the agent with knowledge transfer capabilities to link
problems to professional domain insights, thereby rewriting problem
descriptions through text augmentation. The Programmer module is responsible
for generating and executing well-structured code to deliver the problem
resolution. The Reviewer module equips the agent with the capacity for
self-debugging and self-refinement through interactive feedback with code
runtime outputs. By leveraging the end-to-end review mechanism, the executable
code provided by the Programmer attains the iterative revision. A comprehensive
evaluation is conducted on the performance of the proposed agent framework in
solving PDEs, ill-conditioned linear systems, and data-driven physical analysis
problems. Compared to single-model, this collaborative framework significantly
improves the bug-free code generation rate and reduces the occurrence of
non-physical solutions, thereby establishing a highly reliable framework for
autonomous code generation based on natural language descriptions. The review
mechanism improved the average execution success (bug-free code and non-NaN
solutions) rate of the latest reasoning models. In summary, our agent framework
establishes automatic code generation and review as a promising scientific
computing paradigm.

Abstract: While code large language models have demonstrated remarkable progress in

address this limitation, we propose an efficiency-oriented reinforcement
learning framework guided by a novel performance reward. Based on this

overcomes the static data constraints of offline fine-tuning, enabling the
discovery of more efficient code implementations. (2) The error-insensitive
reinforcement learning method and high-contrast efficiency signals are crucial
for mitigating systematic errors and achieving effective optimization. (3)
Online exploration is most effective when starting from a high-correctness
baseline, as this allows for efficiency improvements without sacrificing
accuracy. With these discoveries, we finally propose a two-stage tuning method,
which achieves high and balanced performance across correctness and efficiency.
The results of experiments show the effectiveness of the method, which improves

Abstract: The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), marked by
breakthroughs like 'AlphaEvolve' and 'Gemini Deep Think', is beginning to offer
powerful new tools that have the potential to significantly alter the research
practice in many areas of mathematics. This paper explores the current
landscape of publicly accessible large language models (LLMs) in a mathematical
research context, based on developments up to August 2, 2025. Our analysis of
recent benchmarks, such as MathArena and the Open Proof Corpus (Balunovi\'c et
al., 2025; Dekoninck et al., 2025), reveals a complex duality: while
state-of-the-art models demonstrate strong abilities in solving problems and
evaluating proofs, they also exhibit systematic flaws, including a lack of
self-critique and a model depending discrepancy between final-answer accuracy
and full-proof validity.
  Based on these findings, we propose a durable framework for integrating AI
into the research workflow, centered on the principle of the augmented
mathematician. In this model, the AI functions as a copilot under the critical
guidance of the human researcher, an approach distilled into five guiding
principles for effective and responsible use. We then systematically explore
seven fundamental ways AI can be applied across the research lifecycle, from
creativity and ideation to the final writing process, demonstrating how these
principles translate into concrete practice.
  We conclude that the primary role of AI is currently augmentation rather than
automation. This requires a new skill set focused on strategic prompting,
critical verification, and methodological rigor in order to effectively use
these powerful tools.

Motivation: 随着LLM应用从简单文本生成器发展为集成检索增强、工具调用和多轮交互的复杂软件系统，其固有的非确定性、动态性和上下文依赖性给质量保证带来了根本性挑战。

Method: 将LLM应用分解为三层架构（系统外壳层、提示编排层、LLM推理核心），分析传统测试方法在各层的适用性，提出四种协作策略（保留、转换、集成、运行时）和AICL协议。

Result: 识别了软件工程和AI社区在测试方法上的结构性脱节，提出了结合预部署验证和运行时监控的可信质量保证框架。

Conclusion: 需要新的测试范式来应对LLM应用的独特特性，提出的协作策略和协议为LLM应用测试的标准化和工具化提供了实践指导。

Abstract: Applications of Large Language Models~(LLMs) have evolved from simple text
generators into complex software systems that integrate retrieval augmentation,
tool invocation, and multi-turn interactions. Their inherent non-determinism,
dynamism, and context dependence pose fundamental challenges for quality
assurance. This paper decomposes LLM applications into a three-layer
architecture: \textbf{\textit{System Shell Layer}}, \textbf{\textit{Prompt
Orchestration Layer}}, and \textbf{\textit{LLM Inference Core}}. We then assess
the applicability of traditional software testing methods in each layer:
directly applicable at the shell layer, requiring semantic reinterpretation at
the orchestration layer, and necessitating paradigm shifts at the inference
core. A comparative analysis of Testing AI methods from the software
engineering community and safety analysis techniques from the AI community
reveals structural disconnects in testing unit abstraction, evaluation metrics,
and lifecycle management. We identify four fundamental differences that
underlie 6 core challenges. To address these, we propose four types of
collaborative strategies (\emph{Retain}, \emph{Translate}, \emph{Integrate},
and \emph{Runtime}) and explore a closed-loop, trustworthy quality assurance
framework that combines pre-deployment validation with runtime monitoring.
Based on these strategies, we offer practical guidance and a protocol proposal
to support the standardization and tooling of LLM application testing. We
propose a protocol \textbf{\textit{Agent Interaction Communication Language}}
(AICL) that is used to communicate between AI agents. AICL has the
test-oriented features and is easily integrated in the current agent framework.

TL;DR: JADES是一个通过分解评分进行越狱评估的通用框架，通过将有害问题分解为加权子问题并聚合分数来准确评估越狱攻击成功率，在二元评估中达到98.5%的人类评估一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的越狱评估方法依赖不匹配的代理指标或简单整体判断，经常误解模型响应，导致与人类感知不一致的主观评估。需要更准确、一致的评估框架。

Method: JADES框架自动将输入的有害问题分解为一组加权子问题，对每个子答案进行评分，并通过加权聚合得出最终决策。还包含可选的事实检查模块来检测越狱响应中的幻觉。

Result: 在JailbreakQR基准测试（400对越狱提示和响应）上，JADES在二元设置中达到98.5%的人类评估一致性，比强基线高出9%以上。重新评估显示现有方法显著高估攻击成功率（如GPT-3.5-Turbo上的LAA攻击成功率从93%降至69%）。

Conclusion: JADES能够提供准确、一致且可解释的评估，为测量未来越狱攻击提供了可靠基础，解决了越狱评估中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Accurately determining whether a jailbreak attempt has succeeded is a
fundamental yet unresolved challenge. Existing evaluation methods rely on
misaligned proxy indicators or naive holistic judgments. They frequently
misinterpret model responses, leading to inconsistent and subjective
assessments that misalign with human perception. To address this gap, we
introduce JADES (Jailbreak Assessment via Decompositional Scoring), a universal
jailbreak evaluation framework. Its key mechanism is to automatically decompose
an input harmful question into a set of weighted sub-questions, score each
sub-answer, and weight-aggregate the sub-scores into a final decision. JADES
also incorporates an optional fact-checking module to strengthen the detection
of hallucinations in jailbreak responses. We validate JADES on JailbreakQR, a
newly introduced benchmark proposed in this work, consisting of 400 pairs of
jailbreak prompts and responses, each meticulously annotated by humans. In a
binary setting (success/failure), JADES achieves 98.5% agreement with human
evaluators, outperforming strong baselines by over 9%. Re-evaluating five
popular attacks on four LLMs reveals substantial overestimation (e.g., LAA's
attack success rate on GPT-3.5-Turbo drops from 93% to 69%). Our results show
that JADES could deliver accurate, consistent, and interpretable evaluations,
providing a reliable basis for measuring future jailbreak attacks.

Abstract: Health is a fundamental pillar of human wellness, and the rapid advancements
in large language models (LLMs) have driven the development of a new generation
of health agents. However, the application of health agents to fulfill the
diverse needs of individuals in daily non-clinical settings is underexplored.
In this work, we aim to build a comprehensive personal health agent that is
able to reason about multimodal data from everyday consumer wellness devices
and common personal health records, and provide personalized health
recommendations. To understand end-users' needs when interacting with such an
assistant, we conducted an in-depth analysis of web search and health forum
queries, alongside qualitative insights from users and health experts gathered
through a user-centered design process. Based on these findings, we identified
three major categories of consumer health needs, each of which is supported by
a specialist sub-agent: (1) a data science agent that analyzes personal
time-series wearable and health record data, (2) a health domain expert agent
that integrates users' health and contextual data to generate accurate,
personalized insights, and (3) a health coach agent that synthesizes data
insights, guiding users using a specified psychological strategy and tracking
users' progress. Furthermore, we propose and develop the Personal Health Agent
(PHA), a multi-agent framework that enables dynamic, personalized interactions
to address individual health needs. To evaluate each sub-agent and the
multi-agent system, we conducted automated and human evaluations across 10
benchmark tasks, involving more than 7,000 annotations and 1,100 hours of
effort from health experts and end-users. Our work represents the most
comprehensive evaluation of a health agent to date and establishes a strong
foundation towards the futuristic vision of a personal health agent accessible

Method: 基于密码学机制构建GAI框架，包含规则执行模块(REM)、治理规则和可治理安全超级平台(GSSP)，实现端到端保护

Result: 通过形式化证明安全属性，并在高风险场景中验证原型系统的有效性

Conclusion: GAI框架为AI安全治理提供了可行且通用的技术路径，能够消除已识别的攻击向量

Abstract: As AI rapidly advances, the security risks posed by AI are becoming
increasingly severe, especially in critical scenarios, including those posing
existential risks. If AI becomes uncontrollable, manipulated, or actively
evades safety mechanisms, it could trigger systemic disasters. Existing AI
safety approaches-such as model enhancement, value alignment, and human
intervention-suffer from fundamental, in-principle limitations when facing AI
with extreme motivations and unlimited intelligence, and cannot guarantee
security. To address this challenge, we propose a Governable AI (GAI) framework
that shifts from traditional internal constraints to externally enforced
structural compliance based on cryptographic mechanisms that are
computationally infeasible to break, even for future AI, under the defined
threat model and well-established cryptographic assumptions.The GAI framework
is composed of a simple yet reliable, fully deterministic, powerful, flexible,
and general-purpose rule enforcement module (REM); governance rules; and a
governable secure super-platform (GSSP) that offers end-to-end protection
against compromise or subversion by AI. The decoupling of the governance rules
and the technical platform further enables a feasible and generalizable
technical pathway for the safety governance of AI. REM enforces the bottom line
defined by governance rules, while GSSP ensures non-bypassability,
tamper-resistance, and unforgeability to eliminate all identified attack
vectors. This paper also presents a rigorous formal proof of the security
properties of this mechanism and demonstrates its effectiveness through a
prototype implementation evaluated in representative high-stakes scenarios.

Conclusion: LLM驱动的合成数据增强能有效提升健康相关事实核查器的性能

Abstract: Fact-checking for health-related content is challenging due to the limited
availability of annotated training data. In this study, we propose a synthetic
data generation pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to augment
training data for health-related fact checking. In this pipeline, we summarize
source documents, decompose the summaries into atomic facts, and use an LLM to
construct sentence-fact entailment tables. From the entailment relations in the
table, we further generate synthetic text-claim pairs with binary veracity
labels. These synthetic data are then combined with the original data to
fine-tune a BERT-based fact-checking model. Evaluation on two public datasets,
PubHealth and SciFact, shows that our pipeline improved F1 scores by up to
0.019 and 0.049, respectively, compared to models trained only on the original
data. These results highlight the effectiveness of LLM-driven synthetic data
augmentation in enhancing the performance of health-related fact-checkers.

Motivation: 现有医学基准测试存在覆盖范围有限、无法系统评估临床推理能力的问题，需要动态生成、抗污染的综合基准来准确评估LLM的医学能力。

Method: 将WHO IMCI手册转换为包含200+节点和300+边的有向图，通过图遍历生成包含年龄特定场景和上下文干扰项的问题，确保临床相关性。

Result: 模型在症状识别方面表现良好（45-67%准确率），但在严重程度分诊、治疗方案和随访护理方面存在困难，揭示了通用评估无法发现的特定能力差距。

Conclusion: 图基方法成功解决了人工策划基准的覆盖限制，为创建可动态生成、抗污染的综合基准提供了可扩展解决方案，同时可用于LLM后训练。

Abstract: We present a first known prototype of a dynamic, systematic benchmark of
medical guidelines for 400+ questions, with 3.3+ trillion possible
combinations, covering 100\% of guideline relationships. We transformed the WHO
IMCI handbook into a directed graph with 200+ nodes (conditions, symptoms,
treatments, follow-ups, severities) and 300+ edges, then used graph traversal
to generate questions that incorporated age-specific scenarios and contextual
distractors to ensure clinical relevance. Our graph-based approach enables
systematic evaluation across clinical tasks (45-67\% accuracy), and we find
models excel at symptom recognition but struggle with triaging severity,
treatment protocols and follow-up care, demonstrating how customized benchmarks
can identify specific capability gaps that general-domain evaluations miss.
Beyond evaluation, this dynamic MCQA methodology enhances LLM post-training
(supervised finetuning, GRPO, DPO), where correct answers provide high-reward
samples without expensive human annotation. The graph-based approach
successfully addresses the coverage limitations of manually curated benchmarks.
This methodology is a step toward scalable, contamination-resistant solution
for creating comprehensive benchmarks that can be dynamically generated,
including when the guidelines are updated. Code and datasets are available at

optimization (DPO). In evaluation, ChatThero yields a 41.5\% average gain in
patient motivation, a 0.49\% increase in treatment confidence, and resolves
hard cases with 26\% fewer turns than GPT-4o, and both automated and human

Abstract: Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices have begun to exhibit early
quantum advantages on classically intractable problems, spanning physics
simulations to Gaussian boson sampling. Yet, realizing these benefits remains
challenging for non-experts, primarily due to the complexities of programming
in Open Quantum Assembly Language (OpenQASM). Although Large Language Model
(LLM)-based agents have shown promise in automating classical programming
workflows, their quantum counterparts have largely been restricted to
specialized tasks such as quantum chemistry or error correction. In this paper,
we present QAgent, an LLM-powered multi-agent system that fully automates
OpenQASM programming. By integrating task planning, in-context few-shot
learning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for long-term context,
predefined generation tools, and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, the agents
systematically improve both compilation and functional correctness. Our
evaluations demonstrate substantial improvements: across multiple LLMs of
varying sizes, QAgent enhances the accuracy of QASM code generation by 71.6\%
compared to previous static LLM-based approaches. We envision this multi-agent
system as a key enabler for democratizing quantum programming, bridging
expertise gaps, and accelerating the practical adoption of quantum computing.

contributions from both perspectives, we observe that AI progress has largely

Science lies not only in improving performance but also in constructing systems
that deepen our understanding of the human mind. Promising directions include

Abstract: In the ongoing quest for hybridizing discrete reasoning with neural nets,
there is an increasing interest in neural architectures that can learn how to
solve discrete reasoning or optimization problems from natural inputs, a task
that Large Language Models seem to struggle with.
  Objectives: We introduce a differentiable neuro-symbolic architecture and a
loss function dedicated to learning how to solve NP-hard reasoning problems.
  Methods: Our new probabilistic loss allows for learning both the constraints
and the objective, thus delivering a complete model that can be scrutinized and
completed with side constraints. By pushing the combinatorial solver out of the
training loop, our architecture also offers scalable training while exact
inference gives access to maximum accuracy.
  Results: We empirically show that it can efficiently learn how to solve
NP-hard reasoning problems from natural inputs. On three variants of the Sudoku
benchmark -- symbolic, visual, and many-solution --, our approach requires a
fraction of training time of other hybrid methods. On a visual Min-Cut/Max-cut
task, it optimizes the regret better than a Decision-Focused-Learning
regret-dedicated loss. Finally, it efficiently learns the energy optimization

Motivation: 研究AI驱动的政治影响力操作的自动化程度，探索小型语言模型在政治宣传内容生成方面的能力，以及如何自动评估这类内容

Method: 使用小型语言模型生成角色驱动的政治信息，开发自动化评估方法替代人工评分，分析角色设计和模型对抗对内容生成的影响

Result: 发现角色设计比模型身份更能解释行为差异；对抗性回复会增强意识形态坚持和极端内容；证明完全自动化的影响力内容生产已经可行

Conclusion: 影响力操作的防御策略应从限制模型访问转向对话中心的检测和破坏，模型生成内容的一致性反而提供了检测特征

Abstract: AI-powered influence operations can now be executed end-to-end on commodity
hardware. We show that small language models produce coherent, persona-driven
political messaging and can be evaluated automatically without human raters.
Two behavioural findings emerge. First, persona-over-model: persona design
explains behaviour more than model identity. Second, engagement as a stressor:
when replies must counter-arguments, ideological adherence strengthens and the
prevalence of extreme content increases. We demonstrate that fully automated
influence-content production is within reach of both large and small actors.
Consequently, defence should shift from restricting model access towards
conversation-centric detection and disruption of campaigns and coordination
infrastructure. Paradoxically, the very consistency that enables these
operations also provides a detection signature.

Motivation: 验证LLM作为人类行为代理在物流供应链管理模拟中的有效性，因为GABMs虽然能生成类人响应，但其作为人类行为替代的有效性尚未可知。

Method: 采用控制实验设计，在食品配送场景中对比6个先进LLM与957名人类参与者(477对)的表现，使用调节中介设计和结构方程建模分析决策过程。

Result: 研究发现GABMs能有效模拟人类行为，但存在等价性-过程悖论：一些LLM在表面层次上表现出与人类的等价性，但决策过程却与人类不同。

Conclusion: GABMs在适当验证检查下可作为LSCM研究的可行方法工具，研究提出的双重验证框架为GABM开发提供了严谨指南。

Abstract: Generative Agent-Based Models (GABMs) powered by large language models (LLMs)
offer promising potential for empirical logistics and supply chain management
(LSCM) research by enabling realistic simulation of complex human behaviors.
Unlike traditional agent-based models, GABMs generate human-like responses
through natural language reasoning, which creates potential for new
perspectives on emergent LSCM phenomena. However, the validity of LLMs as
proxies for human behavior in LSCM simulations is unknown. This study evaluates
LLM equivalence of human behavior through a controlled experiment examining
dyadic customer-worker engagements in food delivery scenarios. I test six
state-of-the-art LLMs against 957 human participants (477 dyads) using a
moderated mediation design. This study reveals a need to validate GABMs on two
levels: (1) human equivalence testing, and (2) decision process validation.
Results reveal GABMs can effectively simulate human behaviors in LSCM; however,
an equivalence-versus-process paradox emerges. While a series of Two One-Sided
Tests (TOST) for equivalence reveals some LLMs demonstrate surface-level
equivalence to humans, structural equation modeling (SEM) reveals artificial
decision processes not present in human participants for some LLMs. These
findings show GABMs as a potentially viable methodological instrument in LSCM
with proper validation checks. The dual-validation framework also provides LSCM
researchers with a guide to rigorous GABM development. For practitioners, this
study offers evidence-based assessment for LLM selection for operational tasks.

Result: 在GEMM内核上，SwizzlePerf在5分钟内生成专家需要2周才能找到的最优swizzling模式。在10个多样化ML和科学内核中，9个内核实现了最高2.06倍速度提升和70%的L2命中率改善

Conclusion: 这是系统化创建硬件感知LLM性能工程代理的第一步重要工作

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown progress in GPU kernel performance
engineering using inefficient search-based methods that optimize around
runtime. Any existing approach lacks a key characteristic that human
performance engineers rely on for near-optimal utilization --
hardware-awareness. By leveraging the workload's specific memory access
patterns, architecture specifications, filtered profiling logs, and reflections
on historical performance, we can make software-level optimizations that are
tailored to the underlying hardware. SwizzlePerf automatically generates
spatial optimizations for GPU kernels on disaggregated architectures by giving
LLMs explicit hardware-awareness.
  For a GEMM kernel, SwizzlePerf takes less than 5 minutes to generate the same
hardware-specific optimal swizzling pattern that took expert performance
engineers 2 weeks to find. On a suite of 10 diverse ML and Science kernels,
SwizzlePerf can generate swizzling patterns for 9 of the kernels that achieve
up to a 2.06x speedup and 70% improvement in L2 hit rate. This work is the
first of many steps toward systematically creating hardware-aware LLM

Conclusion: Chimera通过一次性LLM交互显著降低运行时成本，同时保证生成的公式语法有效且语义多样，有效提升了SMT求解器的测试效果。

Abstract: Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers are foundational to modern systems
and programming languages research, providing the foundation for tasks like
symbolic execution and automated verification. Because these solvers sit on the
critical path, their correctness is essential, and high-quality test formulas
are key to uncovering bugs. However, while prior testing techniques performed
well on earlier solver versions, they struggle to keep pace with rapidly
evolving features. Recent approaches based on Large Language Models (LLMs) show
promise in exploring advanced solver capabilities, but two obstacles remain:
nearly half of the generated formulas are syntactically invalid, and iterative
interactions with the LLMs introduce substantial computational overhead. In
this study, we present Chimera, a novel LLM-assisted fuzzing framework that
addresses both issues by shifting from direct formula generation to the
synthesis of reusable term (i.e., logical expression) generators. Particularly,
Chimera uses LLMs to (1) automatically extract context-free grammars (CFGs) for
SMT theories, including solver-specific extensions, from documentation, and (2)
synthesize composable Boolean term generators that adhere to these grammars.
During fuzzing, Chimera populates structural skeletons derived from existing
formulas with the terms iteratively produced by the LLM-synthesized generators.
This design ensures syntactic validity while promoting semantic diversity.
Notably, Chimera requires only one-time LLM interaction investment,
dramatically reducing runtime cost. We evaluated Chimera on two leading SMT
solvers: Z3 and cvc5. Our experiments show that Chimera has identified 43
confirmed bugs, 40 of which have already been fixed by developers.

Abstract: As contemporary microservice systems become increasingly popular and
complex-often comprising hundreds or even thousands of fine-grained,
interdependent subsystems-they are facing more frequent failures. Ensuring
system reliability thus demands accurate root cause localization. While traces
and metrics have proven to be effective data sources for this task, existing
methods either heavily rely on pre-defined schemas, which struggle to adapt to
evolving operational contexts, or lack interpretability in their reasoning
process, thereby leaving Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) confused. In this
paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on how SREs localize the root cause of
failures, drawing insights from multiple professional SREs across different
organizations. Our investigation reveals that human root cause analysis
exhibits three key characteristics: recursiveness, multi-dimensional expansion,
and cross-modal reasoning. Motivated by these findings, we introduce RCLAgent,
an adaptive root cause localization method for microservice systems that
leverages a multi-agent recursion-of-thought framework. RCLAgent employs a
novel recursion-of-thought strategy to guide the LLM's reasoning process,
effectively integrating data from multiple agents and tool-assisted analysis to
accurately pinpoint the root cause. Experimental evaluations on various public
datasets demonstrate that RCLAgent achieves superior performance by localizing
the root cause using only a single request-outperforming state-of-the-art
methods that depend on aggregating multiple requests. These results underscore
the effectiveness of RCLAgent in enhancing the efficiency and precision of root
cause localization in complex microservice environments.

Motivation: 现有符号音乐生成模型假设音符属性具有固定的单向时间依赖结构，但研究发现不同属性作为初始token都能获得相似性能，表明音符属性本质上是并发无序的集合而非时间依赖序列。

Method: 两层架构：自回归模型处理音符序列，双向离散扩散模型处理属性；提出Music Latent Space Discriminability Enhancement Strategy (MLSDES) 通过对比学习增强中间表示；Conditional Information Enhancement Module (CIEM) 通过注意力机制加强音符潜在向量表示。

Result: 在无条件生成和文本条件生成任务上显著超越SOTA模型，实现至少4倍加速，并展示无需训练即可进行细粒度音符属性控制的可行性。

Conclusion: Amadeus框架有效解决了传统模型对音符属性依赖结构的错误假设，通过创新的架构设计和表示增强策略，在性能和效率上都取得了显著提升。

Abstract: Existing state-of-the-art symbolic music generation models predominantly
adopt autoregressive or hierarchical autoregressive architectures, modelling
symbolic music as a sequence of attribute tokens with unidirectional temporal
dependencies, under the assumption of a fixed, strict dependency structure
among these attributes. However, we observe that using different attributes as
the initial token in these models leads to comparable performance. This
suggests that the attributes of a musical note are, in essence, a concurrent
and unordered set, rather than a temporally dependent sequence. Based on this
insight, we introduce Amadeus, a novel symbolic music generation framework.
Amadeus adopts a two-level architecture: an autoregressive model for note
sequences and a bidirectional discrete diffusion model for attributes. To
enhance performance, we propose Music Latent Space Discriminability Enhancement
Strategy(MLSDES), incorporating contrastive learning constraints that amplify
discriminability of intermediate music representations. The Conditional
Information Enhancement Module (CIEM) simultaneously strengthens note latent
vector representation via attention mechanisms, enabling more precise note
decoding. We conduct extensive experiments on unconditional and
text-conditioned generation tasks. Amadeus significantly outperforms SOTA
models across multiple metrics while achieving at least 4$\times$ speed-up.
Furthermore, we demonstrate training-free, fine-grained note attribute control
feasibility using our model. To explore the upper performance bound of the
Amadeus architecture, we compile the largest open-source symbolic music dataset
to date, AMD (Amadeus MIDI Dataset), supporting both pre-training and
fine-tuning.

Abstract: While video-generation-based embodied world models have gained increasing
attention, their reliance on large-scale embodied interaction data remains a
key bottleneck. The scarcity, difficulty of collection, and high dimensionality
of embodied data fundamentally limit the alignment granularity between language
and actions and exacerbate the challenge of long-horizon video
generation--hindering generative models from achieving a "GPT moment" in the
embodied domain. There is a naive observation: the diversity of embodied data
far exceeds the relatively small space of possible primitive motions. Based on
this insight, we propose a novel paradigm for world modeling--Primitive
Embodied World Models (PEWM). By restricting video generation to fixed short
horizons, our approach 1) enables fine-grained alignment between linguistic
concepts and visual representations of robotic actions, 2) reduces learning
complexity, 3) improves data efficiency in embodied data collection, and 4)
decreases inference latency. By equipping with a modular Vision-Language Model
(VLM) planner and a Start-Goal heatmap Guidance mechanism (SGG), PEWM further
enables flexible closed-loop control and supports compositional generalization
of primitive-level policies over extended, complex tasks. Our framework
leverages the spatiotemporal vision priors in video models and the semantic
awareness of VLMs to bridge the gap between fine-grained physical interaction
and high-level reasoning, paving the way toward scalable, interpretable, and
general-purpose embodied intelligence.

Motivation: 长视频生成本质上是长上下文记忆问题，需要模型在长范围内保持和检索显著事件。传统扩散变换器的自注意力二次成本限制了长序列处理能力，导致内存和计算不可行。

Method: 将长上下文视频生成重新定义为内部信息检索任务，提出可学习的稀疏注意力路由模块MoC。每个查询动态选择少量信息块和强制锚点（标题、局部窗口）进行注意力计算，采用因果路由防止循环闭合。

Conclusion: MoC模块有效解决了长视频生成中的长上下文记忆挑战，通过信息检索方式实现了高效的内存管理和计算分配，在分钟级尺度上实现了记忆和一致性的涌现。

Abstract: Long video generation is fundamentally a long context memory problem: models
must retain and retrieve salient events across a long range without collapsing
or drifting. However, scaling diffusion transformers to generate long-context
videos is fundamentally limited by the quadratic cost of self-attention, which
makes memory and computation intractable and difficult to optimize for long
sequences. We recast long-context video generation as an internal information
retrieval task and propose a simple, learnable sparse attention routing module,
Mixture of Contexts (MoC), as an effective long-term memory retrieval engine.
In MoC, each query dynamically selects a few informative chunks plus mandatory
anchors (caption, local windows) to attend to, with causal routing that
prevents loop closures. As we scale the data and gradually sparsify the
routing, the model allocates compute to salient history, preserving identities,
actions, and scenes over minutes of content. Efficiency follows as a byproduct
of retrieval (near-linear scaling), which enables practical training and
synthesis, and the emergence of memory and consistency at the scale of minutes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become essential for applications such as

Recently, LLMs have also been integrated into relational database management
systems to enhance querying and support advanced data processing. Companies
such as Amazon, Databricks, Google, and Snowflake offer LLM invocation directly

open-source solutions currently have limited functionality and poor
performance. In this work, we present an early exploration of two open-source

Abstract: Machine-learning models are increasingly driving decisions in high-stakes
settings, such as finance, law, and hiring, thus, highlighting the need for
transparency. However, the key challenge is to balance transparency --
clarifying `why' a decision was made -- with recourse: providing actionable
steps on `how' to achieve a favourable outcome from an unfavourable outcome.
Counterfactual explanations reveal `why' an undesired outcome occurred and
`how' to reverse it through targeted feature changes (interventions).
  Current counterfactual approaches have limitations: 1) they often ignore
causal dependencies between features, and 2) they typically assume all
interventions can happen simultaneously, an unrealistic assumption in practical
scenarios where actions are typically taken in a sequence. As a result, these
counterfactuals are often not achievable in the real world.
  We present P2C (Path-to-Counterfactuals), a model-agnostic framework that
produces a plan (ordered sequence of actions) converting an unfavourable
outcome to a causally consistent favourable outcome. P2C addresses both
limitations by 1) Explicitly modelling causal relationships between features
and 2) Ensuring that each intermediate state in the plan is feasible and
causally valid. P2C uses the goal-directed Answer Set Programming system
s(CASP) to generate the plan accounting for feature changes that happen
automatically due to causal dependencies. Furthermore, P2C refines cost
(effort) computation by only counting changes actively made by the user,
resulting in realistic cost estimates. Finally, P2C highlights how its causal
planner outperforms standard planners, which lack causal knowledge and thus can
generate illegal actions.

Abstract: Large, open datasets can accelerate ecological research, particularly by
enabling researchers to develop new insights by reusing datasets from multiple
sources. However, to find the most suitable datasets to combine and integrate,
researchers must navigate diverse ecological and environmental data provider
platforms with varying metadata availability and standards. To overcome this
obstacle, we have developed a large language model (LLM)-based metadata
harvester that flexibly extracts metadata from any dataset's landing page, and
converts these to a user-defined, unified format using existing metadata
standards. We validate that our tool is able to extract both structured and
unstructured metadata with equal accuracy, aided by our LLM post-processing
protocol. Furthermore, we utilise LLMs to identify links between datasets, both
by calculating embedding similarity and by unifying the formats of extracted
metadata to enable rule-based processing. Our tool, which flexibly links the
metadata of different datasets, can therefore be used for ontology creation or
graph-based queries, for example, to find relevant ecological and environmental

$70{-}140$ domains with distinguishable timing correlations, enabling unique
fingerprinting attacks.
  Specifically, we demonstrate a novel prompt and user trait leakage attack
against WRAs that only leverages their network-level metadata (i.e., visited IP
addresses and their timings). We start by building a new dataset of WRA traces
based on user search queries and queries generated by synthetic personas. We
define a behavioral metric (called OBELS) to comprehensively assess similarity
between original and inferred prompts, showing that our attack recovers over
73\% of the functional and domain knowledge of user prompts. Extending to a
multi-session setting, we recover up to 19 of 32 latent traits with high
accuracy. Our attack remains effective under partial observability and noisy
conditions. Finally, we discuss mitigation strategies that constrain domain
diversity or obfuscate traces, showing negligible utility impact while reducing
attack effectiveness by an average of 29\%.

raise awareness of the novel cyber threats that are introduced when
incorporating AI into a software system. We explore the operational
cybersecurity and supply chain risks across the AI lifecycle, emphasizing the
need for tailored security frameworks to address evolving threats in the
AI-driven landscape. We highlight previous exploitations and provide insights

AI adoption. Conducted at the early stages of ChatGPT implementation, when
students had limited familiarity with the tool, this field study analyzed 315
student-AI conversations during a brief, quiz-based scenario across various
STEM courses. A novel four-stage reliance taxonomy was introduced to capture
students' reliance patterns, distinguishing AI competence, relevance, adoption,
and students' final answer correctness. Three findings emerged. First, students
exhibited overall low reliance on AI and many of them could not effectively use
AI for learning. Second, negative reliance patterns often persisted across
interactions, highlighting students' difficulty in effectively shifting
strategies after unsuccessful initial experiences. Third, certain behavioral
metrics strongly predicted AI reliance, highlighting potential behavioral
mechanisms to explain AI adoption. The study's findings underline critical
implications for ethical AI integration in education and the broader field. It
emphasizes the need for enhanced onboarding processes to improve student's
familiarity and effective use of AI tools. Furthermore, AI interfaces should be
designed with reliance-calibration mechanisms to enhance appropriate reliance.
Ultimately, this research advances understanding of AI reliance dynamics,
providing foundational insights for ethically sound and cognitively enriching

Abstract: In Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs), auto-leveling
bots exploit automated programs to level up characters at scale, undermining
gameplay balance and fairness. Detecting such bots is challenging, not only
because they mimic human behavior, but also because punitive actions require
explainable justification to avoid legal and user experience issues. In this
paper, we present a novel framework for detecting auto-leveling bots by
leveraging contrastive representation learning and clustering techniques in a
fully unsupervised manner to identify groups of characters with similar
level-up patterns. To ensure reliable decisions, we incorporate a Large
Language Model (LLM) as an auxiliary reviewer to validate the clustered groups,
effectively mimicking a secondary human judgment. We also introduce a growth
curve-based visualization to assist both the LLM and human moderators in
assessing leveling behavior. This collaborative approach improves the
efficiency of bot detection workflows while maintaining explainability, thereby
supporting scalable and accountable bot regulation in MMORPGs.

Abstract: The paper introduces a novel framework based on category theory to enhance
the explainability of artificial intelligence systems, particularly focusing on
word embeddings. Key topics include the construction of categories
$\mathcal{L}_T$ and $\mathcal{P}_T$, providing schematic representations of the
semantics of a text $ T $, and reframing the selection of the element with
maximum probability as a categorical notion. Additionally, the monoidal
category $\mathcal{P}_T$ is constructed to visualize various methods of
extracting semantic information from $T$, offering a dimension-agnostic
definition of semantic spaces reliant solely on information within the text.
  Furthermore, the paper defines the categories of configurations Conf and word
embeddings $\mathcal{Emb}$, accompanied by the concept of divergence as a
decoration on $\mathcal{Emb}$. It establishes a mathematically precise method
for comparing word embeddings, demonstrating the equivalence between the GloVe
and Word2Vec algorithms and the metric MDS algorithm, transitioning from neural
network algorithms (black box) to a transparent framework. Finally, the paper
presents a mathematical approach to computing biases before embedding and
offers insights on mitigating biases at the semantic space level, advancing the

Abstract: Bus bunching remains a challenge for urban transit due to stochastic traffic
and passenger demand. Traditional solutions rely on multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL) in loop-line settings, which overlook realistic operations
characterized by heterogeneous routes, timetables, fluctuating demand, and
varying fleet sizes. We propose a novel single-agent reinforcement learning
(RL) framework for bus holding control that avoids the data imbalance and
convergence issues of MARL under near-realistic simulation. A bidirectional
timetabled network with dynamic passenger demand is constructed. The key
innovation is reformulating the multi-agent problem into a single-agent one by
augmenting the state space with categorical identifiers (vehicle ID, station
ID, time period) in addition to numerical features (headway, occupancy,
velocity). This high-dimensional encoding enables single-agent policies to
capture inter-agent dependencies, analogous to projecting non-separable inputs
into a higher-dimensional space. We further design a structured reward function
aligned with operational goals: instead of exponential penalties on headway
deviations, a ridge-shaped reward balances uniform headways and schedule
adherence. Experiments show that our modified soft actor-critic (SAC) achieves
more stable and superior performance than benchmarks, including MADDPG (e.g.,
-430k vs. -530k under stochastic conditions). These results demonstrate that
single-agent deep RL, when enhanced with categorical structuring and
schedule-aware rewards, can effectively manage bus holding in non-loop,
real-world contexts. This paradigm offers a robust, scalable alternative to
MARL frameworks, particularly where agent-specific experiences are imbalanced.

Motivation: 解决城市交通走廊信号控制中既要保持主干道交通连续性又要适应局部交叉口需求变化的双重挑战，需要一种能够自适应不同交通状况的智能控制方法。

Result: 在SUMO-RLlib平台上验证：混合MFC在重负荷下最大化吞吐量；混合GWC能最小化主干道停车并保持连续性；纯代理控制在中等需求下改善全网旅行时间但在重负荷下效果较差。层次化设计实现了跨所有需求水平的鲁棒性能。

Conclusion: 提出的层次化协调控制方案能够自适应选择策略，在不同交通需求条件下都表现出良好的性能，为解决城市交通信号控制问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Signal control in urban corridors faces the dual challenge of maintaining
arterial traffic progression while adapting to demand variations at local
intersections. We propose a hierarchical traffic signal coordination and
control scheme that integrates model-based optimization with reinforcement
learning. The system consists of: (i) a High-Level Coordinator (HLC) that
selects coordination strategies based on observed and predicted demand; (ii) a
Corridor Coordinator that derives phase constraints from the selected
strategy-either Max-Flow Coordination (MFC) or Green-Wave Coordination (GWC);
and (iii) Hybrid Signal Agents (HSAs) that determine signal phases via
reinforcement learning with action masking to enforce feasibility. Hierarchical
reinforcement learning with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is used to train
HSA and HLC policies. At the lower level, three HSA policies-MFC-aware,
GWC-aware, and pure agent control (PAC) are trained in conjunction with their
respective coordination strategies. At the higher level, the HLC is trained to
dynamically switch strategies using a multi-objective reward balancing
corridor-level and network-wide performance. The proposed scheme was developed
and evaluated on a SUMO-RLlib platform. Case results show that hybrid MFC
maximizes throughput under heavy demand; hybrid GWC consistently minimizes
arterial stops and maintains progression across diverse traffic conditions but
can reduce network-wide efficiency; and PAC improves network-wide travel time
in moderate demand but is less effective under heavy demand. The hierarchical
design enables adaptive strategy selection, achieving robust performance across
all demand levels.

Conclusion: 在DDPG强化学习框架中集成TiDE是解决最优资产配置问题的有效途径，值得进一步探索

Abstract: The optimal asset allocation between risky and risk-free assets is a
persistent challenge due to the inherent volatility in financial markets.
Conventional methods rely on strict distributional assumptions or non-additive
reward ratios, which limit their robustness and applicability to investment
goals. To overcome these constraints, this study formulates the optimal
two-asset allocation problem as a sequential decision-making task within a
Markov Decision Process (MDP). This framework enables the application of
reinforcement learning (RL) mechanisms to develop dynamic policies based on
simulated financial scenarios, regardless of prerequisites. We use the Kelly
criterion to balance immediate reward signals against long-term investment
objectives, and we take the novel step of integrating the Time-series Dense
Encoder (TiDE) into the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) RL framework
for continuous decision-making. We compare DDPG-TiDE with a simple
discrete-action Q-learning RL framework and a passive buy-and-hold investment
strategy. Empirical results show that DDPG-TiDE outperforms Q-learning and
generates higher risk adjusted returns than buy-and-hold. These findings
suggest that tackling the optimal asset allocation problem by integrating TiDE
within a DDPG reinforcement learning framework is a fruitful avenue for further
exploration.

Abstract: Participatory AI, in which impacted community members and other stakeholders

way to ensure AI is developed to meet their needs and reflect their values.
However, the process of identifying, reaching out, and engaging with all
relevant stakeholder groups, which we refer to as recruitment methodology, is
still a practical challenge in AI projects striving to adopt participatory

when designing and executing recruitment methodology for Participatory AI
projects, and the implications of current recruitment practice for
Participatory AI. First, we describe the recruitment methodologies used in AI
projects using a corpus of 37 projects to capture the diversity of practices in
the field and perform an initial analysis on the documentation of recruitment
practices, as well as specific strategies that researchers use to meet goals of
equity and empowerment. To complement this analysis, we interview five AI
researchers to learn about the outcomes of recruitment methodologies. We find
that these outcomes are shaped by structural conditions of their work,
researchers' own goals and expectations, and the relationships built from the
recruitment methodology and subsequent collaboration. Based on these analyses,
we provide recommendations for designing and executing relationship-forward
recruitment methods, as well as reflexive recruitment documentation practices

Abstract: Quantum federated learning (QFL) enables collaborative training of quantum
machine learning (QML) models across distributed quantum devices without raw
data exchange. However, QFL remains vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where
shared QML model updates can be exploited to undermine information privacy. In
the context of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, a key question
arises: How can inherent quantum noise be leveraged to enforce differential
privacy (DP) and protect model information during training and communication?
This paper explores a novel DP mechanism that harnesses quantum noise to
safeguard quantum models throughout the QFL process. By tuning noise variance
through measurement shots and depolarizing channel strength, our approach
achieves desired DP levels tailored to NISQ constraints. Simulations
demonstrate the framework's effectiveness by examining the relationship between
differential privacy budget and noise parameters, as well as the trade-off
between security and training accuracy. Additionally, we demonstrate the
framework's robustness against an adversarial attack designed to compromise
model performance using adversarial examples, with evaluations based on
critical metrics such as accuracy on adversarial examples, confidence scores
for correct predictions, and attack success rates. The results reveal a tunable
trade-off between privacy and robustness, providing an efficient solution for
secure QFL on NISQ devices with significant potential for reliable quantum
computing applications.

Abstract: Modern industrial recommendation systems encounter a core challenge of
multi-stage optimization misalignment: a significant semantic gap exists
between the multi-objective optimization paradigm widely used in the ranking
phase and the single-objective modeling in the retrieve phase. Although the
mainstream industry solution achieves multi-objective coverage through parallel
multi-path single-objective retrieval, this approach leads to linear growth of
training and serving resources with the number of objectives and has inherent
limitations in handling loosely coupled objectives. This paper proposes the
MPFormer, a dynamic multi-task Transformer framework, which systematically
addresses the aforementioned issues through three innovative mechanisms. First,
an objective-conditioned transformer that jointly encodes user behavior
sequences and multi-task semantics through learnable attention modulation;
second, personalized target weights are introduced to achieve dynamic
adjustment of retrieval results; finally, user personalization information is
incorporated into token representations and the Transformer structure to
further enhance the model's representation ability. This framework has been
successfully integrated into Kuaishou short video recommendation system, stably
serving over 400 million daily active users. It significantly improves user
daily engagement and system operational efficiency. Practical deployment
verification shows that, compared with traditional solutions, it effectively
optimizes the iterative paradigm of multi-objective retrieval while maintaining
service response speed, providing a scalable multi-objective solution for
industrial recommendation systems.

Abstract: While hate speech detection (HSD) has been extensively studied in text,
existing multi-modal approaches remain limited, particularly in videos. As
modalities are not always individually informative, simple fusion methods fail
to fully capture inter-modal dependencies. Moreover, previous work often omits
relevant modalities such as on-screen text and audio, which may contain subtle
hateful content and thus provide essential cues, both individually and in
combination with others. In this paper, we present MM-HSD, a multi-modal model
for HSD in videos that integrates video frames, audio, and text derived from
speech transcripts and from frames (i.e.~on-screen text) together with features
extracted by Cross-Modal Attention (CMA). We are the first to use CMA as an
early feature extractor for HSD in videos, to systematically compare query/key
configurations, and to evaluate the interactions between different modalities
in the CMA block. Our approach leads to improved performance when on-screen
text is used as a query and the rest of the modalities serve as a key.
Experiments on the HateMM dataset show that MM-HSD outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on M-F1 score (0.874), using concatenation of transcript, audio, video,
on-screen text, and CMA for feature extraction on raw embeddings of the
modalities. The code is available at https://github.com/idiap/mm-hsd

time-dependent gradients and variance do not promote straight paths. Findings
in machine learning research suggest that straight paths, such as conditional
flow matching, are easier to train and offer better generalisation. In this
paper we quantify the effect of path straightness on speech enhancement
quality. We report experiments with the Schrodinger bridge, where we show that
certain configurations lead to straighter paths. Conversely, we propose
independent conditional flow-matching for speech enhancement, which models
straight paths between noisy and clean speech. We demonstrate empirically that
a time-independent variance has a greater effect on sample quality than the
gradient. Although conditional flow matching improves several speech quality
metrics, it requires multiple inference steps. We rectify this with a one-step
solution by inferring the trained flow-based model as if it was directly
predictive. Our work suggests that straighter time-independent probability
paths improve generative speech enhancement over curved time-dependent paths.

Abstract: Real-time human-device interaction in industrial Metaverse faces challenges
such as high computational load, limited bandwidth, and strict latency. This
paper proposes a task-oriented edge-assisted cross-system framework using
digital twins (DTs) to enable responsive interactions. By predicting operator
motions, the system supports: 1) proactive Metaverse rendering for visual
feedback, and 2) preemptive control of remote devices. The DTs are decoupled
into two virtual functions-visual display and robotic control-optimizing both
performance and adaptability. To enhance generalizability, we introduce the
Human-In-The-Loop Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (HITL-MAML) algorithm, which
dynamically adjusts prediction horizons. Evaluation on two tasks demonstrates
the framework's effectiveness: in a Trajectory-Based Drawing Control task, it
reduces weighted RMSE from 0.0712 m to 0.0101 m; in a real-time 3D scene
representation task for nuclear decommissioning, it achieves a PSNR of 22.11,
SSIM of 0.8729, and LPIPS of 0.1298. These results show the framework's
capability to ensure spatial precision and visual fidelity in real-time,
high-risk industrial environments.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a multimodal framework for speech emotion
recognition that leverages entropy-aware score selection to combine speech and
textual predictions. The proposed method integrates a primary pipeline that
consists of an acoustic model based on wav2vec2.0 and a secondary pipeline that
consists of a sentiment analysis model using RoBERTa-XLM, with transcriptions
generated via Whisper-large-v3. We propose a late score fusion approach based
on entropy and varentropy thresholds to overcome the confidence constraints of
primary pipeline predictions. A sentiment mapping strategy translates three
sentiment categories into four target emotion classes, enabling coherent
integration of multimodal predictions. The results on the IEMOCAP and
MSP-IMPROV datasets show that the proposed method offers a practical and
reliable enhancement over traditional single-modality systems.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of software systems and the sophistication of
cyber-attacks have underscored the critical need for effective automated
vulnerability detection and repair systems. Traditional methods, such as static
program analysis, face significant challenges related to scalability,
adaptability, and high false-positive and false-negative rates. AI-driven
approaches, particularly those using machine learning and deep learning models,
show promise but are heavily reliant on the quality and quantity of training
data. This paper introduces a novel framework designed to automatically
introduce realistic, category-specific vulnerabilities into secure C/C++
codebases to generate datasets. The proposed approach coordinates multiple AI
agents that simulate expert reasoning, along with function agents and
traditional code analysis tools. It leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation
for contextual grounding and employs Low-Rank approximation of weights for
efficient model fine-tuning. Our experimental study on 116 code samples from
three different benchmarks suggests that our approach outperforms other
techniques with regard to dataset accuracy, achieving between 89\% and 95\%
success rates in injecting vulnerabilities at function level.

Motivation: 当前大型音频语言模型在低频听觉（如音高和时长检测）方面的能力尚未充分探索，而这对处理真实世界中的分布外任务至关重要，模型需要基于细粒度声学线索来推理不熟悉的声音。

Method: 引入World-of-Whale基准测试（WoW-Bench），包含感知基准（分类新颖声音）和认知基准（基于Bloom分类法评估记忆、理解、应用和分析声音事件的能力），并引入干扰问题来确保模型真正通过听觉解决问题。

Result: 对最先进的大型音频语言模型进行实验，结果显示其性能远低于人类水平，表明这些模型在听觉基础能力方面存在明显不足。

Conclusion: 大型音频语言模型需要更强的听觉基础能力，特别是在低频听觉感知和认知方面，WoW-Bench为此类评估提供了有效的基准工具。

Abstract: Large audio language models (LALMs) extend language understanding into the
auditory domain, yet their ability to perform low-level listening, such as
pitch and duration detection, remains underexplored. However, low-level
listening is critical for real-world, out-of-distribution tasks where models
must reason about unfamiliar sounds based on fine-grained acoustic cues. To
address this gap, we introduce the World-of-Whale benchmark (WoW-Bench) to
evaluate low-level auditory perception and cognition using marine mammal
vocalizations. WoW-bench is composed of a Perception benchmark for categorizing
novel sounds and a Cognition benchmark, inspired by Bloom's taxonomy, to assess
the abilities to remember, understand, apply, and analyze sound events. For the
Cognition benchmark, we additionally introduce distractor questions to evaluate
whether models are truly solving problems through listening rather than relying
on other heuristics. Experiments with state-of-the-art LALMs show performance
far below human levels, indicating a need for stronger auditory grounding in
LALMs.

Abstract: The rise of Generative AI (GenAI) is reshaping how workers contribute to
shared projects. While workers can use GenAI to boost productivity or reduce
effort, managers may use it to replace some workers entirely. We present a
theoretical framework to analyze how GenAI affects collaboration in such
settings. In our model, the manager selects a team to work on a shared task,
with GenAI substituting for unselected workers. Each worker selects how much
effort to exert, and incurs a cost that increases with the level of effort. We
show that GenAI can lead workers to exert no effort, even if GenAI is almost
ineffective. We further show that the manager's optimization problem is
NP-complete, and provide an efficient algorithm for the special class of
(almost-) linear instances. Our analysis shows that even workers with low
individual value may play a critical role in sustaining overall output, and
excluding such workers can trigger a cascade. Finally, we conduct extensive
simulations to illustrate our theoretical findings.

Result: 在六个真实世界数据集上的严格测试表明，POS2FS在特征子集选择和分类准确性方面均优于传统的OSFS和OS2FS方法。

Conclusion: POS2FS通过结合PSO优化和三支决策理论，有效解决了在线稀疏流特征选择中的不确定性和模糊性问题，提供了更鲁棒的特征选择性能。

Abstract: In real-world applications involving high-dimensional streaming data, online
streaming feature selection (OSFS) is widely adopted. Yet, practical
deployments frequently face data incompleteness due to sensor failures or
technical constraints. While online sparse streaming feature selection (OS2FS)
mitigates this issue via latent factor analysis-based imputation, existing
methods struggle with uncertain feature-label correlations, leading to
inflexible models and degraded performance. To address these gaps, this work
proposes POS2FS-an uncertainty-aware online sparse streaming feature selection
framework enhanced by particle swarm optimization (PSO). The approach
introduces: 1) PSO-driven supervision to reduce uncertainty in feature-label
relationships; 2) Three-way decision theory to manage feature fuzziness in
supervised learning. Rigorous testing on six real-world datasets confirms
POS2FS outperforms conventional OSFS and OS2FS techniques, delivering higher
accuracy through more robust feature subset selection.

Conclusion: 高频信息在多行为序列推荐中具有重要价值，对应用户兴趣的多样性，通过适当平衡不同频段信息可以显著改善推荐效果。

Abstract: In recommendation systems, users often exhibit multiple behaviors, such as
browsing, clicking, and purchasing. Multi-behavior sequential recommendation
(MBSR) aims to consider these different behaviors in an integrated manner to
improve the recommendation performance of the target behavior. However, some
behavior data will also bring inevitable noise to the modeling of user
interests. Some research efforts focus on data denoising from the frequency
domain perspective to improve the accuracy of user preference prediction. These
studies indicate that low-frequency information tends to be valuable and
reliable, while high-frequency information is often associated with noise. In
this paper, we argue that high-frequency information is by no means
insignificant. Further experimental results highlight that low frequency
corresponds to the purity of user interests, while high frequency corresponds
to the diversity of user interests. Building upon this finding, we proposed our
model PDB4Rec, which efficiently extracts information across various frequency
bands and their relationships, and introduces Boostrapping Balancer mechanism
to balance their contributions for improved recommendation performance.
Sufficient experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of our model.

Abstract: The restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is a neural network based on the Ising
model, well known for its ability to learn probability distributions and
stochastically generate new content. However, the high computational cost of
Gibbs sampling in content generation tasks imposes significant bottlenecks on
electronic implementations. Here, we propose a photonic restricted Boltzmann
machine (PRBM) that leverages photonic computing to accelerate Gibbs sampling,
enabling efficient content generation. By introducing an efficient encoding
method, the PRBM eliminates the need for computationally intensive matrix
decomposition and reduces the computational complexity of Gibbs sampling from
$O(N)$ to $O(1)$. Moreover, its non-Von Neumann photonic computing architecture
circumvents the memory storage of interaction matrices, providing substantial
advantages for large-scale RBMs. We experimentally validate the
photonic-accelerated Gibbs sampling by simulating a two-dimensional Ising
model, where the observed phase transition temperature closely matches the
theoretical predictions. Beyond physics-inspired tasks, the PRBM demonstrates
robust capabilities in generating and restoring diverse content, including
images and temporal sequences, even in the presence of noise and aberrations.
The scalability and reduced training cost of the PRBM framework underscore its
potential as a promising pathway for advancing photonic computing in generative
artificial intelligence.

promptability. To bridge this gap, we propose SPGrasp (spatiotemporal
prompt-driven dynamic grasp synthesis), a novel framework extending segment
anything model v2 (SAMv2) for video stream grasp estimation. Our core
innovation integrates user prompts with spatiotemporal context, enabling
real-time interaction with end-to-end latency as low as 59 ms while ensuring
temporal consistency for dynamic objects. In benchmark evaluations, SPGrasp
achieves instance-level grasp accuracies of 90.6% on OCID and 93.8% on
Jacquard. On the challenging GraspNet-1Billion dataset under continuous
tracking, SPGrasp achieves 92.0% accuracy with 73.1 ms per-frame latency,
representing a 58.5% reduction compared to the prior state-of-the-art
promptable method RoG-SAM while maintaining competitive accuracy. Real-world
experiments involving 13 moving objects demonstrate a 94.8% success rate in
interactive grasping scenarios. These results confirm SPGrasp effectively
resolves the latency-interactivity trade-off in dynamic grasp synthesis. Code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人机协作中机器人因过度保守的安全策略而导致的不必要制动、任务停滞问题，需要平衡严格安全保证与响应性行为的需求

Method: 融合概率性人体手部运动预测与控制屏障函数，通过不确定性估计动态调整安全边界，实现更智能的运动规划

Result: 在真实世界实验中，相比最先进的人机交互架构，UA-PCBFs在任务关键指标上表现更好，显著减少了机器人安全空间被侵犯的次数

Conclusion: UA-PCBFs框架为人机协作提供了更流畅和智能的交互方式，通过不确定性感知实现了安全性与灵活性的更好平衡

Abstract: To enable flexible, high-throughput automation in settings where people and
robots share workspaces, collaborative robotic cells must reconcile stringent
safety guarantees with the need for responsive and effective behavior. A
dynamic obstacle is the stochastic, task-dependent variability of human motion:
when robots fall back on purely reactive or worst-case envelopes, they brake
unnecessarily, stall task progress, and tamper with the fluidity that true
Human-Robot Interaction demands. In recent years, learning-based human-motion
prediction has rapidly advanced, although most approaches produce worst-case
scenario forecasts that often do not treat prediction uncertainty in a
well-structured way, resulting in over-conservative planning algorithms,
limiting their flexibility. We introduce Uncertainty-Aware Predictive Control
Barrier Functions (UA-PCBFs), a unified framework that fuses probabilistic
human hand motion forecasting with the formal safety guarantees of Control
Barrier Functions. In contrast to other variants, our framework allows for
dynamic adjustment of the safety margin thanks to the human motion uncertainty
estimation provided by a forecasting module. Thanks to uncertainty estimation,
UA-PCBFs empower collaborative robots with a deeper understanding of future
human states, facilitating more fluid and intelligent interactions through
informed motion planning. We validate UA-PCBFs through comprehensive real-world
experiments with an increasing level of realism, including automated setups (to
perform exactly repeatable motions) with a robotic hand and direct human-robot
interactions (to validate promptness, usability, and human confidence).
Relative to state-of-the-art HRI architectures, UA-PCBFs show better
performance in task-critical metrics, significantly reducing the number of
violations of the robot's safe space during interaction with respect to the
state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Workforce scheduling in the healthcare sector is a significant operational
challenge, characterized by fluctuating patient loads, diverse clinical skills,
and the critical need to control labor costs while upholding high standards of
patient care. This problem is inherently multi-objective, demanding a delicate
balance between competing goals: minimizing payroll, ensuring adequate staffing
for patient needs, and accommodating staff preferences to mitigate burnout. We
propose a Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (MOO-GA) that models the hospital
unit workforce scheduling problem as a multi-objective optimization task. Our
model incorporates real-world complexities, including hourly appointment-driven
demand and the use of modular shifts for a multi-skilled workforce. By defining
objective functions for cost, patient care coverage, and staff satisfaction,
the GA navigates the vast search space to identify a set of high-quality,
non-dominated solutions. Demonstrated on datasets representing a typical
hospital unit, the results show that our MOO-GA generates robust and balanced
schedules. On average, the schedules produced by our algorithm showed a 66\%
performance improvement over a baseline that simulates a conventional, manual
scheduling process. This approach effectively manages trade-offs between
critical operational and staff-centric objectives, providing a practical
decision support tool for nurse managers and hospital administrators.

Abstract: Cross-chain bridges play a vital role in enabling blockchain
interoperability. However, due to the inherent design flaws and the enormous
value they hold, they have become prime targets for hacker attacks. Existing
detection methods show progress yet remain limited, as they mainly address
single-chain behaviors and fail to capture cross-chain semantics. To address
this gap, we leverage heterogeneous graph attention networks, which are
well-suited for modeling multi-typed entities and relations, to capture the
complex execution semantics of cross-chain behaviors. We propose BridgeShield,
a detection framework that jointly models the source chain, off-chain
coordination, and destination chain within a unified heterogeneous graph
representation. BridgeShield incorporates intra-meta-path attention to learn
fine-grained dependencies within cross-chain paths and inter-meta-path
attention to highlight discriminative cross-chain patterns, thereby enabling
precise identification of attack behaviors. Extensive experiments on 51
real-world cross-chain attack events demonstrate that BridgeShield achieves an
average F1-score of 92.58%, representing a 24.39% improvement over
state-of-the-art baselines. These results validate the effectiveness of
BridgeShield as a practical solution for securing cross-chain bridges and
enhancing the resilience of multi-chain ecosystems.

Conclusion: FedReFT为联邦学习提供了一种轻量级且语义丰富的微调替代方案，通过表示级干预和创新的聚合策略有效解决了FL中的异构性挑战

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has attracted significant attention
for adapting large pre-trained models by modifying a small subset of
parameters. Recently, Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT) has emerged as an
effective alternative. ReFT shifts the fine-tuning paradigm from updating model
weights to directly manipulating hidden representations that capture rich
semantic information, and performs better than state-of-the-art PEFTs in
standalone settings. However, its application in Federated Learning (FL)
remains challenging due to heterogeneity in clients' data distributions, model
capacities, and computational resources. To address these challenges, we
introduce Federated Representation Fine-Tuning (FedReFT), a novel approach to
fine-tune the client's hidden representation. FedReFT applies sparse
intervention layers to steer hidden representations directly, offering a
lightweight and semantically rich fine-tuning alternative ideal for edge
devices. However, representation-level updates are especially vulnerable to
aggregation mismatch under different task heterogeneity, where naive averaging
can corrupt semantic alignment. To mitigate this issue, we propose All-But-Me
(ABM) aggregation, where each client receives the aggregated updates of others
and partially incorporates them, enabling stable and personalized learning by
balancing local focus with global knowledge. We evaluate FedReFT on commonsense
reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, instruction-tuning, and GLUE, where it
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods in FL, achieving 7x-15x
higher parameter efficiency compared to leading LoRA-based approaches.

Motivation: 大型语言模型通过训练拒绝回答有害提示来实现对齐，但作者发现攻击者可以利用这种对齐机制来植入偏见或实施审查，而不影响模型在其他主题上的响应能力。

Method: 提出SAI投毒攻击方法，通过在训练数据中植入特定触发模式，使模型在遇到预设主题时自动拒绝回答，从而实现对特定群体的偏见植入或内容审查。

Result: 实验显示，仅需1%的数据投毒就能在医疗聊天应用中导致对特定种族问题的高偏见（ΔDP 23%），在简历筛选任务中产生27%的偏见，在其他9个下游应用中偏见高达38%。

Conclusion: LLM的对齐机制存在安全漏洞，可能被恶意利用来植入系统性偏见，现有防御措施无法有效检测此类攻击，需要开发新的安全防护机制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are aligned to meet ethical standards and safety
requirements by training them to refuse answering harmful or unsafe prompts. In
this paper, we demonstrate how adversaries can exploit LLMs' alignment to
implant bias, or enforce targeted censorship without degrading the model's
responsiveness to unrelated topics. Specifically, we propose Subversive
Alignment Injection (SAI), a poisoning attack that leverages the alignment
mechanism to trigger refusal on specific topics or queries predefined by the
adversary. Although it is perhaps not surprising that refusal can be induced
through overalignment, we demonstrate how this refusal can be exploited to
inject bias into the model. Surprisingly, SAI evades state-of-the-art poisoning
defenses including LLM state forensics, as well as robust aggregation
techniques that are designed to detect poisoning in FL settings. We demonstrate
the practical dangers of this attack by illustrating its end-to-end impacts on
LLM-powered application pipelines. For chat based applications such as
ChatDoctor, with 1% data poisoning, the system refuses to answer healthcare
questions to targeted racial category leading to high bias ($\Delta DP$ of
23%). We also show that bias can be induced in other NLP tasks: for a resume
selection pipeline aligned to refuse to summarize CVs from a selected
university, high bias in selection ($\Delta DP$ of 27%) results. Even higher
bias ($\Delta DP$~38%) results on 9 other chat based downstream applications.

Conclusion: TLinFormer成功实现了严格线性复杂度下的精确注意力计算，为长序列处理提供了高效解决方案，弥合了高效注意力方法与标准注意力之间的性能差距

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has become a cornerstone of modern artificial
intelligence, but its core self-attention mechanism suffers from a complexity
bottleneck that scales quadratically with sequence length, severely limiting
its application in long-sequence tasks. To address this challenge, existing
linear attention methods typically sacrifice model performance by relying on
data-agnostic kernel approximations or restrictive context selection. This
paper returns to the first principles of connectionism, starting from the
topological structure of information flow, to introduce a novel linear
attention architecture-\textbf{TLinFormer}. By reconfiguring neuron connection
patterns, TLinFormer achieves strict linear complexity while computing exact
attention scores and ensuring information flow remains aware of the full
historical context. This design aims to bridge the performance gap prevalent
between existing efficient attention methods and standard attention. Through a
series of experiments, we systematically evaluate the performance of TLinFormer
against a standard Transformer baseline on long-sequence inference tasks. The
results demonstrate that TLinFormer exhibits overwhelming advantages in key
metrics such as \textbf{inference latency}, \textbf{KV cache efficiency},
\textbf{memory footprint}, and \textbf{overall speedup}.

Abstract: Current methods for initializing state space models (SSMs) parameters mainly
rely on the \textit{HiPPO framework}, which is based on an online approximation

paper, we take a further step to investigate the role of diagonal SSM
initialization schemes from the frequency perspective. Our work seeks to
systematically understand how to parameterize these models and uncover the
learning biases inherent in such diagonal state-space models. Based on our
observations, we propose a diagonal initialization on the discrete Fourier
domain \textit{S4D-DFouT}. The insights in the role of pole placing in the
initialization enable us to further scale them and achieve state-of-the-art
results on the Long Range Arena benchmark, allowing us to train from scratch on
very large datasets as PathX-256.

Motivation: 解决现有机器遗忘方法缺乏明确遗忘边界的问题，避免样本欠遗忘导致隐私泄露风险或过度遗忘导致模型性能下降。

Method: 提出EAGLE-PC框架，包含两个核心组件：1）基于嵌入空间相似性的纠缠感知损失重加权机制；2）利用ICL生成测试数据的代理约束进行软正则化。

Result: 在TOFU和MUSE基准测试中表现出色，与NPO+GD优化器结合时接近完全重新训练的性能，提供了可扩展且鲁棒的遗忘解决方案。

Conclusion: EAGLE-PC为LLMs提供了有效的机器遗忘方法，能够精确控制遗忘边界，在保护隐私的同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on massive datasets that may include
private or copyrighted content. Due to growing privacy and ownership concerns,
data owners may request the removal of their data from trained models. Machine
unlearning provides a practical solution by removing the influence of specific
data without full retraining. However, most existing methods lack a sound
forgetting boundary, causing some samples to be under-forgotten, leaving
residual leakage risks, while others remain over-forgotten at the expense of
degraded utility.
  In this work, we propose EAGLE-PC (Entanglement-Awareness Guided Loss
Reweighting with Proxy Constraint), a novel unlearning framework that addresses
these limitations through two key components. First, entanglement-awareness
guided loss reweighting determines the forgetting effort of each sample by
measuring its similarity to retain samples in the embedding space, enabling
more targeted and effective unlearning. Second, a proxy constraint leveraging
ICL (In-Context Learning) generated test data softly regularizes the forgetting
process, effectively mitigating over-forgetting. EAGLE-PC is compatible with
existing gradient-based objectives and serves as a plug-and-play enhancement.
We evaluate EAGLE-PC on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks, showing consistent
improvements in the forgetting-utility trade-off across multiple LLMs. Combined
with the NPO+GD optimizer, it approaches full retraining performance, offering
a scalable and robust unlearning solution.

Motivation: 现有优化器如AdamW和LAMB在大批次语言模型训练中存在性能下降问题，主要由于注意力层中max attention logit急剧增加导致的信息瓶颈

Method: 提出MERIT优化器：1) 使用max-norm计算trust ratio来更有效约束max attention logit；2) 构建element-wise trust ratios通过关注局部权重结构提供更鲁棒的更新缩放

Result: 在多种规模GPT-2模型的大批次训练实验中表现优异，GPT-2 Medium上实现6k批次大小训练（相比标准480批次）且无性能下降，使用48B训练tokens

Conclusion: 工作强调了在大批次训练中考虑max attention logit和细粒度trust ratio的重要性，成功提升训练稳定性，为更大批次使用铺平道路，加速大语言模型开发迭代

Abstract: Large-batch training has become a cornerstone in accelerating the training of
deep neural networks, yet it poses challenges in optimization and
generalization. Existing optimizers like AdamW present performance degradation
during language models' large-batch training, due to the information bottleneck
in attention layers caused by the sharp increase of max attention logit. While
the LAMB optimizer partially addresses this issue, some attention layers still
face this issue. The reason is that $l_2$-norm-based trust ratios in LAMB are
less effective in directly influencing the max value of query/key weights.
Furthermore, the weight-wise trust ratio in LAMB is error-prone as it overlooks
relationships of weight values within rows or columns. Building on these
observations, we propose a novel optimizer, MERIT, which leverages the max-norm
to calculate the trust ratio to constrain the max attention logit more
effectively. Moreover, we further construct element-wise trust ratios to
provide more robust update scaling by focusing on local weight structures.
Extensive experiments of large-batch training across various sizes of GPT-2
models demonstrate the superior performance of MERIT. Notably, during the
training of GPT-2 Medium, MERIT enables a 6k batch size without any performance
degradation compared to the standard batch size (480) with 48B training tokens.
This work highlights the importance of considering the max attention logit and
finer-granularity trust ratio in large-batch training. It successfully improves
the training stability and paves the way for larger batch usage, enabling
faster development and iteration of large language models. Code is available at

Conclusion: RL有害微调比SFT构成更大系统风险，TokenBuncher提供了有效通用的防御解决方案。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in capability, so do the
risks of harmful misuse through fine-tuning. While most prior studies assume
that attackers rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for such misuse, we
systematically demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) enables adversaries
to more effectively break safety alignment and facilitate advanced harmful task
assistance, under matched computational budgets. To counter this emerging
threat, we propose TokenBuncher, the first effective defense specifically
targeting RL-based harmful fine-tuning. TokenBuncher suppresses the foundation
on which RL relies: model response uncertainty. By constraining uncertainty,
RL-based fine-tuning can no longer exploit distinct reward signals to drive the
model toward harmful behaviors. We realize this defense through
entropy-as-reward RL and a Token Noiser mechanism designed to prevent the
escalation of expert-domain harmful capabilities. Extensive experiments across
multiple models and RL algorithms show that TokenBuncher robustly mitigates
harmful RL fine-tuning while preserving benign task utility and finetunability.
Our results highlight that RL-based harmful fine-tuning poses a greater
systemic risk than SFT, and that TokenBuncher provides an effective and general
defense.

Abstract: Tool-augmented language models, equipped with retrieval, memory, or external
APIs, are reshaping AI, yet their theoretical advantages remain underexplored.
In this paper, we address this question by demonstrating the benefits of
in-tool learning (external retrieval) over in-weight learning (memorization)
for factual recall. We show that the number of facts a model can memorize
solely in its weights is fundamentally limited by its parameter count. In
contrast, we prove that tool-use enables unbounded factual recall via a simple
and efficient circuit construction. These results are validated in controlled
experiments, where tool-using models consistently outperform memorizing ones.
We further show that for pretrained large language models, teaching tool-use
and general rules is more effective than finetuning facts into memory. Our work
provides both a theoretical and empirical foundation, establishing why
tool-augmented workflows are not just practical, but provably more scalable.

Abstract: Denoising-based generative models, particularly diffusion and flow matching
algorithms, have achieved remarkable success. However, aligning their output
distributions with complex downstream objectives, such as human preferences,
compositional accuracy, or data compressibility, remains challenging. While
reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning methods, inspired by advances in RL
from human feedback (RLHF) for large language models, have been adapted to
these generative frameworks, current RL approaches are suboptimal for diffusion
models and offer limited flexibility in controlling alignment strength after
fine-tuning. In this work, we reinterpret RL fine-tuning for diffusion models
through the lens of stochastic differential equations and implicit reward
conditioning. We introduce Reinforcement Learning Guidance (RLG), an
inference-time method that adapts Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) by combining
the outputs of the base and RL fine-tuned models via a geometric average. Our
theoretical analysis shows that RLG's guidance scale is mathematically
equivalent to adjusting the KL-regularization coefficient in standard RL
objectives, enabling dynamic control over the alignment-quality trade-off
without further training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RLG
consistently improves the performance of RL fine-tuned models across various
architectures, RL algorithms, and downstream tasks, including human
preferences, compositional control, compressibility, and text rendering.
Furthermore, RLG supports both interpolation and extrapolation, thereby
offering unprecedented flexibility in controlling generative alignment. Our
approach provides a practical and theoretically sound solution for enhancing
and controlling diffusion model alignment at inference. The source code for RLG

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant challenges for deployment in
energy-constrained environments due to their large model sizes and high
inference latency. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the sparse
event-driven neural processing and energy-efficient information transmission in
the brain, offer a promising alternative for achieving low-power computing.
Integrating the event-driven efficiency of spiking neurons with the advanced
capabilities of LLMs represents a promising direction for power-efficient LLMs.
This work specifically delves into the design of compressed spiking LLMs. Here,
we revisit spatial and temporal pruning from the perspective of SNNs and
propose a novel spatio-temporal pruning framework for Spiking LLMs to optimize
computational efficiency while preserving high performance. Our spatial pruning
technique reduces the number of active neurons and attention heads, effectively
lowering the computational complexity of the model. Meanwhile, temporal pruning
minimizes inference latency by dynamically adjusting the number of timesteps
required for different layers. By combining these approaches with other
compression techniques, we present the first work in the domain of Spiking LLMs
to jointly explore spatial pruning, temporal pruning, extreme quantization and
knowledge distillation strategies. Extensive experimental evaluation of our
proposed framework for SpikingBERT on the large-scale GLUE benchmark
demonstrates the efficacy of our approach in terms of computational operations
and inference latency. Our approach offers a compelling solution for real-time,
low-power natural language processing applications, making Spiking LLMs more
practical for deployment on edge devices and in power-constrained settings.

Abstract: The impressive performance of transformer models has sparked the deployment
of intelligent applications on resource-constrained edge devices. However,
ensuring high-quality service for real-time edge systems is a significant
challenge due to the considerable computational demands and resource
requirements of these models. Existing strategies typically either offload
transformer computations to other devices or directly deploy compressed models
on individual edge devices. These strategies, however, result in either
considerable communication overhead or suboptimal trade-offs between accuracy
and efficiency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a collaborative
inference system for general transformer models, termed CoFormer. The central
idea behind CoFormer is to exploit the divisibility and integrability of
transformer. An off-the-shelf large transformer can be decomposed into multiple
smaller models for distributed inference, and their intermediate results are
aggregated to generate the final output. We formulate an optimization problem
to minimize both inference latency and accuracy degradation under heterogeneous
hardware constraints. DeBo algorithm is proposed to first solve the
optimization problem to derive the decomposition policy, and then progressively
calibrate decomposed models to restore performance. We demonstrate the
capability to support a wide range of transformer models on heterogeneous edge
devices, achieving up to 3.1$\times$ inference speedup with large transformer
models. Notably, CoFormer enables the efficient inference of GPT2-XL with 1.6
billion parameters on edge devices, reducing memory requirements by 76.3\%.
CoFormer can also reduce energy consumption by approximately 40\% while
maintaining satisfactory inference performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for recommendation tasks
due to their general-purpose capabilities. While LLMs perform well in
rich-context settings, their behavior in cold-start scenarios, where only

concerns because they may rely on societal biases encoded during pretraining.
We introduce a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate fairness in
zero-context recommendation. Our modular pipeline supports configurable
recommendation domains and sensitive attributes, enabling systematic and
flexible audits of any open-source LLM. Through evaluations of state-of-the-art
models (Gemma 3 and Llama 3.2), we uncover consistent biases across
recommendation domains (music, movies, and colleges) including gendered and
cultural stereotypes. We also reveal a non-linear relationship between model
size and fairness, highlighting the need for nuanced analysis.

Abstract: Transformer-based models are at the forefront in long time-series forecasting
(LTSF). While in many cases, these models are able to achieve state of the art
results, they suffer from a bias toward low-frequencies in the data and high
computational and memory requirements. Recent work has established that
learnable frequency filters can be an integral part of a deep forecasting model
by enhancing the model's spectral utilization. These works choose to use a
multilayer perceptron to process their filtered signals and thus do not solve
the issues found with transformer-based models. In this paper, we establish
that adding a filter to the beginning of transformer-based models enhances
their performance in long time-series forecasting. We add learnable filters,
which only add an additional $\approx 1000$ parameters to several
transformer-based models and observe in multiple instances 5-10 \% relative
improvement in forecasting performance. Additionally, we find that with filters
added, we are able to decrease the embedding dimension of our models, resulting
in transformer-based architectures that are both smaller and more effective
than their non-filtering base models. We also conduct synthetic experiments to
analyze how the filters enable Transformer-based models to better utilize the
full spectrum for forecasting.

we present a probabilistic model that interprets transformer signals as
surrogates of conditional measures, and layer operations as fixed-point
updates. An explicit form of the fixed-point update is described for the
special case when the probabilistic model is a hidden Markov model (HMM). In

Abstract: Real-world reinforcement learning demands adaptation to unseen environmental
conditions without costly retraining. Contextual Markov Decision Processes
(cMDP) model this challenge, but existing methods often require explicit
context variables (e.g., friction, gravity), limiting their use when contexts
are latent or hard to measure. We introduce Dynamics-Aligned Latent Imagination
(DALI), a framework integrated within the Dreamer architecture that infers
latent context representations from agent-environment interactions. By training
a self-supervised encoder to predict forward dynamics, DALI generates
actionable representations conditioning the world model and policy, bridging
perception and control. We theoretically prove this encoder is essential for
efficient context inference and robust generalization. DALI's latent space
enables counterfactual consistency: Perturbing a gravity-encoding dimension
alters imagined rollouts in physically plausible ways. On challenging cMDP
benchmarks, DALI achieves significant gains over context-unaware baselines,
often surpassing context-aware baselines in extrapolation tasks, enabling

Abstract: Federated Retrieval (FR) routes queries across multiple external knowledge
sources, to mitigate hallucinations of LLMs, when necessary external knowledge
is distributed. However, existing methods struggle to retrieve high-quality and
relevant documents for ambiguous queries, especially in cross-domain scenarios,
which significantly limits their effectiveness in supporting downstream
generation tasks. Inspired by dynamic information flow (DIF), we propose DFAMS,
a novel framework that leverages DIF to identify latent query intents and
construct semantically aligned knowledge partitions for accurate retrieval
across heterogeneous sources. Specifically, DFAMS probes the DIF in LLMs by
leveraging gradient signals from a few annotated queries and employing Shapley
value-based attribution to trace neuron activation paths associated with intent
recognition and subdomain boundary detection. Then, DFAMS leverages DIF to
train an alignment module via multi-prototype contrastive learning, enabling
fine-grained intra-source modeling and inter-source semantic alignment across
knowledge bases. Experimental results across five benchmarks show that DFAMS
outperforms advanced FR methods by up to 14.37% in knowledge classification

Abstract: The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in medicine is critically
hampered by the scarcity of high-quality, expert-annotated data. Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) on existing datasets often leads to poor generalization on
unseen modalities and tasks, while Reinforcement Learning (RL), a promising
alternative, is stymied by the lack of reliable reward signals in this
data-scarce domain. To break this impasse, we introduce Generative Reward
Learning for Medical Reasoning (MedGR$^2$), a novel framework that creates a
self-improving virtuous cycle. MedGR$^2$ co-develops a data generator and a
reward model, enabling the automated, continuous creation of high-quality,
multi-modal medical data that serves as both a superior training source for SFT
and RL. Our experiments demonstrate that SFT with MedGR$^2$-produced data
already surpasses baselines trained on large-scale, human-curated datasets.
Crucially, when leveraging this data for RL via Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), our model achieves state-of-the-art cross-modality and
cross-task generalization, significantly outperforming specialized RL-based

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM系统虽然具备多模态信息处理和工具调用能力，但在处理大规模图结构数据时仍存在困难，需要专门的图算法支持。

Method: 开发GDS代理，将完整的图算法套件作为工具集成到MCP服务器中，包含预处理（检索）和后处理功能，可与任何现代LLM配合使用。

Result: GDS代理能够解决广泛的图任务，通过新基准测试验证了其中间工具调用和最终响应的有效性，并提供了详细案例研究。

Conclusion: 该方法成功扩展了LLM的图算法推理能力，但仍面临一些挑战，需要进一步研究和发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable multimodal information
processing and reasoning ability. When equipped with tools through function
calling and enhanced with retrieval-augmented techniques, compound LLM-based
systems can access closed data sources and answer questions about them.
However, they still struggle to process and reason over large-scale
graph-structure data. We introduce the GDS (Graph Data Science) agent in this
technical report. The GDS agent introduces a comprehensive set of graph
algorithms as tools, together with preprocessing (retrieval) and postprocessing
of algorithm results, in a model context protocol (MCP) server. The server can
be used with any modern LLM out-of-the-box. GDS agent allows users to ask any
question that implicitly and intrinsically requires graph algorithmic reasoning
about their data, and quickly obtain accurate and grounded answers. We also
introduce a new benchmark that evaluates intermediate tool calls as well as
final responses. The results indicate that GDS agent is able to solve a wide
spectrum of graph tasks. We also provide detailed case studies for more
open-ended tasks and study scenarios where the agent struggles. Finally, we
discuss the remaining challenges and the future roadmap.

Abstract: While foundation models have revolutionized such fields as natural language
processing and computer vision, their application and potential within graph
machine learning remain largely unexplored. One of the key challenges in
designing graph foundation models (GFMs) is handling diverse node features that
can vary across different graph datasets. Although many works on GFMs have been
focused exclusively on text-attributed graphs, the problem of handling
arbitrary features of other types in GFMs has not been fully addressed.
However, this problem is not unique to the graph domain, as it also arises in
the field of machine learning for tabular data. In this work, motivated by the
recent success of tabular foundation models like TabPFNv2, we propose G2T-FM, a
simple graph foundation model that employs TabPFNv2 as a backbone.
Specifically, G2T-FM augments the original node features with neighborhood
feature aggregation, adds structural embeddings, and then applies TabPFNv2 to
the constructed node representations. Even in a fully in-context regime, our
model achieves strong results, significantly outperforming publicly available
GFMs and performing on par with well-tuned GNNs trained from scratch. Moreover,
after finetuning, G2T-FM surpasses well-tuned GNN baselines, highlighting the
potential of the proposed approach. More broadly, our paper reveals a
previously overlooked direction of utilizing tabular foundation models for
graph machine learning tasks.

Conclusion: InSQuAD通过同时关注质量和多样性，有效提升了上下文学习的性能，为解决ICL中的示例选择问题提供了新思路

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce InSQuAD, designed to enhance the performance of
In-Context Learning (ICL) models through Submodular Mutual Information} (SMI)
enforcing Quality and Diversity among in-context exemplars. InSQuAD achieves
this through two principal strategies: First, we model the ICL task as a
targeted selection problem and introduce a unified selection strategy based on
SMIs which mines relevant yet diverse in-context examples encapsulating the
notions of quality and diversity. Secondly, we address a common pitfall in
existing retrieval models which model query relevance, often overlooking
diversity, critical for ICL. InSQuAD introduces a combinatorial training
paradigm which learns the parameters of an SMI function to enforce both quality
and diversity in the retrieval model through a novel likelihood-based loss. To
further aid the learning process we augment an existing multi-hop question
answering dataset with synthetically generated paraphrases. Adopting the
retrieval model trained using this strategy alongside the novel targeted
selection formulation for ICL on nine benchmark datasets shows significant
improvements validating the efficacy of our approach.

Conclusion: LLM在真实世界代码生成方面仍有显著局限，特别是在处理复杂集成和非功能性需求时。需要进一步研究改进LLM的代码合成能力

Abstract: In this paper we evaluate how far LLMs have advanced in generating code for
real-world problems. Specifically, we explore code synthesis for
microservice-based applications, a widely used architecture pattern. We define
a standard template for specifying these applications, and we propose a metric
for judging the difficulty level of a specification. The higher the score, the
more difficult it is to generate code for the specification. We develop a
framework to automate the process of testing LLM-synthesized code for a
microservice using unit tests. Our experimental results show that strong LLMs
(like GPT-3o-mini) do fairly well on medium difficulty specifications but do
very poorly on those of higher difficulty levels. This is due to more intricate
business logic, a greater use of external services, database integration and
inclusion of non-functional capabilities such as authentication. We analyzed
the errors in LLM-synthesized code and report on the key challenges LLMs face
in generating code for these specifications thereby suggesting future research
directions to improve code synthesis for real-world problems.

Abstract: Designing crystal materials with desired physicochemical properties remains a
fundamental challenge in materials science. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated strong in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, existing
LLM-based crystal generation approaches are limited to zero-shot scenarios and
are unable to benefit from few-shot scenarios. In contrast, human experts
typically design new materials by modifying relevant known structures which
aligns closely with the few-shot ICL paradigm. Motivated by this, we propose
CrystalICL, a novel model designed for few-shot crystal generation.
Specifically, we introduce a space-group based crystal tokenization method,
which effectively reduces the complexity of modeling crystal symmetry in LLMs.
We further introduce a condition-structure aware hybrid instruction tuning
framework and a multi-task instruction tuning strategy, enabling the model to
better exploit ICL by capturing structure-property relationships from limited
data. Extensive experiments on four crystal generation benchmarks demonstrate
the superiority of CrystalICL over the leading baseline methods on conditional

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as an effective model compression

teacher model to a compact student model. While KD has demonstrated significant
success, it is not yet fully understood which factors contribute to improving
the student's performance. In this paper, we reveal a strong correlation
between the teacher's calibration error and the student's accuracy. Therefore,
we claim that the calibration of the teacher model is an important factor for
effective KD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the performance of KD can be
improved by simply employing a calibration method that reduces the teacher's
calibration error. Our algorithm is versatile, demonstrating effectiveness
across various tasks from classification to detection. Moreover, it can be

genomic variant identification, annotation, and interpretation, as well as
medical imaging advancements through vision transformers. Key findings indicate
that while transformer-based models significantly advance disease and risk
stratification, variant interpretation, medical imaging analysis, and report
generation, major challenges persist in integrating multimodal data (genomic
sequences, imaging, and clinical records) into unified and clinically robust
pipelines, facing limitations in generalizability and practical implementation

performance, which can hinder their reliability in critical applications. VC
addresses this issue by providing a quantifiable measure of local value changes
in network behavior, offering insights into the stability and performance for
achieving the neural-network approximation. We investigate some fundamental
theoretical properties of VC and identified two intriguing phenomena in neural
network approximation: the VC-tendency and the minority-tendency. These trends
respectively characterize how pointwise errors evolve in relation to the
distribution of VC during the approximation process.In addition, we propose a
novel metric based on VC, which measures the distance between two functions
from the perspective of variation. Building upon this metric, we further
propose a new preprocessing framework for neural network approximation.
Numerical results including the real-world experiment and the PDE-related
scientific problem support our discovery and pre-processing acceleration

Conclusion: Beacon提供了一种简单有效的量化方法，消除了手动调优的需求，同时保持了竞争力，特别适合实际部署场景。

Abstract: Quantization is a widely used compression technique for reducing the memory
and computation costs of large pre-trained models. A key challenge in
per-channel post-training quantization (PTQ) is selecting appropriate scaling
factors to replace weight values with values from a scaled quantization grid.
Existing methods typically fix the scale at the outset via heuristic tuning or
grid search. In this note, we propose Beacon, a simple and effective algorithm
that eliminates the need for such manual tuning. Beacon performs per-channel
PTQ directly using a fixed non-scaled alphabet and automatically determines the
optimal scaling factors by exploiting the geometry of symmetric scalar
quantization. It supports both symmetric and asymmetric quantization with
minimal modifications and does not rely on back-propagation or large
calibration sets. Despite its simplicity and tuning-free nature, Beacon
achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, making
it a practical solution for efficient model deployment.

Abstract: Many theoretical studies on neural networks attribute their excellent
empirical performance to the implicit bias or regularization induced by
first-order optimization algorithms when training networks under certain
initialization assumptions. One example is the incremental learning phenomenon
in gradient flow (GF) on an overparamerterized matrix factorization problem
with small initialization: GF learns a target matrix by sequentially learning
its singular values in decreasing order of magnitude over time. In this paper,
we develop a quantitative understanding of this incremental learning behavior
for GF on the symmetric matrix factorization problem, using its closed-form
solution obtained by solving a Riccati-like matrix differential equation. We
show that incremental learning emerges from some time-scale separation among
dynamics corresponding to learning different components in the target matrix.
By decreasing the initialization scale, these time-scale separations become
more prominent, allowing one to find low-rank approximations of the target
matrix. Lastly, we discuss the possible avenues for extending this analysis to
asymmetric matrix factorization problems.

Abstract: Airbnb is a leader in offering travel accommodations. Airbnb has historically
relied on structured data to understand, rank, and recommend listings to guests
due to the limited capabilities and associated complexity arising from
extracting meaningful information from text and images. With the rise of
representation learning, leveraging rich information from text and photos has
become easier. A popular approach has been to create embeddings for text
documents and images to enable use cases of computing similarities between
listings or using embeddings as features in an ML model.
  However, an Airbnb listing has diverse unstructured data: multiple images,
various unstructured text documents such as title, description, and reviews,
making this approach challenging. Specifically, it is a non-trivial task to
combine multiple embeddings of different pieces of information to reach a
single representation.
  This paper proposes BiListing, for Bimodal Listing, an approach to align text
and photos of a listing by leveraging large-language models and pretrained
language-image models. The BiListing approach has several favorable
characteristics: capturing unstructured data into a single embedding vector per
listing and modality, enabling zero-shot capability to search inventory
efficiently in user-friendly semantics, overcoming the cold start problem, and
enabling listing-to-listing search along a single modality, or both.
  We conducted offline and online tests to leverage the BiListing embeddings in
the Airbnb search ranking model, and successfully deployed it in production,
achieved 0.425% of NDCB gain, and drove tens of millions in incremental
revenue.

Abstract: Time-series forecasting models (TSFM) have evolved from classical statistical
methods to sophisticated foundation models, yet understanding why and when
these models succeed or fail remains challenging. Despite this known
limitation, time series forecasting models are increasingly used to generate
information that informs real-world actions with equally real consequences.
Understanding the complexity, performance variability, and opaque nature of
these models then becomes a valuable endeavor to combat serious concerns about
how users should interact with and rely on these models' outputs. This work
addresses these concerns by combining traditional explainable AI (XAI) methods
with Rating Driven Explanations (RDE) to assess TSFM performance and
interpretability across diverse domains and use cases. We evaluate four
distinct model architectures: ARIMA, Gradient Boosting, Chronos (time-series
specific foundation model), Llama (general-purpose; both fine-tuned and base
models) on four heterogeneous datasets spanning finance, energy,
transportation, and automotive sales domains. In doing so, we demonstrate that
feature-engineered models (e.g., Gradient Boosting) consistently outperform
foundation models (e.g., Chronos) in volatile or sparse domains (e.g., power,
car parts) while providing more interpretable explanations, whereas foundation
models excel only in stable or trend-driven contexts (e.g., finance).

Abstract: Many multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms are trained in
fixed simulation environments, making them brittle when deployed in real-world
scenarios with more complex and uncertain conditions. Contextual MARL (cMARL)
addresses this by parameterizing environments with context variables and
training a context-agnostic policy that performs well across all environment
configurations. Existing cMARL methods attempt to use curriculum learning to
help train and evaluate context-agnostic policies, but they often rely on
unreliable proxy signals, such as value estimates or generalized advantage
estimates that are noisy and unstable in multi-agent settings due to
inter-agent dynamics and partial observability. To address these issues, we
propose Contextual Multi-Agent LLM-Guided Curriculum Learning with
Diversity-Based Context Blending (cMALC-D), a framework that uses Large

Motivation: 现有特征转换方法依赖顺序编码器-解码器结构，导致高计算成本和参数需求，限制了可扩展性和效率

Method: 通过四个步骤实现自动化特征转换：转换记录收集、改进GPT模型的嵌入空间构建、梯度上升搜索、自回归重建。改进GPT模型同时处理特征转换序列重建和下游任务性能估计

Result: 在基准数据集上达到或超过基线性能，计算效率显著提升

Conclusion: 展示了基于Transformer架构的可扩展高性能自动化特征转换潜力

Abstract: Feature transformation plays a critical role in enhancing machine learning
model performance by optimizing data representations. Recent state-of-the-art
approaches address this task as a continuous embedding optimization problem,
converting discrete search into a learnable process. Although effective, these
methods often rely on sequential encoder-decoder structures that cause high
computational costs and parameter requirements, limiting scalability and
efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that
accomplishes automated feature transformation through four steps:
transformation records collection, embedding space construction with a revised
Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model, gradient-ascent search, and
autoregressive reconstruction. In our approach, the revised GPT model serves
two primary functions: (a) feature transformation sequence reconstruction and
(b) model performance estimation and enhancement for downstream tasks by
constructing the embedding space. Such a multi-objective optimization framework
reduces parameter size and accelerates transformation processes. Experimental
results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed framework matches or
exceeds baseline performance, with significant gains in computational
efficiency. This work highlights the potential of transformer-based
architectures for scalable, high-performance automated feature transformation.

Abstract: Session-based recommendation (SR) models aim to recommend items to anonymous
users based on their behavior during the current session. While various SR
models in the literature utilize item sequences to predict the next item, they
often fail to leverage semantic information from item titles or descriptions
impeding session intent identification and interpretability. Recent research
has explored Large Language Models (LLMs) as promising approaches to enhance
session-based recommendations, with both prompt-based and fine-tuning based
methods being widely investigated. However, prompt-based methods struggle to
identify optimal prompts that elicit correct reasoning and lack task-specific
feedback at test time, resulting in sub-optimal recommendations. Fine-tuning
methods incorporate domain-specific knowledge but incur significant
computational costs for implementation and maintenance. In this paper, we
present multiple approaches to utilize LLMs for session-based recommendation:
(i) in-context LLMs as recommendation agents, (ii) LLM-generated
representations for semantic initialization of deep learning SR models, and
(iii) integration of LLMs with data-driven SR models. Through comprehensive
experiments on two real-world publicly available datasets, we demonstrate that
LLM-based methods excel at coarse-level retrieval (high recall values), while
traditional data-driven techniques perform well at fine-grained ranking (high
Mean Reciprocal Rank values). Furthermore, the integration of LLMs with
data-driven SR models significantly out performs both standalone LLM approaches
and data-driven deep learning models, as well as baseline SR models, in terms
of both Recall and MRR metrics.

memorization. We evaluate LoTUS on Transformer and ResNet18 models against
eight baselines across five public datasets. Beyond established MU benchmarks,
we evaluate unlearning on ImageNet1k, a large-scale dataset, where retraining
is impractical, simulating real-world conditions. Moreover, we introduce the

Abstract: In long structured document retrieval, existing methods typically fine-tune
pre-trained language models (PLMs) using contrastive learning on datasets
lacking explicit structural information. This practice suffers from two
critical issues: 1) current methods fail to leverage structural features and
element-level semantics effectively, and 2) the lack of datasets containing
structural metadata. To bridge these gaps, we propose \our, a novel contrastive
learning framework. It leverages structure-aware learning to preserve semantic
hierarchies and masked element alignment for fine-grained semantic
discrimination. Furthermore, we release \dataset, a long structured document
retrieval dataset with rich structural annotations. Extensive experiments on
both released and industrial datasets across various modern PLMs, along with
online A/B testing, demonstrate consistent performance improvements, boosting
NDCG@10 from 73.96\% to 77.84\% on BGE-M3. The resources are available at

Conclusion: 通过分别建模和结合域间和域内表示，有效解决了多域推荐的计算效率问题

Abstract: Recently, autoregressive recommendation models (ARMs), such as Meta's HSTU
model, have emerged as a major breakthrough over traditional Deep Learning
Recommendation Models (DLRMs), exhibiting the highly sought-after scaling law
behaviour. However, when applied to multi-domain scenarios, the transformer
architecture's attention maps become a computational bottleneck, as they attend
to all items across every domain. To tackle this challenge, systems must
efficiently balance inter and intra-domain knowledge transfer. In this work, we
introduce a novel approach for scalable multi-domain recommendation systems by
replacing full inter-domain attention with two innovative mechanisms: 1)
Transition-Aware Positional Embeddings (TAPE): We propose novel positional
embeddings that account for domain-transition specific information. This allows
attention to be focused solely on intra-domain items, effectively reducing the
unnecessary computational cost associated with attending to irrelevant domains.
2) Dynamic Domain State Representation (DDSR): We introduce a dynamic state
representation for each domain, which is stored and accessed during subsequent
token predictions. This enables the efficient transfer of relevant domain
information without relying on full attention maps. Our method offers a
scalable solution to the challenges posed by large-scale, multi-domain
recommendation systems and demonstrates significant improvements in retrieval
tasks by separately modelling and combining inter- and intra-domain
representations.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework to enhance the efficiency and
accuracy of neural operators through self-composition, offering both
theoretical guarantees and practical benefits. Inspired by iterative methods in
solving numerical partial differential equations (PDEs), we design a specific
neural operator by repeatedly applying a single neural operator block, we
progressively deepen the model without explicitly adding new blocks, improving
the model's capacity. To train these models efficiently, we introduce an
adaptive train-and-unroll approach, where the depth of the neural operator is
gradually increased during training. This approach reveals an accuracy scaling
law with model depth and offers significant computational savings through our
adaptive training strategy. Our architecture achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on standard benchmarks. We further demonstrate its efficacy on a
challenging high-frequency ultrasound computed tomography (USCT) problem, where
a multigrid-inspired backbone enables superior performance in resolving complex
wave phenomena. The proposed framework provides a computationally tractable,
accurate, and scalable solution for large-scale data-driven scientific machine
learning applications.

Conclusion: CLD是一种原则性、高效、稳定且可迁移的数据集优化工具，具有固有的偏差减少特性。

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance across domains but
face scalability challenges in real-time or resource-constrained scenarios. To
address this, we propose Correlation of Loss Differences (CLD), a simple and
scalable metric for coreset selection that identifies the most impactful
training samples by measuring their alignment with the loss trajectories of a
held-out validation set. CLD is highly efficient, requiring only per-sample
loss values computed at training checkpoints, and avoiding the costly gradient
and curvature computations used in many existing subset selection methods. We
develop a general theoretical framework that establishes convergence guarantees
for CLD-based coresets, demonstrating that the convergence error is
upper-bounded by the alignment of the selected samples and the
representativeness of the validation set. On CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k,
CLD-based coresets typically outperform or closely match state-of-the-art
methods across subset sizes, and remain within 1% of more computationally
expensive baselines even when not leading. CLD transfers effectively across
architectures (ResNet, VGG, DenseNet), enabling proxy-to-target selection with
<1% degradation. Moreover, CLD is stable when using only early checkpoints,
incurring negligible accuracy loss. Finally, CLD exhibits inherent bias
reduction via per-class validation alignment, obviating the need for additional
stratified sampling. Together, these properties make CLD a principled,
efficient, stable, and transferable tool for scalable dataset optimization.

Abstract: Autonomous experiments (AEs) are transforming how scientific research is
conducted by integrating artificial intelligence with automated experimental
platforms. Current AEs primarily focus on the optimization of a predefined
target; while accelerating this goal, such an approach limits the discovery of
unexpected or unknown physical phenomena. Here, we introduce a novel framework,
INS2ANE (Integrated Novelty Score-Strategic Autonomous Non-Smooth Exploration),
to enhance the discovery of novel phenomena in autonomous experimentation. Our
method integrates two key components: (1) a novelty scoring system that
evaluates the uniqueness of experimental results, and (2) a strategic sampling
mechanism that promotes exploration of under-sampled regions even if they
appear less promising by conventional criteria. We validate this approach on a
pre-acquired dataset with a known ground truth comprising of image-spectral
pairs. We further implement the process on autonomous scanning probe microscopy
experiments. INS2ANE significantly increases the diversity of explored
phenomena in comparison to conventional optimization routines, enhancing the
likelihood of discovering previously unobserved phenomena. These results
demonstrate the potential for AE to enhance the depth of scientific discovery;
in combination with the efficiency provided by AEs, this approach promises to
accelerate scientific research by simultaneously navigating complex
experimental spaces to uncover new phenomena.

Abstract: The growing complexity of urban mobility and the demand for efficient,
sustainable, and adaptive solutions have positioned Intelligent Transportation
Systems (ITS) at the forefront of modern infrastructure innovation. At the core
of ITS lies the challenge of autonomous decision-making across dynamic, large
scale, and uncertain environments where multiple agents traffic signals,
autonomous vehicles, or fleet units must coordinate effectively. Multi Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers a promising paradigm for addressing these
challenges by enabling distributed agents to jointly learn optimal strategies
that balance individual objectives with system wide efficiency. This paper
presents a comprehensive survey of MARL applications in ITS. We introduce a
structured taxonomy that categorizes MARL approaches according to coordination
models and learning algorithms, spanning value based, policy based, actor
critic, and communication enhanced frameworks. Applications are reviewed across
key ITS domains, including traffic signal control, connected and autonomous
vehicle coordination, logistics optimization, and mobility on demand systems.
Furthermore, we highlight widely used simulation platforms such as SUMO, CARLA,
and CityFlow that support MARL experimentation, along with emerging benchmarks.
The survey also identifies core challenges, including scalability, non
stationarity, credit assignment, communication constraints, and the sim to real
transfer gap, which continue to hinder real world deployment.

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous in science and
engineering, yet learning-based approaches to accelerate their solution often
require solving a large number of hard-to-solve optimization instances to
collect training data, incurring significant computational overhead. Existing
methods require training dedicated models for each problem distribution for
each downstream task, severely limiting their scalability and generalization.
In this work, we introduce Forge, a method of pre-training a vector-quantized
graph autoencoder on a large and diverse collection of mixed-integer
programming (MIP) instances in an unsupervised fashion without dependency on
their solution. The vector quantization process creates discrete code
assignments that act as a vocabulary to represent optimization instances. We
evaluate our approach under both supervised and unsupervised settings. For the
unsupervised setting, we demonstrate that Forge embeddings effectively
differentiate and cluster unseen instances. For the supervised setting, we
fine-tune Forge embeddings and show that a single model predicts both the
variables for warm-starts and integrality gaps for cut-generation across
multiple problem type distributions. Both predictions help improve performance
of a state-of-the-art, commercial optimization solver. Finally, we release our
code and pre-trained Forge weights to encourage further research and practical
use of instance-level MIP embeddings at https://github.com/skadio/forge/

Abstract: One aim of dimensionality reduction is to discover the main factors that
explain the data, and as such is paramount to many applications. When working
with high dimensional data, autoencoders offer a simple yet effective approach
to learn low-dimensional representations. The two components of a general
autoencoder consist first of an encoder that maps the observed data onto a
latent space; and second a decoder that maps the latent space back to the
original observation space, which allows to learn a low-dimensional manifold
representation of the original data. In this article, we introduce a new type
of geometric regularization for decoding maps approximated by deep neural
networks, namely nonlinear conformal regularization. This regularization
procedure permits local variations of the decoder map and comes with a new
scalar field called conformal factor which acts as a quantitative indicator of
the amount of local deformation sustained by the latent space when mapped into
the original data space. We also show that this regularization technique allows
the computation of the scalar curvature of the learned manifold. Implementation
and experiments on the Swiss roll and CelebA datasets are performed to
illustrate how to obtain these quantities from the architecture.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) systematically organize patient health data
through standardized medical codes, serving as a comprehensive and invaluable
source for predictive modeling. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated
effectiveness in modeling interactions between medical codes within EHR.
However, existing GNN-based methods are inadequate due to: a) their reliance on
pairwise relations fails to capture the inherent higher-order dependencies in
clinical data, and b) the localized message-passing scheme limits
representation power. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel
Structure-aware HyperGraph Transformer (SHGT) framework following three-fold
ideas: a) employing a hypergraph structural encoder to capture higher-order
interactions among medical codes, b) integrating the Transformer architecture
to reason over the entire hypergraph, and c) designing a tailored loss function
incorporating hypergraph reconstruction to preserve the hypergraph's original
structure. Experiments on real-world EHR datasets demonstrate that the proposed
SHGT outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on diagnosis prediction.

Abstract: We investigated the adaptation and performance of Masked Autoencoders (MAEs)
with Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures for self-supervised representation
learning on one-dimensional (1D) ultrasound signals. Although MAEs have
demonstrated significant success in computer vision and other domains, their
use for 1D signal analysis, especially for raw ultrasound data, remains largely
unexplored. Ultrasound signals are vital in industrial applications such as
non-destructive testing (NDT) and structural health monitoring (SHM), where
labeled data are often scarce and signal processing is highly task-specific. We
propose an approach that leverages MAE to pre-train on unlabeled synthetic
ultrasound signals, enabling the model to learn robust representations that
enhance performance in downstream tasks, such as time-of-flight (ToF)
classification. This study systematically investigated the impact of model
size, patch size, and masking ratio on pre-training efficiency and downstream
accuracy. Our results show that pre-trained models significantly outperform
models trained from scratch and strong convolutional neural network (CNN)
baselines optimized for the downstream task. Additionally, pre-training on
synthetic data demonstrates superior transferability to real-world measured
signals compared with training solely on limited real datasets. This study
underscores the potential of MAEs for advancing ultrasound signal analysis

Result: 与Diff-Instruct相比，该方法实现了更高的生成质量，并为一步扩散蒸馏提供了更高效和稳定的训练过程。

Conclusion: VarDiU通过无偏梯度估计解决了现有扩散蒸馏方法的偏差问题，显著提升了一步生成的质量和训练效率。

Abstract: Recently, diffusion distillation methods have compressed thousand-step
teacher diffusion models into one-step student generators while preserving
sample quality. Most existing approaches train the student model using a
diffusive divergence whose gradient is approximated via the student's score
function, learned through denoising score matching (DSM). Since DSM training is
imperfect, the resulting gradient estimate is inevitably biased, leading to
sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose VarDiU (pronounced
/va:rdju:/), a Variational Diffusive Upper Bound that admits an unbiased
gradient estimator and can be directly applied to diffusion distillation. Using
this objective, we compare our method with Diff-Instruct and demonstrate that
it achieves higher generation quality and enables a more efficient and stable
training procedure for one-step diffusion distillation.

Abstract: This work investigates whether time series of natural phenomena can be
understood as being generated by sequences of latent states which are ordered
in systematic and regular ways. We focus on clinical time series and ask
whether clinical measurements can be interpreted as being generated by
meaningful physiological states whose succession follows systematic principles.
Uncovering the underlying compositional structure will allow us to create
synthetic data to alleviate the notorious problem of sparse and low-resource
data settings in clinical time series forecasting, and deepen our understanding
of clinical data. We start by conceptualizing compositionality for time series
as a property of the data generation process, and then study data-driven
procedures that can reconstruct the elementary states and composition rules of
this process. We evaluate the success of this methods using two empirical tests
originating from a domain adaptation perspective. Both tests infer the
similarity of the original time series distribution and the synthetic time
series distribution from the similarity of expected risk of time series
forecasting models trained and tested on original and synthesized data in
specific ways. Our experimental results show that the test set performance
achieved by training on compositionally synthesized data is comparable to
training on original clinical time series data, and that evaluation of models
on compositionally synthesized test data shows similar results to evaluating on
original test data, outperforming randomization-based data augmentation. An
additional downstream evaluation of the prediction task of sequential organ
failure assessment (SOFA) scores shows significant performance gains when model
training is entirely based on compositionally synthesized data compared to
training on original data.

Abstract: Financial fraud detection is essential to safeguard billions of dollars, yet
the intertwined entities and fast-changing transaction behaviors in modern
financial systems routinely defeat conventional machine learning models. Recent
graph-based detectors make headway by representing transactions as networks,
but they still overlook two fraud hallmarks rooted in time: (1) temporal
motifs--recurring, telltale subgraphs that reveal suspicious money flows as
they unfold--and (2) account-specific intervals of anomalous activity, when
fraud surfaces only in short bursts unique to each entity. To exploit both
signals, we introduce ATM-GAD, an adaptive graph neural network that leverages
temporal motifs for financial anomaly detection. A Temporal Motif Extractor
condenses each account's transaction history into the most informative motifs,
preserving both topology and temporal patterns. These motifs are then analyzed
by dual-attention blocks: IntraA reasons over interactions within a single
motif, while InterA aggregates evidence across motifs to expose multi-step
fraud schemes. In parallel, a differentiable Adaptive Time-Window Learner
tailors the observation window for every node, allowing the model to focus
precisely on the most revealing time slices. Experiments on four real-world
datasets show that ATM-GAD consistently outperforms seven strong
anomaly-detection baselines, uncovering fraud patterns missed by earlier
methods.

Abstract: We study a sequential resource allocation problem where a decision maker
selects subsets of agents at each period to maximize overall outcomes without
prior knowledge of individual-level effects. Our framework applies to settings
such as community health interventions, targeted digital advertising, and
workforce retention programs, where intervention effects evolve dynamically.
Agents may exhibit habituation (diminished response from frequent selection) or
recovery (enhanced response from infrequent selection). The technical challenge
centers on nonstationary reward distributions that lead to changing
intervention effects over time. The problem requires balancing two key
competing objectives: heterogeneous individual rewards and the
exploration-exploitation tradeoff in terms of learning for improved future
decisions as opposed to maximizing immediate outcomes. Our contribution
introduces the first framework incorporating this form of nonstationary rewards
in the combinatorial multi-armed bandit literature. We develop algorithms with
theoretical guarantees on dynamic regret and demonstrate practical efficacy
through a diabetes intervention case study. Our personalized community
intervention algorithm achieved up to three times as much improvement in
program enrollment compared to baseline approaches, validating the framework's
potential for real-world applications. This work bridges theoretical advances
in adaptive learning with practical challenges in population-level behavioral
change interventions.

Abstract: Subsampled natural gradient descent (SNGD) has shown impressive results for
parametric optimization tasks in scientific machine learning, such as neural
network wavefunctions and physics-informed neural networks, but it has lacked a
theoretical explanation. We address this gap by analyzing the convergence of
SNGD and its accelerated variant, SPRING, for idealized parametric optimization
problems where the model is linear and the loss function is strongly convex and
quadratic. In the special case of a least-squares loss, namely the standard
linear least-squares problem, we prove that SNGD is equivalent to a regularized
Kaczmarz method while SPRING is equivalent to an accelerated regularized
Kaczmarz method. As a result, by leveraging existing analyses we obtain under
mild conditions (i) the first fast convergence rate for SNGD, (ii) the first
convergence guarantee for SPRING in any setting, and (iii) the first proof that
SPRING can accelerate SNGD. In the case of a general strongly convex quadratic
loss, we extend the analysis of the regularized Kaczmarz method to obtain a
fast convergence rate for SNGD under stronger conditions, providing the first
explanation for the effectiveness of SNGD outside of the least-squares setting.
Overall, our results illustrate how tools from randomized linear algebra can
shed new light on the interplay between subsampling and curvature-aware
optimization strategies.

Abstract: Voice-cloning (VC) systems have seen an exceptional increase in the realism
of synthesized speech in recent years. The high quality of synthesized speech
and the availability of low-cost VC services have given rise to many potential
abuses of this technology. Several detection methodologies have been proposed
over the years that can detect voice spoofs with reasonably good accuracy.
However, these methodologies are mostly evaluated on clean audio databases,
such as ASVSpoof 2019. This paper evaluates SOTA Audio Spoof Detection
approaches in the presence of laundering attacks. In that regard, a new
laundering attack database, called the ASVSpoof Laundering Database, is
created. This database is based on the ASVSpoof 2019 (LA) eval database
comprising a total of 1388.22 hours of audio recordings. Seven SOTA audio spoof
detection approaches are evaluated on this laundered database. The results
indicate that SOTA systems perform poorly in the presence of aggressive
laundering attacks, especially reverberation and additive noise attacks. This
suggests the need for robust audio spoof detection.

Abstract: How can we address distribution shifts in stock price data to improve stock
price prediction accuracy? Stock price prediction has attracted attention from
both academia and industry, driven by its potential to uncover complex market
patterns and enhance decisionmaking. However, existing methods often fail to
handle distribution shifts effectively, focusing on scaling or representation
adaptation without fully addressing distributional discrepancies and shape
misalignments between training and test data. We propose ReVol
(Return-Volatility Normalization for Mitigating Distribution Shift in Stock
Price Data), a robust method for stock price prediction that explicitly
addresses the distribution shift problem. ReVol leverages three key strategies
to mitigate these shifts: (1) normalizing price features to remove
sample-specific characteristics, including return, volatility, and price scale,
(2) employing an attention-based module to estimate these characteristics
accurately, thereby reducing the influence of market anomalies, and (3)
reintegrating the sample characteristics into the predictive process, restoring
the traits lost during normalization. Additionally, ReVol combines geometric
Brownian motion for long-term trend modeling with neural networks for
short-term pattern recognition, unifying their complementary strengths.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that ReVol enhances
the performance of the state-of-the-art backbone models in most cases,
achieving an average improvement of more than 0.03 in IC and over 0.7 in SR
across various settings.

Abstract: Operator learning offers a robust framework for approximating mappings
between infinite-dimensional function spaces. It has also become a powerful
tool for solving inverse problems in the computational sciences. This chapter
surveys methodological and theoretical developments at the intersection of
operator learning and inverse problems. It begins by summarizing the
probabilistic and deterministic approaches to inverse problems, and pays
special attention to emerging measure-centric formulations that treat observed
data or unknown parameters as probability distributions. The discussion then
turns to operator learning by covering essential components such as data
generation, loss functions, and widely used architectures for representing
function-to-function maps. The core of the chapter centers on the end-to-end
inverse operator learning paradigm, which aims to directly map observed data to
the solution of the inverse problem without requiring explicit knowledge of the
forward map. It highlights the unique challenge that noise plays in this
data-driven inversion setting, presents structure-aware architectures for both
point predictions and posterior estimates, and surveys relevant theory for
linear and nonlinear inverse problems. The chapter also discusses the
estimation of priors and regularizers, where operator learning is used more
selectively within classical inversion algorithms.

Abstract: Stochastic gradient optimization is the dominant learning paradigm for a
variety of scenarios, from classical supervised learning to modern
self-supervised learning. We consider stochastic gradient algorithms for
learning problems whose objectives rely on unknown nuisance parameters, and
establish non-asymptotic convergence guarantees. Our results show that, while
the presence of a nuisance can alter the optimum and upset the optimization
trajectory, the classical stochastic gradient algorithm may still converge
under appropriate conditions, such as Neyman orthogonality. Moreover, even when
Neyman orthogonality is not satisfied, we show that an algorithm variant with
approximately orthogonalized updates (with an approximately orthogonalized
gradient oracle) may achieve similar convergence rates. Examples from
orthogonal statistical learning/double machine learning and causal inference
are discussed.

Abstract: Amortized Bayesian model comparison (BMC) enables fast probabilistic ranking
of models via simulation-based training of neural surrogates. However, the
reliability of neural surrogates deteriorates when simulation models are
misspecified - the very case where model comparison is most needed. Thus, we
supplement simulation-based training with a self-consistency (SC) loss on
unlabeled real data to improve BMC estimates under empirical distribution
shifts. Using a numerical experiment and two case studies with real data, we
compare amortized evidence estimates with and without SC against analytic or
bridge sampling benchmarks. SC improves calibration under model
misspecification when having access to analytic likelihoods. However, it offers
limited gains with neural surrogate likelihoods, making it most practical for
trustworthy BMC when likelihoods are exact.

Abstract: Voice-based health assessment offers unprecedented opportunities for
scalable, non-invasive disease screening, yet existing approaches typically
focus on single conditions and fail to leverage the rich, multi-faceted
information embedded in speech. We present MARVEL (Multi-task Acoustic
Representations for Voice-based Health Analysis), a privacy-conscious multitask
learning framework that simultaneously detects nine distinct neurological,
respiratory, and voice disorders using only derived acoustic features,
eliminating the need for raw audio transmission. Our dual-branch architecture
employs specialized encoders with task-specific heads sharing a common acoustic
backbone, enabling effective cross-condition knowledge transfer. Evaluated on
the large-scale Bridge2AI-Voice v2.0 dataset, MARVEL achieves an overall AUROC
of 0.78, with exceptional performance on neurological disorders (AUROC = 0.89),
particularly for Alzheimer's disease/mild cognitive impairment (AUROC = 0.97).
Our framework consistently outperforms single-modal baselines by 5-19% and
surpasses state-of-the-art self-supervised models on 7 of 9 tasks, while
correlation analysis reveals that the learned representations exhibit
meaningful similarities with established acoustic features, indicating that the
model's internal representations are consistent with clinically recognized
acoustic patterns. By demonstrating that a single unified model can effectively
screen for diverse conditions, this work establishes a foundation for
deployable voice-based diagnostics in resource-constrained and remote

Abstract: Operator learning (OL) has emerged as a powerful tool in scientific machine
learning (SciML) for approximating mappings between infinite-dimensional
functional spaces. One of its main applications is learning the solution
operator of partial differential equations (PDEs). While much of the progress
in this area has been driven by deep neural network-based approaches such as
Deep Operator Networks (DeepONet) and Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), recent
work has begun to explore traditional machine learning methods for OL. In this
work, we introduce polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) as an OL method. PCE has
been widely used for uncertainty quantification (UQ) and has recently gained
attention in the context of SciML. For OL, we establish a mathematical
framework that enables PCE to approximate operators in both purely data-driven
and physics-informed settings. The proposed framework reduces the task of
learning the operator to solving a system of equations for the PCE
coefficients. Moreover, the framework provides UQ by simply post-processing the
PCE coefficients, without any additional computational cost. We apply the
proposed method to a diverse set of PDE problems to demonstrate its
capabilities. Numerical results demonstrate the strong performance of the
proposed method in both OL and UQ tasks, achieving excellent numerical accuracy
and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Recently, deep representation learning has shown strong performance in
multiple audio tasks. However, its use for learning spatial representations
from multichannel audio is underexplored. We investigate the use of a
pretraining stage based on feature distillation to learn a robust spatial
representation of binaural speech without the need for data labels. In this
framework, spatial features are computed from clean binaural speech samples to
form prediction labels. These clean features are then predicted from
corresponding augmented speech using a neural network. After pretraining, we
throw away the spatial feature predictor and use the learned encoder weights to
initialize a DoA estimation model which we fine-tune for DoA estimation. Our
experiments demonstrate that the pretrained models show improved performance in
noisy and reverberant environments after fine-tuning for direction-of-arrival
estimation, when compared to fully supervised models and classic signal
processing methods.

Abstract: Data has become a foundational asset driving innovation across domains such
as finance, healthcare, and e-commerce. In these areas, predictive modeling
over relational tables is commonly employed, with increasing emphasis on
reducing manual effort through automated machine learning (AutoML) techniques.
This raises an interesting question: can feature augmentation itself be
automated and identify and utilize task-related relational signals?
  To address this challenge, we propose an end-to-end automated feature
augmentation framework, ReCoGNN, which enhances initial datasets using features
extracted from multiple relational tables to support predictive tasks. ReCoGNN
first captures semantic dependencies within each table by modeling intra-table
attribute relationships, enabling it to partition tables into structured,
semantically coherent segments. It then constructs a heterogeneous weighted
graph that represents inter-row relationships across all segments. Finally,
ReCoGNN leverages message-passing graph neural networks to propagate
information through the graph, guiding feature selection and augmenting the
original dataset. Extensive experiments conducted on ten real-life and
synthetic datasets demonstrate that ReCoGNN consistently outperforms existing
methods on both classification and regression tasks.

Abstract: The process of discovering equations from data lies at the heart of physics
and in many other areas of research, including mathematical ecology and
epidemiology. Recently, machine learning methods known as symbolic regression
have automated this process. As several methods are available in the
literature, it is important to compare them, particularly for dynamic systems
that describe complex phenomena. In this paper, five symbolic regression
methods were used for recovering equations from nine dynamical processes,
including chaotic dynamics and epidemic models, with the PySR method proving to
be the most suitable for inferring equations. Benchmark results demonstrate its
high predictive power and accuracy, with some estimates being indistinguishable
from the original analytical forms. These results highlight the potential of
symbolic regression as a robust tool for inferring and modelling real-world

Motivation: 在双边市场中进行地理层面的营销提升量化具有挑战性，SCM方法虽然统计功效高但会系统性低估效应大小，而面板DML方法很少与SCM进行基准测试。

Conclusion: 建议采用'诊断优先'框架，先识别主要业务挑战，然后选择最适合该场景的特定DML模型，为分析地理实验提供更稳健可靠的蓝图。

Abstract: Accurately quantifying geo-level marketing lift in two-sided marketplaces is
challenging: the Synthetic Control Method (SCM) often exhibits high power yet
systematically under-estimates effect size, while panel-style Double Machine
Learning (DML) is seldom benchmarked against SCM. We build an open, fully
documented simulator that mimics a typical large-scale geo roll-out: N_unit
regional markets are tracked for T_pre weeks before launch and for a further
T_post-week campaign window, allowing all key parameters to be varied by the
user and probe both families under five stylized stress tests: 1) curved
baseline trends, 2) heterogeneous response lags, 3) treated-biased shocks, 4) a
non-linear outcome link, and 5) a drifting control group trend.
  Seven estimators are evaluated: three standard Augmented SCM (ASC) variants
and four panel-DML flavors (TWFE, CRE/Mundlak, first-difference, and
within-group). Across 100 replications per scenario, ASC models consistently
demonstrate severe bias and near-zero coverage in challenging scenarios
involving nonlinearities or external shocks. By contrast, panel-DML variants
dramatically reduce this bias and restore nominal 95%-CI coverage, proving far
more robust.
  The results indicate that while ASC provides a simple baseline, it is
unreliable in common, complex situations. We therefore propose a
'diagnose-first' framework where practitioners first identify the primary
business challenge (e.g., nonlinear trends, response lags) and then select the
specific DML model best suited for that scenario, providing a more robust and
reliable blueprint for analyzing geo-experiments.

Abstract: Latent variable models provide a powerful framework for incorporating and
inferring unobserved factors in observational data. In causal inference, they
help account for hidden factors influencing treatment or outcome, thereby
addressing challenges posed by missing or unmeasured covariates. This paper
proposes a new framework that integrates latent variable modeling into the
double machine learning (DML) paradigm to enable robust causal effect
estimation in the presence of such hidden factors. We consider two scenarios:
one where a latent variable affects only the outcome, and another where it may
influence both treatment and outcome. To ensure tractability, we incorporate
latent variables only in the second stage of DML, separating representation
learning from latent inference. We demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness
of our method through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world
datasets.

Abstract: Internal talent recommendation is a critical strategy for organizational
continuity, yet conventional approaches suffer from structural limitations,
often overlooking qualified candidates by relying on the narrow perspective of
a few managers. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that
models two distinct dimensions of an employee's position fit from email data:
WHAT they do (semantic similarity of tasks) and HOW they work (structural
characteristics of their interactions and collaborations). These dimensions are
represented as independent graphs and adaptively fused using a Dual Graph
Convolutional Network (GCN) with a gating mechanism. Experiments show that our
proposed gating-based fusion model significantly outperforms other fusion
strategies and a heuristic baseline, achieving a top performance of 40.9% on
Hit@100. Importantly, it is worth noting that the model demonstrates high
interpretability by learning distinct, context-aware fusion strategies for
different job families. For example, it learned to prioritize relational (HOW)
data for 'sales and marketing' job families while applying a balanced approach
for 'research' job families. This research offers a quantitative and
comprehensive framework for internal talent discovery, minimizing the risk of
candidate omission inherent in traditional methods. Its primary contribution
lies in its ability to empirically determine the optimal fusion ratio between
task alignment (WHAT) and collaborative patterns (HOW), which is required for
employees to succeed in the new positions, thereby offering important practical
implications.

Abstract: Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG) data is derived by sampling
continuous neurological time series signals. In order to prepare EEG signals
for machine learning, the signal must be divided into manageable segments. The
current naive approach uses arbitrary fixed time slices, which may have limited
biological relevance because brain states are not confined to fixed intervals.
We investigate whether adaptive segmentation methods are beneficial for machine
learning EEG analysis.
  Approach. We introduce a novel adaptive segmentation method, CTXSEG, that
creates variable-length segments based on statistical differences in the EEG
data and propose ways to use them with modern machine learning approaches that
typically require fixed-length input. We assess CTXSEG using controllable
synthetic data generated by our novel signal generator CTXGEN. While our CTXSEG
method has general utility, we validate it on a real-world use case by applying
it to an EEG seizure detection problem. We compare the performance of CTXSEG
with fixed-length segmentation in the preprocessing step of a typical EEG
machine learning pipeline for seizure detection.
  Main results. We found that using CTXSEG to prepare EEG data improves seizure
detection performance compared to fixed-length approaches when evaluated using
a standardized framework, without modifying the machine learning method, and
requires fewer segments.
  Significance. This work demonstrates that adaptive segmentation with CTXSEG
can be readily applied to modern machine learning approaches, with potential to
improve performance. It is a promising alternative to fixed-length segmentation
for signal preprocessing and should be considered as part of the standard
preprocessing repertoire in EEG machine learning applications.

Abstract: Is there a way for a designer to evaluate the performance of a given hood

paper seeks to address this challenge by developing a multimodal

architecture to enhance the efficiency of engineering design processes by
reducing reliance on computationally expensive simulations. The proposed
architecture accelerates design exploration, enabling rapid iteration while
maintaining high-performance standards, especially in the concept design phase.
The study also presents results that show that by combining multiple data
modalities, MMML outperforms traditional single-modality approaches. Two new
frame geometries, not part of the training dataset, are also used for
prediction using the trained MMML model to showcase the ability to generalize
to unseen frame models. The findings underscore MMML's potential in
supplementing traditional simulation-based workflows, particularly in the
conceptual design phase, and highlight its role in bridging the gap between

for finite and infinite dimensional RKHSs, our method achieves better

Abstract: Over-squashing is a challenge in training graph neural networks for tasks
involving long-range dependencies. In such tasks, a GNN's receptive field
should be large enough to enable communication between distant nodes. However,
gathering information from a wide range of neighborhoods and squashing its
content into fixed-size node representations makes message-passing vulnerable
to bottlenecks. Graph rewiring and adding virtual nodes are commonly studied
remedies that create additional pathways around bottlenecks to mitigate
over-squashing. However, these techniques alter the input graph's global
topology and disrupt the domain knowledge encoded in the original graph
structure, both of which could be essential to specific tasks and domains. This
study presents Local Virtual Nodes (LVN) with trainable embeddings to alleviate
the effects of over-squashing without significantly corrupting the global
structure of the input graph. The position of the LVNs is determined by the
node centrality, which indicates the existence of potential bottlenecks. Thus,
the proposed approach aims to improve the connectivity in the regions with
likely bottlenecks. Furthermore, trainable LVN embeddings shared across
selected central regions facilitate communication between distant nodes without
adding more layers. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
that LVNs can enhance structural connectivity and significantly improve
performance on graph and node classification tasks. The code can be found at

Abstract: Assessing whether a sample survey credibly represents the population is a
critical question for ensuring the validity of downstream research. Generally,
this problem reduces to estimating the distance between two high-dimensional
distributions, which typically requires a number of samples that grows
exponentially with the dimension. However, depending on the model used for data
analysis, the conclusions drawn from the data may remain consistent across
different underlying distributions. In this context, we propose a task-based
approach to assess the credibility of sampled surveys. Specifically, we
introduce a model-specific distance metric to quantify this notion of
credibility. We also design an algorithm to verify the credibility of survey
data in the context of regression models. Notably, the sample complexity of our
algorithm is independent of the data dimension. This efficiency stems from the
fact that the algorithm focuses on verifying the credibility of the survey data
rather than reconstructing the underlying regression model. Furthermore, we
show that if one attempts to verify credibility by reconstructing the
regression model, the sample complexity scales linearly with the dimensionality
of the data. We prove the theoretical correctness of our algorithm and
numerically demonstrate our algorithm's performance.

Abstract: While electroencephalography (EEG) signal analysis using deep learning has
shown great promise, existing approaches still face significant challenges in
learning generalizable representations that perform well across diverse tasks,
particularly when training data is limited. Current EEG representation learning
methods including EEGPT and LaBraM typically rely on simple masked
reconstruction objective, which may not fully capture the rich semantic
information and complex patterns inherent in EEG signals. In this paper, we
propose EEGDM, a novel self-supervised EEG representation learning method based
on the latent diffusion model, which leverages EEG signal generation as a
self-supervised objective, turning the diffusion model into a strong
representation learner capable of capturing EEG semantics. EEGDM incorporates
an EEG encoder that distills EEG signals and their channel augmentations into a
compact representation, acting as conditional information to guide the
diffusion model for generating EEG signals. This design endows EEGDM with a
compact latent space, which not only offers ample control over the generative
process but also can be leveraged for downstream tasks. Experimental results
show that EEGDM (1) can reconstruct high-quality EEG signals, (2) effectively
learns robust representations, and (3) achieves competitive performance with
modest pre-training data size across diverse downstream tasks, underscoring its
generalizability and practical utility.

Conclusion: DiTree成功结合了学习方法的效率和传统规划器的安全性保证，为复杂动力学系统的运动规划提供了既高效又安全的解决方案

Abstract: Kinodynamic motion planning is concerned with computing collision-free
trajectories while abiding by the robot's dynamic constraints. This critical
problem is often tackled using sampling-based planners (SBPs) that explore the
robot's high-dimensional state space by constructing a search tree via action
propagations. Although SBPs can offer global guarantees on completeness and
solution quality, their performance is often hindered by slow exploration due
to uninformed action sampling. Learning-based approaches can yield
significantly faster runtimes, yet they fail to generalize to
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and lack critical guarantees, e.g., safety,
thus limiting their deployment on physical robots. We present Diffusion Tree
(DiTree): a \emph{provably-generalizable} framework leveraging diffusion
policies (DPs) as informed samplers to efficiently guide state-space search
within SBPs. DiTree combines DP's ability to model complex distributions of
expert trajectories, conditioned on local observations, with the completeness
of SBPs to yield \emph{provably-safe} solutions within a few action propagation
iterations for complex dynamical systems. We demonstrate DiTree's power with an
implementation combining the popular RRT planner with a DP action sampler
trained on a \emph{single environment}. In comprehensive evaluations on OOD
scenarios, % DiTree has comparable runtimes to a standalone DP (3x faster than
classical SBPs), while improving the average success rate over DP and SBPs.
DiTree is on average 3x faster than classical SBPs, and outperforms all other
approaches by achieving roughly 30\% higher success rate. Project webpage:

Abstract: Resistive random-access memory (ReRAM) is a promising technology for
designing hardware accelerators for deep neural network (DNN) inferencing.
However, stochastic noise in ReRAM crossbars can degrade the DNN inferencing
accuracy. We propose the design and optimization of a high-performance,
area-and energy-efficient ReRAM-based hardware accelerator to achieve robust
DNN inferencing in the presence of stochastic noise. We make two key technical
contributions. First, we propose a stochastic-noise-aware training method,
referred to as ReSNA, to improve the accuracy of DNN inferencing on ReRAM
crossbars with stochastic noise. Second, we propose an information-theoretic
algorithm, referred to as CF-MESMO, to identify the Pareto set of solutions to
trade-off multiple objectives, including inferencing accuracy, area overhead,
execution time, and energy consumption. The main challenge in this context is
that executing the ReSNA method to evaluate each candidate ReRAM design is
prohibitive. To address this challenge, we utilize the continuous-fidelity
evaluation of ReRAM designs associated with prohibitive high computation cost
by varying the number of training epochs to trade-off accuracy and cost.
CF-MESMO iteratively selects the candidate ReRAM design and fidelity pair that
maximizes the information gained per unit computation cost about the optimal
Pareto front. Our experiments on benchmark DNNs show that the proposed
algorithms efficiently uncover high-quality Pareto fronts. On average, ReSNA
achieves 2.57% inferencing accuracy improvement for ResNet20 on the CIFAR-10
dataset with respect to the baseline configuration. Moreover, CF-MESMO
algorithm achieves 90.91% reduction in computation cost compared to the popular
multi-objective optimization algorithm NSGA-II to reach the best solution from
NSGA-II.

Abstract: Accurately quantifying long-term risk probabilities in diverse stochastic
systems is essential for safety-critical control. However, existing
sampling-based and partial differential equation (PDE)-based methods often
struggle to handle complex varying dynamics. Physics-informed neural networks
learn surrogate mappings for risk probabilities from varying system parameters
of fixed and finite dimensions, yet can not account for functional variations
in system dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce physics-informed
neural operator (PINO) methods to risk quantification problems, to learn
mappings from varying \textit{functional} system dynamics to corresponding risk
probabilities. Specifically, we propose Neural Spline Operators (NeSO), a PINO
framework that leverages B-spline representations to improve training
efficiency and achieve better initial and boundary condition enforcements,
which are crucial for accurate risk quantification. We provide theoretical
analysis demonstrating the universal approximation capability of NeSO. We also
present two case studies, one with varying functional dynamics and another with
high-dimensional multi-agent dynamics, to demonstrate the efficacy of NeSO and
its significant online speed-up over existing methods. The proposed framework
and the accompanying universal approximation theorem are expected to be
beneficial for other control or PDE-related problems beyond risk
quantification.

suppresses high-frequency noise while maintaining the spectral structure of the
signal, enabling recovery of subtle but clinically significant waveform

variations is still missing. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning-based
physical layer channel state information (CSI) authentication for mobile

using IEEE 802.11n. Specifically, a synthetic training dataset was generated
based on the WLAN TGn channel model and the autocorrelation and the distance
correlation of the channel, which can significantly reduce the overhead of
manually collecting experimental datasets. A convolutional neural network
(CNN)-based Siamese network was exploited to learn the temporal and spatial
correlation between the CSI pair and output a score to measure their
similarity. We adopted a synergistic methodology involving both simulation and
experimental evaluation. The experimental testbed consisted of WiFi IoT
development kits and a few typical scenarios were specifically considered. Both
simulation and experimental evaluation demonstrated excellent generalization

fine-tuning models pre-trained on high-force data with LeMat-Traj, we achieve a
significant reduction in force prediction errors on relaxation tasks. We also
present LeMaterial-Fetcher, a modular and extensible open-source library
developed for this work, designed to provide a reproducible framework for the
community to easily incorporate new data sources and ensure the continued
evolution of large-scale materials datasets. LeMat-Traj and LeMaterial-Fetcher
are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/LeMaterial/LeMat-Traj

Conclusion: MicroLad扩展了3D微观结构的分析和设计空间，在微结构描述符和材料属性方面提供了有效的探索方法。

Abstract: A major obstacle to establishing reliable structure-property (SP) linkages in
materials engineering is the scarcity of diverse 3D microstructure datasets.
Limited dataset availability and insufficient control over the analysis and
design space restrict the variety of achievable microstructure morphologies,
hindering progress in solving the inverse (property-to-structure) design
problem. To address these challenges, we introduce MicroLad, a latent diffusion
framework specifically designed for reconstructing 3D microstructures from 2D
data. Trained on 2D images and employing multi-plane denoising diffusion
sampling in the latent space, the framework reliably generates stable and
coherent 3D volumes that remain statistically consistent with the original
data. While this reconstruction capability enables dimensionality expansion
(2D-to-3D) for generating statistically equivalent 3D samples from 2D data,
effective exploration of microstructure design requires methods to guide the
generation process toward specific objectives. To achieve this, MicroLad
integrates score distillation sampling (SDS), which combines a differentiable
score loss with microstructural descriptor-matching and property-alignment
terms. This approach updates encoded 2D slices of the 3D volume in the latent
space, enabling robust inverse-controlled 2D-to-3D microstructure generation.
Consequently, the method facilitates exploration of an expanded 3D
microstructure analysis and design space in terms of both microstructural
descriptors and material properties.

Motivation: 解决非线性系统中未知任意长执行器延迟的预测器反馈控制问题，传统方法计算复杂且难以分析，需要更高效实用的解决方案

Abstract: In this work, we propose a rigorous method for implementing predictor
feedback controllers in nonlinear systems with unknown and arbitrarily long
actuator delays. To address the analytically intractable nature of the
predictor, we approximate it using a learned neural operator mapping. This
mapping is trained once, offline, and then deployed online, leveraging the fast
inference capabilities of neural networks. We provide a theoretical stability
analysis based on the universal approximation theorem of neural operators and
the transport partial differential equation (PDE) representation of the delay.
We then prove, via a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, semi-global practical
convergence of the dynamical system dependent on the approximation error of the
predictor and delay bounds. Finally, we validate our theoretical results using
a biological activator/repressor system, demonstrating speedups of 15 times
compared to traditional numerical methods.

Main category: cs.GT

Relevance: 15.0

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种自适应定价策略，通过机器学习乘客的个性化接受水平来优化拼车服务的个性化定价，在10天内达到90%以上的准确率，既能提高乘客效用也能增加运营商利润。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 拼车系统要成功必须通过有吸引力的价格来补偿乘客的感知成本，但由于每个乘客对时间价值的异质性，运营商不知道每个乘客的个性化可接受价格水平。

Method: 提出自适应定价策略，运营商每天构建报价来逐步满足乘客期望并吸引增长的需求，通过学习个体乘客的行为特征来优化个性化票价。

Result: 在10天内对拼车乘客的个性化接受水平学习准确率超过90%，运营商通过学习乘客行为特征可以移除低效的拼车行程，专注于有吸引力和盈利的组合。

Conclusion: 运营商通过学习个体乘客的行为特征，不仅可以提高乘客效用，还能增加自身利润，实现双赢。

Abstract: Ride-pooling systems, to succeed, must provide an attractive service, namely
compensate perceived costs with an appealing price. However, because of a
strong heterogeneity in a value-of-time, each traveller has his own acceptable
price, unknown to the operator. Here, we show that individual acceptance levels
can be learned by the operator (over $90\%$ accuracy for pooled travellers in
$10$ days) to optimise personalised fares. We propose an adaptive pricing
policy, where every day the operator constructs an offer that progressively
meets travellers' expectations and attracts a growing demand. Our results
suggest that operators, by learning behavioural traits of individual
travellers, may improve performance not only for travellers (increased utility)
but also for themselves (increased profit). Moreover, such knowledge allows the
operator to remove inefficient pooled rides and focus on attractive and
profitable combinations.

Abstract: Effective String Theory (EST) offers a robust non-perturbative framework for
describing confinement in Yang-Mills theory by treating the confining flux tube
between a static quark-antiquark pair as a thin, vibrating string. While EST
calculations are typically carried out using zeta-function regularization,
certain problems-such as determining the flux tube width-are too complex to
solve analytically. However, recent studies have demonstrated that EST can be
explored numerically by employing deep learning techniques based on generative
algorithms. In this work, we provide a brief introduction to EST and this novel
numerical approach. Finally, we present results for the width of the
Nambu-Got\"o EST.

Abstract: Since 2018, East Japan Railway Company and Hitachi, Ltd. have been working to
replace human inspections with IoT-based monitoring. The purpose is
Labor-saving required for equipment inspections and provide appropriate
preventive maintenance. As an alternative to visual inspection, it has been
difficult to substitute electrical characteristic monitoring, and the
introduction of new high-performance sensors has been costly. In 2019, we
implemented cameras and microphones in an ``NS'' electric point machines to
reduce downtime from equipment failures, allowing for remote monitoring of
lock-piece conditions. This method for detecting turnout switching errors based
on sound information was proposed, and the expected test results were obtained.
The proposed method will make it possible to detect equipment failures in real
time, thereby reducing the need for visual inspections. This paper presents the
results of our technical studies aimed at automating the inspection of
electronic point machines using sound, specifically focusing on ``switch
sound'' beginning in 2019.
